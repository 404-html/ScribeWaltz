<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.920

<v Speaker 1>freak?</v>

32
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess in this world.</v>

33
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking out there about how</v>

34
00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>many people are pilled up and that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>was while we were also talking about</v>

35
00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>people who can't tell the truth that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even more weird.</v>

36
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

37
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about Trans Racial people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>the one folks,</v>

39
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>you know that check for approval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one who thinks he's in and then that</v>

40
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.520
<v Speaker 1>dude who also did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of weird people out there.</v>

41
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

42
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>also Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie lies about being an Indian,</v>

43
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>apparently not alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a lie.</v>

44
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not funny thing you can't,</v>

45
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Indian is actually kind of offensive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people now.</v>

46
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where it was like standard for a long</v>

47
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:38.360
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

48
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ashamed to see you.</v>

49
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>When I first came to America 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

50
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I always cause it was the way we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up to do.</v>

51
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>We refer to native Americans as a Red</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indians.</v>

52
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.050
<v Speaker 1>We time I would see red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian,</v>

53
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 1>everybody in me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my band would be gone.</v>

54
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop that.</v>

55
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

56
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

57
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I was 30 years in or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so used to seeing it.</v>

58
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.730
<v Speaker 1>The hose that a Scotland thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say you this thing you say Red</v>

59
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to see right Indian that has no</v>

60
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>been completely changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But back then 20 odd years ago.</v>

61
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always refer to native Americans as</v>

62
00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Red Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:16.070
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't say read people,</v>

64
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>but you can say white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can definitely say black people,</v>

65
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 1>but you can't say yellow people.</v>

66
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>

67
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two bills are complicated.</v>

68
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:25.810
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

69
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 1>if you did know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be so like if you were just</v>

70
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 1>learning this language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you came from China or something</v>

71
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fees.</v>

72
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:32.140
<v Speaker 1>You'd be baffled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

73
00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spend my life baffled though.</v>

74
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:35.330
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just gone.</v>

75
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I just go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

76
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>it's good for you to be baffled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

77
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.580
<v Speaker 1>That is a good way to approach it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made me happier.</v>

78
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely happy than trying to</v>

79
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>control everything and a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that go down that rabbit hole,</v>

80
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good rabbit hole to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

81
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think controlling things or it's</v>

82
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:52.700
<v Speaker 1>fear driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.581
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:53.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

85
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:54.860
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it.</v>

86
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm too old to be fearful</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

87
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

88
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>but you are like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see there's a certain thing that happens</v>

89
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>to people in show business when they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a certain age,</v>

90
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>either they feel like it's slipping away</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they feel comfortable.</v>

91
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>You seem like a comfortable person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comfortable kind of kind of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable?</v>

93
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm uncomfortable about a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get into it.</v>

94
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By lower your guard,</v>

95
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:31.110
<v Speaker 1>by giving you something really beneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>me first and then slip it in.</v>

96
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

97
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm uncomfortable about a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hear what you're saying and yeah,</v>

98
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I feel like maybe if you feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've failed and then you've stepped</v>

99
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.850
<v Speaker 1>back up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start your,</v>

100
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you either crumble and you can't build</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life back up.</v>

101
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Or you find a place to stand and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>build your career again on your own</v>

102
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>terms and then it is comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>

103
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Like that's where you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

104
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>But you never failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt I did.</v>

105
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>we haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we in the 90s where so much I sort of</v>

107
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.910
<v Speaker 1>pop cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zig aced I guess,</v>

108
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that can't last forever.</v>

109
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>But when it stops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should speak for myself.</v>

110
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>When it stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

111
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>it was desi and from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really know what to do with</v>

112
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really understand my identity,</v>

113
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.550
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know who it was,</v>

114
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>was such a ride because it was such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy ride.</v>

115
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I densified with myself as a successful</v>

116
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>person and my idea of success was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>warped,</v>

117
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your idea of success was commercial</v>

118
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

119
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you take any comfort in the artistic</v>

120
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Speaker 1>success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did eventually,</v>

121
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>but at the time I felt like we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>being creatively adventurous and we were</v>

122
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>getting punished for it and it made me</v>
<v Speaker 1>really angry.</v>

123
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you feel like you're getting the</v>

124
00:04:56.781 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

125
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>was it the publishers though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music publishers that we're</v>

126
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>punishing you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was,</v>

127
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.820
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I took it personally,</v>

128
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 1>it was really much more a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>shift,</v>

129
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.700
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that just,</v>

130
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't received as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>

131
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 1>You are correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

132
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we'd been used to being on top of</v>

133
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 1>the charts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>and then when that stops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you're like,</v>

135
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is everything we're doing?</v>

136
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>All our ideas are rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But deep down,</v>

137
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:23.254
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

138
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>but you're being rejected anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to find a way through</v>

139
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's complicated,</v>

140
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I think was complicated for a simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl like me that,</v>

141
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>well I would imagine anytime you are as</v>
<v Speaker 1>big as garbage was in the nineties I</v>

142
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys weren't gigantic.</v>

143
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hard to go into a clothing store</v>

144
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:42.450
<v Speaker 1>without hearing your music blaring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.720
<v Speaker 1>And just mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mad.</v>

146
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan.</v>

147
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

148
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of weird sitting across</v>

149
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:51.560
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

150
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm enjoying you seem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

151
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine that like as big as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys were the either stay that big</v>

152
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>and then you become a crazy person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably better off like doing what</v>

153
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>you did like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like taking our artistic chances,</v>

154
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>settling in and then doing what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing now.</v>

155
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Being more comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

156
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were lucky we had a manager,</v>

157
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>a very wise manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

158
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Ki Prime management at the time who</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

159
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.610
<v Speaker 2>what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want a long career,</v>

160
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.570
<v Speaker 2>a lower level or do you want a short</v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

161
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.630
<v Speaker 2>a ridiculously high level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were like,</v>

162
00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:37.260
<v Speaker 2>we want the long career and Stina that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what we got in the end.</v>

163
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.590
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this mad blip that happened</v>

164
00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:45.120
<v Speaker 2>for alternative music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I had never gotten really that</v>

165
00:06:45.121 --> 00:06:49.440
<v Speaker 2>much pop cultural success I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>

166
00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:53.760
<v Speaker 2>we'd enjoyed this weird rush of</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative music that for far blip</v>

167
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.100
<v Speaker 2>ruled the charts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you weren't under old bands,</v>

168
00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:57.300
<v Speaker 2>you were nothing bad.</v>

169
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys caught that wave,</v>

170
00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:00.760
<v Speaker 1>that post Novo Nirvana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it was.</v>

172
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

173
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to talk to Chris Cornell</v>

174
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.480
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when Chris Cornell did those</v>

175
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.160
<v Speaker 1>pop music songs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you went from soundgarden dislike</v>

176
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.470
<v Speaker 1>deep crazy dark band too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

177
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:16.810
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like weird poppy music.</v>

178
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Some stuff softer and I'm sure he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to figure out a way to</v>

179
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>survive like we all do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

180
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's complicated for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.250
<v Speaker 2>With a career yourself included.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

182
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:29.950
<v Speaker 2>you have to like adopt and figured out</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

183
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where does stick?</v>

184
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

185
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>To know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

186
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

187
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately what you got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out is what are you like?</v>

188
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

189
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to know what you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

190
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:40.071
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

191
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't like something but</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super successful for you and you</v>

192
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>might keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very confusing.</v>

193
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surely.</v>

194
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Goodness for getting here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.910
<v Speaker 1>We're going to meet my future husband.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife's coming up here soon to keep</v>

196
00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>that on the DL.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure my husband will be listening</v>

197
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 1>and laughing his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

198
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Your husband is named Billy Bush</v>
<v Speaker 1>different Billy Bush not to grab the</v>

199
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 1>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billy Bush.</v>

200
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

201
00:08:05.161 --> 00:08:07.410
<v Speaker 1>he really suffered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

202
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Tell him he got like an hailstorm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse via twitter.</v>

203
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find it funny,</v>

204
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 1>but it was also quite alarming because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>

205
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope somebody isn't common.</v>

206
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Punish you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

207
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy is that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the re the real grab the pussy.</v>

208
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Billy Bush didn't really do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just there.</v>

209
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

210
00:08:24.631 --> 00:08:26.990
<v Speaker 1>he kind of was a scapegoat and then go</v>
<v Speaker 1>from there some,</v>

211
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was just trying to be</v>

212
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>conciliatory as a TV host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

213
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:32.721
<v Speaker 1>And he got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

214
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 1>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost his job.</v>

215
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

216
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was sitting next to this gigantic</v>

217
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 1>tycoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire character,</v>

218
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:43.220
<v Speaker 1>this flamboyant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boisterous,</v>

219
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>sort of a guy who was going on his usual</v>
<v Speaker 1>flamboyant,</v>

220
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:49.430
<v Speaker 1>boisterous tyrese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably felt like it was funny.</v>

221
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to this guy.</v>

222
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Did to be fair,</v>

223
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.610
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

224
00:08:53.611 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 2>did he have to pay the price?</v>

225
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 1>My husband too by default.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny that you know,</v>

226
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 1>your husband would get hate from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the or that that guy would get hate</v>

227
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People seem to be like looking for</v>

228
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 1>people to get mad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what all Matt,</v>

229
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the whole world is currently angry</v>

230
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>and we don't really know why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we get fed a lot of negative</v>

231
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:16.770
<v Speaker 1>information and I don't know if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human brain knows how to cook with it.</v>

232
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's very early on and the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological revolution,</v>

233
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think our brains have quite</v>

234
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 1>caught up with how much bad news we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbing on a daily basis.</v>

235
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:26.971
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

236
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I think people are angry and upset and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what to do with it.</v>

237
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And there are certain figures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>attract that,</v>

238
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of rage or wrath and the</v>

239
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.890
<v Speaker 1>people use these people as hot rods for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the on</v>

240
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 1>chaos in their brains.</v>

241
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I think you just nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's absolutely it.</v>

242
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 1>We've been talking about it a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>lately,</v>

243
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 1>that there's just too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 7 billion people and to get all</v>

244
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 1>the information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the bad information from 7</v>

245
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 1>billion people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on marriage.</v>

246
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 1>It's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:09:57.901 --> 00:09:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

248
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Well said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy.</v>

249
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>You flicked through twitter or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>flicked through instagram or look on</v>

250
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single thing from every corner of</v>

251
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:10.120
<v Speaker 1>the globe is your heating bad news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

252
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.590
<v Speaker 1>you want to hear because like if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

253
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.560
<v Speaker 1>the good news is not news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

254
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody got along great</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

255
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a stories can sell that.</v>

256
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to be really curious as</v>

257
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>to see where the human race schools have</v>
<v Speaker 1>had high,</v>

258
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 1>we do manage with all this information</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause even if you stand up for a cause</v>

259
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

260
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 1>like today I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a post about um,</v>

261
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.110
<v Speaker 1>for Amnesty International who's standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for the Turkish journalists who are,</v>

262
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 1>who are all in prison for just doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>their jobs.</v>

263
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And so you stand up for that cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I feel very strongly in a free</v>

264
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 1>press and you just become inundated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people saying,</v>

265
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:50.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about Venezuela?</v>

266
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And they have their legitimate concerns</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what's going on in their country,</v>

267
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:55.560
<v Speaker 1>right by the women in Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:10:55.561 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 1>and so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Brazil and Mexico and I just</v>

269
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 1>don't know even know what to do with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the information.</v>

270
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a part of the problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people expect you to comment on</v>

271
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:07.920
<v Speaker 1>every single thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you comment on one thing,</v>

272
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 1>especially if you can't run a one funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly thing,</v>

273
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:11.221
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

274
00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:13.950
<v Speaker 1>what about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking about this terrible things</v>

275
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:16.170
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you have a</v>

276
00:11:16.171 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to alert people of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of consciousness that every step</v>

277
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:22.140
<v Speaker 1>of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every second of the day,</v>

278
00:11:22.141 --> 00:11:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could definitely do that.</v>

279
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Not even I could do that just for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emojis.</v>

280
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as emojis.</v>

281
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel like emojis or the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking a lot about this.</v>

282
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:33.210
<v Speaker 1>I think emojis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

283
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it Eddie Brown with compared them to</v>

284
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:37.740
<v Speaker 1>hieroglyphs you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Jamie.</v>

285
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

286
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was saying,</v>

287
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.220
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about it that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are a lot like hieroglyphs.</v>

288
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you send someone,</v>

289
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you one of the reasons why I thought it</v>

290
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 1>was Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Eddie always sends me like a</v>

291
00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:52.050
<v Speaker 1>series of emojis like in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

292
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just being funny.</v>

293
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll send me a clown and a thumbs</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and a black fist.</v>

294
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Oprah Jean and my two favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The obor Jean Jean.</v>

<v Speaker 1>an eggplant.</v>

296
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

297

298
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>I know what you mean now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

299
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it an eggplant at the favorite</v>

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get the race thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

322
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a word that they would always</v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

323
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Miliion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>slang term for a black person and it's</v>

325
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:07.231
<v Speaker 1>derived from the word egg plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a melon Zion,</v>

326
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.283
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

328
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.550

<v Speaker 1>I made it impossible for you to use</v>

329
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:18.230
<v Speaker 1>eggplant now without thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to the lipstick Emoji.</v>

330
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.230
<v Speaker 1>So we've killed Red Indian and we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed eggplant on one podcast.</v>

331
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian was the thing that like you could</v>

332
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:29.770
<v Speaker 1>say all the time when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now if he even accidentally like</v>

333
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 1>slips out of my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you don't say cowboys and Indians</v>

334
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:33.650
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

335
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Say like cowboys and native Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't roll off the tongue as</v>

336
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:41.730
<v Speaker 1>quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can make our habits can cause we</v>

337
00:13:41.731 --> 00:13:43.420
<v Speaker 1>of all we are,</v>

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Something to do with Max and bullocks is</v>
<v Speaker 1>too hard for me to see.</v>

354
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.250
<v Speaker 1>But bollix is like bullshit too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

355
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would use.</v>

356
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:26.890
<v Speaker 1>That's bullocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's also balls,</v>

357
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

358
00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:30.730
<v Speaker 1>But it's used in a slightly different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could balls be bullshit.</v>

359
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm so confused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the confusion,</v>

360
00:14:34.501 --> 00:14:35.830
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going with it.</v>

361
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally going with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm flexible.</v>

362
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I tried to be more flexible as I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>

363
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to remain flexible is really a</v>

364
00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:49.330
<v Speaker 1>challenge and I think that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiates the sheep from the goats.</v>

365
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 1>What's better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sheep or goat?</v>

366
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 3>The goat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The greatest of all time.</v>

367
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I love the gold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I'm partial tear sheet.</v>

368
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.110
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

369
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.460
<v Speaker 3>yesterday about music and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about how people get very rigid</v>

370
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:07.820
<v Speaker 3>in their musical tastes like what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>liked when they were younger.</v>

371
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 3>They get to a certain stage in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>life and then they just lock on and any</v>

372
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:12.860
<v Speaker 3>new music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just sort of reject a logical</v>

373
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:13.700
<v Speaker 3>reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

374
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:14.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

375
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:15.290
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know</v>

376
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.870
<v Speaker 2>it's something to do within the pathways</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your brain?</v>

377
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:20.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you first meet these insane</v>

378
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.020
<v Speaker 2>connections and it's usually during</v>
<v Speaker 2>adolescence apparently.</v>

379
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make these connections with I</v>

380
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:28.090
<v Speaker 2>suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure and you know,</v>

381
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.090
<v Speaker 2>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

382
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:30.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about it,</v>

383
00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 2>but they have done all these studies</v>
<v Speaker 2>during studies on the brain,</v>

384
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 2>on dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've discovered all these incredible</v>

385
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:41.890
<v Speaker 2>neurological pathways that are formed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>music and somebody can't even remember</v>

386
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.290
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

387
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.250
<v Speaker 2>button their shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can sing every single word and</v>

388
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:48.800
<v Speaker 2>every note perfectly to some opera that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

389
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.840
<v Speaker 2>they performed when they were young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

390
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

391
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

392
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:57.780
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely weird pathways that</v>
<v Speaker 3>get established in the brain and they</v>

393
00:15:57.781 --> 00:16:02.100
<v Speaker 3>say that like there's something about</v>
<v Speaker 3>music and especially like musical</v>

394
00:16:02.101 --> 00:16:07.020
<v Speaker 3>pathways that literally invoke these</v>
<v Speaker 3>physiological changes in a person that</v>

395
00:16:07.021 --> 00:16:08.850
<v Speaker 3>are unlike anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it.</v>

396
00:16:08.851 --> 00:16:13.851
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was a kid that rocky I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tiger song would come on and he was</v>

397
00:16:15.511 --> 00:16:17.770
<v Speaker 3>just the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would just want to start running.</v>

398
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.240
<v Speaker 3>You would just want to lift weights or</v>
<v Speaker 3>just run up a hill or something like</v>

399
00:16:21.241 --> 00:16:23.850
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it would make your body change.</v>

400
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.420
<v Speaker 3>It was like if that was a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could take that drug,</v>

401
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.760
<v Speaker 3>if he could sniff it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like and like feel how you felt when</v>

402
00:16:29.761 --> 00:16:30.840
<v Speaker 3>that song came on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And be like,</v>

403
00:16:30.841 --> 00:16:33.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

404
00:16:33.061 --> 00:16:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else does that,</v>

405
00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:35.430
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing else it does.</v>

406
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:36.041
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

407
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:39.610
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing else that does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm currently on this mad obsession with</v>

408
00:16:39.611 --> 00:16:40.910
<v Speaker 2>oliver sacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

409
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.370
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

410
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading his biography right now or</v>
<v Speaker 2>autobiographies dicey and he's talking</v>

411
00:16:47.501 --> 00:16:52.501
<v Speaker 2>about some of his like really sick</v>
<v Speaker 2>patients who have dementia or there's</v>

412
00:16:53.351 --> 00:16:56.920
<v Speaker 2>some other form weird vitus that shuts</v>
<v Speaker 2>them down completely and they can't even</v>

413
00:16:56.921 --> 00:16:59.650
<v Speaker 2>stand really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if they play a certain piece of</v>

414
00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:02.670
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who is essentially an</v>

415
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.800
<v Speaker 2>unconscious being snaps to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stands up and can dance and like recite</v>

416
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.690
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they'd been newt for years.</v>

417
00:17:10.691 --> 00:17:11.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really crazy,</v>

418
00:17:11.861 --> 00:17:12.790
<v Speaker 2>crazy stuff.</v>

419
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about that art form</v>

420
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.290
<v Speaker 3>about your art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Music can heal you.</v>

421
00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Don't put your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel it.</v>

422
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.590
<v Speaker 3>I felt it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt in charge my whole body,</v>

423
00:17:23.591 --> 00:17:25.450
<v Speaker 3>my hair stood up on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What hair I have left.</v>

424
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something to it.</v>

425
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.190
<v Speaker 3>There's something to it that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

426
00:17:30.191 --> 00:17:33.910
<v Speaker 3>and it's also very bizarre because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that people have created,</v>

427
00:17:33.911 --> 00:17:35.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not something that exists in</v>

428
00:17:35.381 --> 00:17:37.150
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes beautiful sounds in nature,</v>

429
00:17:37.151 --> 00:17:40.570
<v Speaker 3>like birds chirping and certain animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>noises and things that are beautiful.</v>

430
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.740
<v Speaker 3>But music is like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

431
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.340
<v Speaker 3>the ability to control notes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

432
00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 3>The ability to a symphony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to structure a song and put</v>

433
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 3>it together with a beautiful voice like</v>
<v Speaker 3>yours.</v>

434
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Like that is something that's entirely</v>
<v Speaker 3>created by a human being.</v>

435
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't exist before.</v>

436
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Human beings existed and it works only</v>
<v Speaker 3>on us.</v>

437
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.550
<v Speaker 3>He ever played music for a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These fucking stare at you.</v>

438
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.850
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dogs have shitty music.</v>

439
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Tastes might talk with response to</v>
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

440
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe your dog does make sense.</v>

441
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose she's trained that way.</v>

442
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most probably.</v>

443
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:21.441
<v Speaker 3>Maybe feels like it's important to you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give me to like a shitty person.</v>

444
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually they have a shitty dog because</v>

445
00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:26.320
<v Speaker 3>the dog is getting much shitting on</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

446
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.180
<v Speaker 3>he's taught them shitty manners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the dog becomes sure.</v>

447
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:32.130
<v Speaker 3>They like if a dog bite your face off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's shitty dog.</v>

448
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:32.993
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>

449
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Although I would argue it's a scared</v>
<v Speaker 3>dog,</v>

450
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 3>but I'll give you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

451
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I or terribly trained dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

452
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:39.953
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a problem.</v>

453
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.910
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

454
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

455
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.130
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

456
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 3>there's something that we've done with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this that I think is really,</v>

457
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it taps into the human reward</v>

458
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 3>system in a way that the human reward</v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

459
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 3>like when people enjoy being around</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain people,</v>

460
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like rewards,</v>

461
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:01.830
<v Speaker 3>just like social rewards.</v>

462
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.900
<v Speaker 3>You get from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like say if we have like a leader.</v>

463
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.561
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

464
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.900
<v Speaker 3>We're having a fun time having a fun</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation and laugh.</v>

465
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.380
<v Speaker 3>But like say if like you were in a tribe</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people and there was this one leader</v>

466
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:11.290
<v Speaker 3>or this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

467
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>warrior that saved you from the Jaguar</v>

468
00:19:13.681 --> 00:19:15.450
<v Speaker 3>and you would look up to that person</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

469
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.600
<v Speaker 3>that's like a hero in a movie right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we tap into these ancient reward</v>

470
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:24.900
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there were ways that human</v>

471
00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 3>beings could learn and ways that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>could share energy with each other that</v>

472
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.700
<v Speaker 3>existed before media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before music,</v>

473
00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:36.960
<v Speaker 3>and before movies and books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what we've done with media,</v>

474
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.990
<v Speaker 3>music and books and movies especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is tap into those human reward system</v>

475
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:47.020
<v Speaker 3>since really crazy that I'm really into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this idea.</v>

476
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 3>There is hope for the human race after</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

477
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely hope were awesome</v>

478
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.230
<v Speaker 3>people that awesome them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

479
00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:55.350
<v Speaker 3>we suck sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a few who suck,</v>

480
00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:00.380
<v Speaker 3>but it's not even 1% is that tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's maybe 1% I think that if</v>

481
00:20:00.631 --> 00:20:03.480
<v Speaker 3>you get 300 million people like we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>in America,</v>

482
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.320
<v Speaker 3>you get about 3 million douche bags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

483
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.960
<v Speaker 3>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have also people that are</v>

484
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 3>the same victims as your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad dog.</v>

485
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.150
<v Speaker 3>Like give people that are born and</v>
<v Speaker 3>raised in horrible environments and</v>

486
00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:22.290
<v Speaker 3>abused when they're young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a giant part of the</v>

487
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:24.300
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a giant part of what we are.</v>

488
00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:25.890
<v Speaker 3>And if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just addressed that.</v>

489
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the main problems that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have with our culture is that we don't</v>

490
00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:35.061
<v Speaker 3>address at really at all the raising of</v>
<v Speaker 3>children and the doing it from the</v>

491
00:20:35.611 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 3>beginning as a culture.</v>

492
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 3>But we don't address betty much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's painful or dark or complicated,</v>

493
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.900
<v Speaker 3>do we?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

494
00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:45.390
<v Speaker 3>We don't talk about death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is a big mistake because</v>

495
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:48.700
<v Speaker 3>then you have your people to not live</v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives fully because they're so</v>

496
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 3>scared of dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They spend their whole lives wedding and</v>

497
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Speaker 3>we'll get you can sick to talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents don't want to talk about it.</v>

498
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.410
<v Speaker 3>I just think that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's as though if you don't talk about</v>

499
00:20:59.411 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to go away somehow.</v>

500
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't want to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about something else.</v>

501
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Let's go get dessert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

502
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 3>People just shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mentioned anything difficult just</v>

503
00:21:10.721 --> 00:21:13.780
<v Speaker 3>shuts down a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that was one of the main problems</v>

504
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:18.490
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of psychologists had with</v>
<v Speaker 3>hiding caskets.</v>

505
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.860
<v Speaker 3>Like when they were bringing people back</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the war,</v>

506
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 3>that they were taking these photographs</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the caskets and they wouldn't let</v>

507
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:25.870
<v Speaker 3>them be released.</v>

508
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Like it was a big thing during the Bush</v>
<v Speaker 3>administration in America and um,</v>

509
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 3>psychologists were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you understand like this is your,</v>

510
00:21:32.321 --> 00:21:37.120
<v Speaker 3>you are programming people to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very specific notion of war then because</v>

511
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:39.460
<v Speaker 3>you're not showing them the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences here.</v>

512
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean in a casket is almost a symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence cause you're only seeing a</v>

513
00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 3>box and you know that a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a child's,</v>

514
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some parents child is in that box.</v>

515
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 3>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not even seeing the body.</v>

516
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.500
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not even saying we should</v>
<v Speaker 3>see the body so people can understand</v>

517
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:55.330
<v Speaker 3>what a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a missile does to a person.</v>

518
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.040
<v Speaker 3>You're saying like the boxes themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>are forbidden to be shown.</v>

519
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.200
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

520
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.990
<v Speaker 3>Well it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

521
00:22:01.991 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 3>It's psychological warfare and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways on the people because it allows</v>

522
00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:08.800
<v Speaker 3>people to accept the consequences in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a weird,</v>

523
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 3>almost abstract way.</v>

524
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.280
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not seeing the consequences.</v>

525
00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:16.360
<v Speaker 3>So sanitizing everything and allowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to grow and expand.</v>

526
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.230
<v Speaker 3>It shrinks our minds in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The less we see,</v>

527
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:22.870
<v Speaker 3>the less we can think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less we're capable of thinking about</v>

528
00:22:22.871 --> 00:22:26.890
<v Speaker 3>it in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it goes back to like the idea of,</v>

529
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.980
<v Speaker 3>of reading children and that goes back</v>
<v Speaker 3>to education as well and that we seem to</v>

530
00:22:32.111 --> 00:22:35.080
<v Speaker 3>have fallen by the wayside there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I think we have,</v>

531
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:38.650
<v Speaker 3>but my feeling that human reward system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was much more uplifting.</v>

532
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Why think it's all connected?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think that what we're doing</v>

533
00:22:41.351 --> 00:22:45.160
<v Speaker 3>with technology in the form of music and</v>
<v Speaker 3>movies and media and all that thing is</v>

534
00:22:45.161 --> 00:22:50.161
<v Speaker 3>just one step in this multifaceted</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that we have integrating</v>

535
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:53.050
<v Speaker 3>technology and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the more,</v>

536
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.720
<v Speaker 3>the more sophisticated this technology</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets,</v>

537
00:22:55.721 --> 00:22:59.050
<v Speaker 3>it seems like the closer it brings</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and ideas.</v>

538
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.840
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I honestly,</v>

539
00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:05.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean people think that it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have too much of a utopian view of it,</v>

540
00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:10.081
<v Speaker 3>but I really feel like that technology</v>
<v Speaker 3>is essentially going to balance it all</v>

541
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like as much as we want to</v>

542
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:17.410
<v Speaker 3>try to hold back information and we try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hold back education or try to program</v>

543
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:19.930
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like technology is ultimately</v>

544
00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:24.931
<v Speaker 3>going to connect people instantaneously</v>
<v Speaker 3>with ideas and that you're not going to</v>

545
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:27.250
<v Speaker 3>be well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

546
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 3>but you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could push it aside.</v>

547
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:30.610
<v Speaker 3>You could shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could walk away.</v>

548
00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.590
<v Speaker 3>If you have discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can leave your phone at home and go</v>

549
00:23:32.591 --> 00:23:35.980
<v Speaker 3>for a walk in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I feel like we're just one or two</v>

550
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:39.670
<v Speaker 3>generations away from being a completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>different thing than we are now.</v>

551
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.610
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that bums me out about</v>
<v Speaker 3>dying.</v>

552
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.230
<v Speaker 3>That's the really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much the only thing is how much</v>

553
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.750
<v Speaker 3>we are going miss</v>

554
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 1>of all the great technological advances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how crazy is it gonna get it's</v>

555
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:52.850
<v Speaker 1>gonna get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know and I'm so sad.</v>

556
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to miss so much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not miss it because you're on</v>

557
00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:59.780
<v Speaker 1>the tip right now of the scientific and</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical advancements that are going to</v>

558
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:02.210
<v Speaker 1>allow people to live to be 300 400 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

559
00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:04.030
<v Speaker 1>To hope not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible.</v>

560
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hope that cause you worry about</v>

561
00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:12.191
<v Speaker 1>overpopulation and and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the calcification of the human mind.</v>

562
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I worry the Donald Trump's going to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a thousand.</v>

563
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all worry a wee bit.</v>

564
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:18.020
<v Speaker 1>It's got a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

565
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:20.210
<v Speaker 1>sure it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty healthy for a fat guy too.</v>

566
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that the other day he</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes out there super active.</v>

567
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Why is he so preoccupied with fast food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really peculiar when you've got all</v>

568
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:32.540
<v Speaker 1>this money and you're stuffing your face</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of the cheapest food you can find</v>

569
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:37.541
<v Speaker 1>doesn't apparently he's got a huge fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>food preoccupation.</v>

570
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a president thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton did too.</v>

571
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 1>There was a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton,</v>

572
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 1>why he was up fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had no,</v>

573
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all cut up with poor bill.</v>

574
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.090
<v Speaker 1>So what time press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't eat fatty foods all time.</v>

575
00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:50.871
<v Speaker 1>We're sloppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

576
00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:55.740
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugary and cheap crap is right.</v>

577
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Every and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every now and again to get one of those</v>

578
00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Wendy's double doubles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those double cheeseburgers.</v>

579
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.770
<v Speaker 1>They used to have the double</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburger in my life ever.</v>

580
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get my,</v>

581
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.680
<v Speaker 1>even I couldn't get my jobs right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really never had a double</v>

582
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:13.320
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a double tees,</v>

583
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:14.450
<v Speaker 1>but how long have you been in America?</v>

<v Speaker 1>No one 22 years.</v>

586
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.361
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:22.760
<v Speaker 1>A good to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a single cheeseburger in and out.</v>

588
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Is that a double?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be</v>

589
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.523
<v Speaker 1>my jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

590
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.860
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've never had a double level.</v>

591
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.120
<v Speaker 1>So what do you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

592
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:30.290
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never ordered it.</v>

593
00:25:30.291 --> 00:25:33.600
<v Speaker 1>My husband's always the one that's sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what I want.</v>

594
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I wish he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he was for like the first,</v>

595
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks that we were together</v>

596
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:46.280
<v Speaker 1>when he's really trying hard to work kit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that has long been left in the dust.</v>

597
00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I can assure you like literally I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to beg,</v>

598
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend of mine before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

599
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:53.870
<v Speaker 1>he's married now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before he was married he had gone</v>

600
00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:56.060
<v Speaker 1>through a series of like really horror</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this relationships.</v>

601
00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 1>And we were sitting around talking once</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were super high and he goes,</v>

602
00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:02.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what I'm going to do is just</v>

603
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>have two weak relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

604
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 1>because two weeks is like the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time you're in love,</v>

605
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.060
<v Speaker 1>you're in love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to spend all the time together,</v>

606
00:26:11.061 --> 00:26:13.370
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes and then somewhere around</v>

607
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:16.210
<v Speaker 1>them they just start expecting things</v>
<v Speaker 1>from you and then they get mad at you.</v>

608
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 1>He's just picking the wrong partners</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>

609
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Clearly cause he's married now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Years I think is like a good honeymoon</v>

610
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:25.520
<v Speaker 1>pdf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two years.</v>

611
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most things can go ogs in two years,</v>

612
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're dating an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never dated an knocked her my life</v>

613
00:26:33.531 --> 00:26:34.910
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>

614
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

615
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Actresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not no dudes,</v>

616
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:45.010
<v Speaker 1>but a girl be say actor like girls want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be called actors now.</v>

617
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Like it's non gender specific these</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

618
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

619
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

620
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally get that I guess.</v>

621
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because actress or Comedienne,</v>

622
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 1>that was a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we like female comics do not like</v>

623
00:26:57.691 --> 00:26:59.170
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't like being called comedian.</v>

624
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you seem like a cheapened down</v>

625
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my funny comedian friends and</v>

626
00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:07.020
<v Speaker 1>happen have vaginas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all comedians.</v>

627
00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

628
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I really do get that out of respect that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing is,</v>

629
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I love the word actress.</v>

630
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Actress is a pretty word word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian sounds like a light version of</v>

631
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedian doesn't have the same kind of</v>

632
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Gravitas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

633
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Low Fat yogurt or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

634
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of it that way.</v>

635
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.940
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the more we get rid of gender</v>

636
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.070
<v Speaker 1>actually the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

637
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.890
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it fun to be a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is fun to be a girl,</v>

638
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's fun to be all genders</v>

639
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:39.000
<v Speaker 1>and because whoever you hire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever you are,</v>

640
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:41.880
<v Speaker 1>but I think when you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

641
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to be called something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like prison.</v>

642
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should be living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisons.</v>

643
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not living in prisons,</v>

644
00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:51.770
<v Speaker 1>but we clearly are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like especially you and I.</v>

645
00:27:51.771 --> 00:27:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Of course you and I are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very different.</v>

646
00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be super confused.</v>

647
00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:57.960
<v Speaker 1>If you're anything like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

648
00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.021
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

649
00:28:02.021 --> 00:28:04.590
<v Speaker 1>but I think you all humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all different,</v>

650
00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:05.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

651
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's crazy that we get put into</v>

652
00:28:07.441 --> 00:28:09.990
<v Speaker 1>these generalized packs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of do.</v>

653
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also just mean there's a</v>

654
00:28:14.281 --> 00:28:17.970
<v Speaker 1>broad spectrum of behavior that is on</v>
<v Speaker 1>one side of the fence or the other side</v>

655
00:28:17.971 --> 00:28:19.350
<v Speaker 1>of the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's male or female,</v>

656
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's definitely a male and female</v>
<v Speaker 1>when in in most people,</v>

657
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and then there's people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

658
00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:30.150
<v Speaker 1>then it gets real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that are born or in some way</v>

659
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.430
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be whatever gender they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

660
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Kinda cool that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be,</v>

661
00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 1>they just aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some people just aren't and some</v>

662
00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:41.340
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's like we were talking</v>

663
00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:44.750
<v Speaker 1>about earlier about that Rachel Dolezal</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to disagree here.</v>

664
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I think.</v>

665
00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we could ever possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

666
00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:52.140
<v Speaker 1>The motivation for every single person</v>
<v Speaker 1>was transgender or trans racial or</v>

667
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:53.460
<v Speaker 1>trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything gender.</v>

668
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.440
<v Speaker 1>There was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you knew yourself,</v>

669
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.890
<v Speaker 1>under no circumstances do you choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>your gender.</v>

670
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:00.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not that powerful.</v>

671
00:29:00.901 --> 00:29:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't think most people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think some people,</v>

672
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that you could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman and decide,</v>

673
00:29:08.491 --> 00:29:10.320
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a fucking man.</v>

674
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

675
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.920
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's well within the realm of</v>

676
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:15.250
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different thing,</v>

677
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:15.781
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

678
00:29:15.781 --> 00:29:18.540
<v Speaker 1>you're right and I'm sure that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances like that,</v>

679
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but of that I think is a different thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely maybe,</v>

680
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.840
<v Speaker 1>but would it be any less legitimate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be any less legitimate if a woman</v>

681
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:31.980
<v Speaker 1>felt compelled just by curiosity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a man versus compelled by her</v>

682
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's identity flirtation as</v>

683
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:40.461
<v Speaker 1>opposed to gender flirtation or gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>chilies or gender manifestation.</v>

684
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm using the wrong words here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people could do whatever the</v>

685
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:50.320
<v Speaker 3>fuck they want to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met that Lizard Dude once in Austin,</v>

686
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:51.730
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that guy is?</v>

687
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:55.270
<v Speaker 3>He's turned himself into a lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's essentially tattooed his entire</v>

688
00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The split his tongue down the middle.</v>

689
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 3>You sat in the front row of my show at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Cap City comedy club and I was like,</v>

690
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need a lot of attention to you</v>

691
00:30:02.481 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 3>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

692
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.280
<v Speaker 3>Sitting right in the fucking front row</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking like a lizard.</v>

693
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Very nice guy though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seemed like a super nice guy.</v>

694
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.930
<v Speaker 3>But he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

695
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that,</v>

696
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 3>that's before he did his whole face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got some amazing,</v>

697
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

698
00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.330
<v Speaker 3>definitely weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about amazing.</v>

699
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:21.520
<v Speaker 3>If that was my kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And come on,</v>

700
00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:23.620
<v Speaker 3>if you saw that in an art gallery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would be like,</v>

701
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:26.350
<v Speaker 3>that is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you and I have a different sense</v>

702
00:30:26.351 --> 00:30:28.240
<v Speaker 3>of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we do.</v>

703
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Well that seems like a guy was drawing</v>
<v Speaker 3>on his face.</v>

704
00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.660
<v Speaker 4>Uh Huh.</v>

705
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.300
<v Speaker 3>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is coming from a guy with drawing</v>

706
00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:36.130
<v Speaker 3>all over his arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty incredible.</v>

707
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who am I to say that it's,</v>

708
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.221
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>

709
00:30:38.221 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 3>that's a cultural thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

710
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Like why is it okay that I have tattoos</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over my arms and I don't think it's</v>

711
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:45.880
<v Speaker 3>right to tattoo your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say that like you should do,</v>

712
00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:47.200
<v Speaker 3>be able to do whatever the fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

713
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he has done,</v>

714
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's a cultural thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

715
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 3>for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was in Japan and they made me,</v>

716
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 3>I was in a gym and they made me go and</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a long sleeve shirt on because you</v>

717
00:30:58.271 --> 00:31:01.510
<v Speaker 3>can't have exposed tattoos like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I guess cause their feelings</v>

718
00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:04.150
<v Speaker 3>towards your arms at the same feelings</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're having towards it.</v>

719
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.830
<v Speaker 3>For one second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Lizard has a little bit,</v>

720
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:09.630
<v Speaker 3>a little bit,</v>

721
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.780

<v Speaker 3>when someone's fucking with you,</v>

729
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:29.760
<v Speaker 3>that's like a negative thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

730
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.360
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

748
00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.110
<v Speaker 2>pretty sort of historical in a funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like we go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>blondie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

751
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Debbie Harry.</v>

752
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know her?</v>

753
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I do know her actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

754
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:29.120
<v Speaker 2>and I love her and she's been somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a mentor to me in a way because she</v>

755
00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:34.090
<v Speaker 2>was managed by a very famous music</v>
<v Speaker 2>manager called Geico first who managed</v>

756
00:32:34.091 --> 00:32:36.450
<v Speaker 2>the ramones and talking heads and body</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>

757
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.140
<v Speaker 2>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the one who basically start</v>

758
00:32:39.141 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 2>plucked me from my band.</v>

759
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.680
<v Speaker 2>He saw him at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought I had potential and he just</v>

760
00:32:42.681 --> 00:32:45.380
<v Speaker 2>let you know I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have potential to be in the</v>

761
00:32:45.381 --> 00:32:48.170
<v Speaker 2>music business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he signed me in the end and blah,</v>

762
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:48.591
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

763
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:49.041
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

764
00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:51.740
<v Speaker 2>And Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he introduced me to Debbie and Debbie</v>

765
00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:55.400
<v Speaker 2>came and saw my band opened for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ramones and the academy in New York</v>

766
00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:59.360
<v Speaker 2>during the new music seminar one year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was shaking like a leaf.</v>

767
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:02.240
<v Speaker 2>I've told this story a million times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of my favorite memories of</v>

768
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:05.420
<v Speaker 2>stepping out on stage on the academy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course ramones fans that were</v>

769
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:06.500
<v Speaker 2>pretty hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

770
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:08.270
<v Speaker 2>they weren't taking fools lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

771
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.310
<v Speaker 2>And you had to prove yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was very,</v>

772
00:33:10.311 --> 00:33:13.670
<v Speaker 2>very nervous and I looked down into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mosh pit and Debbie Harry was there and</v>

773
00:33:13.671 --> 00:33:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will love you forever asking me.</v>

774
00:33:17.571 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I am your slave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are like for someone of that caliber</v>

775
00:33:20.871 --> 00:33:24.110
<v Speaker 2>to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it meant so much to me and as sort of</v>

776
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.600
<v Speaker 2>even in times of when I've doubted</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>

777
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 2>I always think Debbie didn't take me.</v>

778
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

779
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.400
<v Speaker 3>that excites typical night with our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

780
00:33:33.401 --> 00:33:35.200
<v Speaker 3>that's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might tear up tier.</v>

781
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Come on to your butt a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

782
00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.450
<v Speaker 3>get into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

783
00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:44.460
<v Speaker 3>the emotional thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a,</v>

784
00:33:44.781 --> 00:33:47.320
<v Speaker 3>a very unique historical figure in</v>
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

785
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.060
<v Speaker 3>There was no Debbie Harry before Debbie</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harry Caray.</v>

786
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.923
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can look</v>

787
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Debbie Hardy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

788
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.040
<v Speaker 2>There was no lady Gaga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

789
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.670
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did it all really.</v>

790
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.610
<v Speaker 2>She's the archetype I think for a modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop girl.</v>

791
00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.280
<v Speaker 3>And she was very authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was no questioning her</v>

792
00:34:03.281 --> 00:34:06.310
<v Speaker 3>authenticity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she was uniquely eccentric and it</v>

793
00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:07.061
<v Speaker 3>still is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

794
00:34:07.061 --> 00:34:08.140
<v Speaker 3>I'd imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

795
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:13.090
<v Speaker 2>70 and to be still making records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>

796
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.220
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty bad ass.</v>

797
00:34:15.221 --> 00:34:18.760
<v Speaker 2>It's really about us and really</v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiring for other women.</v>

798
00:34:18.761 --> 00:34:20.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we follow in our footsteps,</v>

799
00:34:20.351 --> 00:34:23.560
<v Speaker 2>who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will watch as the first time I can think</v>

800
00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:25.870
<v Speaker 2>of like a woman has had a pop color you</v>
<v Speaker 2>over that long.</v>

801
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't it a new thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you really stop and think</v>

802
00:34:29.861 --> 00:34:32.560
<v Speaker 3>about music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really what we're talking about as</v>

803
00:34:32.561 --> 00:34:36.400
<v Speaker 3>recorded music and recorded music in</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern times has really only been since</v>

804
00:34:36.401 --> 00:34:38.590
<v Speaker 3>the late 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

805
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean when did people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the early 20th century rather,</v>

806
00:34:41.801 --> 00:34:44.020
<v Speaker 3>when did people first start recording</v>
<v Speaker 3>music?</v>

807
00:34:44.021 --> 00:34:47.110
<v Speaker 3>We've gone over this before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started doing it on wax and like</v>

808
00:34:47.111 --> 00:34:50.140
<v Speaker 3>the 17 hundreds is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something along those lines?</v>

809
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:53.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in the early 19 hundreds</v>

810
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.781
<v Speaker 3>what's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out.</v>

811
00:34:54.781 --> 00:34:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if he's going to set us and</v>
<v Speaker 3>add those wax cylinders that they were</v>

812
00:34:57.761 --> 00:35:01.210
<v Speaker 3>recording talking and a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>orchestra stuff on those.</v>

813
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Like right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

814
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.620
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just pull that out of here?</v>

815
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.061
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

816
00:35:04.061 --> 00:35:05.760
<v Speaker 3>we've actually discussed this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

817
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.990
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were just one of your favorite</v>

818
00:35:07.991 --> 00:35:08.480
<v Speaker 3>topics.</v>

819
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.090
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have discussed it like fairly</v>

820
00:35:10.091 --> 00:35:11.650
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within the last year we were talking</v>

821
00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:15.150
<v Speaker 3>about how amazing it is that recording</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like,</v>

822
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:20.160
<v Speaker 3>like Mozart or Beethoven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there was no recording reading work</v>

823
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.720
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would duplicate that written work</v>

824
00:35:22.721 --> 00:35:27.410
<v Speaker 3>and that's how you would get to see the</v>
<v Speaker 3>genius of their ideas here at 1877 oh</v>

825
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:29.170
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

826
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:31.600
<v Speaker 3>That's a practical sign recording.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

827
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.460
<v Speaker 3>But when you compare that to like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>record,</v>

828
00:35:36.461 --> 00:35:38.310
<v Speaker 3>a modern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we call it a record,</v>

829
00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:41.090
<v Speaker 3>but I mean a recording,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a modern recording like blondie,</v>

830
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:45.530
<v Speaker 3>like rapture or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is this,</v>

831
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:51.230
<v Speaker 3>there's never been anything like that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>human history up until the 19th or the</v>

832
00:35:51.271 --> 00:35:53.430
<v Speaker 3>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really didn't exist.</v>

833
00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you think about like pop stars,</v>

834
00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:00.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean at a May or however far can you</v>

835
00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:03.150
<v Speaker 3>can go back to where you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately say someone was a popular</v>

836
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:05.610
<v Speaker 3>music star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is so recent.</v>

837
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 3>It's within a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Elvis,</v>

838
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:09.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the first popular star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

839
00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

840
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.900
<v Speaker 3>That's why I went fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's no,</v>

841
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:13.860
<v Speaker 3>no roadmap.</v>

842
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well none of them had road maps.</v>

843
00:36:15.781 --> 00:36:18.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what we forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about this recently</v>

844
00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:20.670
<v Speaker 2>with a bunch of friends is highly</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished.</v>

845
00:36:20.671 --> 00:36:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Young musicians are right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if they can be 15 years old and you</v>

846
00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 2>can watch them perform and they've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the moves and they can sing</v>

847
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:31.230
<v Speaker 2>perfectly because they've practiced</v>
<v Speaker 2>singing along on youtube too,</v>

848
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>digitally enhanced recordings so they</v>

849
00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:36.150
<v Speaker 2>can do stuff with their voice that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>never could,</v>

850
00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.190
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're learning at an</v>

851
00:36:38.191 --> 00:36:39.820
<v Speaker 2>accelerated rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

852
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:43.390
<v Speaker 2>But they don't understand what it means</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have any kind of motivation or like</v>

853
00:36:43.391 --> 00:36:46.710
<v Speaker 2>have any authentic taste or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really peculiar.</v>

854
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a struggle yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like terminators.</v>

855
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:50.641
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

856
00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're perfect but they don't have any</v>

857
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.880
<v Speaker 2>no inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

858
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:59.340
<v Speaker 2>well I'm sure they do have an inside to</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop to 15 no one.</v>

859
00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:02.180
<v Speaker 2>You can abort that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is like,</v>

860
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:07.910
<v Speaker 2>it's just off the charts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's true.</v>

861
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it is.</v>

862
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:14.940
<v Speaker 2>They can sing along to these mat records</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been old sort of,</v>

863
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>auto,</v>

864
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:18.050
<v Speaker 2>auto autotune this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

865
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.260
<v Speaker 2>the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they can sing it.</v>

866
00:37:19.261 --> 00:37:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

867
00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading about this 24 year old</v>

868
00:37:21.941 --> 00:37:24.340
<v Speaker 3>motivational speaker and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want to go find that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell them to shut the fuck up.</v>

873
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's preposterous.</v>

874
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:40.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like my friend Steve Maxwell says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said you should never listen to</v>

875
00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:43.420
<v Speaker 3>anyone who is under 40 who is a personal</v>
<v Speaker 3>trainer.</v>

876
00:37:43.421 --> 00:37:45.760
<v Speaker 3>He's a personal trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like anyone who is under 40 was a</v>

877
00:37:45.761 --> 00:37:48.130
<v Speaker 3>personal trainer is and what the fuck do</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's a lot to learn.</v>

880
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.160
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot.</v>

881
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.660
<v Speaker 2>There is I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am amazed.</v>

882
00:37:54.661 --> 00:37:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had also state by 30 I mean</v>

883
00:37:57.091 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking I'm so old and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>so wise.</v>

884
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:03.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean I remember thinking that and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit 50 and you're like,</v>

885
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.150
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew nothing.</v>

886
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you probably think that when</v>

887
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:10.320
<v Speaker 2>you're 70 my.claims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the case.</v>

888
00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:12.090
<v Speaker 2>He laughs at me and my dad laughs at me</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

889
00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say something that he thinks it's</v>

890
00:38:15.061 --> 00:38:16.530
<v Speaker 2>absolutely ludicrous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

891
00:38:16.531 --> 00:38:17.570
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just you wait,</v>

892
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Speaker 2>just wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

893
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.040
<v Speaker 2>you'll eat those words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

894
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's a big part of what</v>

895
00:38:22.791 --> 00:38:26.780
<v Speaker 3>you see today in social media with young</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids espousing really preposterous</v>

896
00:38:26.781 --> 00:38:30.560
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like there's so they have so little</v>

897
00:38:30.561 --> 00:38:34.140
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual life experience or them.</v>

898
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel sad</v>

899
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 2>for all these like young hipsters that</v>
<v Speaker 2>get lauded by,</v>

900
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fashion magazines at literally at the</v>

901
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:43.840
<v Speaker 2>age of 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the fetishizing of young</v>

902
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:47.800
<v Speaker 2>people right now really gives me the</v>
<v Speaker 2>creeps and I feel very sad for these</v>

903
00:38:47.801 --> 00:38:50.960
<v Speaker 2>young people who basically get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are like these beautiful butterflies and</v>

904
00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

905
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:55.390
<v Speaker 2>a glass jar gets shoved on top of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they're stuck.</v>

906
00:38:55.391 --> 00:39:00.010
<v Speaker 2>They're being cool and hip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not with no driver,</v>

907
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.440
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no nothing to fight against,</v>

908
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.320
<v Speaker 2>nothing to be dissatisfied with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

909
00:39:05.321 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 2>it's just peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're doing adderall and</v>

910
00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:12.550
<v Speaker 2>having a great old time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm sure.</v>

911
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just because you made a bunch of</v>

912
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:15.550
<v Speaker 2>fucking hit records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

913
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.610
<v Speaker 2>tell me how to live my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in this God damn glass jar.</v>

914
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 2>Never for one moment would ever tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody how to live their life.</v>

915
00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:26.050
<v Speaker 2>What I don't like seeing is people not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being allowed to live their lives.</v>

916
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this kid,</v>

917
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:30.400
<v Speaker 2>somebody sent me this thing on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some kid,</v>

918
00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I forget where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some pop festival,</v>

919
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.000
<v Speaker 2>but he's like 12 years old playing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guitar and he's fucking incredible.</v>

920
00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>

921
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.080
<v Speaker 2>And they were like saying he's the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Hendrix,</v>

922
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:43.480
<v Speaker 2>some little black kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

923
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Like just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just unbelievably talented and I'm just</v>

924
00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:48.251
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He'll be fucking crazy.</v>

926
00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what it feels like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's creepy.</v>

927
00:39:53.621 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 2>It's like so many people send me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

928

929
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:00.690
<v Speaker 2>particularly young women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

930
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:02.200
<v Speaker 2>artists and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

931
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:03.670
<v Speaker 2>would you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

932
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.380
<v Speaker 2>supporting this girl or what do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of this and that [inaudible] life,</v>

933
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think go like living your life.</v>

934
00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Don't let your parents figured out your</v>
<v Speaker 2>career for you,</v>

935
00:40:12.241 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 2>and that's what you're supposed to do.</v>

936
00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.000
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to have your parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>who happens to have an end with a well</v>

937
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:17.950
<v Speaker 2>known singer or producer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

938
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.480
<v Speaker 2>pump pimping you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

939
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.910
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you learn is by actually</v>

940
00:40:21.911 --> 00:40:23.950
<v Speaker 2>doing it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

941
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:28.951
<v Speaker 2>I just feel it's creepy and it feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>pedophilic to me and I don't like it.</v>

942
00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Speaker 2>It definitely can be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you were young,</v>

943
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.360
<v Speaker 2>when did you know that you wanted to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a singer?</v>

944
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I ever knew I wanted to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a singer and wants to be yes,</v>

945
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.740
<v Speaker 2>but fairly recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

946
00:40:41.741 --> 00:40:44.440
<v Speaker 2>literally in the last time I've seen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 10 years,</v>

947
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really good at this actually.</v>

948
00:40:46.931 --> 00:40:50.320
<v Speaker 2>And I enjoy it and I guess this is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do for a living.</v>

949
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.460
<v Speaker 2>This is my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last time,</v>

950
00:40:52.461 --> 00:40:54.910
<v Speaker 2>the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going on with you.</v>

951
00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Like when stupid girl was coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

952
00:40:57.761 --> 00:41:00.220
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I'd stumbled into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>

953
00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:02.020
<v Speaker 2>which I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

954
00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.610
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

955
00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I wanted to be an actress.</v>

956
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.520
<v Speaker 2>And then by total default I was in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>youth theater when I was young and I met</v>

957
00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:13.120
<v Speaker 2>this guy and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

958
00:41:13.121 --> 00:41:16.120
<v Speaker 2>would you come and play keyboards in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>band for a weekend because we've lost</v>

959
00:41:16.121 --> 00:41:18.310
<v Speaker 2>our keyboard player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I joined the band and then I just</v>

960
00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:21.790
<v Speaker 2>ended up being in that band for 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing keyboards and doing backup</v>

961
00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:23.200
<v Speaker 2>vocals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was quite happy.</v>

962
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't harbor any ambition to be a</v>

963
00:41:25.781 --> 00:41:30.781
<v Speaker 2>lead singer at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just 1,000,000,001 things</v>

964
00:41:31.181 --> 00:41:36.181
<v Speaker 2>happened and I ended up being the lead</v>
<v Speaker 2>singer of this betty seen band just so</v>

965
00:41:36.321 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 2>that we could survive cause we'd been</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped by our record label for going to</v>

966
00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:46.151
<v Speaker 2>Berlin and spending all our money on our</v>
<v Speaker 2>record advance on drugs coming back and</v>

967
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:47.330
<v Speaker 2>not have anything to show for it.</v>

968
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:49.460
<v Speaker 2>So the record company dropped us but</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept me.</v>

969
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.400
<v Speaker 2>And so then I pulled the band in as my</v>
<v Speaker 2>band.</v>

970
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 2>So we just sort of shifted all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

971
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By myself as the lead singer by default</v>

972
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.640
<v Speaker 2>and then our videos on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

973
00:42:01.641 --> 00:42:04.190
<v Speaker 2>it was mostly speed and ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speed.</v>

974
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:07.220
<v Speaker 2>How much money you're spending on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

975
00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the northern,</v>

976
00:42:08.721 --> 00:42:12.110
<v Speaker 2>that might money that it was our entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>record events.</v>

977
00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.840
<v Speaker 2>How much was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

978
00:42:14.841 --> 00:42:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I think it was something like a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand pounds.</v>

979
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.610
<v Speaker 2>What does that like $50,000 thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>

980
00:42:20.611 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 2>somewhere on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's double that.</v>

981
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Double the oats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>200,000 a stumble.</v>

982
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it the opposite.</v>

983
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told him no,</v>

984
00:42:28.101 --> 00:42:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't all on speed and it was</v>

985
00:42:30.921 --> 00:42:33.680
<v Speaker 2>all Kahal and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going and drink,</v>

986
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:35.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking and partying and just wasting</v>

987
00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:36.320
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

988
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.050
<v Speaker 2>And you have in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call that going off.</v>

989
00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went off,</v>

990
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:43.290
<v Speaker 2>you guys went off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went totally off too.</v>

991
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:47.180
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason I was one of the sober ones</v>

992
00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:48.200
<v Speaker 2>for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

993
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know I did my share,</v>

994
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:51.800
<v Speaker 2>but by comparison I kept my shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

995
00:42:51.801 --> 00:42:52.510
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

996
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.881
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

997
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Speaker 2>we used to dark opportunity there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by default I became a lead singer.</v>

998
00:42:56.241 --> 00:43:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Our video got played on mtv and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just chanced upon garbage.</v>

999
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:03.190
<v Speaker 2>The garbage boys needed a singer and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got hired and,</v>

1000
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:06.710
<v Speaker 2>and so I always felt I just fumbled into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it by going off,</v>

1001
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.140
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1002
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1003
00:43:10.001 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I never believed in myself for</v>

1004
00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:17.870
<v Speaker 2>my whole first half of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call the first phase of garbage.</v>

1005
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.333
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1006
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:21.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a really common thing that we</v>

1007
00:43:21.241 --> 00:43:22.920
<v Speaker 3>were just talking about this the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>day with somebody,</v>

1008
00:43:22.921 --> 00:43:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I forget who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they were saying that so many</v>

1009
00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:28.320
<v Speaker 3>really talented people feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>illegitimate.</v>

1010
00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.310
<v Speaker 3>They've felt like they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimate.</v>

1011
00:43:30.311 --> 00:43:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1012
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Are they filming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody feels like,</v>

1013
00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's even the artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's everybody,</v>

1014
00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.300
<v Speaker 2>you know who won't pay it and it sits</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and goes,</v>

1015
00:43:36.301 --> 00:43:37.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm my parent.</v>

1016
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how to parent my children and</v>

1017
00:43:39.391 --> 00:43:41.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how to pay the bills and get the</v>

1018
00:43:41.791 --> 00:43:44.670
<v Speaker 2>work done and keep the high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows how to do anything.</v>

1019
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you definitely do question yourself</v>

1020
00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:49.080
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.940
<v Speaker 3>Like you'll do your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1022
00:43:50.941 --> 00:43:52.230
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have three.</v>

1023
00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.410
<v Speaker 3>I have one that's 20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have one that's almost nine and one</v>

1024
00:43:55.411 --> 00:43:56.610
<v Speaker 3>that's almost eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1025
00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or almost seven rather.</v>

1026
00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.630
<v Speaker 3>And I was hanging out all day with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost seven yesterday.</v>

1027
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.130
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1028
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:06.120
<v Speaker 3>we're just having a great old time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we have days we split up where I</v>

1029
00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:09.600
<v Speaker 3>just hang out with one kid and my wife</v>
<v Speaker 3>will hang out with one kid because I</v>

1030
00:44:09.601 --> 00:44:11.430
<v Speaker 3>think sometimes when you get the two of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them together,</v>

1031
00:44:11.431 --> 00:44:12.870
<v Speaker 3>the young ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't get enough attention,</v>

1032
00:44:12.871 --> 00:44:14.700
<v Speaker 3>especially the little one suffers a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>

1033
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.240
<v Speaker 3>So we have like specific days where it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1034
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:21.930
<v Speaker 3>and so the entire time we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a good time,</v>

1035
00:44:21.931 --> 00:44:23.520
<v Speaker 3>we're having fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also thinking,</v>

1036
00:44:23.521 --> 00:44:25.740
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to like figure we're kind of,</v>

1037
00:44:25.741 --> 00:44:28.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of programming are here as this</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

1038
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:30.930
<v Speaker 3>So every question I have to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>temper this question,</v>

1039
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:35.520
<v Speaker 3>you have to think that these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably don't know any better.</v>

1040
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 3>So that's probably why they litter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1041
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:40.050
<v Speaker 3>And see it like she gets mad when she</v>
<v Speaker 3>sees people throw cigarettes out the</v>

1042
00:44:40.051 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a guy throw a cigarette out the</v>

1043
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:44.310
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that Daddy?</v>

1044
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.990
<v Speaker 3>He threw a cigarette out the window and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1045
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:48.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely not good to throw</v>

1046
00:44:48.871 --> 00:44:50.940
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes out the window,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to think like this poor</v>

1047
00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:53.220
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of a mind do they have</v>

1048
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 3>like this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This the way their brain works.</v>

1049
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.300
<v Speaker 3>They think it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not worried.</v>

1050
00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.790
<v Speaker 3>Like if I drop something on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pick it up.</v>

1051
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Do you pick it up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

1052
00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:01.920
<v Speaker 3>I always pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1053
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:03.150
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we pick things up,</v>

1054
00:45:03.151 --> 00:45:04.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to litter because if</v>

1055
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 3>everybody livered we would never be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get anywhere.</v>

1056
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.160
<v Speaker 3>Just be garbage everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stressful.</v>

1057
00:45:08.161 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Being a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's stressful,</v>

1058
00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 3>but when toward is theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

1059
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.550
<v Speaker 3>you don't have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1060
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:21.240
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to describe to someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>the love that you experienced between</v>

1061
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:24.540
<v Speaker 3>you and this little tiny person like me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the six,</v>

1062
00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:29.340
<v Speaker 3>almost seven when when we talk like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she just jumps on me and hugs me,</v>

1063
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.110
<v Speaker 3>like my whole body has this reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the love meter.</v>

1064
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:36.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know a carnival thing where you hit</v>

1065
00:45:36.451 --> 00:45:38.730
<v Speaker 3>the thing on the bottom and the bell</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes Ding.</v>

1066
00:45:38.731 --> 00:45:39.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

1067
00:45:39.581 --> 00:45:42.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the metal sudden shoots up and hits the</v>

1068
00:45:42.091 --> 00:45:43.920
<v Speaker 3>bell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hits the bell every time.</v>

1069
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Whenever she gives me this big hug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I can't,</v>

1070
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.880
<v Speaker 3>you can't love anybody anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course the love that I have for hers,</v>

1071
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.240
<v Speaker 3>it's Cray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

1072
00:45:51.241 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 3>It's scary because you're worried about</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing them.</v>

1073
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.830
<v Speaker 3>It's scary because you're worried about</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking it up.</v>

1074
00:45:55.831 --> 00:45:58.650
<v Speaker 3>It's scary because just because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>

1075
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.410
<v Speaker 3>really powerful changes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It changes who you are.</v>

1076
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just a hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed me.</v>

1077
00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Just made me a different completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>different person and it does every day,</v>

1078
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:09.990
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a different person than I was like a</v>

1079
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.200
<v Speaker 3>week ago and I talked to a lot of are</v>
<v Speaker 3>other my friends that have kids and it's</v>

1080
00:46:13.201 --> 00:46:17.600
<v Speaker 3>the same thing like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it changes your level of compassion,</v>

1081
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.460
<v Speaker 3>the changes who you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave Chappelle said it best to me.</v>

1082
00:46:20.461 --> 00:46:24.900
<v Speaker 3>He said it didn't just change my how</v>
<v Speaker 3>much I love,</v>

1083
00:46:24.901 --> 00:46:28.260
<v Speaker 3>it changed my capacity for love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1084
00:46:28.261 --> 00:46:29.730
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you nailed it.</v>

1085
00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a tiny window into it cause my</v>

1086
00:46:33.651 --> 00:46:36.710
<v Speaker 2>sister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my younger sister had two children and I</v>

1087
00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:40.210
<v Speaker 2>felt towards her children differently</v>
<v Speaker 2>than I do any other child.</v>

1088
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:45.260
<v Speaker 2>So that's just a small window into how I</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine it is for her with her children.</v>

1089
00:46:45.261 --> 00:46:46.670
<v Speaker 2>And we talk about this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1090
00:46:46.671 --> 00:46:48.950
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think I could handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be too,</v>

1091
00:46:48.951 --> 00:46:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm to sent to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm to hypersensitive to,</v>

1092
00:46:51.261 --> 00:46:54.000
<v Speaker 2>I think take the responsibility on of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a parent.</v>

1093
00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1094
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:55.340
<v Speaker 3>I think though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you would,</v>

1095
00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.950
<v Speaker 3>it changes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you become more wherever you are</v>

1096
00:46:57.951 --> 00:47:00.260
<v Speaker 3>now once if a little person comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body,</v>

1097
00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:01.940
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1098
00:47:01.941 --> 00:47:03.380
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm surely with a person.</v>

1099
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.690
<v Speaker 3>There's like chapter two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1100
00:47:05.691 --> 00:47:07.640
<v Speaker 3>are surely 2.0 or whatever it is.</v>

1101
00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it changes how you view</v>

1102
00:47:09.941 --> 00:47:12.570
<v Speaker 2>yourself and your function on Erath I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would imagine</v>

1103
00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.900
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

1104
00:47:13.901 --> 00:47:16.810
<v Speaker 3>And it also makes you appreciate like</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1105
00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.510
<v Speaker 3>my time is fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1106
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:23.230
<v Speaker 3>it's flexible in terms of like I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulate my time,</v>

1107
00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I can kind of choose what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't really have to do anything.</v>

1108
00:47:26.921 --> 00:47:28.390
<v Speaker 3>I choose to do a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1109
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 3>but that do have</v>

1110
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.760
<v Speaker 1>to do things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially couples where both work and</v>

1111
00:47:33.761 --> 00:47:37.900
<v Speaker 1>they work long hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredibly hard to raise</v>

1112
00:47:37.901 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1113
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you see how tired they're too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they come home from a nine,</v>

1114
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:44.890
<v Speaker 1>10 hour day and their kid has been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>daycare and the kid just can't wait to</v>

1115
00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:45.690
<v Speaker 1>see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

1116
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:48.250
<v Speaker 1>you literally only have an hour with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them before they go to bed.</v>

1117
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not even raising them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relationship was like,</v>

1118
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.130
<v Speaker 1>that was my dad's like when my mum died</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago,</v>

1119
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 1>my dad came over here to Los Angeles to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay with us and we went out for</v>

1120
00:47:58.151 --> 00:48:00.100
<v Speaker 1>lunch and I'm sitting across from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

1121
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm 45 years old and I'm thinking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

1122
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I have never sat alone with you in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant in my life ever.</v>

1123
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And it was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1124
00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Because my dad worked hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1125
00:48:13.331 --> 00:48:16.570
<v Speaker 1>and he was always busy and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1126
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:18.280
<v Speaker 1>it was an intense realization.</v>

1127
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's great that you take time</v>

1128
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.640
<v Speaker 1>one on one with your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I didn't have that with my dad.</v>

1129
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have that either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to,</v>

1130
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:25.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1131
00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they're going to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I fuck up that they're</v>

1132
00:48:27.581 --> 00:48:29.260
<v Speaker 1>not going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to accept you're gonna</v>

1133
00:48:29.261 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't try to fuck up.</v>

1134
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to try to do your best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I just,</v>

1135
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the things that you do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>inverted commas get right are the things</v>

1136
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:44.470
<v Speaker 1>that do I think the most damage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the things that you do wrong.</v>

1137
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.220
<v Speaker 1>The so called big mistakes can also be</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good for children.</v>

1138
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at no point should a child ever be hurt</v>

1139
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.640
<v Speaker 1>in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1140
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that's a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a terrible thing and that</v>

1141
00:48:57.061 --> 00:48:57.790
<v Speaker 1>must never happen.</v>

1142
00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:58.750
<v Speaker 1>But I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1143
00:48:58.751 --> 00:49:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot parents who sort of really</v>
<v Speaker 1>get down on themselves because the</v>

1144
00:49:02.591 --> 00:49:06.910
<v Speaker 1>divorce for a random example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have seen children bloom through</v>

1145
00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:08.190
<v Speaker 1>divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1146
00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.900
<v Speaker 1>and I keep saying that some that to my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my friends who are going through</v>

1147
00:49:10.901 --> 00:49:12.010
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're not,</v>

1148
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:15.820
<v Speaker 1>you're not making a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're teaching them to not settle and</v>

1149
00:49:15.821 --> 00:49:17.920
<v Speaker 1>this good things that can come from bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1150
00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's what I'm trying to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1151
00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:20.411
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1152
00:49:20.411 --> 00:49:23.940
<v Speaker 1>My parents split up when I was five and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very good thing and it,</v>

1153
00:49:23.941 --> 00:49:28.300
<v Speaker 1>it taught me that my mom was strong for</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving my dad and that like you have to</v>

1154
00:49:28.301 --> 00:49:32.440
<v Speaker 1>make tough choices and then things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to suck for a while,</v>

1155
00:49:32.441 --> 00:49:34.960
<v Speaker 1>but there's a reason for it.</v>

1207
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I used to feel that way about people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are drug addicts.</v>

1208
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.210
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to feel that way because all the</v>

1209
00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:50.900
<v Speaker 1>greats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the were drug out of Richard Pryor,</v>

1210
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Kennison Bill Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all drug addicts.</v>

1211
00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all had like huge cocaine</v>

1212
00:51:55.701 --> 00:51:58.010

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1213
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Hicks was the only one that got through</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1214
00:51:59.441 --> 00:52:01.010
<v Speaker 1>But then he wound up not dying of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

1215
00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

1216
00:52:02.241 --> 00:52:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1217
00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Kennison was a cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kind says who's he?</v>

1218

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1222
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I think Richard Pryor was the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's surprised he's right up there.</v>

1223

<v Speaker 5>you got to buy it on shit.</v>

1271
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:40.390
<v Speaker 5>I that's try.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's courses because I know these</v>

1272
00:54:40.391 --> 00:54:43.280
<v Speaker 5>guys were laying out on slabs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're,</v>

1273
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.390
<v Speaker 5>and they're going well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was tough.</v>

1274
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:49.320
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that was pretty hard to live up to</v>

1275
00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:51.920
<v Speaker 5>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have half page death and I'm glad I</v>

1276
00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:53.060
<v Speaker 5>went through it and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1277
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:56.270
<v Speaker 5>well I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm ready to spend eternity in heaven</v>

1278
00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:00.640
<v Speaker 5>and be with Jesus and Ragab age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey.</v>

1279
00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:06.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe</v>

1280
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:18.500
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This girl,</v>

1281
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.740
<v Speaker 5>she laid down in the parking lot and she</v>
<v Speaker 5>was gone.</v>

1282
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:27.380
<v Speaker 5>He'd be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cube's fuck in this.</v>

1283
00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.233
<v Speaker 5>Even after you're dead.</v>

1284
00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:30.020
<v Speaker 3>And I'm crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing.</v>

1285
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I was crying and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1286
00:55:31.971 --> 00:55:33.290
<v Speaker 3>I got to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to see this.</v>

1287
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:36.020
<v Speaker 3>And so I think I got it from a video</v>
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>

1288
00:55:36.021 --> 00:55:39.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it was back when you would rent</v>
<v Speaker 3>it from a vhs cassette.</v>

1289
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I found out about Sam</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinison.</v>

1290
00:55:41.961 --> 00:55:44.930
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons why I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>into standup comedy because I didn't</v>

1291
00:55:44.931 --> 00:55:48.200
<v Speaker 3>know that common he was ever like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought comedy was a guy who just</v>

1292
00:55:48.201 --> 00:55:49.670
<v Speaker 3>stood in front of the microphone and</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1293
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:52.380
<v Speaker 3>did you ever notice that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what was,</v>

1294
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.280
<v Speaker 3>what does well is being a comedian to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean?</v>

1295
00:55:55.281 --> 00:55:57.050
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh it's a bunch of different</v>

1296
00:55:57.051 --> 00:55:59.120
<v Speaker 3>possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was so chaotic.</v>

1297
00:55:59.121 --> 00:56:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his comedy was so wild and crazy.</v>

1298
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a real ground breaker in that</v>

1299
00:56:05.721 --> 00:56:07.940
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why else did you get into being a</v>

1300
00:56:07.941 --> 00:56:10.950
<v Speaker 3>comedian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

1301
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:13.370
<v Speaker 3>I got talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1302
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:18.490

<v Speaker 3>I wasn't teaching any siblings.</v>

1303
00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:21.360
<v Speaker 3>One sister.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So it's just you and your mom and</v>

1305
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.500

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well my mom remarried my Stepdad who</v>

1307
00:56:27.261 --> 00:56:28.580
<v Speaker 3>she's still with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you like him?</v>

1308
00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's great guy.</v>

1309
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1310
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:32.540
<v Speaker 3>super lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a real good guy.</v>

1311
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1312
00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:35.600
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was uh,</v>

1313
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.830
<v Speaker 3>I got talked into doing stand up by my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends from martial arts</v>

1314
00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.130
<v Speaker 3>for real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause we would,</v>

1315
00:56:43.131 --> 00:56:44.690
<v Speaker 3>well you must've been funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1316
00:56:44.691 --> 00:56:47.360
<v Speaker 3>I was only funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was glad gallows humor we would go</v>

1317
00:56:47.361 --> 00:56:48.980
<v Speaker 3>to compete like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1318
00:56:48.981 --> 00:56:51.320
<v Speaker 3>or we would be about to spar and I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

1319
00:56:51.321 --> 00:56:54.080
<v Speaker 3>the guy would make everybody laugh</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everybody was so nervous because</v>

1320
00:56:54.081 --> 00:56:55.760
<v Speaker 3>it was scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You beat the shit out of each other,</v>

1321
00:56:55.761 --> 00:56:57.260
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we would go to these</v>

1322
00:56:57.261 --> 00:57:01.880
<v Speaker 3>competitions so he'd get on a bus and</v>
<v Speaker 3>travel across the country to go fight in</v>

1323
00:57:01.881 --> 00:57:04.520
<v Speaker 3>these tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was super nerve wracking.</v>

1324
00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was super nervous so you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut the tension with a knife.</v>

1325
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:11.630
<v Speaker 3>So I would always like be doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>impressions of people having sex and</v>

1326
00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.430
<v Speaker 3>making jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just,</v>

1327
00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:16.610
<v Speaker 3>this was like long before ever thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>about being comedian.</v>

1328
00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:18.320
<v Speaker 3>I was just trying to lighten up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mood.</v>

1329
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:20.360
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I got into stand up.</v>

1330
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.520
<v Speaker 2>So hold on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So see,</v>

1331
00:57:23.521 --> 00:57:26.400
<v Speaker 2>this is a bit of a surprise to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when people fight,</v>

1332
00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>semi professionally or otherwise,</v>

1333
00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.010
<v Speaker 2>or at school or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nerve wracking.</v>

1334
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:35.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's terrifying because you're scared of</v>

1335
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:36.833
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>

1336
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.190
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anticipation of the possibility of</v>

1337
00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:45.120
<v Speaker 3>losing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're worried about the just all the</v>

1338
00:57:45.121 --> 00:57:46.700
<v Speaker 3>possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1339
00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:49.090
<v Speaker 3>there's just a full realm of things.</v>

1340
00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Why do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm sounding like a mortar on,</v>

1341
00:57:52.051 --> 00:57:55.290
<v Speaker 2>I just have never had the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask anyone who's ever done this.</v>

1342
00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very insecure and um,</v>

1343
00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:03.720
<v Speaker 3>I got bullied and I wasn't big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a small kid and I was really</v>

1344
00:58:03.721 --> 00:58:06.840
<v Speaker 3>nervous and I did not like that feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

1345
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:07.651
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always,</v>

1346
00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:10.920
<v Speaker 3>we were always moving around a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We was moved to new places.</v>

1347
00:58:10.921 --> 00:58:12.740
<v Speaker 3>I was always the new kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1348
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:13.471
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1349
00:58:13.471 --> 00:58:18.471
<v Speaker 3>my mom married my Stepdad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We moved across the country from New</v>

1350
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Jersey to San Francisco and then we</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived there for a while and then we</v>

1351
00:58:21.091 --> 00:58:23.340
<v Speaker 3>moved to Florida and then we moved to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston and he,</v>

1352
00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:26.940
<v Speaker 3>he switched careers and he was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer programmer and then we became</v>

1353
00:58:26.941 --> 00:58:28.720
<v Speaker 3>an architect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a lot of work.</v>

1354
00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of traveling and I just</v>

1355
00:58:32.221 --> 00:58:35.730
<v Speaker 3>was always the new kid in the new kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets fucked boys.</v>

1356
00:58:35.731 --> 00:58:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most of the time was fine,</v>

1357
00:58:37.531 --> 00:58:41.160
<v Speaker 3>but as we started getting older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when it got creepy.</v>

1358
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.290
<v Speaker 3>Like most of the time it was no big</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>

1359
00:58:43.291 --> 00:58:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Like at nine and 10 it's no big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it gets to be like 13 and 14</v>

1360
00:58:47.041 --> 00:58:50.940
<v Speaker 3>then it starts getting violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so like kids would pick on me and I</v>

1361
00:58:50.941 --> 00:58:53.460
<v Speaker 3>didn't know how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it drove me crazy.</v>

1362
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1363
00:58:54.421 --> 00:58:57.450
<v Speaker 3>I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate the fact that when these kids</v>

1364
00:58:57.451 --> 00:58:59.400
<v Speaker 3>want to fight me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do and I'm,</v>

1365
00:58:59.401 --> 00:59:00.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'd be like,</v>

1366
00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.360
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go home the long way around.</v>

1367
00:59:03.361 --> 00:59:05.040
<v Speaker 3>So I'd avoid everybody and that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1368
00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.610
<v Speaker 3>So I decided to learn martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1369
00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:09.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I afraid of?</v>

1370
00:59:09.451 --> 00:59:10.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid of people that know how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1371
00:59:10.681 --> 00:59:12.930
<v Speaker 3>Well I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to really know how to fight.</v>

1372
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:16.380
<v Speaker 3>So I went into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it became my whole life,</v>

1373
00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.900
<v Speaker 3>like from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from high school,</v>

1374
00:59:18.901 --> 00:59:22.970
<v Speaker 3>freshman year on really from 15 is when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went crazy.</v>

1375
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:26.600
<v Speaker 3>So from 15 on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all I did every day,</v>

1376
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.220
<v Speaker 3>like six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven days a week.</v>

1377
00:59:28.221 --> 00:59:29.450
<v Speaker 3>I was teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1378
00:59:29.451 --> 00:59:30.410
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I became a,</v>

1379
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:33.230
<v Speaker 3>I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was teaching when I was 17,</v>

1380
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.060

<v Speaker 3>that's what I was doing.</v>

1381
00:59:35.061 --> 00:59:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Like every day I was teaching at Boston</v>
<v Speaker 3>University when I was 18 and 19.</v>

1382
00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:41.720
<v Speaker 3>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>became my whole life.</v>

1383
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Born in Boston.</v>

00:59:43.071 --> 00:59:44.750
<v Speaker 3>I was born in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come,</v>

1385
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:46.550
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the crazy accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got Rid of it.</v>

1386
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Hurt myself on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won the bay state games.</v>

1387
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:50.840
<v Speaker 3>It was this big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1388
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:54.650
<v Speaker 3>like an Olympic festival,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they had all the Olympic sports</v>

1389
00:59:54.651 --> 00:59:56.990
<v Speaker 3>and was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo had not been in the Olympics</v>

1390
00:59:56.991 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was about to be,</v>

1391
00:59:58.821 --> 01:00:00.830
<v Speaker 3>so they had it in the bay state games</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I won.</v>

1392
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:04.710
<v Speaker 3>So they interviewed me on TV and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember Tom,</v>

1393
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.790
<v Speaker 3>he was like very specifically say we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were working really hard.</v>

1394
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.040
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1395
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 3>I heard that accent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so bad.</v>

1396
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:13.790
<v Speaker 3>I heard the video and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1397
01:00:13.791 --> 01:00:17.750
<v Speaker 3>what the Fuck is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had taken on that accent out of</v>

1398
01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:20.400
<v Speaker 3>insecurity because I'd only lived there</v>
<v Speaker 3>since I was 13.</v>

1399
01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from 13 to 19 and six years I</v>

1400
01:00:23.901 --> 01:00:26.460
<v Speaker 3>developed a stupid accent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fall,</v>

1401
01:00:26.461 --> 01:00:27.294
<v Speaker 3>wanted to finish it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1402
01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:29.180
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized I'd done it once so</v>
<v Speaker 3>I abandoned that.</v>

1403
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:32.570
<v Speaker 3>But it will come out a little bit if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>get drunk like every now and then some</v>

1404
01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.000
<v Speaker 3>words because he didn't grow up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1405
01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.060
<v Speaker 3>of course it's gross when you hear</v>
<v Speaker 3>another girl.</v>

1406
01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:44.610
<v Speaker 3>In fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>

1407
01:00:44.631 --> 01:00:49.100
<v Speaker 3>it's like too many Ar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ar thing that stretches out.</v>

1408
01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Although the ice didn't speak like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1409
01:00:53.961 --> 01:00:56.420
<v Speaker 3>I wish as beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that accent is pretty,</v>

1410
01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:58.450
<v Speaker 3>there's something about the Boston</v>
<v Speaker 3>accent,</v>

1411
01:00:58.451 --> 01:01:03.350
<v Speaker 3>it's just particularly gross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so please don't worry about it.</v>

1412
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:08.660
<v Speaker 3>You are fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then your pile talked you into</v>

1413
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:12.590
<v Speaker 3>becoming my friend Steve Graham to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends ed shorter and Steve Graham,</v>

1414
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Steve Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still one of my best friends today.</v>

1415
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:19.700
<v Speaker 3>He was an ophthalmologist at the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and still encourage you to walk.</v>

1416
01:01:19.701 --> 01:01:24.470
<v Speaker 3>Go to you told me I should be a comedian</v>
<v Speaker 3>of class or like literally grabbed me by</v>

1417
01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:26.580
<v Speaker 3>my shoulders and said you should be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian.</v>

1418
01:01:26.581 --> 01:01:28.880
<v Speaker 3>So then what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to an open mic night,</v>

1419
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.700
<v Speaker 3>I watched a amateurs try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the good things about</v>

1420
01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:32.910
<v Speaker 3>amateurs is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1421
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.360
<v Speaker 3>if you go to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like most of them don't know what</v>

1422
01:01:35.361 --> 01:01:36.290
<v Speaker 3>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're terrible.</v>

1423
01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.370
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1424
01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:39.560
<v Speaker 3>well I can't be as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1425
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.690
<v Speaker 3>at least I'm not going to be the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>one who sucks.</v>

1426
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:44.120
<v Speaker 3>So like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I go up and do that,</v>

1427
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:45.650
<v Speaker 3>I can do what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They suck.</v>

1428
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:47.510
<v Speaker 3>I suck too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they suck.</v>

1429
01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:52.160
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like you're going up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Pryor's on Richard,</v>

1430
01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Jenny and all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could take the competition.</v>

1431
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.471
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1432
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:56.900
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I wouldn't be the only one</v>
<v Speaker 3>who sucked.</v>

1433
01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Like people who really suck inspire you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it because they'll,</v>

1434
01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:04.340
<v Speaker 3>they lower the bar of expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause like if I went up there and it was</v>

1435
01:02:04.341 --> 01:02:06.920
<v Speaker 3>all these really amazing comedians and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then to me,</v>

1436
01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:07.551
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1437
01:02:07.551 --> 01:02:08.450
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1438
01:02:08.451 --> 01:02:12.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking terrible at it because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning curve of standup comedy is so</v>

1439
01:02:12.081 --> 01:02:15.080
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially when you're 21 you don't</v>

1440
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:17.480
<v Speaker 3>know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know anything about life or</v>

1441
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:18.200
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1442
01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.440
<v Speaker 3>of course he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1443
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:20.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I</v>

1444
01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But somehow or another,</v>

1445
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>these guys talked me into doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you still do your stand up?</v>

1446
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:25.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constantly.</v>

1447
01:02:25.891 --> 01:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1448
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>You turn it around on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1450
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1451
01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clever girl</v>

1452
01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:39.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At worst you don't,</v>

1453
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't think you're clever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think particularly clever.</v>

1454
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I can think fast on my feet that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>clever.</v>

1455
01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>But I have serious attention deficit</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>

1456
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1457
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I hear that a lot from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually think that what that means is</v>

1458
01:02:57.421 --> 01:03:02.040
<v Speaker 1>you really enjoy certain things so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other things suck for you and you</v>

1459
01:03:02.041 --> 01:03:04.320
<v Speaker 1>just get distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

1460
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I bet you don't have an attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>deficit disorder when you're singing</v>

1461
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:07.770
<v Speaker 1>your songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1462
01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:12.770
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that again is not a material you'll</v>

1463
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:15.150
<v Speaker 1>have to retrieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just stuff in there.</v>

1464
01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:16.260
<v Speaker 1>You open your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes out.</v>

1465
01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think that it's possible that</v>

1466
01:03:19.231 --> 01:03:24.231
<v Speaker 1>you achieve these high frequencies of</v>
<v Speaker 1>delight and of stimulation when you're</v>

1467
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.920
<v Speaker 1>performing and when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1468
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:31.740
<v Speaker 1>you got to think that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage,</v>

1469
01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:34.440
<v Speaker 1>like what's the biggest crowd you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever performed for this?</v>

1470
01:03:34.441 --> 01:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like I'm making up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1471
01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I can hardly believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we played in front of 300,000 people</v>

1472
01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:43.890
<v Speaker 1>in some out of Russia and that was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trippiest expedia</v>

1473
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the biggest music festival that</v>

1474
01:03:49.261 --> 01:03:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I'd ever been</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1475
01:03:52.351 --> 01:03:57.000
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't see the end of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I look at Glastonbury and go small.</v>

1476
01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:03.210
<v Speaker 1>You know how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think of that.</v>

1477
01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Think of that experience and how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are ever going to feel that.</v>

1478
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.840
<v Speaker 1>How many ever people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are ever going to rock out in</v>

1479
01:04:09.841 --> 01:04:14.841
<v Speaker 1>front of 300,000 people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that some people,</v>

1480
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:18.780
<v Speaker 1>they're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moments of brilliance that there's</v>

1481
01:04:18.781 --> 01:04:23.781
<v Speaker 1>moments of spectacular experience that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have are so different than most</v>

1482
01:04:24.331 --> 01:04:29.331
<v Speaker 1>people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people disagree 100% because I know</v>

1483
01:04:31.621 --> 01:04:36.621
<v Speaker 1>that people's capacity for joy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a certain expedience that we</v>

1484
01:04:36.991 --> 01:04:39.330
<v Speaker 1>all have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can go out to dinner and if</v>

1485
01:04:39.331 --> 01:04:42.360
<v Speaker 1>you're having a really great meal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're with people that you love and are</v>

1486
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:44.940
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you are laughing yourself sick.</v>

1487
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I have the same feelings as I do when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a good shore.</v>

1488
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like my career is the highlight</v>

1489
01:04:52.981 --> 01:04:53.814
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1490
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a joyous part of my life that plays</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rule in,</v>

1491
01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:01.950
<v Speaker 1>in my enjoyment of being on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds very balanced,</v>

1492
01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.950
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that doesn't.</v>

1493
01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So I think my point being is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think if you enjoy your job,</v>

1494
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:12.480
<v Speaker 1>if you love your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have great sex with your</v>

1495
01:05:12.481 --> 01:05:15.180
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend or your girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a baby,</v>

1496
01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:17.470
<v Speaker 1>you know that moment when they put the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby in arms,</v>

1497
01:05:17.471 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly</v>

1498
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.560
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to play in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>300,000 people,</v>

1499
01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:21.660
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1500
01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is correct.</v>

1501
01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:25.150
<v Speaker 2>You're the only one to be able to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>us though.</v>

1502
01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must take it from an authority.</v>

1503
01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.430
<v Speaker 2>There's no denier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You argue with,</v>

1504
01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.530
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was going to say though is that</v>

1505
01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:40.531
<v Speaker 2>your experience in the intensity is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>high that your capacity to appreciate</v>

1506
01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:45.400
<v Speaker 2>boring shit is probably very low and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why people</v>

1507
01:05:45.401 --> 01:05:47.980
<v Speaker 2>would lay label it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like attention deficit.</v>

1508
01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:50.400
<v Speaker 2>You probably just don't want to pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to shit that,</v>

1509
01:05:50.401 --> 01:05:52.240
<v Speaker 2>that you're not passionate about was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

1510
01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:55.930
<v Speaker 2>But there is moments when somebody is</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me something and I'm thinking to</v>

1511
01:05:55.931 --> 01:05:56.381
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1512
01:05:56.381 --> 01:06:00.070
<v Speaker 2>remember this cause this is important</v>
<v Speaker 2>and or this is really cool.</v>

1513
01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:03.190
<v Speaker 2>You could use it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hold us information,</v>

1514
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.290
<v Speaker 2>hold this fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold this.</v>

1515
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.290
<v Speaker 2>And then I try and tell somebody 24</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours later,</v>

1516
01:06:08.291 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 2>but this incredible story I was told and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember it.</v>

1517
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:15.700
<v Speaker 2>That's called being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>

1518
01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you haven't slipped away at all</v>

1519
01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.040
<v Speaker 2>during this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1520
01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been locked on.</v>

1521
01:06:20.861 --> 01:06:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm intense and I am a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are or what you're woke.</v>

1522
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:30.160
<v Speaker 2>I hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fucking expression.</v>

1523
01:06:30.161 --> 01:06:33.070
<v Speaker 2>One more time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might hit the next person might that</v>

1524
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:33.670
<v Speaker 2>comes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1525
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:36.220
<v Speaker 2>that is an expression that never had its</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1526
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1527
01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Joke from the moment I first came out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with fools.</v>

1528
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Fools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1529
01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.600
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like person that I know.</v>

1530
01:06:49.601 --> 01:06:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Like ever said that word without being</v>
<v Speaker 2>in just joking.</v>

1531
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.790
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well hang out with a lot of comedians.</v>

1532
01:06:56.090 --> 01:07:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Well they're fast and quick and funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think it's ridiculous job as a</v>

1533
01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:03.460
<v Speaker 2>comedian to take the piss out of all us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Norm norms.</v>

1534
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.590
<v Speaker 2>That is one thing that I love that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys say.</v>

1535
01:07:05.591 --> 01:07:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Take the piss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a great expression.</v>

1536
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Scotland has some incredible like</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible expressions and sort of the</v>

1537
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.560
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best things that happened to</v>

1538
01:07:17.561 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 2>me lately was I got retweeted by William</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gibson</v>

1539
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:27.330
<v Speaker 2>and he retweeted a Scottish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a link that I'd done on,</v>

1540
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:31.650
<v Speaker 2>or I'd done for the nme on Scottish</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden and the fact that he had re</v>

1541
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>posted my tutorial on Scottish sweating</v>
<v Speaker 2>and need my fucking life.</v>

1542
01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Call me side if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was like the most glorious moment</v>

1543
01:07:39.641 --> 01:07:41.590
<v Speaker 2>of my career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've sat at all.</v>

1544
01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:43.230
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1545
01:07:43.231 --> 01:07:45.580
<v Speaker 2>the scots are really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1546
01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:48.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a small culture because it's bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>weather.</v>

1547
01:07:48.641 --> 01:07:53.641
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are stupefying uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so cliches I'm spewing here,</v>

1548
01:07:53.831 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 2>but because it's a small country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's bad weather because we</v>

1549
01:07:56.741 --> 01:07:59.020
<v Speaker 2>spend a lot of time talking to one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

1550
01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:03.760
<v Speaker 2>passing one another in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of humor in America I find</v>

1551
01:08:03.761 --> 01:08:06.640
<v Speaker 2>is not quite as acute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1552
01:08:06.641 --> 01:08:09.410
<v Speaker 2>people are used to verbally spotting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scotland because you know,</v>

1553
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.400
<v Speaker 2>against people all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing past them in shops,</v>

1554
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:13.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling and the tube,</v>

1555
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:14.980
<v Speaker 2>being on the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1556
01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:15.321
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1557
01:08:15.321 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas in America,</v>

1558
01:08:16.221 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 2>everything's more spread out and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not around people so much.</v>

1559
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:21.170
<v Speaker 2>So when you are in face to face with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1560
01:08:21.171 --> 01:08:22.250
<v Speaker 2>people are a little more polite.</v>

1561
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:26.120
<v Speaker 2>And Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is absolutely no politeness.</v>

1562
01:08:26.121 --> 01:08:28.520
<v Speaker 2>We got shoved their big comedy festival</v>
<v Speaker 2>there every year.</v>

1563
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.980
<v Speaker 2>The fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1564
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Have you been there yet</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Ari?</v>

1565
01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Shaffir raves about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that mother fucker goes everywhere.</v>

1566
01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:37.910
<v Speaker 2>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should go there.</v>

1567
01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:41.930
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredible circuit for funny men</v>

1568
01:08:41.931 --> 01:08:43.880
<v Speaker 2>like yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys have billy connolly,</v>

1569
01:08:43.881 --> 01:08:47.480
<v Speaker 2>he's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept calling me is great and hi</v>

1570
01:08:47.481 --> 01:08:48.420
<v Speaker 2>ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

1571
01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:49.283
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1572
01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Well not well though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really decide degenerative disease,</v>

1573
01:08:54.591 --> 01:08:56.030
<v Speaker 2>sadly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1574
01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:58.070
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to lose him soon I think.</v>

1575
01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1576
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it's target</v>
<v Speaker 2>or or dementia.</v>

1577
01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember if it's one on one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two.</v>

1578
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a brilliant mind.</v>

1579
01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:11.114
<v Speaker 2>Funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny man.</v>

1580
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.000
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should get your ass over there.</v>

1581
01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:16.400
<v Speaker 2>They would love you done bad weather</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1582
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why Boston has so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny comedians.</v>

1583
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

1584
01:09:20.901 --> 01:09:22.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is a ridiculous cliche,</v>

1585
01:09:22.851 --> 01:09:26.540
<v Speaker 2>but for sure it plays a small part and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not cliche at all.</v>

1586
01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:28.190
<v Speaker 2>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1587
01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:29.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've been Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

1588
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.230
<v Speaker 2>A lot of bad weather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of cold snow people indoors,</v>

1589
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:35.630
<v Speaker 2>people the long winters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's true.</v>

1590
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:39.110
<v Speaker 2>No tolerance for stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No tolerance.</v>

1591
01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Also work ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hard work ethic.</v>

1592
01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:45.230
<v Speaker 2>They're very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had no tolerance for meandering</v>

1593
01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:46.600
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1594
01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.980
<v Speaker 2>it's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different way of thinking</v>

1595
01:09:48.981 --> 01:09:52.550
<v Speaker 2>certainly than Los Angeles and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>expedience or soft out here,</v>

1596
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.880
<v Speaker 2>push heart are very polite and they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>soft for one of a better term.</v>

1597
01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like I find that sometimes when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>make jokes people don't know how to flip</v>

1598
01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:04.940
<v Speaker 2>it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know like it's going to be buddies</v>

1599
01:10:04.941 --> 01:10:08.480
<v Speaker 2>joking all the time and it's really fast</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of dialogue.</v>

1600
01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.930
<v Speaker 2>People panic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>panic and they,</v>

1601
01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:15.470
<v Speaker 2>they're scared they're going to offend</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and say the wrong thing and</v>

1602
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:20.060
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I have to go on double dates</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my wife and sometimes I'll crack a</v>

1603
01:10:20.061 --> 01:10:22.880
<v Speaker 2>joke and the whole table would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1604
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's meeting.</v>

1605
01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I think all of us go home in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say to my husband,</v>

1606
01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:32.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm really sorry if I embarrassed you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says he's always got this</v>

1607
01:10:32.091 --> 01:10:33.740
<v Speaker 2>classic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went and he didn't embarrass me.</v>

1608
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 2>You only embarrass yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious or joking?</v>

1609
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Kind of half and half.</v>

<v Speaker 2>mildly inappropriate.</v>

1611
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like you're like because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're from Scotland that you have like</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the crickets.</v>

<v Speaker 3>a young man was a,</v>

1644
01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:03.400
<v Speaker 3>wants to be girded with a belt of</v>

<v Speaker 3>Girding gird your loins,</v>

01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:28.803
<v Speaker 3>this is a show of it.</v>

1653

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1658
01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that as a certain kind of high</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get when you go off in the road and</v>

1659
01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:48.310
<v Speaker 2>you can stop worrying about bills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You stop worrying about money,</v>

1660
01:12:48.311 --> 01:12:49.600
<v Speaker 2>stop worrying about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
01:12:49.601 --> 01:12:50.860
<v Speaker 2>the pain in your ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1662
01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have no worries.</v>

1663
01:12:52.361 --> 01:12:55.780
<v Speaker 2>You just go on the tour bus and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>bust for me to be,</v>

1664
01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.190
<v Speaker 2>you get a little email every day that</v>
<v Speaker 2>tells you exactly what you're doing.</v>

1665
01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:02.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at noon to a core manager,</v>

1666
01:13:02.471 --> 01:13:04.810
<v Speaker 2>there's the handles all your manager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1667
01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1668
01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:07.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1669
01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I love going on tour and it's an honor</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be playing with blondie and uh,</v>

1670
01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.930
<v Speaker 2>the fans are very excited.</v>

1671
01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:17.530
<v Speaker 2>And how many days do you go for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about seven weeks,</v>

1672
01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:20.440
<v Speaker 2>although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a small tutor for us.</v>

1673
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:22.810
<v Speaker 2>That was a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We normally go out for a year.</v>

1674
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:24.850
<v Speaker 2>A year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A year,</v>

1675
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:25.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One off,</v>

1676
01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:27.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you come home for bits,</v>

1677
01:13:27.101 --> 01:13:29.530
<v Speaker 2>but generally it's a sort of a year long</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1678
01:13:29.531 --> 01:13:32.770
<v Speaker 2>And it used to be two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the music industry got crushed</v>

1679
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.480
<v Speaker 2>by music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Final shading.</v>

1680
01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a slightly different game</v>

1681
01:13:37.091 --> 01:13:40.540
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But isn't the touring business the same</v>

1682
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:42.940
<v Speaker 2>or how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1683
01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.370
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the problem with a tutoring</v>

1684
01:13:45.371 --> 01:13:48.370
<v Speaker 2>business know is that it's the only way</v>
<v Speaker 2>a musician can make money.</v>

1685
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:49.061
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

1686
01:13:49.061 --> 01:13:54.061
<v Speaker 2>the competition to score venues in which</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can play or it's getting higher and</v>

1687
01:13:54.881 --> 01:13:57.220
<v Speaker 2>higher and higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I noticed that as a community really</v>

1688
01:13:57.221 --> 01:14:00.580
<v Speaker 2>difficult is a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have to book stuff like a year in</v>

1689
01:14:00.581 --> 01:14:01.590
<v Speaker 2>advance advance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1690
01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edinburgh festival next year.</v>

1691
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll love it.</v>

1692
01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:11.470
<v Speaker 2>You'll learn all kinds of phrases that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can employ in your stand up and ever</v>

1693
01:14:11.471 --> 01:14:14.140
<v Speaker 2>used in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of original material.</v>

1694
01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:15.123
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1695
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you guys though,</v>

1696
01:14:20.381 --> 01:14:25.381
<v Speaker 2>you were in the business when the money</v>
<v Speaker 2>was being made and then it was like,</v>

1697
01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 2>what is it around like 2000 when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>floor dropped out,</v>

1698
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:33.490
<v Speaker 2>the floor was beginning to drill pipe</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then 2001 came around and September,</v>

1699
01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.830
<v Speaker 2>September.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

1700
01:14:35.831 --> 01:14:37.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the beginning of the end.</v>

1701
01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the writing on the wall?</v>

1702
01:14:39.131 --> 01:14:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Did you think they were going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1703
01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:42.910
<v Speaker 2>I told her whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally saw the writing on the wall.</v>

1704
01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Actually rule a boater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I at the time I run our blog,</v>

1705
01:14:45.401 --> 01:14:46.630
<v Speaker 2>a music blog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

1706
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:48.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first,</v>

1707
01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:50.680
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because musicians didn't have blogs,</v>

1708
01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:52.960
<v Speaker 2>we didn't really use computers up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>

1709
01:14:52.961 --> 01:14:56.640
<v Speaker 2>So I had this blog and I was very vocal</v>
<v Speaker 2>about napster and I,</v>

1710
01:14:56.641 --> 01:14:57.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1711
01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I could foresee the issues that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1712
01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:03.550
<v Speaker 2>that presented themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the industry itself was still</v>

1713
01:15:03.551 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 2>greedy.</v>

1714
01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:07.090
<v Speaker 2>It refused to adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1715
01:15:07.091 --> 01:15:11.320
<v Speaker 2>and as long as he could have died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1716
01:15:11.321 --> 01:15:13.390
<v Speaker 2>That's not my place to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about it really?</v>

1717
01:15:13.391 --> 01:15:14.570
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1718
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:19.950
<v Speaker 2>they just continued to want to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>money via cds and physical seals and the</v>

1719
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:23.590
<v Speaker 2>refused sort of to make the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>deals that they really needed to,</v>

1720
01:15:23.591 --> 01:15:25.200
<v Speaker 2>and digital deals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1721
01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:29.500
<v Speaker 2>While before people started selling</v>
<v Speaker 2>things on itunes and what have you,</v>

1722
01:15:29.501 --> 01:15:32.590
<v Speaker 2>but there wasn't really a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a venue for it before that they would</v>

1723
01:15:32.591 --> 01:15:34.270
<v Speaker 2>have had to create,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they would have had to create it,</v>

1724
01:15:34.271 --> 01:15:36.160
<v Speaker 2>but the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only ones who had the power and the</v>

1725
01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:38.640
<v Speaker 2>financial resources to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1726
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:39.520
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1727
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.010
<v Speaker 2>and as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now of course they're the only ones we</v>

1728
01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:45.490
<v Speaker 2>can money or any of the companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the record companies continue to make</v>

1729
01:15:45.491 --> 01:15:49.840
<v Speaker 2>vast amounts of money off artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube mix vast amounts of money off</v>

1730
01:15:49.841 --> 01:15:50.230
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>

1731
01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:52.570
<v Speaker 2>And the artist makes nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the general public are</v>

1732
01:15:52.571 --> 01:15:56.260
<v Speaker 2>fully aware of what a crime spree is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crime,</v>

1733
01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:59.080
<v Speaker 2>crime spree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a crime spree.</v>

1734
01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:02.020
<v Speaker 2>But who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's committing the crimes while</v>

1735
01:16:02.021 --> 01:16:04.970
<v Speaker 2>they're tiny crimes committed against</v>
<v Speaker 2>each artist,</v>

1736
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:09.280
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that con that compiles a vast library of</v>

1737
01:16:09.281 --> 01:16:14.281
<v Speaker 2>digital content that through which</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive companies conglomerates make</v>

1738
01:16:14.591 --> 01:16:18.920
<v Speaker 2>money from by just sheer mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the artists themselves mixed,</v>

1739
01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:22.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less than a penny a pop less than a</v>

1740
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:23.620
<v Speaker 2>penny a pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1741
01:16:23.770 --> 01:16:27.310
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give you guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought your albums on itunes.</v>

1742
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Well we had a bad example too because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are our own record label at this point.</v>

1743
01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.240
<v Speaker 2>You are your own records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when a bad example,</v>

1744
01:16:34.241 --> 01:16:39.241
<v Speaker 2>we're one of the lucky ones and when did</v>
<v Speaker 2>you figure this out by a lot of getting</v>

1745
01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:40.301
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>

1746
01:16:40.301 --> 01:16:43.360
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no lube was used and you know,</v>

1747
01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:43.971
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1748
01:16:43.971 --> 01:16:44.710
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

1749
01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:47.860
<v Speaker 2>we were around long enough that at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our masters are very good to us and</v>

1750
01:16:47.861 --> 01:16:52.630
<v Speaker 2>so we could make really lucrative deals</v>
<v Speaker 2>for ourselves and protect our catalog</v>

1751
01:16:52.631 --> 01:16:53.351
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's blah,</v>

1752
01:16:53.351 --> 01:16:53.710
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

1753
01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:56.800
<v Speaker 2>It's so boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But boring is fascinating for young</v>

1754
01:16:56.801 --> 01:16:58.240
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1755
01:16:58.241 --> 01:16:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1756
01:16:59.411 --> 01:17:00.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1757
01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:03.190
<v Speaker 2>you're hooked up to a record label.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The record label makes money by your</v>

1758
01:17:03.191 --> 01:17:05.440
<v Speaker 2>records getting plead on Youtube for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

1759
01:17:05.441 --> 01:17:06.970
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>

1760
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like a 0.0375 percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a penny that you might get played after</v>

1761
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:19.870
<v Speaker 2>by a thousand million plays on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>

1762
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:22.670
<v Speaker 2>it's bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1763
01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:24.100
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

1764
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.260
<v Speaker 2>what is the justification for a record</v>
<v Speaker 2>company at this point?</v>

1765
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:30.400
<v Speaker 2>It seems like what with distribution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1766
01:17:30.401 --> 01:17:33.500
<v Speaker 2>but like where are they distributing at</v>
<v Speaker 2>told one of the world,</v>

1767
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:36.110
<v Speaker 2>but to where to what and in what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in what manner?</v>

1768
01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.940
<v Speaker 2>In a variety of different manners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they know do three 60 degrees,</v>

1769
01:17:40.941 --> 01:17:42.640
<v Speaker 2>so they take a percentage of absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1770
01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:43.880
<v Speaker 2>A band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>errands,</v>

1771
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:45.860
<v Speaker 2>which was not the case before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>

1772
01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:46.170
<v Speaker 2>the knife.</v>

1773
01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:48.710
<v Speaker 2>So up your publishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they saw up your performance rates,</v>

1774
01:17:48.711 --> 01:17:51.890
<v Speaker 2>they saw what your marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they s any endorsements you get,</v>

1775
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:53.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems fucked up to me.</v>

1776
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:55.010
<v Speaker 2>It is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't,</v>

1777
01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.170
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem like it's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do they,</v>

1778
01:17:57.171 --> 01:18:00.680
<v Speaker 2>what do they bring to the table?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a bunch of people stealing money,</v>

1779
01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:03.150
<v Speaker 2>except if you're a massive pop star like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1780
01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:06.620
<v Speaker 2>beyond Sierra Gaga or Kate Patty and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bieber or what have you,</v>

1781
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.920
<v Speaker 2>then that company can use its resources</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make you even bigger.</v>

1782
01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:15.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's why these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these pop stars who continue to make</v>

1783
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.370
<v Speaker 2>commercial signed music get bigger and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger and bigger and more and more</v>

1784
01:18:19.371 --> 01:18:24.290
<v Speaker 2>powerful until they can just buy their</v>
<v Speaker 2>way into the consciousness of the public</v>

1785
01:18:24.291 --> 01:18:27.770
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But radio is not much of a thing</v>

1786
01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:28.190
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1787
01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:28.430
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1788
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:30.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not radio anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's visibility.</v>

1789
01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:33.360
<v Speaker 2>You have to have visibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it that's getting</v>

1790
01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.580
<v Speaker 3>people visible these days?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1791
01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:39.960
<v Speaker 3>like it used to be a song would be a top</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 hit on the radio and then everybody</v>

1792
01:18:39.961 --> 01:18:41.880
<v Speaker 3>would hear about it and you'd want to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and buy the record.</v>

1793
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Well I think most young people get it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the web,</v>

1794
01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:46.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1795
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:48.640
<v Speaker 3>But like how does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but viral music,</v>

1796
01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:52.270
<v Speaker 3>like if you release a song and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your label,</v>

1797
01:18:52.271 --> 01:18:55.990
<v Speaker 3>it's your own thing and you put it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube and say someone like me comes</v>

1798
01:18:55.991 --> 01:18:58.270
<v Speaker 3>along and has a lot of twitter followers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I say,</v>

1799
01:18:58.271 --> 01:19:00.950
<v Speaker 3>this is awesome and I retweet it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a bunch of other people retweet</v>

1800
01:19:00.951 --> 01:19:02.350
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all it takes today,</v>

1801
01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:03.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1802
01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1803
01:19:04.861 --> 01:19:07.320
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a song though that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily digestible,</v>

1804
01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:11.430
<v Speaker 2>which is why there's so few musicians</v>
<v Speaker 2>now taking real risks because otherwise</v>

1805
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:15.570
<v Speaker 2>if they take a risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a all song,</v>

1806
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that appeals to the masses then.</v>

1807
01:19:17.821 --> 01:19:20.060
<v Speaker 2>So you day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'll see what I mean.</v>

1808
01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not articulating myself anywhere.</v>

1809
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Kendrick Lamar guy is that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he independent?</v>

1810
01:19:24.751 --> 01:19:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Is he the guy that's independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which got chance the rapper chance the</v>

1811
01:19:27.361 --> 01:19:29.460
<v Speaker 2>rapper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy that's independent and he's</v>

1812
01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.720
<v Speaker 2>enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1813
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how the fuck did he do it?</v>

1814
01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's obviously the always an</v>

1815
01:19:34.681 --> 01:19:36.870
<v Speaker 2>exception to the rule and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary.</v>

1816
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:38.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an extraordinary talent.</v>

1817
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:41.910
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and usually when somebody hasn't reached</v>

1818
01:19:41.911 --> 01:19:45.150
<v Speaker 2>public consciousness yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of hype around them.</v>

1819
01:19:45.151 --> 01:19:47.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to be in the know,</v>

1820
01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.610
<v Speaker 2>they want to talk about the new artists</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody doesn't know about so and</v>

1821
01:19:50.611 --> 01:19:53.160
<v Speaker 2>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they enjoy like a massive swell</v>

1822
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:57.630
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully he'll be able to build</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon that.</v>

1823
01:19:57.631 --> 01:19:59.280
<v Speaker 2>But it'll be harder for him the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>time round.</v>

1824
01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:02.250
<v Speaker 2>What I'm getting at is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is fascinating to me that the record</v>

1825
01:20:02.251 --> 01:20:06.250
<v Speaker 2>companies have managed to stay even</v>
<v Speaker 2>remotely relevant because what,</v>

1826
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 2>because they made all these deals with</v>
<v Speaker 2>all</v>

1827
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 1>these new companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the media companies.</v>

1828
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.380
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets really creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1829
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is creepy.</v>

1830
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:16.830
<v Speaker 1>It is creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As someone who's not in the business,</v>

1831
01:20:16.831 --> 01:20:20.250
<v Speaker 1>it's creepy because I'm looking at like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they bring to the table and there's</v>

1832
01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:22.230
<v Speaker 1>not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

1833
01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:25.830
<v Speaker 1>distribution and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this firsthand because it's very</v>

1834
01:20:25.831 --> 01:20:29.580
<v Speaker 1>difficult for us to get to distribute</v>
<v Speaker 1>our music because we don't have a</v>

1835
01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:32.880
<v Speaker 1>distribution label that can compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1836
01:20:32.881 --> 01:20:35.160
<v Speaker 1>But when you say distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like distributed,</v>

1837
01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:40.110
<v Speaker 1>where at are whenever they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether that's adds on the street,</v>

1838
01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:44.340
<v Speaker 1>whether that's ads on the television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's ads on the radio,</v>

1839
01:20:44.341 --> 01:20:46.680
<v Speaker 1>whether it's ads on youtube and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>

1840
01:20:46.681 --> 01:20:50.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just an accumulative con like</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness of an artist.</v>

1841
01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:55.190
<v Speaker 1>So they're almost manufacturing like</v>
<v Speaker 1>public interest kind of.</v>

1842
01:20:55.591 --> 01:20:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

1843
01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:00.210
<v Speaker 1>they have to have assemblance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something good,</v>

1844
01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:00.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>

1845
01:21:00.841 --> 01:21:03.450
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sell shit as it turns out.</v>

1846
01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:05.160
<v Speaker 1>But that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exception to the rule.</v>

1847
01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have a catchy song and they can,</v>

1848
01:21:08.581 --> 01:21:13.581
<v Speaker 1>if they push it to enough minds eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can have a hip.</v>

1849
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a weird transition.</v>

1850
01:21:16.261 --> 01:21:19.410
<v Speaker 1>They're like vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to remain indoors.</v>

1851
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fifth a strange and is kind of sad</v>

1852
01:21:24.871 --> 01:21:27.150
<v Speaker 1>really as it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you are seeing fewer and</v>

1853
01:21:27.151 --> 01:21:30.870
<v Speaker 1>fewer artists that have long careers</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like I said,</v>

1854
01:21:30.871 --> 01:21:33.480
<v Speaker 1>you can generate a lot of excitement</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's your first record.</v>

1855
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:36.810
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easiest when by the time it comes</v>

1856
01:21:36.811 --> 01:21:39.060
<v Speaker 1>to your second record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these artists that we hear</v>

1857
01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:43.560
<v Speaker 1>about are already dead and buried under</v>
<v Speaker 1>1,000,000,001 other new artists.</v>

1858
01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you read that Courtney love</v>

1859
01:21:47.191 --> 01:21:50.250
<v Speaker 1>article that she wrote many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years ago about the music business,</v>

1860
01:21:50.251 --> 01:21:53.850
<v Speaker 1>about how complicated it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is pre all of this digital</v>

1861
01:21:53.851 --> 01:21:54.450
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1862
01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:58.650
<v Speaker 1>She wrote this way back in the day when</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was explaining how these artists get</v>

1863
01:21:58.651 --> 01:22:03.651
<v Speaker 1>fucked over by music companies about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything gets written off as an</v>

1864
01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:06.720
<v Speaker 1>expense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time they get paid,</v>

1865
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.880
<v Speaker 1>everybody else has been paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else is like the,</v>

1866
01:22:09.881 --> 01:22:12.810
<v Speaker 1>the record companies made money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the executives of big money and then the</v>

1867
01:22:12.811 --> 01:22:17.580
<v Speaker 1>artists get money and all the expenses</v>
<v Speaker 1>get written off as expenses that the</v>

1868
01:22:17.581 --> 01:22:20.010
<v Speaker 1>artists have to pay for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have no control over the</v>

1869
01:22:20.011 --> 01:22:22.410
<v Speaker 1>expanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for a random example,</v>

1870
01:22:22.411 --> 01:22:26.790
<v Speaker 1>you can turn up at an airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you flew in from La to London.</v>

1871
01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:30.810
<v Speaker 1>You arrive and there's a limousine</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for you and you don't even</v>

1872
01:22:30.811 --> 01:22:31.650
<v Speaker 1>question it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1873
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the transport,</v>

1874
01:22:32.811 --> 01:22:36.400
<v Speaker 1>the record company of scent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take you to this ridiculous hotel</v>

1875
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.340
<v Speaker 1>that the posture than you've ever been</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>

1876
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:40.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't think about it because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>record companies paying for it,</v>

1877
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:43.530
<v Speaker 1>they throw a huge big party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1878
01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:45.420
<v Speaker 1>How generous our record companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So amazing.</v>

1879
01:22:45.421 --> 01:22:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this incredible party and then</v>

1880
01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.630
<v Speaker 1>charging you for every single thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet none of it gets run through you</v>

1881
01:22:51.631 --> 01:22:54.900
<v Speaker 1>for your approval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have no power over the economic</v>

1882
01:22:54.901 --> 01:22:56.670
<v Speaker 1>spending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get charged back.</v>

1883
01:22:56.850 --> 01:22:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single expenditure.</v>

1884
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the salaries of the people that run</v>

1885
01:23:01.831 --> 01:23:04.440
<v Speaker 1>these companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that is dependent upon you</v>

1886
01:23:04.441 --> 01:23:05.740
<v Speaker 1>selling your art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1887
01:23:05.741 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1888
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.480
<v Speaker 2>when things are going well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's,</v>

1889
01:23:07.481 --> 01:23:09.640
<v Speaker 2>they're going well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we do an amazing job.</v>

1890
01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:10.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worship me.</v>

1891
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.040
<v Speaker 2>You're going to literally everyone in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the record companies like you owe us a</v>

1892
01:23:14.041 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 2>thank you and aren't we amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we talk to,</v>

1893
01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:17.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the,</v>

1894
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:18.910
<v Speaker 2>it's an inference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1895
01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:19.883
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>

1896
01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:21.450
<v Speaker 2>We did this look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1897
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.530
<v Speaker 2>what a great job we did for you and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>band.</v>

1898
01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.250
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1899
01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:25.390
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>

1900
01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:28.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second something goes wrong</v>

1901
01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.940
<v Speaker 2>is you're on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys need to figure this out.</v>

1902
01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.950
<v Speaker 2>We're just your record label.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't,</v>

1903
01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:34.960
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1904
01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:35.883
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1905
01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.650
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1906
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:39.070
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you get used to it.</v>

1907
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early days,</v>

1908
01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.970
<v Speaker 2>did they take a piece of your tour?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1909
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never have with us,</v>

1910
01:23:44.651 --> 01:23:47.620
<v Speaker 2>but they do know with young bands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is called a three 60 deal where</v>

1911
01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:48.980
<v Speaker 2>they take how much they take.</v>

1912
01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different for every band.</v>

1913
01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Every single band has to negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instance,</v>

1914
01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:57.700
<v Speaker 2>you know what's a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1915
01:23:57.860 --> 01:23:59.110
<v Speaker 2>One day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>

1916
01:23:59.111 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 2>20%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20%.</v>

1917
01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.830
<v Speaker 2>So they would take 20% of all your</v>
<v Speaker 2>touring.</v>

1918
01:24:03.190 --> 01:24:04.590
<v Speaker 2>So they would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you on Chimera,</v>

1919
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like the fifth person in the</v>

1920
01:24:06.821 --> 01:24:07.654
<v Speaker 2>band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1921
01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the merge your fucking tee shirts.</v>

1922
01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1923
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 2>They take everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty weird and pretty grim right</v>

1924
01:24:17.021 --> 01:24:19.090
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this is what's weird is like what are</v>

1925
01:24:19.091 --> 01:24:20.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what they're doing.</v>

1926
01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they do either.</v>

1927
01:24:22.211 --> 01:24:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to be honest,</v>

1928
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:27.970
<v Speaker 2>they're still trying to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 2>their rule can be in this new world.</v>

1929
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:29.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult for them.</v>

1930
01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1931
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.793
<v Speaker 2>Life is tough.</v>

1932
01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.560
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating time because this</v>
<v Speaker 3>digital thing that came along,</v>

1933
01:24:40.650 --> 01:24:42.630
<v Speaker 3>what's really interesting is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1934
01:24:42.631 --> 01:24:45.780
<v Speaker 3>we saw when the economy fell apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1935
01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:50.781
<v Speaker 3>We saw banks getting bailed out and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw these music companies going under.</v>

1936
01:24:52.081 --> 01:24:57.081
<v Speaker 3>We saw like a lot of issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of collapses and it's all because</v>

1937
01:24:57.331 --> 01:25:02.130
<v Speaker 3>of these emerging technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these emerging technologies also on</v>

1938
01:25:02.131 --> 01:25:04.350
<v Speaker 3>the flip side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it so much easier for people to</v>

1939
01:25:04.351 --> 01:25:05.230
<v Speaker 3>find out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1940
01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it slowly,</v>

1941
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I think things will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it will balance itself out</v>

1942
01:25:09.821 --> 01:25:10.840
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1943
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I think younger artists are going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>we smarter than we ever were and just</v>

1944
01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:14.981
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a minute.</v>

1945
01:25:14.981 --> 01:25:17.140
<v Speaker 2>We're not signing these rates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to?</v>

1946
01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Because there's no reason for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1947
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:21.460
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's so confusing to me.</v>

1948
01:25:21.461 --> 01:25:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Like giving away your merge and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>touring like unless they're booking the</v>

1949
01:25:25.931 --> 01:25:27.770
<v Speaker 2>tour for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they're acting.</v>

1950
01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:30.460
<v Speaker 2>See though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck are they getting a piece?</v>

1951
01:25:30.461 --> 01:25:32.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that's me.</v>

1952
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:35.680
<v Speaker 2>That's where an agent gets a piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they book it,</v>

1953
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:36.950
<v Speaker 2>they set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1954
01:25:36.951 --> 01:25:39.340
<v Speaker 2>they arranged the publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do all that.</v>

1955
01:25:39.341 --> 01:25:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they deserve a piece.</v>

1956
01:25:40.781 --> 01:25:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a business deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like did seems like they're just</v>

1957
01:25:43.121 --> 01:25:45.730
<v Speaker 2>stealing money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it seems a little bit like that.</v>

1958
01:25:45.731 --> 01:25:46.820
<v Speaker 2>I would agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what's,</v>

1959
01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:49.280
<v Speaker 2>what was like for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1960
01:25:49.281 --> 01:25:53.950
<v Speaker 2>in the art business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make 10% of everything we earn.</v>

1961
01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:58.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that what we can make a certain</v>

1962
01:25:58.631 --> 01:26:01.420
<v Speaker 2>amount of money and by the time we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid everybody,</v>

1963
01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 2>we'll take 10% home for all</v>

1964
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:08.020
<v Speaker 1>the band members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each band member gets 10% so 40% okay.</v>

1965
01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.880
<v Speaker 1>40% of what we make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not even taxes.</v>

1966
01:26:10.881 --> 01:26:12.560
<v Speaker 1>You're not even talking about todd</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about tax,</v>

1967
01:26:12.561 --> 01:26:14.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The decimate it put,</v>

1968
01:26:14.730 --> 01:26:16.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were decimated.</v>

1969
01:26:16.161 --> 01:26:21.161
<v Speaker 1>But we are one of the bands who don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pay a percentage of our tooting</v>

1970
01:26:21.651 --> 01:26:23.270
<v Speaker 1>and our marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're one of the bands who get a</v>

1971
01:26:23.271 --> 01:26:25.570
<v Speaker 1>very high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1972
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:30.020
<v Speaker 1>royalty on our records because we only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only give away a tiny,</v>

1973
01:26:30.021 --> 01:26:34.130
<v Speaker 1>tiny percentage of every record to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution company.</v>

1974
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:36.590
<v Speaker 1>So we're one of the lucky ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're always thinking,</v>

1975
01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:39.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is how it is for us,</v>

1976
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1977
01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:43.880
<v Speaker 1>for all these other young artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big thing about young artists,</v>

1978
01:26:43.881 --> 01:26:47.060
<v Speaker 1>they have to pretend that they're rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody has to drive around in a</v>

1979
01:26:47.061 --> 01:26:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Ferrari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a free hour watch on</v>

1980
01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:50.490
<v Speaker 1>your wrist.</v>

1981
01:26:50.490 --> 01:26:53.750
<v Speaker 1>You have to walk around like a baller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really reject all that and I think I</v>

1982
01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:57.740
<v Speaker 1>advise everybody else to reject it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're beginning to move towards</v>

1983
01:26:57.741 --> 01:27:02.741
<v Speaker 1>a new world order because the worshiping</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money we can sustain our lives and</v>

1984
01:27:02.901 --> 01:27:05.180
<v Speaker 1>our world that we things are right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1985
01:27:05.181 --> 01:27:08.960
<v Speaker 1>it comes from people being poor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to aspire to be rich.</v>

1986
01:27:08.961 --> 01:27:11.930
<v Speaker 1>And then once you make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sort of put that show on.</v>

1987
01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

1988
01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 1>but that's a huge thing in the rap</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

1989
01:27:15.111 --> 01:27:16.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With rappers,</v>

1990
01:27:16.821 --> 01:27:19.490
<v Speaker 1>it's almost mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very rare that someone bucks the</v>

1991
01:27:19.491 --> 01:27:22.370
<v Speaker 1>trend where they're not wearing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>jewelry and driving around a Bentley.</v>

1992
01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Although I feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1993
01:27:23.481 --> 01:27:24.960
<v Speaker 1>that's changing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1994
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.353
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1995
01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:29.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never fallen in love with those</v>

1996
01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:34.001
<v Speaker 1>kind of acts as far coats and limousines</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I dunno,</v>

1997
01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:35.240
<v Speaker 1>it's just not my style.</v>

1998
01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1999
01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:37.580
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2000
01:27:37.581 --> 01:27:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes from,</v>

2001
01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:42.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically deprived people that</v>

2002
01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:45.740
<v Speaker 1>finally break through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I understand it's always</v>

2003
01:27:45.741 --> 01:27:47.240
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

2004
01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:51.080
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like the fun part of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rap business.</v>

2005
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Like a big part of the fun part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2006
01:27:52.941 --> 01:27:57.650
<v Speaker 1>how many fucking rap songs are about</v>
<v Speaker 1>jewelry and diamonds and cars and</v>

2007
01:27:57.651 --> 01:28:00.740
<v Speaker 1>mansions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see when I was growing up,</v>

2008
01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.270
<v Speaker 1>as we were telling him about being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same age earlier on,</v>

2009
01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:09.010
<v Speaker 1>it was really uncool to talk about money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the cultural hurdles where we</v>

2010
01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.750
<v Speaker 1>didn't have money and would never talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about money.</v>

2011
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:15.590
<v Speaker 1>And actually often it was heartbreaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've discovered they were rich</v>

2012
01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:18.220
<v Speaker 1>because they were kind of our work in</v>
<v Speaker 1>men's huddles.</v>

2013
01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:19.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work in man heroes,</v>

2014
01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:22.840
<v Speaker 1>go back to Kurt Cobain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wore like converse all stars and</v>

2015
01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:25.850
<v Speaker 1>shipped up jeans and flannel shirts</v>
<v Speaker 1>farther back than that.</v>

2016
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:26.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2017
01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:28.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like John Lennon or somebody and they</v>

2018
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:30.470
<v Speaker 1>ran all these tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2019
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:34.400
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I was sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>indoctrinated in when I was growing up</v>

2020
01:28:34.710 --> 01:28:36.670
<v Speaker 1>or which I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's grateful for it.</v>

2021
01:28:36.671 --> 01:28:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be somebody who worships</v>

2022
01:28:39.021 --> 01:28:39.680
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2023
01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a foolish thing to worship because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2024
01:28:42.570 --> 01:28:45.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimately like what an artist is</v>

2025
01:28:45.411 --> 01:28:50.411
<v Speaker 1>doing is they're trying to express</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the most unique way</v>

2026
01:28:50.871 --> 01:28:52.640
<v Speaker 1>possible and connect with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2027
01:28:52.641 --> 01:28:54.770
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just trying to show the world</v>

2028
01:28:54.771 --> 01:28:57.440
<v Speaker 1>through your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to express yourself and if</v>

2029
01:28:57.441 --> 01:29:01.310
<v Speaker 1>all you're trying to express is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to stack checks,</v>

2030
01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.330
<v Speaker 1>stack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

2031
01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:05.270
<v Speaker 1>What do they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stack on deck when it,</v>

2032
01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.113
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

2033
01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Stacks on stacks on deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a big thing.</v>

2034
01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:12.270
<v Speaker 1>The wrappers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kids today talking about stacks,</v>

2035
01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Stefan decks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to,</v>

2036
01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.560
<v Speaker 1>just to have a little cushion.</v>

2037
01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:18.730
<v Speaker 1>It's always nice to have a coupon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2038
01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.900
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like these days are long</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

2039
01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.730
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you guys only get 10% then you</v>

2040
01:29:23.731 --> 01:29:27.810
<v Speaker 1>really stop and think about it all and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you pay taxes on the 10% I don't</v>

2041
01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:29.040
<v Speaker 1>think people understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2042
01:29:29.050 --> 01:29:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think people understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the same time.</v>

2043
01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody wants to hear a musician</v>
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>

2044
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know many people who live,</v>

2045
01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:41.520
<v Speaker 1>who will have very modest jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are wealthier than we are at this</v>

2046
01:29:41.521 --> 01:29:42.354
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2047
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:43.760
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2048
01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:45.770
<v Speaker 1>that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never became an artist because I want</v>

2049
01:29:45.771 --> 01:29:48.710
<v Speaker 1>it to be rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2050
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:53.750
<v Speaker 1>you would be so much happier being who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are then not being able to sing and</v>

2051
01:29:53.971 --> 01:29:55.650
<v Speaker 1>being wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2052
01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also have met a lot of rich people</v>

2053
01:29:57.991 --> 01:30:02.400
<v Speaker 1>in my team and they're miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So certainly can be chasing that very</v>

2054
01:30:02.401 --> 01:30:03.150
<v Speaker 1>isolated.</v>

2055
01:30:03.150 --> 01:30:07.020
<v Speaker 1>And I know I could count on my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have really rich people I</v>

2056
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:11.220
<v Speaker 1>know who live happy lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who seem like they know what to do with</v>

2057
01:30:11.221 --> 01:30:13.470
<v Speaker 1>their money and these people definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>are out there.</v>

2058
01:30:13.471 --> 01:30:16.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all the happy marriages,</v>

2059
01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:17.640
<v Speaker 1>happy kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced kids,</v>

2060
01:30:17.641 --> 01:30:19.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know when to have fun.</v>

2061
01:30:19.531 --> 01:30:20.820
<v Speaker 1>They know how to work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2062
01:30:20.821 --> 01:30:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're the exception to the rule.</v>

2063
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Super Rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth the pursuit is such a strange</v>

2064
01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:30.681
<v Speaker 1>pursuit because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes when you're pursuing wealth,</v>

2065
01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:34.920
<v Speaker 1>you're pursuing wealth at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is the ultimate goal is the</v>

2066
01:30:34.921 --> 01:30:38.790
<v Speaker 1>score that you put on the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the Gordon Gekko</v>

2067
01:30:38.791 --> 01:30:40.140
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greed is good.</v>

2068
01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Greed will protect me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2069
01:30:42.091 --> 01:30:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why people feel an,</v>

2070
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:49.020
<v Speaker 1>and they're not always wrong either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where money can protect you from a lot</v>

2071
01:30:49.021 --> 01:30:51.570
<v Speaker 1>of presidencies go to our president.</v>

2072
01:30:51.810 --> 01:30:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean our president is essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greed is good guy.</v>

2073
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean the he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is who he is.</v>

2074
01:30:57.031 --> 01:30:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2075
01:30:58.561 --> 01:31:02.460
<v Speaker 1>he has pursued wealth at all costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was also born into wealth a</v>

2076
01:31:02.461 --> 01:31:03.294
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2077
01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And then I think it was a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a substantial amount of</v>

2078
01:31:06.001 --> 01:31:07.530
<v Speaker 1>money he inherited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2079
01:31:07.531 --> 01:31:10.200
<v Speaker 1>he was given $2 million to start his</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

2080
01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:12.090
<v Speaker 1>his first business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he talks about it,</v>

2081
01:31:12.091 --> 01:31:15.900
<v Speaker 1>a small loan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small loans to small loan of $2 million.</v>

2082
01:31:15.901 --> 01:31:16.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2083
01:31:16.281 --> 01:31:16.861
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2084
01:31:16.861 --> 01:31:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he certainly has inherited quite a bit</v>

2085
01:31:20.101 --> 01:31:21.570
<v Speaker 1>of it would no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>

2086
01:31:21.571 --> 01:31:25.050
<v Speaker 1>But my point is that his philosophy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what he's always pursued his</v>

2087
01:31:25.051 --> 01:31:28.140
<v Speaker 1>extravagance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the big gold letters on the side of</v>

2088
01:31:28.141 --> 01:31:30.150
<v Speaker 1>the skyscrapers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his thing.</v>

2089
01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:32.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's a stain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2090
01:31:32.761 --> 01:31:37.530
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways it's a dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology for our country to aspire to.</v>

2091
01:31:37.531 --> 01:31:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody can't,</v>

2092
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:44.040
<v Speaker 1>you can attend that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what use then seeing two people who</v>

2093
01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:45.900
<v Speaker 1>have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who will never have that.</v>

2094
01:31:45.930 --> 01:31:48.780
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what leaves me in great</v>
<v Speaker 1>dismay.</v>

2095
01:31:48.781 --> 01:31:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I understand the pursuit of money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic wellbeing.</v>

2096
01:31:52.621 --> 01:31:56.850
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like what did we then see to the</v>

2097
01:31:56.851 --> 01:31:59.020
<v Speaker 1>people that don't have that and never</v>
<v Speaker 1>will have that,</v>

2098
01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.730
<v Speaker 1>that has to be something</v>

2099
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.460
<v Speaker 2>else other than the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2100
01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hollow pursuit.</v>

2101
01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.090
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a pursuit that's like,</v>

2102
01:32:06.091 --> 01:32:08.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not examined closely enough for</v>
<v Speaker 3>four.</v>

2103
01:32:08.571 --> 01:32:11.250
<v Speaker 3>It's hollow ness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's a word.</v>

2104
01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:14.610
<v Speaker 3>I was having a conversation once with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this friend of mine who is,</v>

2105
01:32:14.611 --> 01:32:16.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is pretty radical black guy,</v>

2106
01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:22.280
<v Speaker 3>a pretty radical African American and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just very proud of African American</v>

2107
01:32:22.501 --> 01:32:23.730
<v Speaker 3>heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

2108
01:32:23.731 --> 01:32:26.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went on this thing about how black</v>

2109
01:32:26.491 --> 01:32:28.200
<v Speaker 3>people used to be kings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2110
01:32:28.201 --> 01:32:30.030
<v Speaker 3>we were kings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand that?</v>

2111
01:32:30.031 --> 01:32:31.710
<v Speaker 3>I go stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2112
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:35.340
<v Speaker 3>can't everybody can't be a king because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see if you have a bunch of kings,</v>

2113
01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:37.890
<v Speaker 3>like to be a king has to be a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2114
01:32:37.891 --> 01:32:40.680
<v Speaker 3>That means you're dominating people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't kings.</v>

2115
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:43.350
<v Speaker 3>That's not a proud thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you gotta stop saying that.</v>

2116
01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Like you say it's the wrong thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

2117
01:32:46.771 --> 01:32:49.170
<v Speaker 3>but it's the thought process is his in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

2118
01:32:49.171 --> 01:32:51.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had examined it like his in his idea,</v>

2119
01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:54.390
<v Speaker 3>like at one point in time we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>Africans,</v>

2120
01:32:54.391 --> 01:32:55.390
<v Speaker 3>we were kings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

2121
01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.330
<v Speaker 3>we were on top and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2122
01:32:57.331 --> 01:32:58.650
<v Speaker 3>slavery and all this other stuff.</v>

2123
01:32:58.890 --> 01:32:59.671
<v Speaker 3>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2124
01:32:59.671 --> 01:33:03.540
<v Speaker 3>his thought process was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>convoluted and by saying we were kings,</v>

2125
01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.670
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be a fucking king man.</v>

2126
01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody should be a fucking king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should be zero kings and you definitely</v>

2127
01:33:09.331 --> 01:33:11.550
<v Speaker 3>don't want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were kings like we can be kings</v>

2128
01:33:11.551 --> 01:33:13.020
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like don't be a king.</v>

2129
01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:14.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be king.</v>

2130
01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be a queen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2131
01:33:15.571 --> 01:33:18.690
<v Speaker 3>it's a big thing with fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some fighters call himself king,</v>

2132
01:33:18.691 --> 01:33:21.270
<v Speaker 3>this king that they like to part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their name.</v>

2133
01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:23.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird,</v>

2134
01:33:24.090 --> 01:33:27.300
<v Speaker 3>it's only African American guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know any white guys call himself</v>

2135
01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:27.811
<v Speaker 3>king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2136
01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:29.050
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

2137
01:33:29.130 --> 01:33:30.510
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>platers white fighters.</v>

2138
01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:32.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about know about that</v>

2139
01:33:32.161 --> 01:33:34.140
<v Speaker 3>world with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bobby King,</v>

2140
01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:35.870
<v Speaker 3>Greene King Bobby Green,</v>
<v Speaker 3>King Mo.</v>

2141
01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:39.240
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know like five or six King Kevin</v>

2142
01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Casey.</v>

2143
01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:44.510
<v Speaker 2>When you feel that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a disadvantage and us as society,</v>

2144
01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:47.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>words are powerful and they can,</v>

2145
01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:52.490
<v Speaker 2>the words we tell ourselves are really</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful and perhaps you can manifest a</v>

2146
01:33:52.491 --> 01:33:55.760
<v Speaker 2>power that you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some times we all need it.</v>

2147
01:33:55.761 --> 01:33:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I know I need it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2148
01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:00.710
<v Speaker 2>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think to yourself,</v>

2149
01:34:00.711 --> 01:34:02.690
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to remember what you have done,</v>

2150
01:34:02.691 --> 01:34:04.130
<v Speaker 2>what you've accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you are,</v>

2151
01:34:04.131 --> 01:34:05.510
<v Speaker 2>who your mother is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2152
01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a lot to be said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess for sure,</v>

2153
01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:11.450
<v Speaker 2>for the casual use of certain words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're right.</v>

2154
01:34:11.451 --> 01:34:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we continue to use these words,</v>

2155
01:34:15.891 --> 01:34:17.120
<v Speaker 2>we have to examine their meaning.</v>

2156
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:18.183
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>

2157
01:34:18.210 --> 01:34:20.650
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the,</v>

2158
01:34:20.651 --> 01:34:24.550
<v Speaker 3>the wealth at all costs is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a foolish pursuit that people look at</v>

2159
01:34:24.551 --> 01:34:26.380
<v Speaker 3>when they don't have the wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2160
01:34:26.381 --> 01:34:29.590
<v Speaker 3>that's when it becomes an attractive</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is the idea that,</v>

2161
01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just got to get that paper.</v>

2162
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2163
01:34:31.710 --> 01:34:34.140
<v Speaker 2>When you've got the wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the greediest people are the</v>

2164
01:34:34.141 --> 01:34:35.790
<v Speaker 2>people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got shitloads of money.</v>

2165
01:34:35.791 --> 01:34:40.530
<v Speaker 2>That's why we see a lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people with money wanting to cut</v>

2166
01:34:40.531 --> 01:34:43.020
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have their tuxes cut rather than inject</v>

2167
01:34:43.021 --> 01:34:44.880
<v Speaker 2>some taxes into the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2168
01:34:44.881 --> 01:34:49.881
<v Speaker 2>I'd much rather live in a more pleasant</v>
<v Speaker 2>community then sit in my golden tower by</v>

2169
01:34:50.371 --> 01:34:52.770
<v Speaker 2>myself with like riots going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

2170
01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:56.300
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if you make everybody happy</v>

2171
01:34:56.301 --> 01:34:57.134
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2172
01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:58.400
<v Speaker 2>you can still be rich,</v>

2173
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:01.220
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a nicer garden</v>
<v Speaker 1>to we'll cut into.</v>

2174
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good attitude.</v>

2175
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a weird game that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>play where it becomes just about getting</v>

2176
01:35:07.551 --> 01:35:10.520
<v Speaker 1>those points up on the board and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>become,</v>

2177
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:13.010
<v Speaker 1>the numbers become meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't sing.</v>

2178
01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't think I have $30 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't spend this.</v>

2179
01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:18.830
<v Speaker 1>This is if I live a normal life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

2180
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:21.260
<v Speaker 1>They don't think that they think I need</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 million.</v>

2181
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I need an island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a jet.</v>

2182
01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.110
<v Speaker 1>How much is enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>babe?</v>

2183
01:35:24.670 --> 01:35:26.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much is enough.</v>

2184
01:35:26.001 --> 01:35:30.260
<v Speaker 1>And of course the more you accumulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more your expenses are and the more</v>

2185
01:35:30.261 --> 01:35:32.930
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just goes on and on and on and on.</v>

2186
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:36.200
<v Speaker 1>There's an amazing radio lab podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's out now about,</v>

2187
01:35:36.250 --> 01:35:37.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie madoff.</v>

2188
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a show coming to narrows playing</v>

2189
01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:42.853
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

2190
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:45.890
<v Speaker 1>She's still hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fuck gotta be 80,</v>

2191
01:35:45.891 --> 01:35:49.100
<v Speaker 1>90 years old now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is still so beautiful,</v>

2192
01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:50.510
<v Speaker 1>so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2193
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:53.040
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking forward to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sorry.</v>

2194
01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.690
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's just,</v>

2195
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:56.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2196
01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:00.050
<v Speaker 1>the interview him and you get to hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>him talk and the,</v>

2197
01:36:00.051 --> 01:36:02.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reporter called him in jail and it's</v>

2198
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:06.050
<v Speaker 1>a really fascinating way they had their</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate because they're only allowed</v>

2199
01:36:06.051 --> 01:36:08.960
<v Speaker 1>to communicate for 15 minutes and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to,</v>

2200
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:11.720
<v Speaker 1>the phone is disconnected and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to wait 15 minutes for,</v>

2201
01:36:11.721 --> 01:36:13.970
<v Speaker 1>they can reconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's doing this.</v>

2202
01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the rules of the prison.</v>

2203
01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:17.480
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2204
01:36:17.481 --> 01:36:21.110
<v Speaker 1>he's in there for it ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never getting out of that fucking</v>

2205
01:36:21.250 --> 01:36:22.490
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2206
01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:26.840
<v Speaker 1>But it's fascinating when you hear him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has zero empathy.</v>

2207
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

2208
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:31.010
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird hearing him talk about these</v>

2209
01:36:31.011 --> 01:36:34.040
<v Speaker 1>people that he ripped off and finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>these like,</v>

2210
01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:35.120
<v Speaker 1>oh they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fine.</v>

2211
01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:36.100
<v Speaker 1>These people that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2212
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:38.900
<v Speaker 1>they had money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're not,</v>

2213
01:36:38.901 --> 01:36:41.420
<v Speaker 1>it's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're listening to the way this</v>

2214
01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:45.140
<v Speaker 1>guy sort of rationalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he is essentially the poster boy for</v>

2215
01:36:45.141 --> 01:36:47.750
<v Speaker 1>that greed at all costs because he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2216
01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:50.690
<v Speaker 1>it was running a Ponzi scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stealing money from people.</v>

2217
01:36:50.710 --> 01:36:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

2218
01:36:51.921 --> 01:36:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I was again talking about this with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband.</v>

2219
01:36:53.721 --> 01:36:56.180
<v Speaker 1>They really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we were talking about what is the</v>

2220
01:36:56.181 --> 01:36:58.730
<v Speaker 1>difference between a Republican and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrat?</v>

2221
01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Like what is essentially the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know lots,</v>

2222
01:37:03.291 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I have very good friends who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans who I respect enormously</v>

2223
01:37:06.381 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2224
01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:11.180
<v Speaker 1>they have taught me a lot and they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed the way I view the world and so</v>

2225
01:37:11.181 --> 01:37:15.410
<v Speaker 1>on so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But essentially I wonder is it that</v>

2226
01:37:15.411 --> 01:37:20.411
<v Speaker 1>Democrats are able to utilize their</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination in an an a republican is</v>

2227
01:37:21.081 --> 01:37:22.250
<v Speaker 1>less imaginative.</v>

2228
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:23.683
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2229
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:25.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm using it light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no answers.</v>

2230
01:37:25.641 --> 01:37:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm just curious about what drives</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone towards the left and what drives</v>

2231
01:37:30.161 --> 01:37:34.670
<v Speaker 1>someone towards the right because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly know that one site is good and</v>

2232
01:37:34.671 --> 01:37:37.820
<v Speaker 1>one side is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One side is really smart and the other</v>

2233
01:37:37.821 --> 01:37:39.890
<v Speaker 1>side isn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing to do with that.</v>

2234
01:37:39.891 --> 01:37:44.891
<v Speaker 1>So what is it that drives us towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>these embattled positions that are the</v>

2235
01:37:46.590 --> 01:37:49.550
<v Speaker 1>ins right now in America seems saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>acute,</v>

2236
01:37:50.090 --> 01:37:52.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there just seems to be new marriage of</v>

2237
01:37:52.101 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>the two sites and I'd love to know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew about how</v>

2238
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.180
<v Speaker 2>that all works.</v>

2239
01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I think people are very easily</v>
<v Speaker 3>influenced.</v>

2240
01:37:59.350 --> 01:38:01.960
<v Speaker 3>I think people are very tribal and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think people,</v>

2241
01:38:01.961 --> 01:38:05.170
<v Speaker 3>it's very easy to influence someone to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get them to adopt a predetermined</v>

2242
01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.230
<v Speaker 3>pattern of thinking and if that</v>
<v Speaker 3>predetermined pattern of thinking is</v>

2243
01:38:08.231 --> 01:38:11.290
<v Speaker 3>right wing or left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're around those people and you</v>

2244
01:38:11.291 --> 01:38:15.220
<v Speaker 3>seek social status by committing to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain ideology,</v>

2245
01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:18.010
<v Speaker 3>you get embedded in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a part of your thinking,</v>

2246
01:38:18.011 --> 01:38:21.130
<v Speaker 3>becomes a part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that is the pattern that you</v>

2247
01:38:21.190 --> 01:38:22.630
<v Speaker 3>bore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You dig deep,</v>

2248
01:38:22.631 --> 01:38:25.510
<v Speaker 3>you dig deep trenches in terms of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology.</v>

2249
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:30.400
<v Speaker 3>You dig deep trenches in your mind that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are unwavering and whether there are</v>

2250
01:38:30.401 --> 01:38:33.220
<v Speaker 3>left wing or right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes very problematic when you</v>

2251
01:38:33.221 --> 01:38:36.160
<v Speaker 3>have two teams like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about Holland the other</v>

2252
01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.810
<v Speaker 3>day that Hollande has something like 17</v>
<v Speaker 3>different parties that viable parties,</v>

2253
01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unlike what we have where we have this</v>

2254
01:38:42.791 --> 01:38:43.510
<v Speaker 3>one too.</v>

2255
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:46.630
<v Speaker 3>And then we have a few joke parties like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Green party that no one takes</v>

2256
01:38:46.631 --> 01:38:48.580
<v Speaker 3>seriously libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody takes seriously,</v>

2257
01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:53.320
<v Speaker 3>they never even come close to winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you have one or two and one of</v>

2258
01:38:53.321 --> 01:38:56.650
<v Speaker 3>them is conservative and one of them is</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>

2259
01:38:56.651 --> 01:39:01.651
<v Speaker 3>it just automatically people identify</v>
<v Speaker 3>with one or the other and they,</v>

2260
01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.410
<v Speaker 3>whether it's from upbringing or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>community that they're attached to or</v>

2261
01:39:05.411 --> 01:39:08.650
<v Speaker 3>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or life experiences past positive or</v>

2262
01:39:08.651 --> 01:39:10.750
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just immediately gravitate towards</v>

2263
01:39:10.751 --> 01:39:14.050
<v Speaker 3>one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They dig in and then they start talking</v>

2264
01:39:14.051 --> 01:39:16.450
<v Speaker 3>shit about the left or they started</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking shit about the right.</v>

2265
01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:19.720
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got salon.com and you've got Fox</v>

2266
01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.780
<v Speaker 3>News and everybody's lobbing bombs at</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and it's just fucking weird.</v>

2267
01:39:22.781 --> 01:39:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2268
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Why have we not seen any break?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I get that.</v>

2269
01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I understand on a,</v>

2270
01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:31.140
<v Speaker 2>totally agree with what you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that generally that is what occurs,</v>

2271
01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:35.340
<v Speaker 2>but surely on both sides of the fence</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have free thinkers.</v>

2272
01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:37.580
<v Speaker 2>There must be a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more now.</v>

2273
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:39.480
<v Speaker 3>I think there's more now than ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

2274
01:39:39.481 --> 01:39:44.481
<v Speaker 3>but this is a very weird time in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of trump and trump winning because he's,</v>

2275
01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.120
<v Speaker 3>he's sort of engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The like they,</v>

2276
01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:52.710
<v Speaker 3>they've sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of people that are not</v>

2277
01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:57.240
<v Speaker 3>necessarily political that are really</v>
<v Speaker 3>into being a right wing or now it's</v>

2278
01:39:57.241 --> 01:40:01.110
<v Speaker 3>almost like online trolls and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just like to be a part of a team</v>

2279
01:40:01.111 --> 01:40:04.290
<v Speaker 3>and they just like to fuck with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call snowflakes are liberals.</v>

2280
01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.300
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird time.</v>

2281
01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:09.930
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like the gold water</v>

2282
01:40:09.931 --> 01:40:12.170
<v Speaker 3>republican days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I think we,</v>

2283
01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:15.090
<v Speaker 3>we need to have like bad examples that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to go,</v>

2284
01:40:15.091 --> 01:40:16.540
<v Speaker 3>well let's not do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2285
01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:17.580
<v Speaker 3>And then collectively</v>

2286
01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:19.590
<v Speaker 2>the arc of history is long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2287
01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:23.230
<v Speaker 2>And the age of the world is infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2288
01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.620
<v Speaker 3>But the America's young as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2289
01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:29.460
<v Speaker 3>and that's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this weird new experiment in self</v>

2290
01:40:29.461 --> 01:40:32.010
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really only been going on for a few</v>

2291
01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:32.610
<v Speaker 3>hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2292
01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:35.130
<v Speaker 3>And it's easy to look at a few hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>years as being a long time,</v>

2293
01:40:35.131 --> 01:40:36.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's really not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

2294
01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:38.580
<v Speaker 3>Especially you guys in Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2295
01:40:38.581 --> 01:40:39.750
<v Speaker 3>you guys have been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd</v>

2296
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:42.510
<v Speaker 2>be the right fucking braveheart days and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2297
01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:43.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

2298
01:40:43.311 --> 01:40:46.380
<v Speaker 2>the thing about the free press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what worries me as a foreigner</v>

2299
01:40:46.381 --> 01:40:48.660
<v Speaker 2>living in this country and seeing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2300
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:51.570
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this surface stuff that's being spewed</v>

2301
01:40:51.571 --> 01:40:54.820
<v Speaker 2>about the free press is worrisome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worrisome.</v>

2302
01:40:54.930 --> 01:40:56.260
<v Speaker 3>It comes from the president himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:57.041
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of,</v>

2304
01:40:57.041 --> 01:40:57.491
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2305
01:40:57.491 --> 01:40:58.810
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only been two presidents,</v>

2306
01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:01.450
<v Speaker 3>our history that have actually gone to</v>
<v Speaker 3>war with the press,</v>

2307
01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:03.880
<v Speaker 3>and one of them was Richard Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2308
01:41:03.881 --> 01:41:08.470
<v Speaker 3>this is just so unprecedented time that</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone disrespects the idea of the</v>

2309
01:41:08.471 --> 01:41:10.990
<v Speaker 3>press and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and news.</v>

2310
01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.080
<v Speaker 2>This is where people can challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody likes getting challenged.</v>

2311
01:41:15.081 --> 01:41:16.730
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel very nice when somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

2312
01:41:16.731 --> 01:41:17.660
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with you.</v>

2313
01:41:17.661 --> 01:41:19.400
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2314
01:41:19.401 --> 01:41:23.510
<v Speaker 2>aren't we all at the point where we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to at least listen and start</v>

2315
01:41:23.511 --> 01:41:24.470
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2316
01:41:24.471 --> 01:41:26.090
<v Speaker 2>But it's very scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2317
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a dictator in a lot of ways.</v>

2318
01:41:28.171 --> 01:41:28.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2319
01:41:28.741 --> 01:41:32.130
<v Speaker 3>and then he was challenged the other day</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by cbs they were asking them about</v>

2320
01:41:32.131 --> 01:41:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Obama wiretapping and the lie that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>made up.</v>

2321
01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:37.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he wound up a multi,</v>

2322
01:41:37.171 --> 01:41:39.510
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some you say he could say it was</v>

2323
01:41:39.511 --> 01:41:41.760
<v Speaker 3>a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some validity to it,</v>

2324
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:44.730
<v Speaker 3>whether it was some surveillance being</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

2325
01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:47.850
<v Speaker 3>but whether or not it was Obama or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's standard</v>

2326
01:41:47.851 --> 01:41:51.210
<v Speaker 3>surveillance at the NSA has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>perpetrating for a long time,</v>

2327
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:53.760
<v Speaker 3>which I think was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more that the ne,</v>

2328
01:41:53.761 --> 01:41:55.950
<v Speaker 3>I think fucking everybody's getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>spied on.</v>

2329
01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:57.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's really what's going on.</v>

2330
01:41:57.870 --> 01:42:01.860
<v Speaker 3>So you can say I'm being spied on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be correct.</v>

2331
01:42:01.890 --> 01:42:05.190
<v Speaker 3>But you say Obama spying on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's correct.</v>

2332
01:42:05.191 --> 01:42:06.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the interview,</v>

2333
01:42:07.210 --> 01:42:07.470
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2334
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:08.940
<v Speaker 3>He walked out when they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenging.</v>

2335
01:42:08.970 --> 01:42:10.620
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like being challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like,</v>

2336
01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:12.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't like anybody questioning him</v>

2337
01:42:12.811 --> 01:42:15.300
<v Speaker 3>and he feels like he could just leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't feel like the press is</v>

2338
01:42:15.301 --> 01:42:16.890
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He feels like he's got a strong enough</v>

2339
01:42:16.891 --> 01:42:21.630
<v Speaker 3>base and all these people that will just</v>
<v Speaker 3>yell out fake news.</v>

2340
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:25.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's made this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of meme when he pointed that</v>

2341
01:42:25.651 --> 01:42:27.420
<v Speaker 3>CNN guy and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are fake news.</v>

2342
01:42:27.421 --> 01:42:29.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is,</v>

2343
01:42:29.431 --> 01:42:34.410
<v Speaker 3>this is a scary time for any disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think in some ways that's good.</v>

2344
01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:37.470
<v Speaker 3>And this is why I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we need,</v>

2345
01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:42.000
<v Speaker 3>as human beings need resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need something to push back against.</v>

2346
01:42:42.010 --> 01:42:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it helps us,</v>

2347
01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.910
<v Speaker 3>it helps us sort of reinvigorate our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2348
01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.740
<v Speaker 3>our collective ideas and re</v>
<v Speaker 3>reinvigorate,</v>

2349
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:53.250
<v Speaker 3>knowing now that this is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know that was possible before.</v>

2350
01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't think he was gonna win.</v>

2351
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:56.130
<v Speaker 3>And if we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he did,</v>

2352
01:42:56.131 --> 01:42:57.870
<v Speaker 3>when Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't think he was gonna win like</v>

2353
01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.520
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you didn't think that he was going</v>

2354
01:42:59.521 --> 01:43:03.480
<v Speaker 3>to sort of dismantle the EPA and do all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these different things he's doing</v>

2355
01:43:03.481 --> 01:43:05.940
<v Speaker 3>tikkaway the fucking satellites they use</v>
<v Speaker 3>for climate.</v>

2356
01:43:06.690 --> 01:43:09.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of shit that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on that's very problematic to</v>

2357
01:43:09.931 --> 01:43:13.980
<v Speaker 3>science and scientists and they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>being really frustrated right now.</v>

2358
01:43:14.130 --> 01:43:16.350
<v Speaker 3>So now they know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they know and now we know.</v>

2359
01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:17.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree.</v>

2360
01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:18.790
<v Speaker 2>And I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2361
01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:23.740
<v Speaker 2>the US press since September 11th have</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

2362
01:43:23.890 --> 01:43:28.750
<v Speaker 2>the standard of journalism has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>sliding know for a decade if not longer.</v>

2363
01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:34.090
<v Speaker 2>And now all of a sudden journalists are</v>
<v Speaker 2>being held to account and they are</v>

2364
01:43:34.091 --> 01:43:37.600
<v Speaker 2>having to step up their game again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is great for the American</v>

2365
01:43:37.601 --> 01:43:40.330
<v Speaker 2>people to have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy good journalism.</v>

2366
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:41.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

2367
01:43:42.010 --> 01:43:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we managed to take something</v>

2368
01:43:43.931 --> 01:43:44.950
<v Speaker 2>relatively,</v>

2369
01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:47.460
<v Speaker 3>I think it's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to think it is.</v>

2370
01:43:47.461 --> 01:43:49.710
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the same thing that's kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of happened to the music business.</v>

2371
01:43:49.711 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I think journalism experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this new wave of media and information</v>

2372
01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.730
<v Speaker 3>being distributed by anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a breitbart or anyone who</v>

2373
01:43:58.731 --> 01:44:01.550
<v Speaker 3>just creates a blog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just starts pump pumping out their</v>

2374
01:44:01.551 --> 01:44:02.880
<v Speaker 3>agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huffington Post's,</v>

2375
01:44:02.881 --> 01:44:04.430
<v Speaker 3>salon.com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

2376
01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:09.260
<v Speaker 3>they become these aggregates for news</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they feel fits with their agenda,</v>

2377
01:44:09.261 --> 01:44:11.300
<v Speaker 3>the agenda that they would like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>promote and push.</v>

2378
01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:14.540
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's full left wing,</v>

2379
01:44:14.541 --> 01:44:19.040
<v Speaker 3>like a salon.com or full right wing like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Breitbart,</v>

2380
01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:22.250
<v Speaker 3>both of them are problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where the New York Times is</v>

2381
01:44:22.251 --> 01:44:23.084
<v Speaker 3>to really step up.</v>

2382
01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're trying to,</v>

2383
01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2384
01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they are.</v>

2385
01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2386
01:44:27.391 --> 01:44:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird times,</v>

2387
01:44:28.981 --> 01:44:31.020
<v Speaker 1>but we're times create great art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2388
01:44:31.021 --> 01:44:33.180
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really creates good people too.</v>

2389
01:44:33.210 --> 01:44:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Like it's good for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you were saying earlier on</v>

2390
01:44:36.841 --> 01:44:38.850
<v Speaker 1>this is really too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when people are tested,</v>

2391
01:44:38.851 --> 01:44:43.260
<v Speaker 1>that's when you see them at their best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pressure creates diamonds.</v>

2392
01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stealing that from my mine.</v>

2393
01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.630
<v Speaker 1>He's still it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2394
01:44:47.631 --> 01:44:50.010
<v Speaker 1>It's the old term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's good.</v>

2395
01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

2396
01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:55.020
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's legit working for fund in here on</v>

2397
01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:58.320
<v Speaker 1>our loins and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of,</v>

2398
01:44:58.330 --> 01:44:59.760
<v Speaker 1>lot of things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2399
01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:01.560
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2400
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:02.423
<v Speaker 1>so do you?</v>

2401
01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:03.273
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

2402
01:45:03.490 --> 01:45:04.510
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2403
01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:09.310
<v Speaker 3>where can people find out tour</v>
<v Speaker 3>information and garbage is your twitter</v>

2404
01:45:09.311 --> 01:45:11.050
<v Speaker 3>handle and does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you handle all that?</v>

2405
01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Do you do that stuff</v>

2406
01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.500
<v Speaker 1>for the most part I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try and I didn't like the feeling of</v>

2407
01:45:15.501 --> 01:45:17.650
<v Speaker 1>some dip tending to be me and putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>words into my mouth.</v>

2408
