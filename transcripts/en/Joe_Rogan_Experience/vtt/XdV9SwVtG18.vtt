1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Can we go for three to Henry Rollins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>how are you fella?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm better now being here with you.</v>

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.853
<v Speaker 1>I'm better now that you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about a show that </v>

4
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>you've got you and Ted nugent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently someone.</v>

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Did someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you pitch it?</v>

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Who pitched the show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an idea that uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>my manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi and I came up with,</v>

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.460
<v Speaker 1>well mostly Heidi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>it was called basically Henry and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put me and someone I might have some</v>

10
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.314
<v Speaker 1>disagreements with or a few agreements </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and we just go somewhere and we </v>

11
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:35.814
<v Speaker 1>weigh in with a camera following us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're thinking what it'll be like a six </v>

12
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>part mini series like me and plus six </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting people.</v>

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>And one of the names that came up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ted nugent because I,</v>

14
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.403
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of his music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is one of the best guitar </v>

15
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>players I've ever seen yet.</v>

16
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>He and I would probably disagree on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a few topics.</v>

17
00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.663
<v Speaker 1>And so we actually picked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitched it to Ted who said he loved the </v>

18
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said,</v>

19
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm busy with a,</v>

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>he had a ton of tour dates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's on now,</v>

21
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>but he said I want to talk to henry to </v>
<v Speaker 1>thank him for thinking of me.</v>

22
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.723
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so ted called like on my phone in </v>

23
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he got my number from the powers</v>

24
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>that be and suddenly it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Ted on my phone.</v>

25
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm at my desk like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

26
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:27.984
<v Speaker 1>this is surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we talked for a few minutes and he </v>

27
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:35.364
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

29
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bad guy.</v>

30
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

31
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things you say,</v>

32
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:42.804
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of takes my breath away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we quickly got on the topic of </v>

33
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

34
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like all that old Detroit music?</v>

35
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitch Ryder the stooges,</v>

37
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.060

<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of the best.</v>

38
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Some of the best music I've ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

39
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>as far I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

40
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is something in the water?</v>

41
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>What is it with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michigan guys?</v>

42
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And Guitar Tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no one gets tone like you,</v>

43
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ashton stooges,</v>

44
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Fred Sonic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smith,</v>

45
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>MC five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

46
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

47
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>you're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

48
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>you gotta we gotta hang out some time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll just talk about music.</v>

49
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that with you.</v>

50
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>So I'll be taking notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was just telling me,</v>

51
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

52
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to hang out at the MC five house</v>

53
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>and go see the stooges and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're killing me because this is like,</v>

54
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:32.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

55
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.213
<v Speaker 1>that would have been heaven for me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see those bands like back in 1969 or </v>

56
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

57
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you know him?</v>

58
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Did you know him back in the day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only recently as a punter.</v>

59
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.063
<v Speaker 1>I would go see him like in high school </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 18 seventies to Neil Carter </v>

60
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go see him at play in my local arena</v>

61
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>in Washington dc in a place called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital center in Largo,</v>

62
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was as good as rock'n'roll gets.</v>

63
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the,</v>

64
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>the double life Gonzo lineup and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget it.</v>

65
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>It was like two and a half hours of just</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting beat up by music.</v>

66
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:08.044
<v Speaker 1>It was fantastic and to this day it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still a high watermark as far as gigs </v>

67
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.733
<v Speaker 1>and in the nineties I met him on </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically incorrect Bill Maher and I </v>

68
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

69
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he gave me a bowhunting catalog.</v>

70
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.173
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

71
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for his whack master,</v>

72
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the croquet mallet and the.</v>

73
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept it,</v>

74
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.583
<v Speaker 1>I tell them a fan and then I met him </v>
<v Speaker 1>years later and I did this radio show </v>

75
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:41.194
<v Speaker 1>like St Patrick's Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1997 to Kressley promote my next record </v>

76
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.963
<v Speaker 1>and I said we met years ago and we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talking for like a couple of hours </v>

77
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just about music and I played him</v>

78
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>some of my new record which you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked and he,</v>

79
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>between the commercial breaks he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like playing riffs for me.</v>

80
00:03:58.301 --> 00:03:59.134
<v Speaker 1>We had little headphone amp and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting across from me on a stool </v>

81
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>playing and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is pretty cool.</v>

82
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the kind of relationship I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have with him where I,</v>

83
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read some of the things he says,</v>

84
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:12.041
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

85
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>that's really hard to take and but those</v>
<v Speaker 1>records are,</v>

86
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.683
<v Speaker 1>they're just so good to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw him play in 2000 opening for </v>

87
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>kiss 2001 somewhere in there.</v>

88
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>And he was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

89
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>The tone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the playing just fantastic.</v>

90
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>And so he's just an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of guys,</v>

91
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

92
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Cause like he can finish a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

93
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not stupid.</v>

94
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a steel trap memory.</v>

95
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.250
<v Speaker 1>But then he'll just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>the Obama's as subhuman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmong girl,</v>

97
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:46.961
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

98
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to talk like that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people you will inspire to punch</v>

99
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>some black guy in the parking lot for no</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

100
00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Like something bad could happen if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk like that to the millions of people</v>

101
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:01.204
<v Speaker 1>who love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like someone will get that message and </v>

102
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>they'll go south with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're in that position,</v>

103
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:06.874
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in self censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you should be careful of </v>

104
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:11.914
<v Speaker 1>what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some merit in having </v>

105
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 1>some control of yourself.</v>

106
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't completely understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

107
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 1>this currency and outrageousness that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

108
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>And you cash in by being the God that </v>
<v Speaker 1>says things he can't.</v>

109
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.693
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe what he just said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you become the guy that goes </v>

110
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>places that says things that no one can </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that you're saying.</v>

111
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

112
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.534
<v Speaker 1>I know that there's some people that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they get their next book deal or </v>

113
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.123
<v Speaker 1>for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never want to trade in that </v>

115
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.183
<v Speaker 1>because my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my reality coming up through punk rock </v>

116
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:45.484
<v Speaker 1>and all of that is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very immediate in that I don't say </v>

117
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>anything about anybody without expecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to hear it.</v>

118
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And with me turning the next corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like going to my car in your parking lot</v>

119
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>and having that</v>

120
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 2>person waiting for me at the car saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

121
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.173
<v Speaker 2>you said this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And having the meal to hold it up on a </v>

122
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.903
<v Speaker 2>tablet and say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I watch what I say because in my </v>

123
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 2>mind I answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will have to answer to all of it.</v>

124
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>And so I would never say something where</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone going really well,</v>

125
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:22.991
<v Speaker 2>today's the day we're going to see who </v>
<v Speaker 2>can kick his ass because you know,</v>

126
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 2>men have this wrong idea that they can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be beat.</v>

127
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone could get knocked on their ass.</v>

128
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 2>You think you're tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always,</v>

129
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the business of tough guys.</v>

130
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.190
<v Speaker 2>There's always a tougher guy around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner of guy.</v>

131
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 2>But more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you don't,</v>

132
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 2>most of the conflict that you get and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk and shit about somebody,</v>

133
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:40.874
<v Speaker 2>like someone like you or I can do an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview and talk shit about someone </v>

134
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 2>and didn't go public and you don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice about it.</v>

135
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.633
<v Speaker 2>But then now it extends to social media </v>
<v Speaker 2>and potentially anybody could do it at </v>

136
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 2>any time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just seems so easy to do.</v>

137
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 2>But I always tried to think if that </v>
<v Speaker 2>person was in front of me,</v>

138
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 2>how is that treated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I would,</v>

139
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.140
<v Speaker 2>if I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this guy,</v>

140
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:02.160
<v Speaker 2>like when he's in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then this is,</v>

141
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I have a real problem with this person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real bad.</v>

142
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.253
<v Speaker 2>I would always wait until I was in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that person and I have waited and </v>

143
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 2>bided my time with people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

144
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 2>And you get into a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all I have said,</v>

145
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very calmly,</v>

146
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're ridiculous person.</v>

147
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I think you're a standing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking,</v>

148
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.253
<v Speaker 2>talking billboard for cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that people need to hear that </v>

149
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:24.584
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because sometimes people don't hear </v>

150
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't hear that from someone.</v>

151
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to help the guy but </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe me.</v>

152
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.800
<v Speaker 2>But I waited until I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only people I'll rip on it,</v>

153
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:37.603
<v Speaker 2>our politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some member of Congress I think is </v>

154
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:43.030
<v Speaker 2>just an inactive waste of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

155
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.370
<v Speaker 2>that'll say anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping it'll bring him to me.</v>

156
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 2>So I can say it to his or her face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part,</v>

157
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.563
<v Speaker 2>the way I was brought up in the world of</v>
<v Speaker 2>music and the street is if you say </v>

158
00:07:58.731 --> 00:07:59.564
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy will be lining you up for a </v>

159
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.014
<v Speaker 2>broken jaw so you better mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe just wait until you guys are </v>

160
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 2>in a room and see what you really want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say.</v>

161
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.663
<v Speaker 2>Cause Sniping from a windowless room </v>
<v Speaker 2>from somewhere or being a a keyboard </v>

162
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 2>activist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not.</v>

163
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean much to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

164
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:29.140
<v Speaker 2>ted is the spokesperson for the right in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's this contrast in so many ways.</v>

166
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.290
<v Speaker 2>He's just wild and it used to be long </v>
<v Speaker 2>hair.</v>

167
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:34.124
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have long hair anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but long haired guitar player from </v>

168
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's Ted nugent.</v>

169
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:39.644
<v Speaker 2>He should be this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't be a drug user or </v>

170
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:41.751
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

171
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 2>It should be on tour all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's the opposite.</v>

172
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't do any drugs,</v>

173
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.503
<v Speaker 2>doesn't drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's super right wing and he </v>

174
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Speaker 2>supports the second amendment and guns </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

175
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.963
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in this group of and he has some </v>

176
00:08:55.231 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 2>very strong beliefs that he really does </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold in that group.</v>

177
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.153
<v Speaker 2>But then comes the outrageous stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says and you would get a </v>

178
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 2>mischaracterization of him because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the things he says.</v>

179
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 2>But if you meet him in person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>person to person,</v>

180
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:09.114
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to them all the time that </v>

181
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:13.280
<v Speaker 2>texted each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only been my experience with him.</v>

182
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.133
<v Speaker 2>Great guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had really cool conversations with </v>

183
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 2>him and I'm a hyper fan of the records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

184
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 2>it's Gospel to me that those records are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my dna.</v>

185
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

186
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:27.260
<v Speaker 2>And that I don't know what fuels those </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just don't get it.</v>

187
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not here to rip on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just honestly do not.</v>

188
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.373
<v Speaker 2>I can't reconcile that conversations I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had were super friendly and happy that </v>

189
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 2>you're a fan of the guy and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch some things.</v>

190
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

191
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some stage somewhere you're like,</v>

192
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:43.764
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

193
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 2>that's as bummed that my whole evening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

194
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's you,</v>

195
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 2>that's the first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go do your thing.</v>

196
00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:52.171
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

197
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Speaker 2>that's this currency in that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that,</v>

198
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 2>that getting that charge out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that outrageous thing.</v>

199
00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.880
<v Speaker 2>It keeps the ball rolling in some way.</v>

200
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not a ball I'd want to roll though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

201
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.660
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't seem sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>speaking of sustainable,</v>

<v Speaker 2>scruff of my shirt with a fist in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>face and the only thing you can do is </v>

231
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:17.304
<v Speaker 2>like imitate him so much that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else laughs and he has to drop you </v>

232
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.340
<v Speaker 2>because he's now like drop will drop </v>
<v Speaker 2>your collar,</v>

233
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.320
<v Speaker 2>not your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

234
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 2>because you're now making him laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when in doubt,</v>

235
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.373
<v Speaker 2>keep talking pal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that I have a quote comedy </v>

236
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:32.154
<v Speaker 2>special on showtime is so unlikely from </v>
<v Speaker 2>some guy from the minimum wage working </v>

237
00:11:36.211 --> 00:11:37.830
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it myself.</v>

238
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.160
<v Speaker 2>And so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to call at night?</v>

239
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.990
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of confidence like going</v>

240
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 2>to call it like just me and my mighty </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wang take this is.</v>

241
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:47.814
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like keep talking because I know I'm </v>

242
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>really not supposed to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how did you do your first show?</v>

243
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.053
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What made you do your first talking </v>

244
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:57.280
<v Speaker 1>show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>$5.</v>

245
00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.393
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 83.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little venue on Hudson right off of </v>

246
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 1>like about 10 paces north of Santa </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monica Boulevard.</v>

247
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like treat the dead ends onto Santa</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monica Boulevard.</v>

248
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:08.743
<v Speaker 1>It was an art space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're called the Lasa club and there </v>

249
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:12.904
<v Speaker 1>was a local promoter in town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing guy and he would get like 25 </v>

250
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:18.124
<v Speaker 1>people on stage in one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone gets five minutes and it'd be </v>

251
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:22.450
<v Speaker 1>the singer of that band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drummer of that band,</v>

252
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>that artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that poet,</v>

253
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.023
<v Speaker 1>like real artists who speak for a living</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the guy with the funny tour </v>

254
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.453
<v Speaker 1>journal or the guy from the band that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>all like and he's going to be an idiot </v>

255
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:34.160
<v Speaker 1>for five minutes and these shows were </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fun because it just.</v>

256
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.193
<v Speaker 1>People are offstage all night long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like running off stage and the bass </v>

257
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 1>player and black flag truck to Koski fed</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic intellect.</v>

258
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.373
<v Speaker 1>He would get invited onto these bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go with him because we were </v>

259
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>beach guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lived in the sticks and the gigs were</v>

260
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:50.554
<v Speaker 1>in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll go into the big smoke will go </v>

261
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:52.774
<v Speaker 1>see the big city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go with him because he had the band </v>

262
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>van.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd go into town,</v>

263
00:12:56.591 --> 00:12:59.990
<v Speaker 1>I'd tag along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he'd read out of some notebook,</v>

264
00:12:59.991 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 1>has apocalyptic rantings and one night </v>
<v Speaker 1>the promoter said,</v>

265
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Speaker 1>you got a big mouth next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you five minutes or seven minutes,</v>

266
00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:09.064
<v Speaker 1>five bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I could think of was the five bucks </v>

267
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.540
<v Speaker 1>and like what I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're starving.</v>

268
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as any band was.</v>

269
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.623
<v Speaker 1>And so the next show I got onstage at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lasa told a story about what had </v>

270
00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:21.304
<v Speaker 1>happened at band practice the day before</v>
<v Speaker 1>where a white supremist in a car tried </v>

271
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:25.294
<v Speaker 1>to run over our guitar player because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had brown skinned people at our band </v>

272
00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:31.450
<v Speaker 1>practice and so he yelled.</v>

273
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.313
<v Speaker 1>He accused our guitar player of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iep lover and tried to run him over on </v>

274
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 1>his way to the liquor store to get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>orange juice,</v>

275
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 1>so our guitar player comes back a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaken,</v>

276
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.423
<v Speaker 1>a nearly got run over by a Neo Nazi and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to practice and so for us </v>

277
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:47.224
<v Speaker 1>that was as Tuesday in the life of black</v>
<v Speaker 1>flag for an audience like you hear jaws </v>

278
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>hit the ground and then I read something</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd written,</v>

279
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well my five minutes are up,</v>

280
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I left the stage and it felt right.</v>

281
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a fish dropped into water </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time.</v>

282
00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:01.661
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

283
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't have a band,</v>

284
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.190
<v Speaker 1>but I had no stage fright and this me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a microphone.</v>

285
00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 1>It felt more natural than music ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt,</v>

286
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 1>which was cool to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never felt natural.</v>

287
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Just felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it this thing is in me,</v>

288
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:15.784
<v Speaker 1>has got to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm serving as a monster where the </v>

289
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:19.600
<v Speaker 1>talking shows like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

290
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:20.523
<v Speaker 1>this is me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after the show people came up and </v>

291
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:24.100
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when's your next show?</v>

292
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:24.551
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

293
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaving on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

294
00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:25.621
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

295
00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:27.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're just talking.</v>

296
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.323
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

297
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a one off.</v>

298
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I got this $5 bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Outta here.</v>

299
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.630
<v Speaker 1>And so the agent that the promoter guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

300
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very good at that.</v>

301
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 1>You're a natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how about this?</v>

302
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:39.283
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promote all these different poets and </v>

303
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>performance artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you,</v>

304
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:42.934
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you 20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll do 20 minutes opening for this </v>

305
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:46.870
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

306
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:52.140
<v Speaker 1>So I did 20 minutes and then after a </v>
<v Speaker 1>handful of those shows,</v>

307
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:53.174
<v Speaker 1>those poet types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're opening for me because the black </v>

308
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:56.864
<v Speaker 1>flag aspect kicks in like the do from </v>
<v Speaker 1>black flag people show up and I guess I </v>

309
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 1>was good enough.</v>

310
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.900
<v Speaker 1>And so those poets weren't that happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm out opening for this guy.</v>

311
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.943
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was 83 turning into 84 by </v>

312
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.333
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had gone to Europe for some poetry </v>

313
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:16.910
<v Speaker 1>festival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I kind of blabbed onto in Holland.</v>

314
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.073
<v Speaker 1>I had done a cross country tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 to 50 people a night sleep on the </v>

315
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 1>promoters couch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go by Amtrak.</v>

316
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.630
<v Speaker 1>And started my little book company or 83</v>
<v Speaker 1>84 self published to this day.</v>

317
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.163
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it went from strength to strength </v>

318
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 1>and now it's a 14 month tour that takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 20 countries,</v>

319
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.230
<v Speaker 1>multiple nights in cities at nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>theaters.</v>

320
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.123
<v Speaker 1>Do you only use yourself for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>publishing company or do you publish </v>

321
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 1>anybody else's books?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to many years ago we,</v>

322
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

323
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.660
<v Speaker 1>people I knew who I thought were great </v>
<v Speaker 1>writers.</v>

324
00:15:50.661 --> 00:15:51.494
<v Speaker 1>I put them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We licensed Nick Cave books from his </v>

325
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:55.360
<v Speaker 1>publishers in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

326
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 1>we licensed a few different titles.</v>

327
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.740
<v Speaker 1>We did photo books and a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>novels,</v>

328
00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:01.574
<v Speaker 1>short story collections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very hard to have a book </v>

329
00:16:05.661 --> 00:16:06.494
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to sell a book in the world </v>

330
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.380
<v Speaker 1>unless it's like Stephen King or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Danielle steel.</v>

331
00:16:10.381 --> 00:16:11.720
<v Speaker 1>It's mega,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the cash register,</v>

333
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:15.950
<v Speaker 1>at the airport store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

334
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're selling poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

335
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.480
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are nothing but uphill.</v>

336
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 1>My books did okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still,</v>

337
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:23.300
<v Speaker 1>they always do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

338
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else's books is like trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell dead animal guts.</v>

339
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:28.881
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

340
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:30.710
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's that interested in the look,</v>

341
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:35.711
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to take it home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we stopped signing new writers,</v>

342
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.460
<v Speaker 1>sold through the press runs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the licenses run out,</v>

343
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Speaker 1>everyone got to keep their masters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we just concentrated on me because,</v>

344
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.004
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep a whole staff busy with all the </v>

345
00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:48.710
<v Speaker 1>stuff I've got going.</v>

346
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 1>And so we publish what we publish me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done a bunch of books.</v>

347
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.680
<v Speaker 1>How many books have you written?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About 27.</v>

348
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing else going on.</v>

349
00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the two of them.</v>

350
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to do a photo book a few years</v>

351
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.280
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Heidi,</v>

352
00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:06.410
<v Speaker 1>who runs all my company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the smart one.</v>

353
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:08.090
<v Speaker 1>So I showed her the manuscript,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

354
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book is great,</v>

355
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:10.483
<v Speaker 1>but let's not do it our company because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of startup money for a photo </v>

356
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:14.990
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a lot of setup costs.</v>

357
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's get you a literary agent and do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else.</v>

358
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:19.933
<v Speaker 1>And so a smart idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we got a literary agent and we </v>

359
00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:24.500
<v Speaker 1>did get a book deal with a very good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

360
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Chicago Company,</v>

361
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Chicago review,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm forgetting,</v>

362
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they put out the photo book and that</v>

363
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 1>was a learning experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like working with an editor like,</v>

364
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.710
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's the cover,</v>

365
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:37.430
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

366
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.020
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a meeting about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

367
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:39.860
<v Speaker 1>you're having a meeting.</v>

368
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:40.993
<v Speaker 1>It's my book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my book cover because I'm used to </v>

369
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.843
<v Speaker 1>owning my own machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you work with other people's </v>

370
00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:47.930
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has a big opinion.</v>

371
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that book came out and did and continues</v>

372
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:52.584
<v Speaker 1>to do very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many years ago I did a kind of a </v>

373
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:59.541
<v Speaker 1>best of if I have any best of material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a best of for random house many,</v>

374
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:04.020
<v Speaker 1>many years ago that you still see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in print.</v>

375
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of people's first book </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mine because it's in stores.</v>

376
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.353
<v Speaker 1>We pulled my company's books out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>circulation because of Amazon because </v>

377
00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:14.094
<v Speaker 1>they can actually sell it cheaper than </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can because they don't mind making </v>

378
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:21.270
<v Speaker 1>five cents on a book because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling 80 billion books a second.</v>

379
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.463
<v Speaker 1>So we pulled ourselves out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution and now it's very much the </v>

380
00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:26.634
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it live shows and we have less </v>

381
00:18:28.201 --> 00:18:28.770
<v Speaker 1>returns.</v>

382
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.350
<v Speaker 1>We don't get a pallet of damaged books </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back that were,</v>

383
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abused in some bookstore,</v>

384
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.973
<v Speaker 1>in a shopping mall in the Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like heavily thumbed but never taken </v>

385
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:38.454
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't buy your books off Amazon </v>

386
00:18:39.671 --> 00:18:41.700
<v Speaker 1>unless a third party seller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

387
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.880
<v Speaker 1>And you just sell them on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

388
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.970
<v Speaker 1>And you might not sell as many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get 1100 returns.</v>

389
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.150
<v Speaker 1>You've got 1,112,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

390
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were selling everyone else's </v>

391
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:56.663
<v Speaker 1>books to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get like a pallet of like books that </v>

392
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 1>looked like a dog chewed them or like </v>
<v Speaker 1>remainder stickers.</v>

393
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:03.024
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I am extraordinarily small of </v>

394
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 1>fame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sell lots of books.</v>

395
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.620
<v Speaker 1>They do create a as ebooks as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

396
00:19:13.621 --> 00:19:16.620
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of overtaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an ebook guy.</v>

397
00:19:16.621 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I like to take a marker and mark books </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and so I buy paper ones,</v>

398
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>but apparently the real world likes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read on their tablet.</v>

399
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 1>And so all my books are on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

400
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to Heidi and apparently they sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

401
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't keep track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just write them.</v>

402
00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't count them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to suggest to somebody,</v>

403
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:36.990
<v Speaker 1>a good book of yours to start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say to start with?</v>

404
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.480
<v Speaker 1>If I was gonna read your books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>

405
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:40.051
<v Speaker 1>start with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

406
00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I would tell you to read blood Meridian </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Cormac McCarthy.</v>

407
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.300
<v Speaker 1>I would just tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read a real writer.</v>

408
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting the van.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My tour journals from black flag is just</v>

409
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.740
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like that book.</v>

410
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:55.380
<v Speaker 1>It's in a bunch of different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

411
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.333
<v Speaker 1>it's just a cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane read of like living this very </v>

412
00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.130
<v Speaker 1>feral life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

413
00:20:01.131 --> 00:20:01.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting women and music and relative </v>

414
00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:07.910
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a fun one to start.</v>

415
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

416
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I like the travel books I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing the last few years.</v>

417
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:13.531
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

418
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I write when I travel all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

419
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 1>And so I write these books from these </v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

420
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:24.231
<v Speaker 1>like from a ship in Antarctica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a tent in the deserts of Timbuktu.</v>

421
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And those travel books I like quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

422
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a dull roar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always have an a,</v>

423
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.813
<v Speaker 1>an a at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dull roar a off to come up with the </v>

424
00:20:38.191 --> 00:20:39.024
<v Speaker 1>rest of the name Sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your manic dedication to work is very </v>

425
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.473
<v Speaker 1>inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it makes me feel like I need to </v>

426
00:20:44.071 --> 00:20:44.904
<v Speaker 1>work more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're writing all the time </v>

427
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:48.520
<v Speaker 1>and doing all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're one of those guys.</v>

428
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:49.354
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like you're always with your </v>

429
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 1>foot on the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of furious for work.</v>

430
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

431
00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what I do,</v>

432
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.203
<v Speaker 1>but it's also what I don't do in that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a family and I'm not putting </v>

433
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:06.730
<v Speaker 1>it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have that.</v>

434
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not chipped that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of having kids.</v>

435
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:15.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have friends really.</v>

436
00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the people I know,</v>

437
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.903
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either pay a salary or a commission to </v>

438
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.503
<v Speaker 1>my phone doesn't ring my old best friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>from since I was 12 in mci of the band </v>

439
00:21:26.801 --> 00:21:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Fugazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and I talk every Sunday of possible,</v>

440
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:31.403
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but past that my phone usually doesn't </v>

441
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 1>ring unless it's an interview or Heidi </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

442
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:36.041
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Get over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that good?</v>

444
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

445
00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:40.690
<v Speaker 1>What it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Work for you.</v>

446
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:41.524
<v Speaker 1>Like it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've been that way since I was </v>

447
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the no friends part.</v>

448
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking for enemies.</v>

449
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

450
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to come over on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend for dinner.</v>

451
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

452
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I ever have a good time at dinner with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody missed.</v>

453
00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.373
<v Speaker 1>Uncomfortable that I'll say the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and I just act like look at the </v>

454
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:06.580
<v Speaker 1>table full of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go Act like them.</v>

455
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.533
<v Speaker 1>You should be friends with comics </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't say the wrong thing </v>

456
00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:11.410
<v Speaker 1>because no one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

457
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.750
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll call and say,</v>

458
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:14.740
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out with us.</v>

459
00:22:14.741 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 1>We're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to go,</v>

460
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:21.150
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go a deadbeat.</v>

461
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I'd be a deadbeat friend because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

462
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I'd never want to go with anyone to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>any.</v>

463
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll look at all the phone calls.</v>

464
00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it sounds like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>managing expectations versus you know,</v>

465
00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.860
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't sound like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like friends.</v>

466
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.350
<v Speaker 1>It's just you don't want expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

467
00:22:39.351 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.080
<v Speaker 1>as it's going to get in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

469
00:22:42.081 --> 00:22:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Well also I'm just kind of moody in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

470
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:45.214
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go out and do this thing </v>

471
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:51.040
<v Speaker 1>and then I don't want to see anyone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything until 20,</v>

472
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.550
<v Speaker 1>28 and I don't want to cancel.</v>

473
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.530
<v Speaker 1>And so here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my big,</v>

474
00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.660
<v Speaker 1>besides hanging out with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

475
00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 1>my big social thing as many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years ago,</v>

476
00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:07.690
<v Speaker 1>2003,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a song with William Shatner,</v>

477
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Bill Shatner on this album and we became</v>
<v Speaker 1>pals.</v>

478
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:12.993
<v Speaker 1>Henry come by the house for Monday night</v>
<v Speaker 1>football and he invited me to the house </v>

479
00:23:19.811 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 1>for Monday night football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lives a few traffic lights for me and</v>

480
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking up the stairs to the living </v>
<v Speaker 1>room where the TV is.</v>

481
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.223
<v Speaker 1>And I heard all this laughter and voices</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I froze and I was right at the </v>

482
00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:35.570
<v Speaker 1>threshold of the door and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn back,</v>

483
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.580
<v Speaker 1>turn back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn turning back Henry.</v>

484
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:43.750
<v Speaker 1>And he saw me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>

485
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:50.350
<v Speaker 1>And I walked in and met all his really </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool friends and he,</v>

486
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.760
<v Speaker 1>at least for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill is,</v>

487
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.020
<v Speaker 1>were the nicest people I've ever met in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

488
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:02.710
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the oddest friendships I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have in that.</v>

489
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I've been going to bill shatner's house </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year since 2003.</v>

490
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Speaker 1>So what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen years.</v>

491
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I will be there this year.</v>

492
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.680

<v Speaker 1>He's doing another record.</v>

<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>

507
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:48.950
<v Speaker 1>And I truly value that friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

508
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:49.784
<v Speaker 1>I look forward to seeing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy hearing what he's up to </v>

509
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:54.463
<v Speaker 1>because it was doing like five things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's become this thing where I </v>

510
00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:01.550
<v Speaker 1>really look forward to football season.</v>

511
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much about football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what a halfback does run.</v>

512
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.100
<v Speaker 1>I think they run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

513
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

514
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.453
<v Speaker 1>I'd never knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like going there and it's always </v>

515
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:14.390
<v Speaker 1>the same group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People he's known for like 500 years and</v>

516
00:25:14.391 --> 00:25:19.391
<v Speaker 1>they're super nice and I've kind of sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of known them for like 15 years and it's</v>

517
00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:26.441
<v Speaker 1>so odd because I have nothing else like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that really in my life.</v>

518
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just William Shatner.</v>

519
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

520
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.513
<v Speaker 1>Sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I would do once a year </v>

521
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.740
<v Speaker 1>and sadly it ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a few years I would go to gail's</v>

522
00:25:40.741 --> 00:25:41.574
<v Speaker 1>APP as birthday party on January first </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I would play a lot of her </v>

523
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:45.853
<v Speaker 1>husband's music on my radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank Zappa and one time someone in the </v>

524
00:25:49.071 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 1>family wrote me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

525
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:53.030
<v Speaker 1>thanks for playing dad on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

526
00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:53.600
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding?</v>

527
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I love those records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then gail,</v>

528
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:58.880
<v Speaker 1>the mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wife wrote and said,</v>

529
00:25:58.881 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

530
00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.130
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

531
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:03.680
<v Speaker 1>we know who you are here and we like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

532
00:26:03.681 --> 00:26:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I have a birthday party every January </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

533
00:26:06.381 --> 00:26:10.040
<v Speaker 1>why don't you come up to the house this </v>
<v Speaker 1>year or next next year.</v>

534
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Like he'll and I did and that was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four years in a row.</v>

535
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:18.311
<v Speaker 1>I did that until gail passed away and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you get there,</v>

536
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like two in the afternoon,</v>

537
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.560
<v Speaker 1>two hours before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm genuinely nervous to go be in a room</v>

538
00:26:27.591 --> 00:26:32.030
<v Speaker 1>full of extraordinarily nice people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastically good food.</v>

539
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.360
<v Speaker 1>And there everyone was always so nice to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and like,</v>

540
00:26:35.361 --> 00:26:36.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like a WHO's who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk in,</v>

541
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

542
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.920
<v Speaker 1>it's just all these people you </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize.</v>

543
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.053
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to name drop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the tables I sat at that </v>

544
00:26:43.711 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 1>thing I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really am I really talking to,</v>

545
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.260
<v Speaker 1>like really fantastic.</v>

546
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.220
<v Speaker 1>And she was always so nice to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like last time I was up there,</v>

547
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:55.110
<v Speaker 1>one of my books is like in the living </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

548
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

549
00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.450
<v Speaker 1>When she passed away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote one of the family members.</v>

550
00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am so sorry.</v>

551
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for the hospitality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mom was so great to me and I'm kind</v>

552
00:27:06.881 --> 00:27:07.714
<v Speaker 1>of like the rescue dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to being outside so I don't </v>

553
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:16.010
<v Speaker 1>come inside very often and I went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that birthday party because the just the</v>

554
00:27:16.171 --> 00:27:21.090
<v Speaker 1>friendliness of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't as socially nerve wracking as</v>

555
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:25.830
<v Speaker 1>those things are for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had such respect for that extension of</v>

556
00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:26.664
<v Speaker 1>kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot disrespect it by not going and </v>

557
00:27:30.391 --> 00:27:33.980
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't dare the Samurai and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do not distract.</v>

558
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:39.020
<v Speaker 1>You must be respectful even if it makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you nauseous with social anxiety because</v>

559
00:27:40.081 --> 00:27:40.914
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say no because it's such a nice </v>

560
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.510
<v Speaker 1>thing to do for someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

561
00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She must not really know how I am.</v>

562
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise she never would have invited </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

563
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

564
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:54.953
<v Speaker 1>but things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of sheer politeness and respect for </v>

565
00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:00.264
<v Speaker 1>someone being friendly to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of a pushover just because I'm </v>

566
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:04.021
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

567
00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:07.050
<v Speaker 1>that was so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must salute that.</v>

568
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.940
<v Speaker 3>I think it's so good that you're open </v>
<v Speaker 3>about your social anxiety and then about</v>

569
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:13.774
<v Speaker 3>how you feel like being around all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people because a lot of people in the </v>

570
00:28:17.591 --> 00:28:19.870
<v Speaker 3>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see someone like you,</v>

571
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black flag.</v>

572
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your spoken word things,</v>

573
00:28:24.911 --> 00:28:26.700
<v Speaker 3>your books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fucking mean.</v>

574
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.370
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always go back to uh,</v>

575
00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:29.680
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

576
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.633
<v Speaker 3>the liar song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fucking neck was like the size of </v>

577
00:28:32.861 --> 00:28:36.640
<v Speaker 3>my waist and you're screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 3>painted red and like,</v>

578
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.730
<v Speaker 3>you're this crazy intimidating guy and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways.</v>

579
00:28:39.731 --> 00:28:43.930
<v Speaker 3>So to hear you talk about social anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how weird you feel.</v>

580
00:28:43.931 --> 00:28:46.930
<v Speaker 3>And I think we all can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all feel that.</v>

581
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.700
<v Speaker 3>I always feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

582
00:28:48.701 --> 00:28:49.534
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think no matter how famous you get </v>

583
00:28:51.491 --> 00:28:53.260
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're paying attention,</v>

584
00:28:53.261 --> 00:28:54.910
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have an imposter </v>
<v Speaker 3>syndrome.</v>

585
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:55.973
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're always gonna feel like you don't </v>

586
00:28:56.591 --> 00:28:57.100
<v Speaker 3>belong there.</v>

587
00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.410
<v Speaker 3>If you're actually paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't,</v>

588
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.670
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably,</v>

589
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.660
<v Speaker 3>you're probably delusional at some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of wonder about the people who don't.</v>

590
00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never get to do cool stuff.</v>

591
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.130
<v Speaker 3>And the bit before we go into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to on your point,</v>

592
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.070
<v Speaker 3>it's easy for me to be in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

593
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.670
<v Speaker 3>That's a very different than than being </v>
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>

594
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.100
<v Speaker 3>I can be the party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but going to the parties,</v>

595
00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.730
<v Speaker 3>difficult putting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put me in front of like five people,</v>

596
00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.100
<v Speaker 3>5,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stage fright.</v>

597
00:29:27.101 --> 00:29:28.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to be out there.</v>

598
00:29:28.841 --> 00:29:31.540
<v Speaker 3>You're a performer type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love that audience.</v>

599
00:29:31.541 --> 00:29:32.590
<v Speaker 3>See if they showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

600
00:29:32.591 --> 00:29:35.080
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dog with a wagging tail.</v>

601
00:29:35.081 --> 00:29:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I want to get out there and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and get it going.</v>

602
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:37.983
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wait the whole day on tour to get out </v>

603
00:29:39.431 --> 00:29:41.620
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole day is about o'clock,</v>

604
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

605
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.160
<v Speaker 1>stage time I'm being amongst people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to like a gallery event.</v>

606
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:49.504
<v Speaker 1>I go see a shepard fairey thing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and people are Super Nice to </v>

607
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:55.810
<v Speaker 1>me and I'm always polite back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm a little nervy.</v>

608
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:56.973
<v Speaker 1>But if they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you get up and speak for five </v>

609
00:29:58.571 --> 00:29:59.201
<v Speaker 1>minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

610
00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I got this strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is strange,</v>

611
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's also um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a way to avoid being with people,</v>

612
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:06.934
<v Speaker 1>be in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a way to be in the room with </v>

613
00:30:09.191 --> 00:30:11.410
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be the center of attention,</v>

614
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:16.650
<v Speaker 1>so maybe that's coming from some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>neediness or some deprivation as a,</v>

615
00:30:17.411 --> 00:30:18.244
<v Speaker 1>you know what I didn't get as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you make a great point about that </v>

616
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:24.040
<v Speaker 1>when you really think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

617
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:29.041
<v Speaker 1>this is where I belong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you lose all the fun of it.</v>

618
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you turn into kind of a jerk.</v>

619
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.303
<v Speaker 1>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every 500 years I go to one of those </v>

620
00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.990
<v Speaker 1>premiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get invited and you're standing,</v>

621
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:38.873
<v Speaker 1>you're in a room full of tons of really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good food and none of those people eat </v>

622
00:30:42.191 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 1>side just like go in there and come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine pounds heavier.</v>

623
00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of shrimp have I just eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

624
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.800
<v Speaker 1>you're a big Hollywood premier big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big movie years ago.</v>

625
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:55.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's like that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>

626
00:30:55.781 --> 00:30:56.501
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>

627
00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:57.220
<v Speaker 1>And they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

628
00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.920
<v Speaker 1>it is their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm with a buddy of mine.</v>

629
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 1>We blagged in there and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing here?</v>

630
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:05.590
<v Speaker 1>This is so cool because we know we </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be here.</v>

631
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:10.360
<v Speaker 1>And after shaking Ike Turner's hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes later,</v>

632
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm back in my own kitchen going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so weird.</v>

633
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a surreal evening.</v>

634
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.233
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because my friend and I were standing </v>

635
00:31:20.021 --> 00:31:22.090
<v Speaker 1>next to other and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks like I turn.</v>

636
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:22.811
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>

637
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:24.690
<v Speaker 1>that is eye turner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked,</v>

638
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.160
<v Speaker 1>looked like a human barracuda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like terrifying.</v>

639
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we bought a ticket at the dance.</v>

640
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go talk to this guy.</v>

641
00:31:32.561 --> 00:31:33.010
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

642
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:33.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

643
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just walked right over there.</v>

644
00:31:34.901 --> 00:31:37.000
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you invented rock and roll rocket 88.</v>

645
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.230
<v Speaker 1>And he went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes I did.</v>

646
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It shook my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

647
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I say first ever distorted guitar on </v>
<v Speaker 1>tape,</v>

648
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.410
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone that's right.</v>

649
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.950
<v Speaker 1>And I fluffed him up and he was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to meet me.</v>

650
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:48.963
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

651
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:49.803
<v Speaker 1>here's my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I brought my friend over and we </v>

652
00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 1>shook his hand and kind of stood with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him for a minute and went,</v>

653
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:55.474
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably not gonna get any </v>

654
00:31:56.771 --> 00:31:58.600
<v Speaker 1>better for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's get outta here.</v>

655
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.920
<v Speaker 1>We ate a few more handfuls of mini </v>
<v Speaker 1>burritos and we bale,</v>

656
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.170
<v Speaker 1>but it was one of those nights were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

657
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:12.180
<v Speaker 1>we were supposed to be in there and if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever lose that then just never talked to</v>

658
00:32:13.091 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 1>me again because I'll just have my head </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have disappeared up.</v>

659
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me with that anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that insecurity is a big part of the</v>

660
00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:22.310
<v Speaker 1>fuel that keeps everything moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super fuel for me.</v>

661
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.480
<v Speaker 1>You analyzing yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

662
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.700
<v Speaker 1>And anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

663
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm mad at I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

664
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I like fighting and not fighting like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ring for me.</v>

665
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.740
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things or confrontation like </v>
<v Speaker 1>tourists.</v>

666
00:32:35.741 --> 00:32:38.800
<v Speaker 1>What you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do 47 shows in 48.</v>

667
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.131
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

668
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:43.030
<v Speaker 1>my next tour is 47 and 47.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

669
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:45.830

<v Speaker 1>few days later in one day.</v>

670
00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

671
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:49.190
<v Speaker 1>what you think I can't will then book 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

672
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.073
<v Speaker 1>200 more in the winter and just give me </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lama and a knife and I make every gig </v>

673
00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 1>like watch this and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's so much of what fuels me.</v>

674
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

675
00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I come up with these huge ideas for </v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

676
00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.630
<v Speaker 1>like that's gonna take me five years to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write it.</v>

677
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:10.520
<v Speaker 1>And it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just finished it.</v>

678
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:13.250
<v Speaker 1>It's going to the proofreader soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This epic project,</v>

679
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

680
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:18.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a series of music books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 407,000 words.</v>

681
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so am I.</v>

682
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.870
<v Speaker 1>is this idea pages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

683
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.713
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly on the hard drive so we </v>

684
00:33:28.461 --> 00:33:31.710
<v Speaker 1>don't have to deforest some park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

685
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.710
<v Speaker 1>but it was an idea I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

686
00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:34.544
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to take a lot of years to </v>

687
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:37.460
<v Speaker 1>execute this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like,</v>

720
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.273
<v Speaker 1>major studio you want to imagine or I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in for the meeting with a casting </v>

721
00:35:08.631 --> 00:35:10.280
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of look you over,</v>

722
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:11.114
<v Speaker 1>but I do those raw auditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you leave and you see like five </v>

723
00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:15.524
<v Speaker 1>head shots on a desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is and you get literally </v>

724
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.600
<v Speaker 1>you're out of there in about 35 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk in,</v>

725
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.440
<v Speaker 1>you're a Henry Henry Harley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

726
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.810
<v Speaker 1>are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

727
00:35:26.811 --> 00:35:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

728
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Stand on this piece of tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll be reading with you and you,</v>

729
00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

730
00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.253
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

731
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.513
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you leave the trailer and you get </v>

732
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:44.310
<v Speaker 1>back on the one on one and go home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you never hear from them again.</v>

733
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:45.773
<v Speaker 1>Often for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time out of 100 of those 98 </v>

734
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 1>times for everybody except putting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

735
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:55.440
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you asked about auditions.</v>

736
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go in there.</v>

737
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:57.503
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes acthar so fucking weird is not </v>

738
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:01.644
<v Speaker 1>just that they need attention in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place where they told Nola they </v>

739
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 1>get told no a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sucks.</v>

740
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.583
<v Speaker 1>It sucks and they're already insecure in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place and then they sort of </v>

741
00:36:10.351 --> 00:36:11.184
<v Speaker 1>try to model their behavior based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they think the casting agents and </v>

742
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:15.744
<v Speaker 1>the producers want to hear and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>change and they developed this style of </v>

743
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:20.430
<v Speaker 1>communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very actory.</v>

744
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird way to make your living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

745
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I've never relied on acting as my source</v>
<v Speaker 1>of income in 1984 when I was 23 either a</v>

746
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:32.580
<v Speaker 1>thing that has been serving me up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting here with you now.</v>

747
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I was very young in 23 years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young idiot and I looked all around.</v>

748
00:36:37.231 --> 00:36:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Me and all my peers are super talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are my peers under threat,</v>

749
00:36:41.071 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 1>bad rains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Husker du,</v>

750
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:44.040
<v Speaker 1>the meat puppets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dead Kennedys.</v>

751
00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm just surrounded by really talented </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are brilliant,</v>

752
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:51.000
<v Speaker 1>great songwriters and between tours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them are waiting tables,</v>

753
00:36:51.001 --> 00:36:53.520
<v Speaker 1>living with mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living on couches,</v>

754
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping at band practice,</v>

755
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:56.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a kick drum,</v>

756
00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.390
<v Speaker 1>a pillow as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as their pillow just like,</v>

757
00:36:59.391 --> 00:37:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughing it and I,</v>

758
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:01.883
<v Speaker 1>I reckon that I'm less talented than all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and if they're waiters between </v>

759
00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:06.564
<v Speaker 1>tours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason I'm not as black flag </v>

760
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:08.514
<v Speaker 1>never stopped drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like were the ball never hit the ground </v>

761
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:14.490
<v Speaker 1>because we'd starve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I better get plans B,</v>

762
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:14.941
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>

763
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:15.774
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>
<v Speaker 1>F and g ready because music's not going </v>

764
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:18.120
<v Speaker 1>to sustain me.</v>

765
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:18.953
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it went very well for me and so I was </v>

766
00:37:21.391 --> 00:37:22.320
<v Speaker 1>doing the writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I said,</v>

767
00:37:22.321 --> 00:37:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to really get better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

768
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to really bear down on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The talking shows.</v>

769
00:37:27.151 --> 00:37:30.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting 35 people a night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get 50 people a night.</v>

770
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.330
<v Speaker 1>And then voiceover people started coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

771
00:37:33.331 --> 00:37:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you do a voiceover?</v>

772
00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I got a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want me to?</v>

773
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.510
<v Speaker 1>I better learn to say yes to stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the mid eighties,</v>

774
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be in a movie?</v>

775
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be like,</v>

776
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.880
<v Speaker 1>what do I have to lose except your </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories from starving?</v>

777
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And so it was fear of not eating that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

778
00:37:51.031 --> 00:37:51.864
<v Speaker 1>and knowing I better have a plan and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>I started developing that in the </v>

779
00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.003
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

780
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.550
<v Speaker 1>And from that came what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with this.</v>

781
00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:00.384
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go immediately into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary and then I'm finishing this </v>

782
00:38:02.401 --> 00:38:05.620
<v Speaker 1>radio show and then I'm going off to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this film and then I'm going on tour and</v>

783
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.533
<v Speaker 1>then I'm coming back and finishing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and it turned into this like </v>

784
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 1>juggling all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I never had to be a full time actor.</v>

785
00:38:12.661 --> 00:38:13.494
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how I pay the rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be terrifying right up there </v>

786
00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:17.004
<v Speaker 1>with being a professional comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know how someone acts for </v>

787
00:38:20.311 --> 00:38:24.480
<v Speaker 1>living without being really good or out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their minds with anxiety.</v>

788
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:28.050
<v Speaker 1>But being a professional comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least you write your own stuff,</v>

789
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.320
<v Speaker 1>so you're kind of in control of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you don't have pain.</v>

790
00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem that rough and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to pay people,</v>

791
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

792
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.933
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to pay roadies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a drummer that has to </v>

793
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:39.970
<v Speaker 2>show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

794
00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the bass player who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get along with.</v>

795
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so many variables with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>band that comedians don't have.</v>

796
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Like we always look at you guys and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

797
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:52.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck you guys do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's not as much like you.</v>

798
00:38:52.441 --> 00:38:54.580
<v Speaker 2>You might do the same size venues that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>

799
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 2>but you're splitting the money with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking people.</v>

800
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a lot of times today the record</v>

801
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:02.830
<v Speaker 2>company gets a piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get a piece of everything,</v>

802
00:39:02.831 --> 00:39:04.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get a piece of your merchandise,</v>

803
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.373
<v Speaker 2>you see bands play really big places and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how much money they don't </v>

804
00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:12.230
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or each guy in the band gets like,</v>

805
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.500
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

806
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:15.523
<v Speaker 2>And then you see someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a small comedian playing like a 150 </v>

807
00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:23.380
<v Speaker 2>cedar for two nights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two sets of night,</v>

808
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:24.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

809
00:39:24.511 --> 00:39:26.680
<v Speaker 2>the left whatever in the Midwest.</v>

810
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.540
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 2>for a band.</v>

817
00:39:39.641 --> 00:39:40.474
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more the venues are more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are more limited places you go are more </v>

818
00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:45.220

<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

819
00:39:45.221 --> 00:39:47.680
<v Speaker 2>And I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting that you're,</v>

820
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:53.130
<v Speaker 2>it was almost like a desperation to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to work a job as a waiter that kept</v>

821
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:55.450

<v Speaker 2>What does it mean?</v>

822
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I just knew that the straight world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'd been in it,</v>

823
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.110

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

824
00:39:59.111 --> 00:40:02.680
<v Speaker 2>minimum wage work and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I knew I couldn't survive in it.</v>

825
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Cause I know you get as a young adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to figure out who you are.</v>

826
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

827
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm an artist type.</v>

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:15.550
<v Speaker 2>You can't put me in a straight shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can pass for normal just because I can</v>

830
00:40:15.551 --> 00:40:17.080
<v Speaker 2>task it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can totally do it.</v>

831
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Like you can put me in a Ralph's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I will totally get in there and hit the </v>

833
00:40:22.751 --> 00:40:25.480
<v Speaker 2>work and cleaned it all and serve it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a smile,</v>

834
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:26.913
<v Speaker 2>but I'll be going crazy inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will be punch everybody in those </v>

<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

836
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.593
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't sustain in that and I haven't </v>

837
00:40:37.361 --> 00:40:39.340
<v Speaker 2>had to for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been lucky.</v>

838
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the world of lunatics since</v>
<v Speaker 2>1981 being a crazy person out with other</v>

839
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:45.814
<v Speaker 2>crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I look at a straight job I'm </v>

840
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:49.570
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

841
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think at this point I could hack</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

842
00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:52.414
<v Speaker 2>Not because I'm spoiled just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had to tether my adult mind </v>

843
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.430
<v Speaker 2>too that I work seven days a week.</v>

844
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.820
<v Speaker 2>But on Henry stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's not,</v>

845
00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing.</v>

846
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.330
<v Speaker 2>You enjoy that work and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way over 60 hours a week.</v>

847
00:41:10.331 --> 00:41:11.164
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do two shifts usually to eight to 10 </v>

848
00:41:12.791 --> 00:41:15.610
<v Speaker 2>hour shifts depending on every workload.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

849
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I can't do four hours of sleep a night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I tie my sleep.</v>

850
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I hit the stopwatch on the phone before </v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to bed.</v>

851
00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Just this clock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep patterns.</v>

852
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I did about six point something hours of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep last night.</v>

853
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:28.540
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

854
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I feel great today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I barely ate and I uh,</v>

855
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:32.703
<v Speaker 2>got into a good workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all last night he did a lot of pull </v>

856
00:41:34.561 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 2>ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played 15,</v>

857
00:41:36.801 --> 00:41:37.634
<v Speaker 2>seven inch records and between flipping </v>
<v Speaker 2>him over I got a beam in my living room </v>

858
00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:41.954
<v Speaker 2>is a beam coming out of the ceiling that</v>
<v Speaker 2>supports me and I just run over there </v>

859
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:48.260
<v Speaker 2>and just do a bunch of pull ups and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>go change the record.</v>

860
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.843
<v Speaker 2>So you want more music?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to pay and pay and pay and all </v>

861
00:41:52.371 --> 00:41:54.380
<v Speaker 2>this by yourself all alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

862
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:58.490
<v Speaker 2>But by bedtime you are hurting and ready</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sleep.</v>

863
00:41:58.491 --> 00:41:59.324
<v Speaker 2>So I got good sleep last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you mix the workout in with your </v>

864
00:42:01.941 --> 00:42:04.640
<v Speaker 2>enjoyment of music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just space it in between the song.</v>

865
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Last night was pulling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tonight at the turntable,</v>

866
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll be listening to more records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just do sets of pushups next to the</v>

867
00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:11.924
<v Speaker 2>turntable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a smart move because like that's </v>

868
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:19.130
<v Speaker 2>probably a good interval of rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like get a good hard workout in.</v>

869
00:42:19.131 --> 00:42:20.660
<v Speaker 2>And then you listen to a form and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

870
00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

871
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.280

<v Speaker 2>50 rep sets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing like 15 to 25,</v>

873
00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:32.480
<v Speaker 2>but I'm doing them for quite a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time I go to bed it's advil time.</v>

874
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.373

<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to brag.</v>

878
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:48.080
<v Speaker 2>I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't handle not doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Whatever the thing is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>great for another day.</v>

899
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.860
<v Speaker 2>There was an article written about </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness and those.</v>

900
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:45.733
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that they said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that seems to sustain </v>

901
00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>people's happiness or facilitate </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness is accomplishing tasks,</v>

902
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.173
<v Speaker 2>like setting goals for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishing those goals and getting </v>

903
00:43:54.831 --> 00:43:55.664
<v Speaker 2>this sense of completion that you've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've actually done the work and you </v>

904
00:43:58.401 --> 00:43:59.234
<v Speaker 2>did it and you discipline yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>got through it and that this is one of </v>

905
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 2>the major keys to happiness for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>work for me,</v>

906
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.710
<v Speaker 2>totally works for me because I may as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

907
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I've tried everything but drugs because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been battling with depression since</v>

908
00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I was a little kid and I just knew what </v>
<v Speaker 2>is this.</v>

909
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:14.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

910
00:44:14.781 --> 00:44:18.230
<v Speaker 2>later I found out it was depression and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do drugs.</v>

911
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want it.</v>

912
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.240
<v Speaker 2>My brain plus drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like someone else's idea.</v>

913
00:44:23.241 --> 00:44:26.690
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifies me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to figure out what do you do.</v>

914
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:27.763
<v Speaker 2>And so that's where the gym you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>working out really is a big help </v>

915
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:31.303
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But listening to music that is like a </v>

916
00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:36.610
<v Speaker 2>kind of my drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

917
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:39.600
<v Speaker 2>I just put the records on and like three</v>
<v Speaker 2>songs in,</v>

918
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:39.991
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

919
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 2>there's that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buoyancy neutral.</v>

920
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:43.403
<v Speaker 2>It's like floating in the tank or when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're scuba diving you get your air </v>

921
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:46.800
<v Speaker 2>just right in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're floating.</v>

922
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.000
<v Speaker 2>That's how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the music on.</v>

923
00:44:49.001 --> 00:44:49.771
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

924
00:44:49.771 --> 00:44:52.770
<v Speaker 2>this is as good as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I always have,</v>

925
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>

926
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.533
<v Speaker 2>I'm always looking at new records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to the record store is more </v>

927
00:44:56.701 --> 00:44:58.230
<v Speaker 2>happiness coming in.</v>

928
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Does the exercise work better or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as work?</v>

929
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Like for managing depression?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

930
00:45:05.401 --> 00:45:08.790
<v Speaker 2>the workout is maintenance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't achieve much,</v>

931
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:12.090
<v Speaker 2>but I achieved the workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you feel like the,</v>

932
00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 2>the endorphin release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that help you?</v>

933
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

934
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

935
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.410
<v Speaker 2>as the Buddhists say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made merit.</v>

936
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:20.873
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went in there and did my time on the </v>

937
00:45:22.951 --> 00:45:23.784
<v Speaker 2>treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be there just the last </v>

938
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:29.280
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

939
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be somewhere else like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yo,</v>

940
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be fine.</v>

941
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Sit Down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do your work.</v>

942
00:45:33.571 --> 00:45:37.140
<v Speaker 2>That's why before the podcast how </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggesting hot yoga to you and you,</v>

943
00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 2>you seem to be very stiff lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got some injuries and some things</v>

944
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:43.110
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

945
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you that'll fix a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>

946
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:46.291
<v Speaker 2>It'll really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

947
00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I know you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a great workout diversity.</v>

948
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:50.184
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you and I were talking before we </v>

949
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:56.490
<v Speaker 2>were at your place and you said some </v>
<v Speaker 2>mornings you feel like training this way</v>

950
00:45:56.491 --> 00:45:57.324
<v Speaker 2>and you'll go to that gym or you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>train like a judo or whatever and then </v>

951
00:46:01.021 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 2>the next day it's going to be kettle </v>
<v Speaker 2>bells.</v>

952
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:03.324
<v Speaker 2>So you really like to mix it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good for a body to always </v>

953
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:07.490
<v Speaker 2>be guessing what's coming next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

954
00:46:07.491 --> 00:46:08.324
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

955
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.350
<v Speaker 4>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

956
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.350
<v Speaker 4>there's some things that are really have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>

957
00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:12.423
<v Speaker 4>I think I need at least one day of hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>cardio a week and I think I need at </v>

958
00:46:16.451 --> 00:46:18.760
<v Speaker 4>least one day of hard lifting weights a </v>
<v Speaker 4>week,</v>

959
00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.980
<v Speaker 4>but I also think I need at least one day</v>
<v Speaker 4>of yoga.</v>

960
00:46:20.981 --> 00:46:21.814
<v Speaker 4>We call East Yoga is to me it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most important things that I do </v>

961
00:46:24.911 --> 00:46:27.610
<v Speaker 4>because for that 90 minutes I can't go </v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere.</v>

962
00:46:27.611 --> 00:46:29.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't touch my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not in the room with me.</v>

963
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.713
<v Speaker 4>It was just me and a jug of water and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Yoga Mat and the class and a bunch </v>

964
00:46:34.481 --> 00:46:38.440
<v Speaker 4>of old ladies that are kicking my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These ladies are fucking tough man.</v>

965
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.990
<v Speaker 4>This is old lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She goes to this workout,</v>

966
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:44.170
<v Speaker 4>classmates see you there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's got to be close to 70.</v>

967
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.290
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't even bring water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She just tufts it out.</v>

968
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:48.183
<v Speaker 4>She's there for 90 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sweating and grunting through the </v>

969
00:46:50.291 --> 00:46:53.200
<v Speaker 4>postures and those you doing an hour and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a half class.</v>

970
00:46:53.201 --> 00:46:58.201
<v Speaker 4>Those last 20 minutes in a 104 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so hard to get through,</v>

971
00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:02.440
<v Speaker 4>but when you get through you just feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you feel better.</v>

972
00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.990
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I almost like can't wallow in it.</v>

973
00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:05.883
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like while I'm struggling and I was </v>

974
00:47:07.931 --> 00:47:08.381
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

975
00:47:08.381 --> 00:47:10.540
<v Speaker 4>I need to do more than this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to do this more often.</v>

976
00:47:10.541 --> 00:47:14.770
<v Speaker 4>Rather I can't wait to do this again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always feel that and it just lengthens</v>

977
00:47:14.771 --> 00:47:15.604
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like all the bad things and the leg </v>

978
00:47:17.381 --> 00:47:18.214
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hamstring things just stretches </v>

979
00:47:19.991 --> 00:47:22.780
<v Speaker 4>everything out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lengthens it and all the tension.</v>

980
00:47:22.781 --> 00:47:23.614
<v Speaker 4>It just straightens it out and loosens </v>
<v Speaker 4>it up and I just feel like for a guy </v>

981
00:47:26.891 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 4>like you or I who does a lot of a Lotta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

982
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.080
<v Speaker 3>especially like used a lot of heavy </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting.</v>

983
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 3>You were saying a lot of dead lifts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>squats.</v>

984
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.133
<v Speaker 3>This is the antidote for all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's decompression and for your body </v>

985
00:47:38.561 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 3>maintenance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just phenomenal.</v>

986
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Probably let's lose the lactic acid out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your muscle tissue.</v>

987
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

988
00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:45.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I've observed.</v>

989
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in Los Angeles,</v>

990
00:47:47.261 --> 00:47:51.280
<v Speaker 3>so there's a lot of yoga people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know them because they have a mat,</v>

991
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.960
<v Speaker 3>but you could also see how they walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they sit there,</v>

992
00:47:55.961 --> 00:48:00.961
<v Speaker 3>so in their body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there is a grace to you.</v>

993
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:03.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to put anyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pejorative,</v>

994
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:08.200
<v Speaker 3>but a yoga person where there's not only</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they limber,</v>

995
00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:13.201
<v Speaker 3>they're just really okay though this </v>
<v Speaker 3>their body articulation,</v>

996
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.410
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

997
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:15.933
<v Speaker 3>I don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Herky Jerky and coordinator </v>

998
00:48:17.871 --> 00:48:19.100
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is a,</v>

999
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh hum.</v>

1000
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Coming from that person's overall body.</v>

1001
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.810
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a beautiful machine.</v>

1002
00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:28.330
<v Speaker 3>The way they articulate themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they sit,</v>

1003
00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:31.120
<v Speaker 3>very unusual balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The balance of like,</v>

1004
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.640
<v Speaker 3>tell someone who does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have that.</v>

1005
00:48:33.641 --> 00:48:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not subtle.</v>

1006
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:37.600
<v Speaker 3>I recognize that you would love it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1007
00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:38.434
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would love it because it fucking </v>

1008
00:48:39.641 --> 00:48:41.530
<v Speaker 3>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while you're doing it,</v>

1009
00:48:41.531 --> 00:48:43.690
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the internal dialogues.</v>

1010
00:48:43.691 --> 00:48:44.524
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to bolt what do you want a </v>

1011
00:48:45.941 --> 00:48:46.774
<v Speaker 3>ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also start going over your life </v>

1012
00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:52.600
<v Speaker 3>and your mind and dealing with all your </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit and your to do list and all the</v>

1013
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:53.250
<v Speaker 3>things you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1014
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.083
<v Speaker 3>you're doing wrong or slacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about really </v>

1015
00:48:57.161 --> 00:48:57.994
<v Speaker 3>struggling in these static positions for</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a minute where you're trying to </v>

1016
00:49:00.821 --> 00:49:02.650
<v Speaker 3>like hold your leg up there and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweating.</v>

1017
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.443
<v Speaker 3>Sweat is literally pouring off your arms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your head and there's something </v>

1018
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:10.120
<v Speaker 3>about that man that it's just really </v>
<v Speaker 3>cleansing.</v>

1019
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:11.163
<v Speaker 3>It just really mtz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's a thing that you're </v>

1020

<v Speaker 3>missing that you would really love if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you tried.</v>

1029
00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:39.160
<v Speaker 3>How do you know Hixon Gracie is well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we talking about the Gracie family?</v>

1030
00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.053
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the family hoists Gracie is the most </v>

1031
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:42.514
<v Speaker 3>famous because he's probably the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>important figure ever in the history of </v>

1032
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:46.624
<v Speaker 3>martial arts because he won the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate fighting championship and </v>

1033
00:49:48.641 --> 00:49:49.474
<v Speaker 3>showed that a small man could actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat larger men with technique and </v>

1034
00:49:52.421 --> 00:49:53.230
<v Speaker 3>skill.</v>

1035
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:54.063
<v Speaker 3>Well his brother is Hickson and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother is like universally regarded as </v>

1036
00:49:59.291 --> 00:50:00.124
<v Speaker 3>one of the greatest Jujitsu guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not the greatest of all time and he </v>

1037
00:50:03.401 --> 00:50:05.710
<v Speaker 3>was different than everybody else and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he did yoga.</v>

1038
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Like his thing was like I'd never heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a martial artist that got into yoga,</v>

1039
00:50:10.661 --> 00:50:15.280
<v Speaker 3>but hixon would do these breathing </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercises and they do these balance beam</v>

1040
00:50:15.281 --> 00:50:16.114
<v Speaker 3>exercises and he was always doing yoga </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stretching and it was a giant part </v>

1041
00:50:19.571 --> 00:50:24.571
<v Speaker 3>of his workout and he was above and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond everyone else in his time period.</v>

1042
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Like in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone scared of Hixon.</v>

1043
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:29.650
<v Speaker 3>He was the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1044
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:30.493
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't like there was any debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very rare that you get something </v>

1045
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:34.124
<v Speaker 3>that is so antagonistic and so tightly </v>
<v Speaker 3>contested as two men using martial arts </v>

1046
00:50:39.741 --> 00:50:40.574
<v Speaker 3>techniques trying to strangle each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one guy stands above all by such a </v>

1047
00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:45.674
<v Speaker 3>large margin and that was Hickson and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>really do believe that part of it was </v>

1048
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:49.844
<v Speaker 3>his mind.</v>

1049
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.773
<v Speaker 3>Part of it was his physicality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of that physicality was </v>

1050
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:56.240
<v Speaker 3>enhanced by his dedication to yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1051
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:57.074
<v Speaker 3>He's a legit Yogi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who does that fire breathing shit </v>

1052
00:50:59.421 --> 00:51:03.080
<v Speaker 3>where he sucks his stomach in that weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>way and hasn't move up and down.</v>

1053
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 3>You ever see someone do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1054
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.640
<v Speaker 3>he does that like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a real Yogi.</v>

1055
00:51:07.641 --> 00:51:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a real trip.</v>

1056
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:12.950
<v Speaker 3>And I think because of his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1057
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:13.590
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1058
00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:15.620
<v Speaker 3>his like physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can see there.</v>

1059
00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:17.450
<v Speaker 3>He's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got this video here.</v>

1060
00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.580
<v Speaker 3>You can see him do this fire breathing </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1061
00:51:19.581 --> 00:51:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Like watch what he does this stomach </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's kind of fucking crazy.</v>

1062
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:24.860
<v Speaker 3>He sucks his stomach way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1063
00:51:24.861 --> 00:51:25.694
<v Speaker 3>way up deep into his rib cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does this breath of fire thing and </v>

1064
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:32.150
<v Speaker 3>then as it gets going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he starts pumping.</v>

1065
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.940
<v Speaker 3>Is here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if you pull it up there,</v>

1066
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The part where it starts to do it.</v>

1067
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.153
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

1068
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that insane?</v>

1070
00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

1071
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:45.493
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the things he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>abdominal muscle control gets that you </v>

1072
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.590
<v Speaker 1>never try and articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it do anything.</v>

1073
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:55.071
<v Speaker 1>Well He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1074
00:51:55.071 --> 00:51:57.470
<v Speaker 1>he'd practice yoga for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

1075
00:51:57.471 --> 00:51:57.750
<v Speaker 1>long</v>

1076
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:58.583
<v Speaker 3>time and because of that he had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal core strength and phenomenal </v>

1077
00:52:02.011 --> 00:52:07.011
<v Speaker 3>balance and he just had a giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage over everyone else and I think</v>

1078
00:52:07.111 --> 00:52:07.944
<v Speaker 3>a lot of that advantage was his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his ability to move his body was </v>

1079
00:52:11.221 --> 00:52:12.054
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also just for a guy like you </v>

1080
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:16.170
<v Speaker 3>that's been just lifting weights for so </v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

1081
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Speaker 3>it's the perfect antidote for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like your body will react to like,</v>

1082
00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.450
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1100
00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.180

<v Speaker 1>Like by the end of this,</v>

1101
00:52:54.181 --> 00:52:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you won't be able to take your shirt off</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change and I've done,</v>

1102
00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:00.120
<v Speaker 1>you know where you're benching this much</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this much.</v>

1103
00:53:00.121 --> 00:53:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Then this much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ended up doing like a hundred and 50</v>

1104
00:53:02.461 --> 00:53:07.461
<v Speaker 1>reps and by the time you can't lift the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bar and you can't lift your arms,</v>

1105
00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:11.310
<v Speaker 1>you're literally trembling from </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhaustion and I've told that to people.</v>

1106
00:53:11.311 --> 00:53:12.360
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's yoga.</v>

1107
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:13.223
<v Speaker 1>You will tremble from exhaustion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be so happy when you leave </v>

1108
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.570
<v Speaker 1>because of how good you feel and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't wait to go back and you won't blow</v>

1109
00:53:21.571 --> 00:53:23.880
<v Speaker 1>your joints out the way you will with </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting.</v>

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.380
<v Speaker 1>I already have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1115
00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 2>on advice of Heidi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the manager and Joey Diaz.</v>

1116

<v Speaker 2>I understand why would work,</v>

1119
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.713
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying it's quackery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just feel like I'm in an Annie </v>

1120
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Hall scene when I walk into these places</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1121
00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.630
<v Speaker 2>because it's like super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever therapy and I'm moonlight and </v>

<v Speaker 2>And then like you shake the guy's hand,</v>

<v Speaker 2>These people are in incredible shape.</v>

1125
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:09.390
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1126
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:10.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got in the robe and I went into that </v>

1127
00:54:11.701 --> 00:54:16.020
<v Speaker 2>room for two minutes and 45 seconds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the endorphin rush,</v>

1128
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:20.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like a ups truck of endorphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come out of there like,</v>

1129
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.360
<v Speaker 2>can I go back in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And since I got out of it,</v>

1130
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:27.420
<v Speaker 2>all I have been thinking about is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in,</v>

1131
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:28.860
<v Speaker 2>in the parking lot.</v>

1132
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:29.723
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to turn around and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>another shy and I asked the guy at the </v>

1133
00:54:32.821 --> 00:54:34.230
<v Speaker 2>counter like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that goes?</v>

<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>

1135
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:39.780
<v Speaker 2>unleashes them like fight or flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just get this rush.</v>

1136
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I said I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back.</v>

1137
00:54:40.951 --> 00:54:42.510
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come and see us again sometime.</v>

1138
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:43.973
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Ten minutes you're in and out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all the brochure,</v>

1143
00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:03.090
<v Speaker 2>nearly all these sports teams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's just part of what you do,</v>

1144
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:04.880
<v Speaker 2>but one thing that has been proven to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1145
00:55:04.881 --> 00:55:05.714
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of naysayers when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this even scientist apparently that </v>

1146
00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:09.264
<v Speaker 2>don't exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people that do exercise and do try </v>

1147
00:55:11.251 --> 00:55:14.280
<v Speaker 2>it all pretty much universally regarded </v>
<v Speaker 2>as being beneficial.</v>

1148
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.113
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that's been shown </v>
<v Speaker 2>in clinical studies is that it reduces </v>

1149
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:22.230
<v Speaker 2>and it produces more anti inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies in the blood.</v>

1150
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.030
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was.</v>

1151
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

1152
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:27.060
<v Speaker 2>it does reduce inflammation in your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just.</v>

1153
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.360
<v Speaker 2>But I think just for the mood elevation </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth doing.</v>

1154
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does say that nor epinephrin released</v>

1155
00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:34.010
<v Speaker 2>that you get when you get out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1156
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:35.540
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get that.</v>

1157
00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1158
00:55:38.311 --> 00:55:40.980
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the sun feels great in your face and</v>

1159
00:55:40.981 --> 00:55:41.814
<v Speaker 2>you get outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1160
00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.340
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything felt great.</v>

1161
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1162
00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:49.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't do much as far as stimulants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like coffee and aspirin I guess.</v>

1163
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not even sure what the effect is,</v>

1164
00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:54.143
<v Speaker 2>if at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it doesn't take much to make me </v>

1165
00:55:57.001 --> 00:55:57.301
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1166
00:55:57.301 --> 00:55:58.980
<v Speaker 2>that's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1167
00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:01.470
<v Speaker 2>And that I walked out back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parking lot,</v>

1168
00:56:01.471 --> 00:56:02.460
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn.</v>

1169
00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was fantastic.</v>

1170
00:56:04.061 --> 00:56:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Do three and then I'd take 10 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

1171
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Then I do three again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do two sessions.</v>

1172
00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I do two back to back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go in,</v>

1173
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:13.980
<v Speaker 2>you do two or three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three minutes,</v>

1174
00:56:13.981 --> 00:56:14.814
<v Speaker 2>and then my body warms back up to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once your skin temperature gets around </v>

1175
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.680
<v Speaker 2>84 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you get back in there.</v>

1176
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:22.440
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll go back in there again for</v>
<v Speaker 2>another three minutes.</v>

1177
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.020
<v Speaker 2>So wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many in an</v>

1178
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:25.510
<v Speaker 1>like you'll go into this place?</v>

1179
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:26.403
<v Speaker 3>Three minutes and then I wait for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes and then I go on for another </v>

1180
00:56:28.421 --> 00:56:30.620
<v Speaker 3>three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So usually to two sessions.</v>

1181
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:32.980
<v Speaker 3>Two sessions in one visit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1182
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how many times?</v>

1183
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.270
<v Speaker 3>How often?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many times a month whenever I can.</v>

1184
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:39.070
<v Speaker 3>But I've been mixing it up more with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sauna.</v>

1185
00:56:39.071 --> 00:56:43.060
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing a lot of sauna lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kinda like that as much if not more.</v>

1186
00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 3>Sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sauna,</v>

1187
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.113
<v Speaker 3>sauna seems to be really good for muscle</v>
<v Speaker 3>injuries and something about the sauna </v>

1188
00:56:49.121 --> 00:56:53.350
<v Speaker 3>for anytime to like muscle tissue or </v>
<v Speaker 3>soreness or weird shit.</v>

1189
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.830
<v Speaker 3>Sauna just blows that all out and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is also one of those things.</v>

1190
00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 3>It's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is your body reacting to extremes,</v>

1191
00:56:59.771 --> 00:57:00.604
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's extreme cold or extreme </v>

1192
00:57:01.511 --> 00:57:02.344
<v Speaker 3>heat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body produces heat shock proteins </v>

1193
00:57:03.821 --> 00:57:04.654
<v Speaker 3>and cold truck proteins and all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are doing is reducing </v>

1194
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:07.740
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1195
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:09.380
<v Speaker 3>that's the number one thing.</v>

1196
00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 3>Like you want to feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reduce inflammation,</v>

1197
00:57:11.621 --> 00:57:12.454
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the best ways to manipulate your </v>

1198
00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:17.320
<v Speaker 3>body is either through carf cryotherapy </v>
<v Speaker 3>or through sauna.</v>

1199
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:20.380
<v Speaker 3>Both of those things are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1200
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Someone I know that she says it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>about inflammation.</v>

1201
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.810
<v Speaker 3>GotTa beat the inflammation and cut out </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the sugar.</v>

1202
00:57:25.811 --> 00:57:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Cut out the carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut out all the bread,</v>

1203
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:30.010
<v Speaker 3>cut it all the alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can do that,</v>

1204
00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:33.250
<v Speaker 3>you'll massively reduce inflammation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for Gospel is all that.</v>

1205
00:57:33.251 --> 00:57:36.100
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing good in there for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

1206
00:57:36.101 --> 00:57:38.620
<v Speaker 3>And once your body gets used to it too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's really interesting.</v>

1207
00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:41.830
<v Speaker 3>You didn't even really crave it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I still like ice cream.</v>

1208
00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:44.200
<v Speaker 3>I still enjoy like a dessert or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

1209
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:45.034
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have the same impact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he used to like I see a sandwich and I </v>

1210
00:57:48.261 --> 00:57:48.850
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1211
00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:51.250
<v Speaker 3>get that sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that Pastrami Sandwich,</v>

1212
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.160
<v Speaker 3>big thick bread and that doesn't do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me anymore.</v>

1213
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't recognize what that is like.</v>

1214
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the trick.</v>

1215
00:57:58.751 --> 00:57:59.860
<v Speaker 3>That's not even really food.</v>

1216
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:01.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1217
00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:02.243
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat as much as I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel so much better when I just </v>

1218
00:58:07.141 --> 00:58:10.440
<v Speaker 1>skipped the middle meal and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose idea was it?</v>

1219
00:58:10.441 --> 00:58:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Three meals a day anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to.</v>

1220
00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:13.403
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I found that I can live very </v>

1221
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.553
<v Speaker 1>comfortably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into like torturing myself so </v>

1222
00:58:18.151 --> 00:58:21.330
<v Speaker 1>like I'm going to starve and nail myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this chair,</v>

1223
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:22.673
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm too distracted to work as I'm </v>

1224
00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:25.734
<v Speaker 1>hungry I need to address that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I found is if I just kind of </v>

1225
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:30.263
<v Speaker 1>don't eat a lot after a couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a jet in the high air where </v>

1226
00:58:35.671 --> 00:58:36.504
<v Speaker 1>you're burning no fuel because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just in the thin air where I walked pie </v>

1227
00:58:39.961 --> 00:58:41.220
<v Speaker 1>food going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

1228
00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:42.533
<v Speaker 1>I've had like two meals in the last two </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half meals like in the last three </v>

1229
00:58:45.541 --> 00:58:47.880
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel fine actually.</v>

1230
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:48.713
<v Speaker 1>I feel like really bouncy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't need the postworkout seven </v>

1231
00:58:52.621 --> 00:58:54.130
<v Speaker 1>minute power nap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1232
00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do intermittent fasting at all?</v>

1233
00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1234
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:03.150
<v Speaker 1>On the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman I work with,</v>

1235
00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.193
<v Speaker 1>you know Heidi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she does that sometimes and I'll just </v>

1236
00:59:06.361 --> 00:59:08.130
<v Speaker 1>follow her lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she'll go,</v>

1237
00:59:08.131 --> 00:59:09.240
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me do this.</v>

1238
00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll try that because I just don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

1239
00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:14.010
<v Speaker 1>And she knows a lot more about it than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1240
00:59:14.011 --> 00:59:19.011
<v Speaker 1>So I just do what she does and so a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago I had got into like one meal a</v>

1241
00:59:19.891 --> 00:59:21.170
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying it out,</v>

1242
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.093
<v Speaker 1>no one told me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in India of all places and I was </v>

1243
00:59:24.951 --> 00:59:25.784
<v Speaker 1>out all day taking photos and sweating </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would eat dinner and that will be </v>

1244
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 1>it and I would sleep through breakfast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go back out and with my camera.</v>

1245
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:33.883
<v Speaker 1>So dinner became my meal and the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>three days of that was a little tough </v>

1246
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.310
<v Speaker 1>and then it was like I never wanted.</v>

1247
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:44.480
<v Speaker 1>I kind of felt bad when I went back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the western or I'm eating a lot of food.</v>

1248
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Your body adapts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1249
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:47.343
<v Speaker 1>well we can adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can live on pizza for the rest of </v>

1250
00:59:48.681 --> 00:59:50.750
<v Speaker 1>your life very happily all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1251
00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:52.760
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your body really does adapt to that.</v>

1252
00:59:52.761 --> 00:59:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Intermittent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That time will know what I'm saying.</v>

1253
00:59:54.381 --> 00:59:55.214
<v Speaker 1>It'll adapt to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll adapt to too much food and little </v>

1254
00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:01.130
<v Speaker 1>depth to like a fraction of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to eat right here.</v>

1255
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:01.964
<v Speaker 1>But just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I have found when I start </v>

1256
01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.620
<v Speaker 1>limiting the food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more alert,</v>

1257
01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>my sleep is more restorative and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounce out of bed,</v>

1258
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:16.961
<v Speaker 1>like just flying out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that afternoon drowsiness.</v>

1259
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I just stay with it and I just feel way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more buoyant and present a type faster,</v>

1260
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>just concentrate more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I,</v>

1261
01:00:28.381 --> 01:00:29.214
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm on tour it's usually I do one </v>

1262
01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>point something meals a day like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to leave on tour.</v>

1263
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>It'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an evening meal post show.</v>

1264
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.633
<v Speaker 4>I put myself into an eight hour feeding </v>
<v Speaker 4>window and 16 hour fasting window every </v>

1265
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:42.763
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've been pretty consistent with </v>

1266
01:00:44.151 --> 01:00:45.800
<v Speaker 4>that over the last like four or five </v>
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>

1267
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:47.810
<v Speaker 4>And as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has a big impact man.</v>

1268
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.490
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I eat dinner,</v>

1269
01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say if I'm done at 8:00,</v>

1270
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:52.573
<v Speaker 4>just I just time it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sixteen hours later is when my first </v>

1271
01:00:55.281 --> 01:00:56.114
<v Speaker 4>meal comes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can have a coffee in between now and </v>

1272
01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:58.933
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But nothing with any real significant </v>

1273
01:01:00.861 --> 01:01:03.410
<v Speaker 4>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just having some liquid or something</v>

1274
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:04.370
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's it.</v>

1275
01:01:04.371 --> 01:01:06.860
<v Speaker 4>And then it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by doing that man,</v>

1276
01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.220
<v Speaker 4>just like a wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not craving breakfast,</v>

1277
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even hungry.</v>

1278
01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:13.880
<v Speaker 4>My body's just totally adapted to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1279
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:14.923
<v Speaker 4>just gives your body a chance to digest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're always in a state of </v>

1280
01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:21.220
<v Speaker 4>feeding and your body just never has </v>
<v Speaker 4>really a chance to digest it.</v>

1281
01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Juggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1282
01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:26.510
<v Speaker 1>the body's like as it's processing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incoming,</v>

1283
01:01:26.511 --> 01:01:27.344
<v Speaker 1>like really another order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it never gets to realize digestion </v>

1284
01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:33.580
<v Speaker 1>and we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always in your like a cow.</v>

1285
01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:34.863
<v Speaker 1>They're always processing nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder if that's a western model </v>

1286
01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.790
<v Speaker 1>because in other parts of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people live very differently than we do.</v>

1287
01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:46.960
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>

1288
01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.273
<v Speaker 1>And a meal is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost just a thing that happens </v>

1289
01:01:51.491 --> 01:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>now in then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's dinner time and we're</v>

1290
01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:57.790
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about report cards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering.</v>

1291
01:01:57.791 --> 01:02:02.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like the whole family works all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the city and they're going to eat.</v>

1292
01:02:02.321 --> 01:02:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I think at some point wherever even </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep you go to like Parse,</v>

1293
01:02:06.491 --> 01:02:07.324
<v Speaker 1>like Vietnam and people just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping behind the counter of the </v>

1294
01:02:10.061 --> 01:02:10.894
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They work at because they've been for a </v>

1295
01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>day and a half because mom can't come </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1296
01:02:14.321 --> 01:02:15.154
<v Speaker 1>So there were you running the store and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sleep business thing that you get </v>

1297
01:02:17.711 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think food is</v>

1298
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.360
<v Speaker 2>like that in a lot of parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1299
01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:22.194
<v Speaker 2>like a meal a wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next time I eat will be the next </v>

1300
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.450
<v Speaker 2>time I eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go to these places,</v>

1301
01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:29.580
<v Speaker 2>and I know you traveled pretty much all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world,</v>

1302
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:34.850
<v Speaker 2>do you go out of your way to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sample in as wide a variety as the local</v>

1303
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:35.910
<v Speaker 2>cuisines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

1304
01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.793
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1305
01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Depends on where I go and I'm not that </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who just brings it all from home and</v>

1306
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:47.181
<v Speaker 2>I never leave home when I'm abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't afford to eat a bad meal and</v>

1307
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:51.570
<v Speaker 2>be bedridden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bedridden for the next day when I should</v>

1308
01:02:51.571 --> 01:02:53.850
<v Speaker 2>be out hitting the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at stuff.</v>

1309
01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:55.830
<v Speaker 2>And so I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1310
01:02:55.831 --> 01:02:56.664
<v Speaker 2>as you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you run into the bad meal where you're </v>

1311
01:02:58.321 --> 01:03:01.530
<v Speaker 2>like hugging a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching the arc of vomit,</v>

1312
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.580
<v Speaker 2>like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Linda Blair.</v>

1313
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:08.390
<v Speaker 2>And I've done that from here to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Myenmar and Russia,</v>

1314
01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:10.020
<v Speaker 2>wherever I've had some bad meals.</v>

1315
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:14.670
<v Speaker 2>And so when the food looks dodgy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the interior of Africa where you</v>

1316
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.130
<v Speaker 2>pointed the meat object and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

1317
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.983
<v Speaker 2>And the guy will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's goat Clif bar just because </v>

1318
01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I've learned to do,</v>

1319
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:28.770
<v Speaker 2>and it's hard on your back because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of weight.</v>

1320
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I take say I'm going to be out in Africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>for two weeks.</v>

1321
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I bring about two meals worth of chow </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

1322
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:39.390
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of cliff bars,</v>

1323
01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:41.160
<v Speaker 2>a lot of like peanut butter and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1324
01:03:41.161 --> 01:03:41.994
<v Speaker 2>things that just don't go bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And heat where I can just look at the </v>

1325
01:03:45.871 --> 01:03:47.160
<v Speaker 2>food and gum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1326
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.023
<v Speaker 2>not tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a handful of almonds </v>

1327
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>and this and water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also in parts of the world where water's</v>

1328
01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:55.890
<v Speaker 2>dodgy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find a store,</v>

1329
01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.473
<v Speaker 2>you buy the box of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rip it open to make sure it hasn't been </v>

1330
01:03:59.881 --> 01:04:01.410
<v Speaker 2>tampered with by the whole box.</v>

1331
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Put it in your backpack and look 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds of water for the next five days.</v>

1332
01:04:05.611 --> 01:04:08.980
<v Speaker 2>It sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't be somewhere and go like,</v>

1333
01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:09.903
<v Speaker 2>I'm thirsty and I don't know about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>water because they have these portable </v>

1334
01:04:14.071 --> 01:04:14.904
<v Speaker 2>backpack filters and stary pens and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that a lot of backpack hikers </v>

1335
01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:19.401
<v Speaker 2>they use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1336
01:04:19.401 --> 01:04:20.970
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very small now.</v>

1337
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.550
<v Speaker 2>They're very small and lightweight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get some,</v>

1338
01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:26.040
<v Speaker 2>like if you're staying in a place that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it has dodgy water,</v>

1339
01:04:26.041 --> 01:04:28.980
<v Speaker 2>you can get a gravity filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put water,</v>

1340
01:04:28.981 --> 01:04:31.380
<v Speaker 2>like you can literally get rain water </v>
<v Speaker 2>from outside in a puddle.</v>

1341
01:04:31.381 --> 01:04:32.214
<v Speaker 2>And I know a lot of people do that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they take it and they put it in this </v>

1342
01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:35.244
<v Speaker 2>large gravity filter in a drip down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like it looks like someone's </v>

1343
01:04:38.371 --> 01:04:42.330
<v Speaker 2>peeing at the bottom of this huge bag of</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 liter bag of water,</v>

1344
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:46.320
<v Speaker 2>but it filters at all and it allows you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to drink basically puddle water,</v>

1345
01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:47.071
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1346
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:52.071
<v Speaker 2>I've never gotten that high tech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in some pretty dodgy places,</v>

1347
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:53.993
<v Speaker 2>but I've always been somewhere in prep </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a city before I go into the </v>

1348
01:04:58.621 --> 01:05:00.420
<v Speaker 2>countryside where I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1349
01:05:00.421 --> 01:05:03.210
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be five days before I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like this again,</v>

1350
01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>so I'm provisioning for eight days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one,</v>

1351
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:07.194
<v Speaker 2>but usually google stary pen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should get one of these things </v>

1352
01:05:10.171 --> 01:05:11.370
<v Speaker 2>because this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing is so,</v>

1353
01:05:11.371 --> 01:05:12.204
<v Speaker 2>so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it basically looks like a pen </v>

1354
01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>and it works with ultraviolet light and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you put it in like say if</v>

1355
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.050
<v Speaker 4>you have a glass of water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just stir this into water.</v>

1356
01:05:20.051 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 4>It kills everything in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>

1357
01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:22.901
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1358
01:05:22.901 --> 01:05:25.030
<v Speaker 4>It'll still give us this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There it is right there.</v>

1359
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.013
<v Speaker 4>So if there's buffalo pis and the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still going to smell like buffalo </v>

1360
01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:29.824
<v Speaker 4>pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not gonna kill you and it won't </v>

1361
01:05:31.391 --> 01:05:33.490
<v Speaker 4>give you Giardia and it won't give you </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything else.</v>

1362
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.211
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's smart.</v>

1363
01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not big.</v>

1364
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:37.240
<v Speaker 4>It's a small little device.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see it,</v>

1365
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:38.660
<v Speaker 4>this handheld,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1366
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:39.970
<v Speaker 4>those are drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's smart.</v>

1367
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a different thing.</v>

1368
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:42.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1369
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:47.701
<v Speaker 4>because there's parts of mainly Africa </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you go really in the water,</v>

1370
01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.730
<v Speaker 4>like that's a lot of sketches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking,</v>

1371
01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:54.010
<v Speaker 4>like clearing the larva out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1372
01:05:54.011 --> 01:05:56.080
<v Speaker 4>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean that's,</v>

1373
01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:58.600
<v Speaker 4>that's our water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My good friend Justin Wren,</v>

1374
01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:01.930
<v Speaker 4>he runs a charity called fight for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>forgotten where they build wells for the</v>

1375
01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:02.764
<v Speaker 4>pygmies in the Congo and he's had </v>
<v Speaker 4>malaria three times from going over </v>

1376
01:06:06.011 --> 01:06:06.190
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1377
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:07.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's A.</v>

1378
01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:11.170
<v Speaker 4>He's a beautiful human being like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy sacrifices so much.</v>

1379
01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:13.840
<v Speaker 4>He's in the Congo several months out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>every year.</v>

1380
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:15.610
<v Speaker 4>Tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>

1381
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.533
<v Speaker 4>It's very dangerous and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got some crazy stories about it </v>

1382
01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:19.930
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1383
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:24.310
<v Speaker 4>these people that you see little </v>
<v Speaker 4>children with horrible distended bellies</v>

1384
01:06:24.311 --> 01:06:27.010
<v Speaker 4>because they're filled with parasites </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's heartbreaking.</v>

1385
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:30.810
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it is clean water and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're developing their.</v>

1386
01:06:30.811 --> 01:06:31.644
<v Speaker 4>There initially partnered up with water </v>
<v Speaker 4>four and now he's kind of doing it all </v>

1387
01:06:33.731 --> 01:06:35.650
<v Speaker 4>on his own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in through this,</v>

1388
01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:38.980
<v Speaker 4>one of my responses called the cash app </v>
<v Speaker 4>and through the cash app,</v>

1389
01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.273
<v Speaker 4>we've already raised thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars to build several wells in the </v>

1390
01:06:43.091 --> 01:06:43.924
<v Speaker 4>Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're constantly raising more money and </v>

1391
01:06:45.581 --> 01:06:48.400
<v Speaker 4>building more wells and it changes their</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1392
01:06:48.401 --> 01:06:52.540
<v Speaker 4>If free actual clear water that comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the ground,</v>

1393
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:54.910
<v Speaker 4>he see these people celebrating and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dancing.</v>

1394
01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:57.880
<v Speaker 4>When the wells get turned on like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is so powerful.</v>

1395
01:06:57.881 --> 01:06:59.530
<v Speaker 4>You just think of water is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh hey,</v>

1396
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:01.150
<v Speaker 4>here's some water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a bottle.</v>

1397
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.950
<v Speaker 4>But to them it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's everything,</v>

1398
01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:03.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1399
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:03.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on and off with the </v>

1400
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:06.833
<v Speaker 1>Water Ngo for many years called drop in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bucket and I've been to Uganda and </v>

1401
01:07:09.881 --> 01:07:14.340
<v Speaker 1>south Sudan with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drill it schools and you know,</v>

1402
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:17.860
<v Speaker 1>as a Westerner of water system thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sing in the shower with,</v>

1403
01:07:17.861 --> 01:07:18.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

1404
01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:19.790
<v Speaker 1>it's always around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1405
01:07:19.791 --> 01:07:20.624
<v Speaker 1>you trip over the bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much water in other parts of </v>

1406
01:07:23.681 --> 01:07:25.120
<v Speaker 1>the world as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much.</v>

1407
01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:26.373
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see the impact of water on the </v>

1408
01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.073
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things you don't think </v>

1409
01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:30.634
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was at this one school where </v>

1410
01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:34.180
<v Speaker 1>they had drilled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping the bucket,</v>

1411
01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:37.690
<v Speaker 1>had drilled before and we were there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>visit the well and meet the kids.</v>

1412
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Masaka it's,</v>

1413
01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.433
<v Speaker 1>I think north of Kampala and what one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drop in the bucket people said is </v>

1414
01:07:45.391 --> 01:07:48.610
<v Speaker 1>like they now have toilets and running </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

1415
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand what that means for </v>
<v Speaker 1>female literacy?</v>

1416
01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:55.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean a woman?</v>

1417
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.330
<v Speaker 1>A girl hits a certain age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes through a major,</v>

1418
01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.193
<v Speaker 1>major physiological change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's not running water in a way </v>

1419
01:08:01.601 --> 01:08:02.434
<v Speaker 1>for her to clean herself up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of potential shame and </v>

1420
01:08:05.861 --> 01:08:09.370
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stopped going to school because it's</v>

1421
01:08:09.371 --> 01:08:14.371
<v Speaker 1>not a way to keep yourself together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you stopped your learning stops at young</v>

1422
01:08:16.191 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>adulthood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with running water in a way to,</v>

1423
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we westerners do,</v>

1424
01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.353
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily you keep yourself a hygienic and </v>

1425
01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>you can go back to class and learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

1426
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:30.890
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never would've thought of that had I</v>

1427
01:08:30.891 --> 01:08:35.690
<v Speaker 1>not come on this trip and it hit me like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a truck because he's the water.</v>

1428
01:08:35.691 --> 01:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water means so much more.</v>

1429
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Just dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to be clean.</v>

1430
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.863
<v Speaker 1>You and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we throw our clothes in the laundry </v>

1431
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clean clothes.</v>

1432
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:46.004
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see these women walking eight miles </v>

1433
01:08:47.721 --> 01:08:50.960
<v Speaker 1>each way with the jerry cans of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of that's for drinking.</v>

1434
01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:51.853
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it's for cleaning clothes </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're sending their kid to a </v>

1435
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:56.350
<v Speaker 1>school and want the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1436
01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.750
<v Speaker 1>human dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and all of that is a big,</v>

1437
01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have dignity without the water</v>

1438
01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>because water means I don't stink and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you must take me.</v>

1439
01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.673
<v Speaker 1>You must respect me as a person because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't smell like I've been living in </v>

1440
01:09:09.831 --> 01:09:12.020
<v Speaker 1>these clothes for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1441
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot of that by traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But traveling with that NGO was a,</v>

1442
01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:18.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like going to class.</v>

1443
01:09:18.651 --> 01:09:20.420
<v Speaker 1>It was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1444
01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:21.140
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1445
01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:22.330
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's know.</v>

1446
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.110
<v Speaker 1>That's something I never would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered.</v>

1447
01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.280
<v Speaker 1>And human dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1448
01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:31.520
<v Speaker 1>why we have a lot of angry people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world because you and I as Westerners,</v>

1449
01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:37.180
<v Speaker 1>we don't suffer the indignities that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't suffer that a lot of people in the</v>

1450
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.820
<v Speaker 1>world work hard to not suffer.</v>

1451
01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Like they have to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1452
01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I have to go get the water today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1453
01:09:44.331 --> 01:09:45.164
<v Speaker 1>that's a long trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to walk to Long Beach and back to </v>

1454
01:09:47.271 --> 01:09:52.270
<v Speaker 1>get the water because there's no tap and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got kids and you know,</v>

1455
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:53.203
<v Speaker 1>infants and I got to make this work </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can't have my family stinking </v>

1456
01:09:58.940 --> 01:09:59.773
<v Speaker 1>and I got to do the cooking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you don't get eaten by a </v>

1457
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:04.250
<v Speaker 1>crocodile and were taught by a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The monkey.</v>

1458
01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:06.830
<v Speaker 1>They smell the water and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mug you for the water.</v>

1459
01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1460
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.923
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just assault yield bite and he </v>

1461
01:10:10.051 --> 01:10:10.884
<v Speaker 1>grabbed the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock it over and just lick it off the </v>

1462
01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:13.004
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet people get assaulted in dry season </v>

1463
01:10:14.331 --> 01:10:15.890
<v Speaker 1>by monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1464
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these creeps.</v>

1465
01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:22.460
<v Speaker 1>But just you see what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not trying to be rockstars.</v>

1466
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:23.323
<v Speaker 1>All they want to do is what you and I do</v>
<v Speaker 1>just without even thinking twice and </v>

1467
01:10:27.711 --> 01:10:28.220
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1468
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:31.190
<v Speaker 1>it's made me as an older guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pushing 60.</v>

1469
01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:35.960
<v Speaker 1>It's made me really reconsider human </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

1470
01:10:35.961 --> 01:10:40.040
<v Speaker 1>like our current political climate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people talk to each other now.</v>

1471
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:40.874
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes kind of terrifying and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes me really reconsider human </v>

1472
01:10:45.351 --> 01:10:48.260
<v Speaker 1>dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect patients.</v>

1473
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with,</v>

1474
01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.480
<v Speaker 1>but they're coming from something real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something very real there,</v>

1475
01:10:56.390 --> 01:11:01.390
<v Speaker 1>an honest propelled them to make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign or to do that thing and the,</v>

1476
01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.793
<v Speaker 1>the cause and effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there may be wrongheaded what </v>

1477
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:08.083
<v Speaker 1>the causes real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the effect is sincerely the action </v>

1478
01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:13.680
<v Speaker 1>of sincerely held</v>

1479
01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:19.130
<v Speaker 2>that the motivation and it's that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of travel and looking how,</v>

1480
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:21.150
<v Speaker 2>looking at how people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want much,</v>

1481
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:24.720
<v Speaker 2>they just want to get by by and large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1482
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:30.950
<v Speaker 2>it's made me reconsider kind of how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually everyone out in the world.</v>

1483
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm getting better at it because</v>

1484
01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.070
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is hard.</v>

1485
01:11:35.071 --> 01:11:38.910
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you pay attention to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you keep concentrating on,</v>

1486
01:11:38.911 --> 01:11:40.770
<v Speaker 2>as you get older you do get better at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1487
01:11:40.771 --> 01:11:41.604
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that someone who's almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>60 is still learning like that is just </v>

1488
01:11:45.421 --> 01:11:46.710
<v Speaker 2>how we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1489
01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:47.563
<v Speaker 2>and we have this weird idea that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are static and they meet a guy and he's </v>

1490
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:54.060
<v Speaker 2>70 when you meet him when he's 75 is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be the same guy if not worse,</v>

1491
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:56.640
<v Speaker 2>but no people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're capable of growth.</v>

1492
01:11:56.641 --> 01:11:59.280
<v Speaker 2>As long as they're alive and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated,</v>

1493
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:02.310
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll grow as much as you want to ask.</v>

1494
01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:05.370
<v Speaker 2>And I've met 70 year old who wear me </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1495
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep up with this.</v>

1496
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I go in some little cool eco travel</v>
<v Speaker 2>trips.</v>

1497
01:12:09.691 --> 01:12:11.580
<v Speaker 2>You go like Antarctica and these old </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1498
01:12:11.581 --> 01:12:12.460
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1499
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.340
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to take a photo or shorts.</v>

1500
01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.753
<v Speaker 2>And then you meet people who are 22 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so burned out and they're so </v>

1501
01:12:20.431 --> 01:12:21.510
<v Speaker 2>hard to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1502
01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:23.460
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had your youth,</v>

1503
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I'd be bouncing off the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

1504
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:27.623
<v Speaker 2>And it's just a mindset and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of surrounding factors and </v>

1505
01:12:31.051 --> 01:12:34.650
<v Speaker 2>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's really just what you want to do</v>

1506
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:35.583
<v Speaker 2>at a certain part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have very little sympathy for adults </v>

1507
01:12:38.011 --> 01:12:39.930
<v Speaker 2>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're 35.</v>

1508
01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.810
<v Speaker 2>This is all you pal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your addictions,</v>

1509
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.830
<v Speaker 2>your crap marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all you like.</v>

1510
01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1511
01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I did so much coke.</v>

1512
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:49.463
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a house anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of coke and I'm sorry that </v>

1513
01:12:54.331 --> 01:12:57.780
<v Speaker 2>you're living in a box or in a van down </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the river.</v>

1514
01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:00.660
<v Speaker 2>But come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a long hill.</v>

1515
01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:01.680
<v Speaker 2>You slid down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.000
<v Speaker 2>So get up and don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't make the same mistake.</v>

1517
01:13:06.001 --> 01:13:07.080
<v Speaker 2>But adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

1518
01:13:07.081 --> 01:13:07.914
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know who you are at this point and </v>

1519
01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:11.370
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you can be.</v>

1520
01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.800
<v Speaker 2>And at this point I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I abhor rudeness.</v>

1521
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I hate it when I'm rude.</v>

1522
01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:16.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

1523
01:13:16.711 --> 01:13:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I have to punish myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

1524
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:20.663
<v Speaker 2>as I get older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working as best as I can to be more </v>

1525
01:13:24.211 --> 01:13:25.044
<v Speaker 2>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be more polite and more patient just </v>

1526
01:13:28.021 --> 01:13:32.620
<v Speaker 2>so I'm more it unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like onstage,</v>

1527
01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.473
<v Speaker 2>I don't curse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no way you can marginalize </v>

1528
01:13:36.811 --> 01:13:38.800
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when you're doing your,</v>

1529
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:39.643
<v Speaker 2>you're live speaking shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have these discussions and you're </v>

1530
01:13:42.361 --> 01:13:44.400
<v Speaker 2>talking about crazy things that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

1531
01:13:44.401 --> 01:13:46.770
<v Speaker 2>You don't swear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many times have I sworn in this room</v>

1532
01:13:46.771 --> 01:13:49.830
<v Speaker 2>with you right now on that today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you have.</v>

1533
01:13:49.831 --> 01:13:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep track.</v>

1534
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1535
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:56.190
<v Speaker 2>many years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 10 years ago,</v>

1536
01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:57.563
<v Speaker 2>I was going out with a woman who never </v>
<v Speaker 2>cursed and I work with people who don't </v>

1537
01:14:01.081 --> 01:14:05.070
<v Speaker 2>curse in the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get their point across and I,</v>

1538
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:06.083
<v Speaker 2>this girl I was going out with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's fantastic and she never cursed in </v>

1539
01:14:09.121 --> 01:14:11.140
<v Speaker 2>my sailor speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1540
01:14:11.141 --> 01:14:11.974
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1541
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.083
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any company here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also Barack Obama and presidents </v>

1542
01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:18.653
<v Speaker 1>have traditionally don't curse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's had such a good way with words </v>

1543
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:25.270
<v Speaker 1>that just admired him on the stump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was all written for him,</v>

1544
01:14:25.271 --> 01:14:27.140
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1545
01:14:27.141 --> 01:14:30.340
<v Speaker 1>I just like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the men carried himself and I said I</v>

1546
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:31.174
<v Speaker 1>want to be more like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just in Australia a couple of </v>

1547
01:14:33.641 --> 01:14:34.220
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1548
01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.060
<v Speaker 1>speaking and I was on a very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>panel about me too.</v>

1549
01:14:37.061 --> 01:14:37.894
<v Speaker 1>I was the only male on the panel is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating and a guy came up with his </v>

1550
01:14:42.341 --> 01:14:43.180
<v Speaker 1>kids like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1551
01:14:43.181 --> 01:14:44.014
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan and I want my kids to meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and my son's 11 and I want them to </v>

1552
01:14:48.101 --> 01:14:50.350
<v Speaker 1>come see one of your shows one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1553
01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.390
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he should see me on my next tour</v>

1554
01:14:52.391 --> 01:14:53.870
<v Speaker 1>here in 20 slash 20 will.</v>

1555
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:54.491
<v Speaker 1>He'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1556
01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:56.050
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

1557
01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not seeing my show is namby </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pamby,</v>

1558
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.970
<v Speaker 1>but I want to be unavoidable where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can write me off.</v>

1559
01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Say I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

1560
01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Disagree with me that that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1561
01:15:07.181 --> 01:15:08.014
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just a foul mouth so we don't have </v>

1562
01:15:09.101 --> 01:15:09.934
<v Speaker 1>to take him seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give you that handle to </v>

1563
01:15:12.281 --> 01:15:15.090
<v Speaker 1>jerk me around line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a plenty of other handles.</v>

1564
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.030
<v Speaker 1>You can turn it around by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1565
01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:18.173
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm just trying to not give </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that angle and it forces me to </v>

1566
01:15:22.301 --> 01:15:27.301
<v Speaker 1>evolve my point of view where those </v>
<v Speaker 1>words are fun and hyperbolic,</v>

1567
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:31.640
<v Speaker 3>but they just don't necessarily don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>serve me.</v>

1568
01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.340
<v Speaker 3>They don't get across what I want to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>across.</v>

1569
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:35.203
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think that you're probably best </v>

1570
01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.350
<v Speaker 3>what you should do it anyway you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm.</v>

1571
01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:46.420
<v Speaker 3>What I'm thinking is that what one way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to use those words is to have your point</v>

1572
01:15:47.811 --> 01:15:50.720
<v Speaker 3>is clear as possible and then use them </v>
<v Speaker 3>rarely.</v>

1573
01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:51.893
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of the things when I was </v>

1574
01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:55.420
<v Speaker 3>starting doing comedy back in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would do,</v>

1575
01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:56.283
<v Speaker 3>they would call the FEC meter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would say you don't want to go </v>

1576
01:15:58.221 --> 01:15:59.054
<v Speaker 3>onstage and say fuck every other word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of people use the word </v>

1577
01:16:01.701 --> 01:16:04.260
<v Speaker 3>fuck and place of the word Om.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1578
01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:07.190
<v Speaker 3>they're like fucking guides fucking says</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

1579
01:16:07.191 --> 01:16:09.080
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fucking tell you what to</v>

1580
01:16:09.081 --> 01:16:12.800
<v Speaker 3>fucking do that as you're just poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>

1581
01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:14.930
<v Speaker 3>This is a shitty economy of words.</v>

1582
01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:18.740
<v Speaker 3>So that word you've given it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've used it so many times,</v>

1583
01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:21.680
<v Speaker 3>you've given away all its meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean anything anymore.</v>

1584
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:22.910
<v Speaker 3>So when you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

1585
01:16:22.911 --> 01:16:25.190
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean anything anymore.</v>

1586
01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you say it like once a year,</v>

1587
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.810
<v Speaker 3>if you say fuck you once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means a lot.</v>

1588
01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Everyone will believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1589
01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1590
01:16:33.141 --> 01:16:34.760
<v Speaker 3>he's serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1591
01:16:34.761 --> 01:16:37.100
<v Speaker 3>if you just drop it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1592
01:16:37.101 --> 01:16:38.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in the first amendment.</v>

1593
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:42.050
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it's when you use that stuff,</v>

1594
01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:47.090
<v Speaker 3>you come in as one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everyone you kind of read the result</v>

1595
01:16:47.601 --> 01:16:51.530
<v Speaker 3>is something else to sell a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in front of some people's eyes.</v>

1596
01:16:51.531 --> 01:16:52.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1597
01:16:52.161 --> 01:16:56.240
<v Speaker 3>you certainly limit your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a digestability yeah.</v>

1598
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:58.760
<v Speaker 3>And impact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1599
01:16:58.761 --> 01:16:59.594
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be articulate than </v>

1600
01:17:01.881 --> 01:17:03.950
<v Speaker 3>overbearing and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1601
01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:06.890
<v Speaker 3>I watched the news and some of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pundits are very,</v>

1602
01:17:06.891 --> 01:17:08.900
<v Speaker 3>very educated and they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very sharp.</v>

1603
01:17:08.901 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 3>They're for living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they</v>

1604
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:11.203
<v Speaker 2>comp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make commentary for a living and </v>

1605
01:17:12.771 --> 01:17:14.570
<v Speaker 2>they're damn good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

1606
01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:16.790
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hell of a sentence.</v>

1607
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I might like to be able to have rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that Monday.</v>

1608
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:22.080
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1609
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.290
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what I admire as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1610
01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I start shrinking with age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1611
01:17:28.251 --> 01:17:29.084
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting that the difference </v>

1612
01:17:31.101 --> 01:17:33.230
<v Speaker 2>between writing something and saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1613
01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.393
<v Speaker 2>so as you do your spoken word shows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have these stories that you want to </v>

1614
01:17:38.991 --> 01:17:39.824
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine that you probably </v>

1615
01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:46.691
<v Speaker 2>write out a good most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do that or do some of it?</v>

1616
01:17:48.021 --> 01:17:50.900
<v Speaker 2>You just know the story so you just tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story the way.</v>

1617
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.630
<v Speaker 2>When I'm out in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be out all day,</v>

1618
01:17:53.631 --> 01:17:56.450
<v Speaker 2>like taking photos or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fooling with the locals,</v>

1619
01:17:56.451 --> 01:17:57.284
<v Speaker 2>getting information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I come back somewhere and I write </v>

1620
01:18:00.231 --> 01:18:02.150
<v Speaker 2>it up or we'll take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1621
01:18:02.151 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you're in a place like Haiti,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be outside at noon.</v>

1622
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.700
<v Speaker 2>The Sun will just like beat you up so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you find shade,</v>

1623
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:08.563
<v Speaker 2>make your notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm always trying to make notes and </v>

1624
01:18:10.191 --> 01:18:14.060
<v Speaker 2>then at night I write it all up a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That turns into a book,</v>

1625
01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:16.970
<v Speaker 2>like I use every part of the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I go somewhere,</v>

1626
01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I make soup jewelry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a coat.</v>

1627
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Every part gets used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1628
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:25.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the books come from that,</v>

1629
01:18:25.821 --> 01:18:26.654
<v Speaker 2>but some stories from those travels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mold them over in my mind and I like </v>

1630
01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.640
<v Speaker 2>the show for me when I'm onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't be mere rapport.</v>

1631
01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Tosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be something,</v>

1632
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.340
<v Speaker 2>there has to be an aroma coming from it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be built,</v>

1633
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.633
<v Speaker 2>there has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1634
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:44.840
<v Speaker 2>something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1635
01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:49.340
<v Speaker 2>wisdom or some kind of melody that comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the raw information.</v>

1636
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:51.650
<v Speaker 2>Like I took all these notes and got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>houses,</v>

1637
01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.330
<v Speaker 2>the holy album,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just,</v>

1638
01:18:53.370 --> 01:18:56.210
<v Speaker 2>if it's component parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was mixed together in a way where</v>

1639
01:18:56.211 --> 01:18:57.410
<v Speaker 2>it's like this beautiful thing.</v>

1640
01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:01.220
<v Speaker 2>And so that often takes weeks were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1641
01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:02.293
<v Speaker 2>I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the story where the guy fell </v>

1642
01:19:03.861 --> 01:19:05.840
<v Speaker 2>over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

1643
01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:08.300
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't six weeks of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1644
01:19:08.301 --> 01:19:10.190
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not the story.</v>

1645
01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:13.220
<v Speaker 2>It's the guy who is watching and did </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

1646
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:14.533
<v Speaker 2>That's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden the whole angle </v>

1647
01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:18.043
<v Speaker 2>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'll mull these things over </v>

1648
01:19:20.571 --> 01:19:22.220
<v Speaker 2>because I have a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live alone.</v>

1649
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.130
<v Speaker 2>And so by the time a story gets to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>

1650
01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:29.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like a stone that's been rolled in </v>
<v Speaker 2>polished and I will.</v>

1651
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:32.510
<v Speaker 2>There's parts of the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ventura Boulevard where at night there's</v>

1652
01:19:32.511 --> 01:19:35.660
<v Speaker 2>nothing but dog walkers and joggers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the shops are closed.</v>

1653
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I will park in a parking lot and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk about a mile each way.</v>

1654
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Talking out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He saying the stories out loud.</v>

1655
01:19:45.151 --> 01:19:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Know you're looking for you now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1656
01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Henry's practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is one man show.</v>

1657
01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.470
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't get the location </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you will go,</v>

1658
01:19:51.471 --> 01:19:52.970
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that one.</v>

1659
01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I will let my brain here,</v>

1660
01:19:56.781 --> 01:20:00.470
<v Speaker 2>my voice say them and I'll make edits </v>
<v Speaker 2>while I'm walking.</v>

1661
01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:00.831
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1662
01:20:00.831 --> 01:20:01.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a dead end.</v>

1663
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:03.230
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1664
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:06.830
<v Speaker 2>and I've been doing this for years and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it on the treadmill and my,</v>

1665
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll just kind of mumble to myself </v>

1666
01:20:09.961 --> 01:20:11.370
<v Speaker 2>where people will come over to Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1667
01:20:11.371 --> 01:20:12.730
<v Speaker 2>are you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1668
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:13.321
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

1669
01:20:13.321 --> 01:20:15.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just say actor.</v>

1670
01:20:15.151 --> 01:20:16.380
<v Speaker 2>And they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1671
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:17.683
<v Speaker 2>know that that's the kind of preparation</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do because I don't believe in warmup </v>

1672
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:23.910
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who wants to see her warm up show?</v>

1673
01:20:23.911 --> 01:20:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks for your demo.</v>

1674
01:20:25.291 --> 01:20:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Like screw you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I paid money,</v>

1675
01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:28.213
<v Speaker 2>I won a game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I only understand come in with </v>

1676
01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:33.084
<v Speaker 2>the a game and so I do all my </v>
<v Speaker 2>woodshedding alone and so by the time I </v>

1677
01:20:37.351 --> 01:20:38.184
<v Speaker 2>hit stage it's that story is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved and then it continues to every </v>

1678
01:20:41.851 --> 01:20:42.810
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1679
01:20:42.811 --> 01:20:43.644
<v Speaker 2>I keep shading the parts off and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chiseled thing of beauty a few nights </v>

1680
01:20:47.341 --> 01:20:47.730
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1681
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:48.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found that you really can only do so </v>

1682
01:20:49.741 --> 01:20:52.650
<v Speaker 2>much on the written page or on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen.</v>

1683
01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:55.410
<v Speaker 2>You have to evolve it in front of a live</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

1684
01:20:55.411 --> 01:20:57.990
<v Speaker 2>especially with xander up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you're essentially doing.</v>

1685
01:20:57.991 --> 01:20:59.880
<v Speaker 2>You're pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing very.</v>

1686
01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:00.813
<v Speaker 2>I mean I listened to a bunch of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>older stuff and it's essentially a form </v>

1687
01:21:03.601 --> 01:21:05.120
<v Speaker 2>of standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1688
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:08.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>

1689
01:21:08.311 --> 01:21:09.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's rock and roll,</v>

1690
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:10.590
<v Speaker 2>there's blues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's jazz,</v>

1691
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:12.240
<v Speaker 2>there's different kinds of standup as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1692
01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Yours is a storytelling standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1693
01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:16.763
<v Speaker 2>And with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to evolve in front of the </v>

1694
01:21:18.421 --> 01:21:19.254
<v Speaker 2>live audience will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on my showtime special tomorrow </v>

1695
01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:23.250
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow night at 10 on showtime,</v>

1696
01:21:23.251 --> 01:21:25.410
<v Speaker 2>showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll hear stories and that's,</v>

1697
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of that is just storytelling.</v>

1698
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:32.100
<v Speaker 2>And it is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1699
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:33.283
<v Speaker 2>but I always leave room in my resume </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to tie myself to </v>

1700
01:21:39.241 --> 01:21:43.140
<v Speaker 2>comedy because when I'm telling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story about the,</v>

1701
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:44.143
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the part of wherever I would like </v>

1702
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Bangladesh I was in that wasn't funny.</v>

1703
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:52.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be in a comedy club with</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guy going,</v>

1704
01:21:52.231 --> 01:21:53.670
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't pay for this.</v>

1705
01:21:53.671 --> 01:21:54.750
<v Speaker 2>You make me laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot.</v>

1706
01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:59.040
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't want to be selling a </v>
<v Speaker 2>false bill of goods.</v>

1707
01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:00.700
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1708
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:04.110
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's quite often it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's not.</v>

1709
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.900
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>events plus time,</v>

1710
01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:10.560
<v Speaker 2>if someone didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there are no casualties,</v>

1711
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:14.700
<v Speaker 2>if it was this mere injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe an eye it is pretty funny,</v>

1712
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:18.900
<v Speaker 2>was a week later after the scabs have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen off a.</v>

1713
01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:20.580
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1714
01:22:20.581 --> 01:22:21.414
<v Speaker 2>the thing is also the you don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted sort of form in which you </v>

1715
01:22:26.551 --> 01:22:31.050
<v Speaker 2>have to perform in by doing it spoken </v>
<v Speaker 2>word style.</v>

1716
01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:32.880
<v Speaker 2>You essentially can do whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

1717
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I need that freedom.</v>

1718
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:36.660
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be dependent on pond to make you</v>

1719
01:22:36.661 --> 01:22:37.800
<v Speaker 2>laugh all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1720
01:22:37.801 --> 01:22:38.634
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's the thing about standup is </v>

1721
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:41.423
<v Speaker 2>part of it I really liked because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces you to use an economy of words </v>

1722
01:22:44.431 --> 01:22:45.264
<v Speaker 2>and boil your ideas down into this very </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear rhythm where you really keep </v>

1723
01:22:48.511 --> 01:22:51.990
<v Speaker 2>hammering them with laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of it is a win.</v>

1724
01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:53.003
<v Speaker 2>Where I get my freedom is from this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like from doing podcasts like so I can </v>

1725
01:22:56.101 --> 01:23:00.990
<v Speaker 2>express myself in ways and get thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 2>across where it doesn't have to have any</v>

1726
01:23:00.991 --> 01:23:03.090
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be funny or it can be.</v>

1727
01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:04.373
<v Speaker 2>It can be depressing or funny and sad or</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to realize itself in 11 </v>

1728
01:23:08.561 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1729
01:23:09.701 --> 01:23:10.534
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't have to have an impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is the thing about standup is </v>

1730
01:23:14.021 --> 01:23:14.854
<v Speaker 2>that you're always getting a reaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't get that reaction is </v>

1731
01:23:17.771 --> 01:23:20.230
<v Speaker 2>not successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can call it whatever you want you to</v>

1732
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:21.190
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this is stand up,</v>

1733
01:23:21.191 --> 01:23:22.024
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about stand up or I'm </v>

1734
01:23:23.681 --> 01:23:26.110
<v Speaker 2>talking about things that are tragic in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my standup.</v>

1735
01:23:26.111 --> 01:23:27.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's deeper and more meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1736
01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.390
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it's not really stand up.</v>

1737
01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Stand up is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1738
01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:35.140
<v Speaker 2>And once it stops being funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're doing something else,</v>

1739
01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:38.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing spoken word or you're doing</v>

1740
01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:41.170
<v Speaker 2>a play or a one person show or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1741
01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:42.023
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would never dare go into a comedy </v>

1742
01:23:43.271 --> 01:23:45.670
<v Speaker 2>club and do what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never do that.</v>

1743
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:48.070
<v Speaker 2>You never go to the Improv or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1744
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:48.933
<v Speaker 2>Two Times in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One time the venue I was supposed to be </v>

1745
01:23:52.121 --> 01:23:54.790
<v Speaker 2>and got knocked out because of a storm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they said,</v>

1746
01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:55.624
<v Speaker 2>we've moved your show too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the laugh dungeon that was in </v>

1747
01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:03.070
<v Speaker 2>someplace in the east coast with like </v>
<v Speaker 2>80,000 head shots on the wall,</v>

1748
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:07.060
<v Speaker 2>that little part case stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the PV boxes,</v>

1749
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:12.090
<v Speaker 2>the PA screwed into the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did my talking show my audience.</v>

1750
01:24:12.941 --> 01:24:14.410
<v Speaker 2>They're all sitting at these tables </v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

1751
01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 2>why are we here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on the last big tour in 2016,</v>

1752
01:24:19.391 --> 01:24:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't like nights off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

1753
01:24:20.951 --> 01:24:22.360
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanksgiving.</v>

1754
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:23.470
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find me a show.</v>

1755
01:24:23.471 --> 01:24:24.730
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found your show.</v>

1756
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a comedy club next to a strip bar.</v>

1757
01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:29.763
<v Speaker 2>And there's no backstage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no monitors is two boxes in the </v>

1758
01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:33.874
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Family owned really nice people and I </v>

1759
01:24:37.121 --> 01:24:38.920
<v Speaker 2>forget where it was somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Illinois.</v>

1760
01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.233
<v Speaker 2>I was a one show one night my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my tour bus was rumbling away in the </v>

1761
01:24:45.371 --> 01:24:49.420
<v Speaker 2>parking lot the next night I think it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like three nights of Ralphie May,</v>

1762
01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.700
<v Speaker 2>the great comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a straight up comedy club and</v>

1763
01:24:54.701 --> 01:24:55.534
<v Speaker 2>I went in there and I just Kinda did </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've been doing for the last nine </v>

1764
01:24:58.361 --> 01:24:59.194
<v Speaker 2>months on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of it was very funny and the </v>

1765
01:25:01.271 --> 01:25:04.410
<v Speaker 2>audience was fantastic and so the owner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came up to her and said,</v>

1766
01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.610
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played this place again anytime.</v>

1767
01:25:06.611 --> 01:25:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1768
01:25:08.171 --> 01:25:09.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know where we are anytime.</v>

1769
01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.713

<v Speaker 2>we like you and you're always welcome </v>

1770
01:25:12.281 --> 01:25:13.114
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that I don't know if it was my </v>

1771
01:25:14.321 --> 01:25:15.820
<v Speaker 2>audience for a comedy audience.</v>

1772
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:17.370
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did the show too is,</v>

1773
01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:18.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sold out in a day.</v>

1774
01:25:18.551 --> 01:25:19.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1775
01:25:19.121 --> 01:25:21.150

1776
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.460

<v Speaker 2>but this is.</v>

1777
01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:23.990
<v Speaker 2>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the audience is,</v>

1778
01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recognize these people.</v>

1779
01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:28.790
<v Speaker 2>This is my local comedy crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>

1780
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:31.150
<v Speaker 2>they just know you from sons of anarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

1781
01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.313
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see how you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was fine and it turned into like </v>

1782
01:25:35.771 --> 01:25:39.580
<v Speaker 2>this to our laugh riot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just great.</v>

1783
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:40.583
<v Speaker 2>It was a super function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have an opening act or </v>

1784
01:25:41.771 --> 01:25:42.660
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just go right out.</v>

1785
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Because I torture him enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just me.</v>

1786
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.433
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask you a professional question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feel free to edit this out when you're </v>

1787
01:25:50.441 --> 01:25:52.920
<v Speaker 2>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like you're doing a big theater like</v>

1788
01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.780
<v Speaker 2>where you're the main guy at like a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night somewhere.</v>

1789
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:57.520
<v Speaker 2>How long are you on stage for?</v>

1790
01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Usually an hour and 10 to an hour and 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

1791
01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Seventy to 80 minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1792
01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:04.483
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just fascinated because I live in a </v>

1793
01:26:06.171 --> 01:26:07.490
<v Speaker 2>bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just do my own thing.</v>

1794
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm onstage for like two hours and 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

1795
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I bring an opening act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how,</v>

1796
01:26:12.711 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 2>what do they do between 20 and 30 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many openers?</v>

1797
01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:16.904
<v Speaker 2>One.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they bring to that's rare but </v>

1798
01:26:18.531 --> 01:26:19.364
<v Speaker 2>it's usually just for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to have two people the most and </v>

1799
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:25.610
<v Speaker 2>they'll do a total of 40 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's a brief intermission,</v>

1800
01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:29.180
<v Speaker 2>three Bang Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

1801
01:26:29.181 --> 01:26:32.210
<v Speaker 2>We go and the show could be 80 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety minutes.</v>

1802
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:34.670
<v Speaker 2>And so the whole thing you would to two </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

1803
01:26:34.671 --> 01:26:37.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like two point something hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be two hours.</v>

1804
01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:38.234
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easily.</v>

1805
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the whole night,</v>

1806
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:40.783
<v Speaker 2>the whole night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Are you ever on your own with </v>

1807
01:26:42.591 --> 01:26:43.730
<v Speaker 2>nobody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

1808
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's always an opener.</v>

1809
01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Usually one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1810
01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:51.730
<v Speaker 2>And so that's 20 minutes and 70 to 80.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole night is a little less than</v>

1811
01:26:53.781 --> 01:26:54.614
<v Speaker 2>two hours depending upon the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not we have two shows in a </v>

1812
01:26:56.991 --> 01:26:59.300
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A short show is an hour and a half,</v>

1813
01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:02.180
<v Speaker 2>which I like a rock 'em sock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>'em robots.</v>

1814
01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a movie.</v>

1815
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 2>You go to a movie and it's two and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>half hours.</v>

1816
01:27:05.781 --> 01:27:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1817
01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:07.640
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1818
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.870
<v Speaker 2>You fill out a city last 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really feel that lack of editing,</v>

1819
01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:14.120
<v Speaker 2>but an hour and a half as bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1820
01:27:14.121 --> 01:27:14.691
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1821
01:27:14.691 --> 01:27:15.524
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1822
01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so how many two night,</v>

1823
01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:21.740
<v Speaker 2>two sets of night do you do often?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1824
01:27:21.741 --> 01:27:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll do seven to nine or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1825
01:27:24.051 --> 01:27:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it pretty often depending on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>size of the venue.</v>

1826
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:27.763
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some places a giant place I'll do one </v>

1827
01:27:29.541 --> 01:27:30.920
<v Speaker 2>show or you know.</v>

1828
01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.700
<v Speaker 2>But I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done a lot of,</v>

1829
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.823
<v Speaker 2>especially this last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of two shows that night in </v>

1830
01:27:35.811 --> 01:27:37.370
<v Speaker 2>big theaters and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1831
01:27:37.770 --> 01:27:38.603
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of turnaround too because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to clear out all those people </v>

1832
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:42.530
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't get a new crowd in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1833
01:27:42.531 --> 01:27:42.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1834
01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:46.130
<v Speaker 2>I work alone because I don't have a peer</v>
<v Speaker 2>group really.</v>

1835
01:27:46.190 --> 01:27:48.600
<v Speaker 2>If I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to find them and I,</v>

1836
01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm just curious about how other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>do their thing because I live alone in a</v>

1837

<v Speaker 2>tour bus with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>road manager and a bus driver and emerge</v>

1840
01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.140
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this open reviews for </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1844
01:28:09.411 --> 01:28:12.500
<v Speaker 2>they don't do that with me when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>there I bring American openers.</v>

1845

<v Speaker 2>like I've gotten to bigger places and my</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I've met.</v>

1848
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I've used this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used him.</v>

1849
01:28:24.171 --> 01:28:25.004
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's done shows with me for like three </v>

1850
01:28:26.421 --> 01:28:28.430
<v Speaker 2>tours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious.</v>

1851
01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Really low keys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A really nice guy.</v>

1852
01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm forgetting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see the guy every three years,</v>

1853
01:28:33.381 --> 01:28:35.600
<v Speaker 2>so it's not in the memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's great and he's,</v>

1854
01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:36.523
<v Speaker 2>he's super funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's real smart and the audience loves </v>

1855
01:28:38.361 --> 01:28:39.194
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think he's kind of known but </v>

1856
01:28:40.431 --> 01:28:42.050
<v Speaker 2>he's great and he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1857
01:28:42.051 --> 01:28:43.490
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

1858
01:28:43.491 --> 01:28:46.370
<v Speaker 2>And then I go do my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's per.</v>

1859
01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:50.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not in every city in Australia it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a couple of places.</v>

1860
01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's some kind of thing.</v>

1861
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Regional rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:28:53.421 --> 01:28:57.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's happened a few times with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would do music like,</v>

1863
01:28:57.741 --> 01:29:00.260
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four guys on stage we're going to have a</v>

1864
01:29:00.261 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 2>foreperson opener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1865
01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

1866
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.933
<v Speaker 1>man and I kinda like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like give the local band some time or </v>

1867
01:29:06.331 --> 01:29:07.164
<v Speaker 1>give the local guy a moment in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his hometown audience or let him tour </v>

1868
01:29:10.801 --> 01:29:12.210
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that idea,</v>

1869
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 1>but that's the only time it or every </v>
<v Speaker 1>once in a while.</v>

1870
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I was at Bonnaroo once and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously lopsided.</v>

1871
01:29:18.931 --> 01:29:23.931
<v Speaker 1>It was me and Tig Notaro who's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know her very well,</v>

1872
01:29:24.241 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen her on stage and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda,</v>

1873
01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:28.793
<v Speaker 1>she didn't exactly open for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she did like half an hour and I did </v>

1874
01:29:32.071 --> 01:29:33.540
<v Speaker 1>like an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1875
01:29:33.541 --> 01:29:36.060
<v Speaker 1>and they cleared the tent and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1876
01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:40.470
<v Speaker 1>cheech Marin came on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a Lewis black was before it was like</v>

1877
01:29:40.471 --> 01:29:41.304
<v Speaker 1>three tent loads of people in one night </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Montereau and that's the only time </v>

1878
01:29:44.371 --> 01:29:45.204
<v Speaker 1>I've ever done a is everyone's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll be the festival where you're </v>

1879
01:29:48.481 --> 01:29:52.500
<v Speaker 1>like the eight to 9:30 guy and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>10:00 guy comes onstage.</v>

1880
01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:57.300
<v Speaker 1>But quite often I'm just on my own on </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour and I'm the only thing onstage.</v>

1881
01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:00.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to have my friends with me.</v>

1882
01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise I get bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want,</v>

1883
01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I go on the road like</v>

1884
01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.293
<v Speaker 4>we want to take on the road with me as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>national headliner that would normally </v>

1885
01:30:07.731 --> 01:30:10.160
<v Speaker 4>be headlining somewhere on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like cool.</v>

1886
01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:10.940
<v Speaker 4>Double.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a cool double bill,</v>

1888
01:30:11.881 --> 01:30:16.881
<v Speaker 4>but it's also I want the best guys that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I can find that I pay them well to go on</v>

1889
01:30:17.031 --> 01:30:17.980
<v Speaker 4>in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1890
01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:21.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it to be a bad show by any </v>
<v Speaker 4>stretch of the imagination,</v>

1891
01:30:21.531 --> 01:30:23.540
<v Speaker 4>so I try to get the best guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also by that,</v>

1892
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:26.390
<v Speaker 4>then I'm traveling with the best guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're having fun.</v>

1893
01:30:26.690 --> 01:30:27.740
<v Speaker 4>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1894
01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:28.753
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1895
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:32.390
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird group like standups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not that many of us.</v>

1896
01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:33.503
<v Speaker 4>It was like maybe a thousand of us in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole country that are like real </v>

1897
01:30:36.261 --> 01:30:37.094
<v Speaker 4>professional comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe 500 headliners and the whole </v>

1898
01:30:39.321 --> 01:30:40.810
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this,</v>

1899
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:41.783
<v Speaker 4>there's just not that many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when we relate to each other and </v>

1900
01:30:45.131 --> 01:30:46.520
<v Speaker 4>sort of a weird way.</v>

1901
01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's not many of you.</v>

1902
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:50.690
<v Speaker 1>When presidents get together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like four of them.</v>

1903
01:30:50.691 --> 01:30:51.524
<v Speaker 1>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of chummy because they </v>

1904
01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:53.714
<v Speaker 1>might be opposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all kind of know they're the </v>

1905
01:30:56.181 --> 01:30:58.310
<v Speaker 1>only people who know that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when they're out,</v>

1906
01:30:58.960 --> 01:30:59.793
<v Speaker 1>when they're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did their time and then they can </v>

1907
01:31:00.771 --> 01:31:04.400
<v Speaker 1>relax and they just look like they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been sucked dry by a vampire.</v>

1908
01:31:04.670 --> 01:31:05.503
<v Speaker 1>That's why I noticed when the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Obama welcomed the president elect </v>

1909
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:09.643
<v Speaker 1>trump to the Oval Office for that 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute meeting that trump thought was </v>

1910
01:31:12.861 --> 01:31:16.430
<v Speaker 1>going to last 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama looked like two-toned come moon.</v>

1911
01:31:16.431 --> 01:31:19.370
<v Speaker 1>He just like his skin was so drawn </v>
<v Speaker 1>across his face.</v>

1912
01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.313
<v Speaker 1>It's like a snare drum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must have been so exhausted and his </v>

1913
01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:23.613
<v Speaker 1>legacy is going to be taken over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just any president like George W dot </v>

1914
01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Bush was to meet a handsome energetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy when he got into office,</v>

1915
01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:33.493
<v Speaker 1>but eight years in nine slash 11 and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion and occupation of Iraq on the </v>

1916
01:31:38.061 --> 01:31:40.150
<v Speaker 1>way out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his face had fallen.</v>

1917
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:42.980
<v Speaker 1>His hair had died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1918
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a guy who hates him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just disagrees,</v>

1919
01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:49.400
<v Speaker 1>but the presidency killed that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1920
01:31:49.401 --> 01:31:50.234
<v Speaker 1>I just think the stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't get the nice phone </v>

1921
01:31:51.711 --> 01:31:52.520
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey the cat,</v>

1922
01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:54.320
<v Speaker 1>we got the cat out of the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1923
01:31:54.321 --> 01:31:55.910
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lost eight guys.</v>

1924
01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 1>That thing you said go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It went well.</v>

1925
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:00.933
<v Speaker 2>I'm very curious to see how trump comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this because he's one of the </v>

1926
01:32:03.401 --> 01:32:06.220
<v Speaker 2>older guys to get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's 70 or 71.</v>

1927
01:32:06.221 --> 01:32:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in just in the past year,</v>

1928
01:32:08.621 --> 01:32:11.610
<v Speaker 2>like there's a picture of Bush for 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 2000 and what I'm saying,</v>

1929
01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:13.290
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

1930
01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:18.600
<v Speaker 2>it kicked his ass and I'm not trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in the majority of reality.</v>

1931
01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:19.653
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you see those really </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing photos of Lincoln during the </v>

1932
01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:27.871
<v Speaker 2>civil war or Lyndon Johnson in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>think tank meetings,</v>

1933
01:32:28.811 --> 01:32:29.644
<v Speaker 2>him and Mcnamara,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his face is sliding off his skull </v>

1934
01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.690
<v Speaker 2>because he's getting those phone calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1935
01:32:34.691 --> 01:32:35.524
<v Speaker 2>we just lost six slash 600 guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr President really started to give you </v>

1936
01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:39.454
<v Speaker 2>this news because he insisted on getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad phone call and you see what it </v>

1937
01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:43.323
<v Speaker 2>does to a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I noticed it with Bush and Obama </v>

1938
01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.233
<v Speaker 2>because those were trying times for both</v>
<v Speaker 2>presidents who was trying very trying </v>

1939
01:32:52.001 --> 01:32:52.834
<v Speaker 2>administrations and I wonder what it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna do to a guy who doesn't take care </v>

1940
01:32:56.951 --> 01:33:00.370
<v Speaker 2>of himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is carrying a lot of weight.</v>

1941
01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Probably nowhere near the best diet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1942
01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I hope he doesn't have some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart attack.</v>

1943
01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:11.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the kind of guy who wants people</v>

1944
01:33:11.861 --> 01:33:13.810
<v Speaker 2>to die easily could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1945
01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:14.710
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at them,</v>

1946
01:33:14.711 --> 01:33:15.251
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1947
01:33:15.251 --> 01:33:17.480
<v Speaker 2>you need to listen to the White House </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>

1948
01:33:17.481 --> 01:33:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Get on a plan because they can really </v>
<v Speaker 2>rock you.</v>

1949
01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:20.763
<v Speaker 2>They can help you lose 40 pounds by </v>
<v Speaker 2>spring of next year and you can really </v>

1950
01:33:25.901 --> 01:33:26.770
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel better.</v>

1951
01:33:26.771 --> 01:33:27.521
<v Speaker 2>You look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1952
01:33:27.521 --> 01:33:28.354
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's someone in the White House who </v>

1953
01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:30.904
<v Speaker 2>can help you with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're paid to get you on the </v>

1954
01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:34.024
<v Speaker 2>track every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could get them up at five in the </v>

1955
01:33:35.681 --> 01:33:37.510
<v Speaker 2>morning and get them out there and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to do it.</v>

1956
01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:38.344
<v Speaker 2>He's got to watch Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that I agree or disagree with </v>

1957
01:33:40.241 --> 01:33:41.074
<v Speaker 2>those people on the TV's too bad because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president has all those people who </v>

1958
01:33:44.081 --> 01:33:45.100
<v Speaker 2>are ready.</v>

1959
01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:45.933
<v Speaker 2>They're already in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're jogging outfits like a dog who </v>

1960
01:33:47.531 --> 01:33:49.530
<v Speaker 2>wants to go to the park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting to train them.</v>

1961
01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:51.910
<v Speaker 2>And it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a dietician.</v>

1962
01:33:51.911 --> 01:33:55.390
<v Speaker 2>They can rock those calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he wants it.</v>

1963
01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1964
01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:58.930
<v Speaker 2>you have to apparently drinks like 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet cokes a day.</v>

1965
01:33:59.650 --> 01:34:00.850
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

1966
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Would that wind that diet window you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about?</v>

1967
01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do eat,</v>

1968
01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:09.820
<v Speaker 2>are you eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a family.</v>

1969
01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Is it the dinner table eating at home </v>
<v Speaker 2>with families.</v>

1970
01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:14.650
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the meal.</v>

1971
01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Is your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that meal targeted like nutrition for</v>

1972
01:34:19.781 --> 01:34:21.620
<v Speaker 2>the kids' nutrition for Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>

1973
01:34:21.650 --> 01:34:25.030
<v Speaker 2>You guys eat smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kids actually eat very healthy.</v>

1974
01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been eating together really </v>

1975
01:34:28.331 --> 01:34:30.430
<v Speaker 2>healthy since they were babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

1976
01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're always eating vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some healthy meat and they eat a lot</v>

1977
01:34:35.231 --> 01:34:37.390
<v Speaker 2>of wild game because I hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1978
01:34:37.391 --> 01:34:38.920
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really healthy.</v>

1979
01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:41.710
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting thing with kids too,</v>

1980
01:34:41.711 --> 01:34:42.544
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you shield them from interesting </v>

1981
01:34:44.201 --> 01:34:46.180
<v Speaker 2>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my eight year old loves Kimchi,</v>

1982
01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:50.710
<v Speaker 2>she loves like Spicy Korean fermented </v>
<v Speaker 2>cabbage,</v>

1983
01:34:50.711 --> 01:34:52.480
<v Speaker 2>which to a lot of kids would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting.</v>

1984
01:34:52.481 --> 01:34:55.120
<v Speaker 2>She loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She eats like fucking plates of it.</v>

1985
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>And because of that she rarely sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1986
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.380
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she eats a lot of probiotics and healthy</v>

1987
01:35:00.381 --> 01:35:01.214
<v Speaker 3>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're always eating fruit and </v>

1988
01:35:02.601 --> 01:35:03.434
<v Speaker 3>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been doing it so they're a </v>

1989
01:35:03.951 --> 01:35:06.200
<v Speaker 3>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't stop them from eating candy,</v>

1990
01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:07.213
<v Speaker 3>but I do tell them what candy is and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed them that sugar documentary and </v>

1991
01:35:11.631 --> 01:35:12.464
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to them in length about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar didn't use to be something that </v>

1992
01:35:15.351 --> 01:35:17.750
<v Speaker 3>people ate all the time and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really recent thing.</v>

1993
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:18.643
<v Speaker 3>I've showed them photographs of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>from like the 18 hundreds and the early </v>

1994
01:35:21.441 --> 01:35:22.490
<v Speaker 3>19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1995
01:35:22.491 --> 01:35:24.020
<v Speaker 3>look what these people looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were thin,</v>

1996
01:35:24.021 --> 01:35:25.910
<v Speaker 3>they were different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a different diet,</v>

1997
01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:26.893
<v Speaker 3>but now we just eat too many </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates and it's fine every now </v>

1998
01:35:29.541 --> 01:35:31.370
<v Speaker 3>and then like don't keep it from </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

1999
01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:35.150
<v Speaker 3>but understand that these are empty </v>
<v Speaker 3>calories and they make your body.</v>

2000
01:35:35.210 --> 01:35:37.910
<v Speaker 3>They actually make you tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I've noticed,</v>

2001
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.923
<v Speaker 3>I look at people when I travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just find that our species is </v>

2002
01:35:41.241 --> 01:35:42.590
<v Speaker 3>fascinating all over the world.</v>

2003
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.903
<v Speaker 3>You look at people's teeth in parts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world were sugar and corn syrup is </v>

2004
01:35:48.321 --> 01:35:49.154
<v Speaker 3>just not normal and you see like these </v>
<v Speaker 3>75 year old women like carrying a couch </v>

2005
01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:54.793
<v Speaker 3>up a hill and their teeth are these </v>
<v Speaker 3>bright white tree trunks just like of </v>

2006
01:35:59.370 --> 01:36:04.370
<v Speaker 3>like they're never a good a fall out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their heads and like no dentistry,</v>

2007
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:08.690
<v Speaker 3>you know that no noticeable dentistry </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the teeth are gleaming.</v>

2008
01:36:08.691 --> 01:36:13.691
<v Speaker 3>White maybe darken from tobacco or tea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing like in the West where their</v>

2009
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:18.740
<v Speaker 3>teeth are just getting assaulted by our </v>
<v Speaker 3>own diet.</v>

2010
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:22.850
<v Speaker 3>And you see people have great age with </v>
<v Speaker 3>like they look,</v>

2011
01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:25.880
<v Speaker 3>they're just ripped and you look at what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're eating.</v>

2012
01:36:26.050 --> 01:36:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rice,</v>

2013
01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:27.793
<v Speaker 3>vegetables and it's all lean smart food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And did the sugars are all a </v>

2014
01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:35.750
<v Speaker 3>monosaccharides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fruit sugar,</v>

2015
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:37.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the occasional banana or orange is a </v>

2016
01:36:39.201 --> 01:36:40.380
<v Speaker 3>treat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2017
01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:42.920
<v Speaker 3>the sugars really not in the Diet at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

2018
01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Maybe shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2019
01:36:45.710 --> 01:36:46.543
<v Speaker 3>but not like we're doing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever done it by the way we're </v>

2020
01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:51.650
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever been as fat,</v>

2021
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.863
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we have these things to shield </v>

2022
01:36:54.111 --> 01:36:56.000
<v Speaker 3>people from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we call it fat shaming,</v>

2023
01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't tell someone their fat,</v>

2024
01:36:57.681 --> 01:36:58.514
<v Speaker 3>let them just be morbidly obese and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through life at a massive risk of heart </v>

2025
01:37:02.661 --> 01:37:03.494
<v Speaker 3>attack or stroke or diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't say anything because then you'll </v>

2026
01:37:06.471 --> 01:37:07.860
<v Speaker 3>hurt their feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

2027
01:37:08.170 --> 01:37:09.003
<v Speaker 3>you could say something to someone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be uncomfortable in the moment </v>

2028
01:37:11.541 --> 01:37:12.374
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Mike,</v>

2029
01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be that guy,</v>

2030
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:16.183
<v Speaker 3>but you got to lose some weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that guy could go and look in </v>

2031
01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:19.490
<v Speaker 3>the mirror and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

2032
01:37:19.730 --> 01:37:20.563
<v Speaker 3>I really do need to lose some weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'll lose some weight and </v>

2033
01:37:23.181 --> 01:37:24.014
<v Speaker 3>they'll be healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll talk to you four or five months </v>

2034
01:37:25.041 --> 01:37:25.851
<v Speaker 3>later and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2035
01:37:25.851 --> 01:37:27.080
<v Speaker 3>you fucked my head up that day.</v>

2036
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:28.123
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really started changing the way I eat </v>

2037
01:37:29.481 --> 01:37:32.300
<v Speaker 3>and I'm so much healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel better because he's your friend,</v>

2038
01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:34.610
<v Speaker 3>my friend Tom Seger and and Bert </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kreischer.</v>

2039
01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.440
<v Speaker 3>They did this thing last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2040
01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:39.080
<v Speaker 3>two years ago where they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a weight loss competition.</v>

2041
01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:43.370
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things they kept doing is</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat shaming each other,</v>

2042
01:37:43.371 --> 01:37:46.460
<v Speaker 3>like ruthlessly and they would use </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag bird is fat,</v>

2043
01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:47.323
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag Thomas Fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they had this weight loss </v>

2044
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:54.650
<v Speaker 3>competition and they fucking both lost a</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitload of weight.</v>

2045
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:55.663
<v Speaker 3>I they both lost between 50 and 60 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds and they looked fucking </v>

2046
01:37:59.971 --> 01:38:01.500
<v Speaker 3>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then after it was over,</v>

2047
01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:02.281
<v Speaker 3>Tom was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2048
01:38:02.281 --> 01:38:04.620
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fat Shaming works.</v>

2049
01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.450
<v Speaker 3>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It got me off my ass.</v>

2050
01:38:06.451 --> 01:38:09.780
<v Speaker 3>I realized I was a fat fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it made me lose weight.</v>

2051
01:38:09.781 --> 01:38:12.770
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shaming thing is you.</v>

2052
01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Fat Shaming doesn't work on people </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't fat,</v>

2053
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:16.223
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it works on people who have a problem </v>

2054
01:38:18.751 --> 01:38:20.340
<v Speaker 3>but don't want to address that problem.</v>

2055
01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:22.440
<v Speaker 3>So you bring up that problem and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

2056
01:38:22.441 --> 01:38:23.274
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making me feel bad by thinking </v>

2057
01:38:24.511 --> 01:38:26.910
<v Speaker 3>about my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a bad person.</v>

2058
01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:28.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a weak spot.</v>

2059
01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.770
<v Speaker 3>That weak spot shouldn't be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A good shouldn't.</v>

2060
01:38:31.771 --> 01:38:34.860
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't Belabor it and constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridicule someone for being fat.</v>

2061
01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.830
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that you're never supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring it up,</v>

2062
01:38:37.831 --> 01:38:38.664
<v Speaker 3>even with someone you care about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even ingest or friends busting balls </v>

2063
01:38:41.521 --> 01:38:42.061
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2064
01:38:42.061 --> 01:38:42.301
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2065
01:38:42.301 --> 01:38:45.990
<v Speaker 3>you should bring it up because that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bad feeling is a gift.</v>

2066
01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.970
<v Speaker 3>It makes you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2067
01:38:47.971 --> 01:38:48.804
<v Speaker 3>I've been remiss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been paying attention to my </v>

2068
01:38:50.161 --> 01:38:52.650
<v Speaker 3>own physical sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2069
01:38:52.651 --> 01:38:54.780
<v Speaker 3>I have control over what goes in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

2070
01:38:54.781 --> 01:38:56.200
<v Speaker 3>I have control over the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2071
01:38:56.220 --> 01:39:00.180
<v Speaker 3>the amount of calories I take in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of calories I have control over how</v>

2072
01:39:00.181 --> 01:39:01.800
<v Speaker 3>much body fat I'm carrying around.</v>

2073
01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:04.110
<v Speaker 3>And there's ways to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2074
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:07.640
<v Speaker 3>I think you should use discretion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2075
01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:10.020
<v Speaker 3>And she's in line at the supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2076
01:39:10.530 --> 01:39:13.140
<v Speaker 3>some people you'd like and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just.</v>

2077
01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:16.080
<v Speaker 3>But it was funny to hear Tom just was </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting angry.</v>

2078
01:39:16.081 --> 01:39:17.940
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking fat shaming works,</v>

2079
01:39:17.941 --> 01:39:18.774
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these people that say don't fat </v>

2080
01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:20.191
<v Speaker 3>shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2081
01:39:20.191 --> 01:39:24.030
<v Speaker 3>That's how I got skinny fat shaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>works until.</v>

2082
01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:25.053
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't be rude to someone out in public </v>

2083
01:39:27.391 --> 01:39:29.460
<v Speaker 3>for no reason to drive an 11 year old to</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide.</v>

2084
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Definitely don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

2085
01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:31.973
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the little kids is the worst because </v>

2086
01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:34.793
<v Speaker 3>their parents will get them hooked on </v>
<v Speaker 3>those sugary sodas and once it's the </v>

2087
01:39:37.651 --> 01:39:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn Sodas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2088
01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:42.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is one of the primary causes</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people being fat in this country.</v>

2089
01:39:42.211 --> 01:39:44.710
<v Speaker 3>And it just seems so innocuous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just an glass.</v>

2090
01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I'll just drink this.</v>

2091
01:39:45.810 --> 01:39:48.540
<v Speaker 3>It's got some ice cubes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No big deal goes down so fast,</v>

2092
01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:50.310
<v Speaker 3>tastes great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the weekends,</v>

2093
01:39:50.650 --> 01:39:51.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2094
01:39:52.210 --> 01:39:54.450
<v Speaker 3>I like ginger beer and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2095
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:57.690
<v Speaker 3>the Bundler Burke's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same power as a coke.</v>

2096
01:39:57.750 --> 01:40:02.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a lot of sugar and I buy a </v>
<v Speaker 3>four pack and I have one bottle a week,</v>

2097
01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my big drink,</v>

2098
01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:09.090
<v Speaker 3>like discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going nuts.</v>

2099
01:40:09.091 --> 01:40:10.440
<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got his drink,</v>

2100
01:40:12.190 --> 01:40:14.550
<v Speaker 3>the best tasting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

2101
01:40:14.551 --> 01:40:18.930
<v Speaker 3>it tastes good for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so sweet and like you just want the</v>

2102
01:40:18.931 --> 01:40:21.300
<v Speaker 3>next one when you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

2103
01:40:21.301 --> 01:40:21.960
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2104
01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.590
<v Speaker 3>and I could drink all day but I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't do that to my system.</v>

2105
01:40:25.591 --> 01:40:28.020
<v Speaker 3>So I do one a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good discipline.</v>

2106
01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:29.431
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2107
01:40:29.431 --> 01:40:30.264
<v Speaker 3>you still need to look forward to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a diet that you follow them </v>

2108
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:34.140
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2109
01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean I love ice cream so I don't eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2110
01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:40.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2111
01:40:40.741 --> 01:40:41.574
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try not to because it's just my body </v>

2112
01:40:43.231 --> 01:40:45.690
<v Speaker 3>is slowed down with age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't shed pounds,</v>

2113
01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.670
<v Speaker 3>but I've never really had a weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

2114
01:40:47.770 --> 01:40:48.601
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never like,</v>

2115
01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:50.760
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to like lose 30 pounds.</v>

2116
01:40:50.761 --> 01:40:52.970
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My metabolism is such.</v>

2117
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Always kind of like a greyhound.</v>

2118
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Like it was kind of nervous and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always working out as well.</v>

2119
01:40:59.070 --> 01:41:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm always kind of like doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just kind of uptight.</v>

2120
01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:03.813
<v Speaker 1>Kind of nervy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you talked the last time you were </v>

2121
01:41:04.901 --> 01:41:08.350
<v Speaker 1>about the fact that your parents had you</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Ritalin from the time you were really</v>

2122
01:41:08.351 --> 01:41:09.184
<v Speaker 1>small boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think that just like wired </v>

2123
01:41:11.621 --> 01:41:14.050
<v Speaker 1>you in a certain way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2124
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.210
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would need a doctor to tell me,</v>

2125
01:41:16.211 --> 01:41:18.580
<v Speaker 1>but it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a subtle drug,</v>

2126
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:19.583
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I try and eat as clean as I can </v>

2127
01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:26.440
<v Speaker 1>because more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

2128
01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:30.580
<v Speaker 1>less need for sleep and not feeling so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad all the time.</v>

2129
01:41:30.581 --> 01:41:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not feeling.</v>

2130
01:41:31.931 --> 01:41:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do anything with a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

2131
01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean I feel better mentally and like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said before,</v>

2132
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I've been struggling with trying to feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2133
01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:43.050
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

2134
01:41:43.050 --> 01:41:45.160
<v Speaker 1>You need to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be neutral.</v>

2135
01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Not just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in deficit.</v>

2136
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be here,</v>

2137
01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:52.300
<v Speaker 1>that's all I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not asking for much and good.</v>

2138
01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I found a good diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2139
01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:58.390
<v Speaker 1>really rocks that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel when I do the bad meal,</v>

2140
01:41:58.960 --> 01:41:59.793
<v Speaker 1>like a depression meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tons of carbs for like a day later </v>

2141
01:42:03.371 --> 01:42:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

2142
01:42:04.541 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling every bite of that and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to feel like that.</v>

2143
01:42:09.371 --> 01:42:10.210
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

2144
01:42:10.211 --> 01:42:12.280
<v Speaker 1>can't do that because it's just not </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth it.</v>

2145
01:42:12.281 --> 01:42:15.400
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of food you like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a typical meal for you today?</v>

2146
01:42:15.401 --> 01:42:16.234
<v Speaker 1>I had a salad with some chopped up </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken with a low calorie dressing on </v>

2147
01:42:22.031 --> 01:42:22.864
<v Speaker 1>it and a cup of coffee and tonight I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have a glass of carrot juice </v>

2148
01:42:27.251 --> 01:42:32.050
<v Speaker 1>with a splash of beet juice and probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cup half a cup of coffee.</v>

2149
01:42:32.050 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 1>The other half of the cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2154
01:42:40.141 --> 01:42:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I'll be good in Hungary tomorrow if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling like I can't sleep.</v>

2155
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm distracted from hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got some peanuts in my room and all</v>

2156
01:42:47.891 --> 01:42:49.630
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden a handful of peanuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

2157
01:42:49.631 --> 01:42:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Very clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neat,</v>

2158
01:42:52.150 --> 01:42:54.580
<v Speaker 1>very clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clean.</v>

2159
01:42:54.581 --> 01:42:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Was like some kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2160
01:42:55.801 --> 01:42:56.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2161
01:42:56.110 --> 01:43:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I to clean because I have found I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>great results with it.</v>

2162
01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Like it is no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It totally works.</v>

2163
01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:06.790
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we do in our line of work,</v>

2164
01:43:06.791 --> 01:43:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of stuff coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of suffering,</v>

2165
01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:12.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a TV show,</v>

2166
01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:14.320
<v Speaker 1>a lot of shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

2167
01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:16.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of speeches.</v>

2168
01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I got a teaching a class at Ucla one day</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up November,</v>

2169
01:43:21.731 --> 01:43:22.564
<v Speaker 1>but when you're teaching a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just want me to talk about music </v>

2170
01:43:25.061 --> 01:43:30.061
<v Speaker 1>and culture and I just got asked to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about change at another place and I have</v>

2171
01:43:31.091 --> 01:43:33.490
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of shows coming up from here to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kiev,</v>

2172
01:43:33.491 --> 01:43:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine and just a lot of marks I got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>

2173
01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:37.353
<v Speaker 1>It's just what I do and so I'm basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ready to walk out of the house </v>

2174
01:43:43.151 --> 01:43:48.151
<v Speaker 1>until about Christmas and the hitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>marks and not screwing up day after day,</v>

2175
01:43:48.971 --> 01:43:53.971
<v Speaker 1>night after night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so diet is a lot goes into that prep</v>

2176
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:55.740
<v Speaker 1>big time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2177
01:43:55.770 --> 01:43:56.603
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes sense if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're demanding that much out of </v>

2178
01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:00.590
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really don't want.</v>

2179
01:44:00.591 --> 01:44:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Your body's struggling with shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition.</v>

2180
01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

2181
01:44:05.170 --> 01:44:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2182
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:09.200
<v Speaker 1>my car can't go off the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't fail.</v>

2183
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be screwing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I hit that set,</v>

2184
01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be on a TV show soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't not know the lines.</v>

2185
01:44:16.851 --> 01:44:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't be tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't look like I haven't slept.</v>

2186
01:44:19.761 --> 01:44:20.594
<v Speaker 1>I got to be a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you take any vitamins or supplements </v>

2187
01:44:23.031 --> 01:44:23.864
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try and I forget and that they go </v>

2188
01:44:25.971 --> 01:44:26.730
<v Speaker 1>stale.</v>

2189
01:44:26.730 --> 01:44:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I have the five lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Heidi said,</v>

2190
01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:31.970
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2191
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:34.070
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got into it and I,</v>

2192
01:44:34.071 --> 01:44:34.904
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually they get put in the cupboard </v>

2193
01:44:36.201 --> 01:44:38.240
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2194
01:44:38.241 --> 01:44:39.074
<v Speaker 1>three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why I do like the carrot </v>

2195
01:44:42.471 --> 01:44:43.304
<v Speaker 1>and beet juice just so that those kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of vitamins are coming through and I do </v>

2196
01:44:46.371 --> 01:44:49.250
<v Speaker 1>that like almost every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just liked the way it tastes too.</v>

2197
01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

2198
01:44:52.050 --> 01:44:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been able to stick with it.</v>

2199
01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I just forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2200
01:44:57.050 --> 01:45:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had anything that you took</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gave you great benefits?</v>

2201
01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:01.273
<v Speaker 1>I never noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I've ever noticed is </v>

2202
01:45:04.191 --> 01:45:09.191
<v Speaker 1>restorative sleep for just general </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration and wellbeing.</v>

2203
01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:12.500
<v Speaker 1>And the cleaner I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better I feel.</v>

2204
01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I get jumped up on it.</v>

2205
01:45:16.431 --> 01:45:17.264
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as far as anything I've ever </v>

2206
01:45:21.261 --> 01:45:23.810
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working out is an antidepressant.</v>

2207
01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Good Diet is an antidepressant and makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a more efficient way when I'm awake.</v>

2208
01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't,</v>

2209
01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I've never taken cod fish oil or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever and said,</v>

2210
01:45:33.321 --> 01:45:34.700
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my joints feel better.</v>

2211
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.863
<v Speaker 1>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm just not aware enough or I'm </v>

2212
01:45:38.811 --> 01:45:39.644
<v Speaker 1>not expecting it to work so I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no thing I can hold up and go </v>

2213
01:45:42.411 --> 01:45:44.630
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This really helped me.</v>

2214
01:45:45.110 --> 01:45:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Besides physical fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the work done,</v>

2215
01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:51.940
<v Speaker 1>like you want to alleviate anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 1>before an audition,</v>

2216
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:56.030
<v Speaker 1>rehearse the wind prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's nothing to be worried about</v>

2217
01:45:56.031 --> 01:45:59.960
<v Speaker 1>because he can't wait to show the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you got and so preparation,</v>

2218
01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:05.560
<v Speaker 1>good diet and and finishing the thing so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really clear the deck.</v>

2219
01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because for me,</v>

2220
01:46:09.591 --> 01:46:14.591
<v Speaker 1>my whole life is don't be depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked so hard not to feel bad.</v>

2221
01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:19.400
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what I do is to not feel really</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

2222
01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.130
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that you've chosen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do this in a non pharmaceutical way.</v>

2223
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Specifically you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've strategies,</v>

2224
01:46:25.730 --> 01:46:27.050
<v Speaker 1>just afraid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2225
01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:27.973
<v Speaker 1>I just don't believe that someone I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know can come up with the drug </v>

2226
01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:33.253
<v Speaker 1>that's going to work for my unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>little mind and I've seen people on </v>

2227
01:46:37.551 --> 01:46:38.840
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2228
01:46:38.841 --> 01:46:41.690
<v Speaker 1>so how's that working for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think I'm losing my mind.</v>

2229
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing this for three months </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know who I am right now.</v>

2230
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:48.223
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2231
01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I have that problem anyway.</v>

2232
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.940
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want any pharmaceuticals to </v>
<v Speaker 2>enhance that.</v>

2233
01:46:53.941 --> 01:46:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm just basically afraid that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimate concern.</v>

2234
01:46:57.090 --> 01:46:57.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the brain is real fragile and </v>

2235
01:46:59.941 --> 01:47:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not one of those types.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say all medication is bad.</v>

2236
01:47:02.791 --> 01:47:03.624
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just anything having to do with the </v>

2237
01:47:05.881 --> 01:47:06.714
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather just deal with what I got </v>

2238
01:47:08.370 --> 01:47:13.370
<v Speaker 2>right and use these more kind of on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground ideas,</v>

2239
01:47:13.561 --> 01:47:14.394
<v Speaker 2>like I'll just sweat a lot and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do a lot of pull ups and whatever I </v>

2240
01:47:17.521 --> 01:47:18.354
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look like a ton of pushups or like </v>

2241
01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:24.650
<v Speaker 2>get on the stationary bike or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do feel better and when I eat the lean</v>

2242
01:47:25.321 --> 01:47:26.640
<v Speaker 2>fish salad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2243
01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:29.040
<v Speaker 2>the salmon and the spinach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do feel better.</v>

2244
01:47:29.041 --> 01:47:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

2246
01:47:32.271 --> 01:47:33.750
<v Speaker 2>that's good enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2247
01:47:33.751 --> 01:47:37.560
<v Speaker 2>You've got successful strategies they </v>
<v Speaker 2>working for me.</v>

2248
01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:38.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2249
01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Now when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean you do so many different things</v>

2250
01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:42.313
<v Speaker 2>at this point of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have specific goals that you set </v>

2251
01:47:46.171 --> 01:47:47.004
<v Speaker 2>out for the year or you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would like to be a year from now or </v>

2252
01:47:50.281 --> 01:47:51.114
<v Speaker 2>do you just do things that are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting to you and just pursue them </v>

2253
01:47:54.031 --> 01:47:54.864
<v Speaker 2>with passion and just let the chips fall</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they may I do that and I don't </v>

2254
01:47:59.251 --> 01:48:01.590
<v Speaker 2>have a goal like at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at 65,</v>

2255
01:48:01.591 --> 01:48:04.320
<v Speaker 2>I want to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea where I'll be.</v>

2256
01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get ready for 2019.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no plans yet.</v>

2257
01:48:08.041 --> 01:48:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm just hoping for a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2258
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't have those kind of long range </v>
<v Speaker 2>plans.</v>

2259
01:48:14.670 --> 01:48:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a short ranged to know ranged person</v>

2260
01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:20.393
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of my motivation is vengeance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that revenge and vengeance </v>

2261
01:48:26.521 --> 01:48:28.710
<v Speaker 2>are synonyms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

2262
01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:31.500
<v Speaker 2>the fact that revenge has [inaudible] in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2263
01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:32.640
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do this,</v>

2264
01:48:32.641 --> 01:48:33.474
<v Speaker 2>I do that.</v>

2265
01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Vengeance is just like the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between aggression and hostility.</v>

2266
01:48:38.050 --> 01:48:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Where you agro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2267
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:42.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm hostile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

2268
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Wham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the ashtray.</v>

2269
01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:46.230
<v Speaker 2>That's hostility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2270
01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.430
<v Speaker 2>You just hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2271
01:48:47.431 --> 01:48:48.264
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like watching you bleed and so </v>

2272
01:48:55.530 --> 01:48:56.730
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2273
01:48:56.731 --> 01:48:58.620
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying it makes sense.</v>

2274
01:48:58.621 --> 01:49:03.621
<v Speaker 2>I know and so I don't believe in tit for</v>
<v Speaker 2>tat.</v>

2275
01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:05.123
<v Speaker 2>I believe in tit tat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch me just jump up and down and just </v>

2276
01:49:08.311 --> 01:49:10.200
<v Speaker 2>break it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to prove yourself?</v>

2277
01:49:10.230 --> 01:49:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a primary motivation.</v>

2278
01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:17.280
<v Speaker 2>So I wake up every day wanting to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>back at every teacher,</v>

2279
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:18.863
<v Speaker 2>every guy at school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every bad boss who would ever parent </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2290
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:53.130
<v Speaker 1>juvenile and it's not cool but it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel in some way.</v>

2291
01:49:53.551 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't spray paint your house on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not flattening your tire.</v>

2292
01:49:56.471 --> 01:49:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when someone goes,</v>

2293
01:49:59.231 --> 01:50:01.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get up early enough and get,</v>

2294
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:02.643
<v Speaker 1>how'd you get five of those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I got up at three and I stood </v>

2295
01:50:05.501 --> 01:50:09.660
<v Speaker 1>outside and I ate this rat tail and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbed the wall.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got two of them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to get somewhere by </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepping on you to use it as a ladder </v>

2300
01:50:24.341 --> 01:50:26.680
<v Speaker 1>rung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cling to this.</v>

2301
01:50:26.681 --> 01:50:28.870
<v Speaker 1>This is not something you ever plan on </v>
<v Speaker 1>an abandoned.</v>

2302
01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:33.040

<v Speaker 1>something or steal from them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I need a new car.</v>

2380
01:53:45.681 --> 01:53:47.150
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting a Mazda six.</v>

2381
01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:49.340
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm picking the interior,</v>

2382
01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:52.490
<v Speaker 2>get in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we wanted to just get an infinity.</v>

2383
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:56.180
<v Speaker 2>You're driving them forever because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want me anymore.</v>

2384
01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2385
01:53:57.470 --> 01:54:00.050
<v Speaker 2>all good things come to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2386
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Double fingers don't want me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we went to,</v>

2387
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.863
<v Speaker 2>we went to the lot and two hours later I</v>
<v Speaker 2>parked the Mazda six next to the </v>

2388
01:54:12.051 --> 01:54:12.884
<v Speaker 2>infinity that got taken while I was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the set of the TV show the next morning </v>

2389
01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:18.013
<v Speaker 2>and I drove my new car to the set and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of shit compared to the infinity </v>

2390
01:54:22.641 --> 01:54:23.210
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2391
01:54:23.210 --> 01:54:25.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a different kind of ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

2392
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:29.390
<v Speaker 2>It makes you very humble because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>floor it in the nine.</v>

2393
01:54:29.391 --> 01:54:30.224
<v Speaker 2>Durables go calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're working in the sunflower seeds </v>

2394
01:54:32.451 --> 01:54:34.970
<v Speaker 2>fall out and every other car passes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're.</v>

2395
01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2396
01:54:37.251 --> 01:54:39.310
<v Speaker 2>you get used to a nice ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2397
01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was that.</v>

2398
01:54:43.190 --> 01:54:44.150
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2399
01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.620
<v Speaker 2>well why don't you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll take a couple of days.</v>

2400
01:54:45.621 --> 01:54:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no new car right now.</v>

2401
01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:48.763
<v Speaker 2>But that's my question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 9:00 AM tomorrow morning or to a </v>

2402
01:54:50.170 --> 01:54:51.560
<v Speaker 2>really nice car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2403
01:54:51.561 --> 01:54:53.010
<v Speaker 2>you work really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2404
01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:53.893
<v Speaker 2>How do you take any compensation or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have any like happiness that you </v>

2405
01:54:58.971 --> 01:55:01.340
<v Speaker 2>derive from buying something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no.</v>

2406
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:03.500
<v Speaker 2>You have a really good stereo stereo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:55:03.501 --> 01:55:04.880
<v Speaker 2>We talked about it last time you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

2408
01:55:04.881 --> 01:55:05.714
<v Speaker 2>your giant speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't you want a car that has a </v>

2409
01:55:07.551 --> 01:55:08.330
<v Speaker 2>crazy stereos?</v>

2410
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:09.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

2411
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:14.350
<v Speaker 2>I just go to trader Joe's and auditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to the Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

2412
01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:17.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in really utilitarian life.</v>

2413
01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Like in La when I'm off the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even wear a watch?</v>

2414
01:55:20.670 --> 01:55:21.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use the phone.</v>

2415
01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:22.973
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use the watch when I travel just so I </v>

2416
01:55:24.921 --> 01:55:26.360
<v Speaker 2>can just see the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the time.</v>

2417
01:55:26.890 --> 01:55:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I'm off the road I just use the</v>

2418
01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.730
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just laziness.</v>

2419
01:55:32.010 --> 01:55:32.843
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live very utilitarian here because </v>

2420
01:55:36.171 --> 01:55:37.004
<v Speaker 2>basically I'm just counting down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>days before I leave again because a lot </v>

2421
01:55:39.561 --> 01:55:43.530
<v Speaker 2>of my work happens out in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>location,</v>

2422
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:47.190
<v Speaker 1>like a film or TV show or just touring </v>
<v Speaker 1>or traveling.</v>

2423
01:55:47.530 --> 01:55:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>

2424
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:51.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi said something funny,</v>

2425
01:55:51.181 --> 01:55:52.980
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're driving me crazy at the office,</v>

2426
01:55:52.981 --> 01:55:56.010
<v Speaker 1>like pacing and huffing and puffing like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wild animal.</v>

2427
01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:57.293
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to book you a trip and you </v>

2428
01:55:59.131 --> 01:56:00.930
<v Speaker 1>can't know where you're going to the day</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave.</v>

2429
01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to get you outta here for</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 days because you're driving me crazy.</v>

2430
01:56:03.991 --> 01:56:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said bucket,</v>

2431
01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:07.193
<v Speaker 1>and so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I need is the right electrical plug </v>

2432
01:56:09.241 --> 01:56:11.550
<v Speaker 1>in the basic temperature range so I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to pack.</v>

2433
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:14.850
<v Speaker 1>She gave it to me and I picked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>itinerary up,</v>

2434
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:18.210
<v Speaker 1>got in the car to go to the airport is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this nice lady,</v>

2435
01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:19.620
<v Speaker 1>takes me to the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2436
01:56:19.621 --> 01:56:20.670
<v Speaker 1>where are we going today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hun?</v>

2437
01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see where the boss is sending me.</v>

2438
01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Lima,</v>

2439
01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:25.613
<v Speaker 1>Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I was in Lima and Cusco for a </v>

2440
01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:29.753
<v Speaker 1>week working on my book manuscript and </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking the streets up in the Peruvian </v>

2441
01:56:33.511 --> 01:56:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Andes up in Cusco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I.</v>

2442
01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:39.840
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my life happens out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

2443
01:56:39.930 --> 01:56:44.550
<v Speaker 1>so when I'm here I'm just editing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepping to get outta here.</v>

2444
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:47.310
<v Speaker 1>And so a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low maintenance,</v>

2445
01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:50.760
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low maintenance and conspicuous.</v>

2446
01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:51.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried trying not to have anything on </v>

2447
01:56:54.091 --> 01:56:54.924
<v Speaker 1>this shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to have a listen to black </v>

2448
01:56:56.401 --> 01:56:58.350
<v Speaker 1>sabbath tee shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd wear that one every day.</v>

2449
01:56:58.351 --> 01:56:59.184
<v Speaker 1>I love that shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm always trying to slip through </v>

2450
01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:06.000
<v Speaker 1>crowds and just head down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just blank close.</v>

2451
01:57:06.670 --> 01:57:07.503
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a very interesting philosophy </v>

2452
01:57:08.971 --> 01:57:11.730
<v Speaker 1>and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your work ethic and your flow.</v>

2453
01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:15.210
<v Speaker 1>It's very inspiring because it makes me </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to work more.</v>

2454
01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It really does.</v>

2455
01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:18.390
<v Speaker 1>When I talked to you and I listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get plenty done,</v>

2456
01:57:18.391 --> 01:57:19.141
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I did,</v>

2457
01:57:19.141 --> 01:57:21.990
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the reasons why I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because I get inspired by people like</v>

2458
01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:24.330
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get inspired by you and other people.</v>

2459
01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Like I love getting inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2460
01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I live a fairly solitary life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a lot of heroes.</v>

2461
01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of bands and people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I go to see bands play and they don't </v>

2463
01:57:40.021 --> 01:57:40.854
<v Speaker 1>know what I have all their records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the bootlegs Uber Fan of so many </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2516
02:00:05.531 --> 02:00:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Running up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2517
02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm so happy to get you out of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>jam.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and meet the family.</v>

2519
02:00:14.141 --> 02:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Please don't make me meet your family.</v>

2520
02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>How did you meet Joey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd you meet Joe Ideas?</v>

2521
02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Heidi set that up.</v>

2522
02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>You'd never met him before he shows via </v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidi via you?</v>

2523
02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2524
02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I knew who he was and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a really lovable guy.</v>

2525
02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:38.020
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I met him I liked him just by</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing them online,</v>

2526
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>but when I met him I read there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing not to like,</v>

2527
02:00:40.961 --> 02:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>he's so honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's full,</v>

2528
02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:46.600
<v Speaker 1>full exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who,</v>

2529
02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.020
<v Speaker 1>who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get it in 60 seconds.</v>

2530
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:53.740
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's why people like him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no bs and like,</v>

2531
02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:54.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the good,</v>

2532
02:00:54.611 --> 02:00:55.444
<v Speaker 1>the bad of anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lets you know who he is in the first </v>

2533
02:00:58.961 --> 02:01:00.610
<v Speaker 1>five minutes and you can take or leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2534
02:01:00.730 --> 02:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no ambiguity.</v>

2535
02:01:03.070 --> 02:01:03.903
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked being around that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can be yourself because he </v>

2536
02:01:09.191 --> 02:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>has shown up being himself.</v>

2537
02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.273
<v Speaker 1>He's not holding back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good way of looking at </v>

2538
02:01:13.991 --> 02:01:14.824
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be yourself because he is being </v>

2539
02:01:16.271 --> 02:01:19.270
<v Speaker 1>himself totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's not going to judge you on that.</v>

2540
02:01:19.271 --> 02:01:21.430
<v Speaker 1>It's going to give you the freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be himself,</v>

2541
02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:24.760
<v Speaker 1>but give you also the freedom to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself unlimited.</v>

2542
02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>

2548
02:01:37.930 --> 02:01:38.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:51.993
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to come over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want bullshit smalltalk </v>

2553
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:57.440
<v Speaker 2>and you've got things to do and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed.</v>

2554
02:01:57.441 --> 02:01:57.950
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm,</v>

2555
02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not what I'm trying to get across </v>
<v Speaker 2>as.</v>

2556
02:01:59.901 --> 02:02:02.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mean spirited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just so happy to help.</v>

2557
02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Just a little awkward.</v>

2558
02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:07.740
<v Speaker 2>But he always ready to help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that this thing is,</v>

2559
02:02:07.850 --> 02:02:10.070
<v Speaker 2>the thing of that awkwardness is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuel.</v>

2560
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:11.383
<v Speaker 2>It's like we were talking about about </v>
<v Speaker 2>having imposter syndrome that I don't </v>

2561
02:02:13.851 --> 02:02:15.820
<v Speaker 2>think it ever goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought one day it would go,</v>

2562
02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:16.753
<v Speaker 2>it would go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more comfortable meeting famous </v>

2563
02:02:18.651 --> 02:02:21.440
<v Speaker 2>people now than I've ever been before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still feel full of shit.</v>

2564
02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:22.573
<v Speaker 2>I think you always will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody that I've ever talked to </v>

2565
02:02:23.841 --> 02:02:24.500
<v Speaker 2>that is any good.</v>

2566
02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:25.333
<v Speaker 2>They all say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they all kind of feel like no one </v>

2567
02:02:27.801 --> 02:02:31.220
<v Speaker 2>ever feels like they're anything special</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you always like,</v>

2568
02:02:31.221 --> 02:02:32.054
<v Speaker 2>if there were any good they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you always ruthlessly self critical </v>

2569
02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:37.730
<v Speaker 2>and trying to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've worked with big actors,</v>

2623
02:04:46.141 --> 02:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>finally I got so cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went home.</v>

2624
02:04:48.570 --> 02:04:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you waited in line to meet me?</v>

2625
02:04:51.121 --> 02:04:51.954
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not really what I do.</v>

2633
02:05:06.931 --> 02:05:07.651
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

2634
02:05:07.651 --> 02:05:09.030
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

2636
02:05:11.881 --> 02:05:12.900
<v Speaker 1>So that stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2637
02:05:12.901 --> 02:05:13.734
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a pretty big place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot his feet to before the first </v>

2638
02:05:17.011 --> 02:05:18.060
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2639
02:05:18.061 --> 02:05:18.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you're George Carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're going to do okay.</v>

2641
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:25.050
<v Speaker 1>But he was sincerely wondering like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it going to be okay in there?</v>

2642
02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding?</v>

2643
02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:27.713
<v Speaker 1>You were handcuffed with lenny bruce in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of a cop car and you're asking </v>

2644
02:05:31.831 --> 02:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>me if it's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was He handcuffed?</v>

2645
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great book.</v>

2646
02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:40.050
<v Speaker 1>It's an that great book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and Gentlemen,</v>

2647
02:05:40.050 --> 02:05:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2648
02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:43.080
<v Speaker 1>in that book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great read reading and a half.</v>

2649
02:05:43.081 --> 02:05:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I've read it like 22 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fantastic.</v>

2650
02:05:45.331 --> 02:05:49.130
<v Speaker 1>I think I read it that long ago to </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot about dre was a time when the,</v>

2651
02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:49.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

2652
02:05:49.921 --> 02:05:50.754
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first amendment was not being used </v>

2653
02:05:52.951 --> 02:05:55.440
<v Speaker 1>in Lenny Bruce's life towards the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his life and that was his.</v>

2654
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Every standup thing he did was about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>law towards the end and using,</v>

2655
02:06:00.170 --> 02:06:01.003
<v Speaker 1>doing a show one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin was there under age and </v>

2656
02:06:04.410 --> 02:06:05.970
<v Speaker 1>George said something and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting.</v>

2657
02:06:05.971 --> 02:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>They pounced on them and then they went </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the crowd Id id id.</v>

2658
02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:09.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come here,</v>

2659
02:06:09.601 --> 02:06:12.060
<v Speaker 1>youngster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they handcuffed them together.</v>

2660
02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:14.760
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how you met Lenny Bruce,</v>

2661
02:06:14.761 --> 02:06:15.331
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2662
02:06:15.331 --> 02:06:17.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had met him before,</v>

2663
02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:18.593
<v Speaker 1>but he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were literally one pair of handcuffs </v>

2664
02:06:20.370 --> 02:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>together just like the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought that's easily.</v>

2665
02:06:23.670 --> 02:06:24.690
<v Speaker 1>That's not how we met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2666
02:06:24.691 --> 02:06:26.400
<v Speaker 1>so how'd you guys meet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2667
02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Bruce was very sympathetic to </v>
<v Speaker 1>young comics,</v>

2668
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:33.780
<v Speaker 1>so what we would do is like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me your best five minutes,</v>

2669
02:06:33.810 --> 02:06:35.410
<v Speaker 1>and he would critique us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2670
02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Soon as he tried to take your mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2671
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.271
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2672
02:06:37.271 --> 02:06:37.680
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just.</v>

2673
02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:38.161
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2674
02:06:38.161 --> 02:06:39.180
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave that part out.</v>

2675
02:06:39.181 --> 02:06:42.150
<v Speaker 1>That part sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do more of that in that first part.</v>

2676
02:06:42.151 --> 02:06:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Put it lasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would like help.</v>

2677
02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:45.960
<v Speaker 1>When he said he was great with all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>young comics,</v>

2678
02:06:45.961 --> 02:06:47.100
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll give me your stuff.</v>

2679
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how you redo it.</v>

2680
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2681
02:06:50.341 --> 02:06:51.930
<v Speaker 1>so you had known him before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2682
02:06:51.931 --> 02:06:53.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2683
02:06:53.251 --> 02:06:54.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2684
02:06:54.610 --> 02:06:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Bruce to me is a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2685
02:06:56.321 --> 02:06:59.940
<v Speaker 1>a hero and inspiration fought back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2686
02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked out of there until like,</v>

2687
02:07:02.541 --> 02:07:03.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freezing,</v>

2688
02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:06.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>east New York to take the end of the car</v>

2689
02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:07.313
<v Speaker 1>back down to the East village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that here's this guy with </v>

2690
02:07:10.810 --> 02:07:11.643
<v Speaker 1>the point I'm making is stone cold pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere where I sell out half the </v>

2691
02:07:15.481 --> 02:07:19.560
<v Speaker 1>tickets he does 20 nights there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in know you'll never get out of that</v>

2692
02:07:19.561 --> 02:07:21.510
<v Speaker 1>shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even he is saying,</v>

2693
02:07:21.511 --> 02:07:22.344
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a question and here's what I've </v>

2694
02:07:24.631 --> 02:07:28.770
<v Speaker 1>found with all of your big actors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

2695
02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:30.240
<v Speaker 1>the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones I've worked with,</v>

2696
02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:34.440
<v Speaker 1>they are obedient to the muse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They work for the art.</v>

2697
02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:38.740
<v Speaker 1>They are so subservient to the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about,</v>

2698
02:07:38.741 --> 02:07:39.401
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm rich,</v>

2699
02:07:39.401 --> 02:07:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm populous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like dammit,</v>

2700
02:07:40.850 --> 02:07:41.683
<v Speaker 1>I gotta make this script come to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they fear it like someone on their </v>

2701
02:07:46.091 --> 02:07:48.940
<v Speaker 1>first job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there might've been a middle period,</v>

2702
02:07:48.941 --> 02:07:49.774
<v Speaker 1>like in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had their idiot phase for three </v>

2703
02:07:51.941 --> 02:07:54.820
<v Speaker 1>years and they kind of went sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

2704
02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:57.850
<v Speaker 1>the big actors I've worked with are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

2705
02:07:57.851 --> 02:07:58.684
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this take is everything and it's a good </v>

2706
02:08:00.731 --> 02:08:01.361
<v Speaker 1>lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2707
02:08:01.361 --> 02:08:03.130
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never lose that.</v>

2708
02:08:03.190 --> 02:08:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you have when you're</v>

2709
02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:05.353
<v Speaker 4>young and you're coming up and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to show promise and somewhere </v>

2710
02:08:08.211 --> 02:08:09.044
<v Speaker 4>along the line it seems like some people</v>
<v Speaker 4>get into this mindset that they deserve </v>

2711
02:08:13.371 --> 02:08:14.204
<v Speaker 4>it and when they deserve it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a terrible thing that happens to </v>

2712
02:08:17.301 --> 02:08:18.890
<v Speaker 4>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something that happens.</v>

2713
02:08:18.891 --> 02:08:19.724
<v Speaker 4>Comedians when they can't relate to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people anymore and they stopped being </v>

2714
02:08:21.951 --> 02:08:22.784
<v Speaker 4>relevant and by George waiting in line </v>
<v Speaker 4>to see you outside in the cold shows </v>

2715
02:08:27.291 --> 02:08:28.124
<v Speaker 4>that he never really got to that place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that bad place and he was probably </v>

2716
02:08:32.211 --> 02:08:36.020
<v Speaker 4>the most prolific standup of all time </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he never stopped.</v>

2717
02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:40.670
<v Speaker 4>He would do a fresh hbo our every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every year he would just sit down and he</v>

2718
02:08:40.671 --> 02:08:41.504
<v Speaker 4>would write it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would write it all out and then he </v>

2719
02:08:44.121 --> 02:08:46.760
<v Speaker 4>would just kind of fine tuned it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sort of like you were saying,</v>

2720
02:08:46.761 --> 02:08:47.594
<v Speaker 4>you do nude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fine tune it and performance after </v>

2721
02:08:49.971 --> 02:08:50.804
<v Speaker 4>performance and then put it on hbo and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then start working on the next one and </v>

2722
02:08:53.931 --> 02:08:55.010
<v Speaker 4>then just crank them out.</v>

2723
02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:56.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was told by someone who had a in as </v>

2724
02:08:58.161 --> 02:08:58.994
<v Speaker 1>venue in northern California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just sits in front of the mirror </v>

2725
02:09:01.251 --> 02:09:04.640
<v Speaker 1>before the show and does the whole show </v>
<v Speaker 1>at hyper speed and the low voice.</v>

2726
02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:07.413
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that on a TV show once means the </v>

2727
02:09:10.071 --> 02:09:11.740
<v Speaker 1>actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the actors ideas say,</v>

2728
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:12.583
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in my trailer and we did the </v>

2729
02:09:13.371 --> 02:09:14.204
<v Speaker 1>whole show at hyperspeed and the low </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice standing in a huddle was really </v>

2730
02:09:18.891 --> 02:09:21.230
<v Speaker 1>cool because we were in each other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>face going on.</v>

2731
02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:23.600
<v Speaker 1>It's funny and we just kind of did it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

2732
02:09:23.601 --> 02:09:27.020
<v Speaker 1>like crazy mumbling fest for like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and we're like,</v>

2733
02:09:27.021 --> 02:09:28.060
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2734
02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:30.170
<v Speaker 1>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went out there and did it.</v>

2735
02:09:30.171 --> 02:09:31.004
<v Speaker 1>It was like live in front of a TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and it was like I'd never done </v>

2736
02:09:33.231 --> 02:09:36.680
<v Speaker 1>that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really cool and apparently that's</v>

2737
02:09:36.681 --> 02:09:37.850
<v Speaker 1>how George preps.</v>

2738
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

2739
02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:40.333
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody else who does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't even look at </v>

2740
02:09:42.951 --> 02:09:45.140
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't stand in front of a mirror,</v>

2741
02:09:45.170 --> 02:09:48.380
<v Speaker 1>they just don't look at myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do one thing that actually works.</v>

2742
02:09:48.381 --> 02:09:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2743
02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2744
02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:57.050
<v Speaker 1>I quote Lincoln's speeches as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>centering exercise,</v>

2745
02:09:58.190 --> 02:10:00.650
<v Speaker 1>especially as speech from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like January 19th,</v>

2746
02:10:00.651 --> 02:10:02.000
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>38 kimmy some,</v>

2747
02:10:02.210 --> 02:10:05.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a famous speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said when he was talking about,</v>

2748
02:10:05.181 --> 02:10:09.230
<v Speaker 1>will America ever be taken over by </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else?</v>

2749
02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:09.861
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2750
02:10:09.861 --> 02:10:11.870
<v Speaker 1>the only way America's going to fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>from within.</v>

2751
02:10:12.290 --> 02:10:13.123
<v Speaker 1>So we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we fear some transatlantic giant </v>

2752
02:10:15.131 --> 02:10:17.450
<v Speaker 1>to cross the ocean and crushes us a </v>
<v Speaker 1>blow?</v>

2753
02:10:17.630 --> 02:10:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2754
02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:19.603
<v Speaker 1>all the country in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and Africa with their war chests </v>

2755
02:10:23.690 --> 02:10:24.523
<v Speaker 1>combined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ours with charges of the world aren't </v>

2756
02:10:26.450 --> 02:10:27.283
<v Speaker 1>accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Bonaparte as a commander could not </v>

2757
02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:30.373
<v Speaker 1>in a trial of a thousand years so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>as take a sip from the river or a tread </v>

2758
02:10:34.341 --> 02:10:35.090
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

2759
02:10:35.090 --> 02:10:36.350
<v Speaker 1>on the Blue Ridge mountains.</v>

2760
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if suicide,</v>

2761
02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:41.210
<v Speaker 1>if destruction be our lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2762
02:10:41.211 --> 02:10:42.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must,</v>

2763
02:10:42.651 --> 02:10:43.484
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either live through all the time or die </v>

2764
02:10:45.701 --> 02:10:46.534
<v Speaker 1>by suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just take chunks of that speech </v>

2765
02:10:48.951 --> 02:10:50.480
<v Speaker 1>because it's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 28,</v>

2766
02:10:50.481 --> 02:10:52.520
<v Speaker 1>29 years of age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so eloquent.</v>

2767
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:56.060
<v Speaker 1>A sentence of Lincoln is worth 10 of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else's.</v>

2768
02:10:56.090 --> 02:10:59.060
<v Speaker 1>It's all online for free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but go to the.</v>

2769
02:10:59.061 --> 02:10:59.894
<v Speaker 1>It's called the speech to the young </v>
<v Speaker 1>men's lyceum or the perpetuation of our </v>

2770
02:11:02.181 --> 02:11:06.170
<v Speaker 1>government institutions and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>3,200 words and it's.</v>

2771
02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:07.820
<v Speaker 1>It'll be the best thing you read this </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

2772
02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:09.980
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't work as a centering exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2773
02:11:09.981 --> 02:11:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I just get in the Lincoln framework </v>
<v Speaker 1>where words matter to him.</v>

2774
02:11:12.561 --> 02:11:15.230
<v Speaker 1>He's a lawyer and a politician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's a double bastard.</v>

2775
02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I was in the vault of the Lincoln Museum</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Springfield a few years ago.</v>

2776
02:11:21.111 --> 02:11:24.830
<v Speaker 1>They let me in and they pull it out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his,</v>

2777
02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>a beaver skin top hats and they.</v>

2778
02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:28.930
<v Speaker 1>They won't let me touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I didn't try,</v>

2779
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:30.560
<v Speaker 1>but the guy with the gloves pulls it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

2780
02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:35.180
<v Speaker 1>do you notice an indentation on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right side of the brim?</v>

2781
02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:36.051
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2782
02:11:36.051 --> 02:11:37.010
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think that is?</v>

2783
02:11:37.011 --> 02:11:38.170
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me guess there.</v>

2784
02:11:38.410 --> 02:11:41.480
<v Speaker 1>There's one on top and two underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I looked and there was,</v>

2785
02:11:41.481 --> 02:11:46.481
<v Speaker 1>I said that's him doffing his cap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hat over and over again,</v>

2786
02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:49.230
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what wears out the beaver skin.</v>

2787
02:11:49.231 --> 02:11:50.064
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2788
02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:51.680
<v Speaker 1>how do you think you wore it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2789
02:11:51.681 --> 02:11:55.340
<v Speaker 1>he's a politician and a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's trying to get everyone's vote.</v>

2790
02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

2791
02:11:57.021 --> 02:11:57.681
<v Speaker 1>good morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good morning,</v>

2792
02:11:57.681 --> 02:11:59.600
<v Speaker 1>good morning world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have an office and I'm running</v>

2793
02:11:59.601 --> 02:12:00.920
<v Speaker 1>for office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2794
02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:01.813
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably it.</v>

2795
02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:03.830
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>

2796
02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:05.630
<v Speaker 1>These beaver skin line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hats.</v>

2797
02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the outside of it and this famous</v>

2798
02:12:08.150 --> 02:12:10.190
<v Speaker 1>hats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw him in the Lincoln Museum.</v>

2799
02:12:10.191 --> 02:12:14.500
<v Speaker 1>They have one in the vault and literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wore out the hide.</v>

2800
02:12:14.690 --> 02:12:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2801
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:20.810
<v Speaker 1>but I use Lincoln and amendments from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Constitution.</v>

2802
02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 14th is a,</v>

2803
02:12:23.870 --> 02:12:26.730
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in four parts or five parts.</v>

2804
02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:30.680
<v Speaker 1>The top part for we the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest is legal ease and I'll do that.</v>

2805
02:12:30.681 --> 02:12:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Or the fourth amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The privacy one.</v>

2806
02:12:32.571 --> 02:12:33.404
<v Speaker 1>That's a great one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not completely in the front of my </v>

2807
02:12:35.271 --> 02:12:36.104
<v Speaker 1>brain pan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I carry a copy of the constitution </v>

2808
02:12:37.881 --> 02:12:38.714
<v Speaker 1>with me whenever I travel and I open it </v>
<v Speaker 1>like people open the Bible and all just </v>

2809
02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:44.320
<v Speaker 1>pick an amendment and read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2810
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2811
02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:45.981
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2812
02:12:45.981 --> 02:12:46.814
<v Speaker 1>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constitution for idiot books were </v>

2813
02:12:48.231 --> 02:12:51.110
<v Speaker 1>like lawyers write about here's when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was brought into law,</v>

2814
02:12:51.111 --> 02:12:51.920
<v Speaker 1>here's why.</v>

2815
02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Here's what it means in layman terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's never not interesting to read.</v>

2816
02:12:57.900 --> 02:12:58.733
<v Speaker 1>The constitution is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is fascinating and we think this is </v>

2817
02:13:00.651 --> 02:13:01.484
<v Speaker 1>an experiment in self government that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people from 300 years ago put </v>

2818
02:13:04.911 --> 02:13:05.750
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda,</v>

2819
02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:11.140
<v Speaker 1>they kinda are gods to me in that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't see the future.</v>

2820
02:13:11.481 --> 02:13:16.481
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they couldn't see the Ar 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Jefferson and company definitely saw</v>

2821
02:13:17.121 --> 02:13:20.660
<v Speaker 1>how easily corruptible humans are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give him a little bit of power.</v>

2822
02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:21.553
<v Speaker 1>We can get a little crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And American democracy is really all </v>

2823
02:13:24.591 --> 02:13:25.610
<v Speaker 1>about the checks you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2824
02:13:25.611 --> 02:13:27.230
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad ass,</v>

2825
02:13:27.231 --> 02:13:30.140
<v Speaker 1>but you're not a bad ass as Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress is going to check.</v>

2826
02:13:30.141 --> 02:13:30.974
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing now with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean trump where we're essentially </v>

2827
02:13:33.751 --> 02:13:34.584
<v Speaker 1>seeing the reason why all these checks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and balances are put in place in the </v>

2828
02:13:38.341 --> 02:13:40.600
<v Speaker 1>first place because he's just like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2829
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Because we have president comes from we </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people.</v>

2830
02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:46.913
<v Speaker 1>It can be you or me potentially and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the framers really saw that like </v>

2831
02:13:51.991 --> 02:13:52.824
<v Speaker 1>it should be from the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got to put this person in checks </v>

2832
02:13:55.711 --> 02:13:59.370
<v Speaker 1>because he might be a failed </v>
<v Speaker 1>businessman,</v>

2833
02:13:59.371 --> 02:14:02.400
<v Speaker 1>bad reality show actor who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

2834
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I have to read 1500 pages of stuff this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend and have five lawyers advised me</v>

2835
02:14:07.410 --> 02:14:08.243
<v Speaker 1>no golf for fun for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the president and a lot of </v>

2836
02:14:11.191 --> 02:14:13.440
<v Speaker 1>presidents do understand before they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2837
02:14:13.441 --> 02:14:13.831
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

2838
02:14:13.831 --> 02:14:17.250
<v Speaker 1>this job's going to be boring and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people are going to be mad.</v>

2839
02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:18.173
<v Speaker 1>And in my lifetime we finally have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>president who really is from the people </v>

2840
02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:23.760
<v Speaker 1>who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2841
02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:25.560
<v Speaker 1>he looks at like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2842
02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:27.470
<v Speaker 1>here's eight folders of stuff to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

2843
02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me the cliff notes.</v>

2844
02:14:29.490 --> 02:14:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2845
02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll play it from the hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2846
02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:33.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch Fox.</v>

2847
02:14:33.331 --> 02:14:34.164
<v Speaker 1>And friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell me what I needed to know and </v>

2848
02:14:35.731 --> 02:14:36.564
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not for me to sit and rip on the </v>

2849
02:14:37.921 --> 02:14:39.990
<v Speaker 1>guy because he's not here to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

2850
02:14:39.991 --> 02:14:40.824
<v Speaker 1>but never in my life have I ever watched</v>
<v Speaker 1>an American president thought to myself </v>

2851
02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I could have done better in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

2852
02:14:48.050 --> 02:14:50.460
<v Speaker 1>And there's presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had nothing but disagree with,</v>

2853
02:14:50.461 --> 02:14:53.550
<v Speaker 1>but they were way better for the job </v>
<v Speaker 1>than I ever could be.</v>

2854
02:14:54.270 --> 02:14:56.190
<v Speaker 1>I look at this guy and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2855
02:14:56.191 --> 02:15:00.380
<v Speaker 1>you just got played and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something out.</v>

2856
02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:02.250
<v Speaker 1>When I knew I was going to be talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2857
02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:05.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing I was thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2858
02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:06.503
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2859
02:15:06.510 --> 02:15:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I heard you speak many years ago about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these politicians are gangster.</v>

2860
02:15:11.461 --> 02:15:12.294
<v Speaker 1>He said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2861
02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:13.193
<v Speaker 1>what that guy did that's Gangsta and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what this guy just did straight up </v>

2862
02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:18.660
<v Speaker 1>gangsters during the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>

2863
02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:20.730
<v Speaker 1>You are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like Halliburton,</v>

2864
02:15:20.731 --> 02:15:23.250
<v Speaker 1>all these people that change the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

2865
02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:25.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a gangster move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a gangster movie.</v>

2866
02:15:25.581 --> 02:15:26.414
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't disagree with anything he just </v>

2867
02:15:27.331 --> 02:15:30.090
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on that kind of level,</v>

2868
02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I think what I hear is that Donald trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a guy who gets consistently played,</v>

2869
02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:40.650
<v Speaker 1>rolled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got rolled by his wife,</v>

2870
02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:41.753
<v Speaker 1>who a woman I have nothing against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she comes from a really tough part </v>

2871
02:15:44.881 --> 02:15:45.714
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slovenia as just a rough patch or real </v>

2872
02:15:47.851 --> 02:15:49.230
<v Speaker 1>estate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's smart,</v>

2873
02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:52.110
<v Speaker 1>she's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she got out cut to America.</v>

2874
02:15:52.590 --> 02:15:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not much on looks,</v>

2875
02:15:54.750 --> 02:15:59.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's a way in from the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he got played by his wife.</v>

2876
02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:04.910
<v Speaker 1>He got played by Paul Manafort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got played by Kim Jong Un.</v>

2877
02:16:05.490 --> 02:16:06.323
<v Speaker 1>He got played like Jimi Hendrix at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monterrey that that particular </v>

2878
02:16:11.670 --> 02:16:16.670
<v Speaker 1>stratocaster by Vladimir Putin and gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>played like rock modern off every single</v>

2879
02:16:18.451 --> 02:16:19.284
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2880
02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:24.410
<v Speaker 1>And anyone he does high stakes business </v>
<v Speaker 1>with negotiations.</v>

2881
02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:29.540
<v Speaker 1>He gets played,</v>
<v Speaker 1>played and and Manafort just used him to</v>

2882
02:16:29.681 --> 02:16:33.640
<v Speaker 1>try and get out of debt and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

2883
02:16:33.641 --> 02:16:38.641
<v Speaker 1>they just roll all over him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately his Hubris is such.</v>

2884
02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:40.570
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha ha,</v>

2885
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:45.310
<v Speaker 1>like no dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just got blown out and like everyone</v>

2886
02:16:45.311 --> 02:16:46.144
<v Speaker 1>around you is playing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We probably doesn't feel that way with </v>

2887
02:16:48.161 --> 02:16:51.640
<v Speaker 1>manafort because manafort's on trial and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not yet right,</v>

2888
02:16:51.641 --> 02:16:52.474
<v Speaker 1>but manafort playdom [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>manafort really does play in that world </v>

2889
02:16:56.141 --> 02:16:58.930
<v Speaker 1>of oligarchs and millions of dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>laundering money.</v>

2890
02:16:59.710 --> 02:17:00.543
<v Speaker 1>If he wrote a book I was telling someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day as I have all these </v>

2891
02:17:02.801 --> 02:17:03.634
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should write the book because it </v>

2892
02:17:04.541 --> 02:17:06.820
<v Speaker 1>would be a page turner if he told the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

2893
02:17:06.821 --> 02:17:07.654
<v Speaker 1>would get him killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He touched the wrong door knob and he </v>

2894
02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:14.890
<v Speaker 1>gets poisoned because Putin can't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>him telling what he knows.</v>

2895
02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:18.310
<v Speaker 1>He's a man that he probably will go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>

2896
02:17:18.670 --> 02:17:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Watch him have some kind of strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>

2897
02:17:23.650 --> 02:17:26.860
<v Speaker 1>He was liquefied in the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something about the water.</v>

2898
02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he knows a lot and there's a lot</v>

2899
02:17:29.801 --> 02:17:32.560
<v Speaker 1>of people who can pay a lot of money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep his mouth shut.</v>

2900
02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:33.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2901
02:17:33.611 --> 02:17:36.880
<v Speaker 1>you know what's fascinating to me is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that over the last year too,</v>

2902
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:41.920
<v Speaker 1>especially from the Fox crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing Vladimir Putin admired.</v>

2903
02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:45.880
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought we would see that.</v>

2904
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a something a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2905
02:17:50.970 --> 02:17:52.600
<v Speaker 1>a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

2906
02:17:52.601 --> 02:17:53.530
<v Speaker 1>some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2907
02:17:53.531 --> 02:17:55.930
<v Speaker 1>he's a good Christian man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he believes in family.</v>

2908
02:17:55.931 --> 02:17:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the butcher of Chechnya.</v>

2909
02:17:59.290 --> 02:18:00.123
<v Speaker 1>Let's flash back to the 19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a young boy on the weekend visit </v>

2910
02:18:03.131 --> 02:18:06.340
<v Speaker 1>with my father to the right of my father</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a wall.</v>

2911
02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:07.900
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to the right of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

2912
02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2913
02:18:09.971 --> 02:18:10.804
<v Speaker 1>if he's still with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be in his nineties and hard as a </v>

2914
02:18:13.451 --> 02:18:15.310
<v Speaker 1>rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like nothing.</v>

2915
02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:19.060
<v Speaker 1>He's like a bar of Hickory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

2916
02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an economist.</v>

2917
02:18:21.310 --> 02:18:23.770
<v Speaker 1>He's a numbers guy and a phd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real smart.</v>

2918
02:18:24.430 --> 02:18:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming home to my mom's apartment </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Saturday,</v>

2919
02:18:28.690 --> 02:18:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Sunday visit with dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in the Washington DC area.</v>

2920
02:18:32.140 --> 02:18:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years old,</v>

2921
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:38.170
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very small economist and Communist.</v>

2922
02:18:38.290 --> 02:18:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what either of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably to a five year old.</v>

2923
02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Kind of sounds the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the big buick station wagon to my</v>

2924
02:18:46.901 --> 02:18:49.780
<v Speaker 1>father's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're pulling up to mom's apartment.</v>

2925
02:18:50.530 --> 02:18:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Henri Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you a communist?</v>

2926
02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't think my father's facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression changed.</v>

2927
02:18:58.570 --> 02:19:03.570
<v Speaker 1>His right hand came off the wheel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his backhand collided with my head.</v>

2928
02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:07.210
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear the word Communist,</v>

2929
02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:11.650
<v Speaker 1>a boy get smacked and it was without </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred or violence.</v>

2930
02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:14.890
<v Speaker 1>It was like national security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whack.</v>

2931
02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:17.680
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even know he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a sneeze,</v>

2932
02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:20.560
<v Speaker 1>like Kapow and it hurts so much.</v>

2933
02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:24.970
<v Speaker 1>My head went numb and it was not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain.</v>

2934
02:19:24.971 --> 02:19:27.450
<v Speaker 1>It was the shock of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2935
02:19:27.670 --> 02:19:28.503
<v Speaker 1>your dad whacking you with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had no idea what you did and all I </v>

2936
02:19:32.991 --> 02:19:33.824
<v Speaker 1>could do was hyperventilate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he opened the door and he let me </v>

2937
02:19:37.281 --> 02:19:38.960
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say a word.</v>

2938
02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:39.853
<v Speaker 1>He didn't tell you that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between a communist and an </v>

2939
02:19:41.811 --> 02:19:45.170
<v Speaker 1>economist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I left for like,</v>

2940
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:46.770
<v Speaker 1>till I was like 33,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2941
02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:51.290
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's so destabilizing.</v>

2942
02:19:51.291 --> 02:19:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Like your dad just walloped you and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of the elevator.</v>

2943
02:19:55.341 --> 02:19:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I go into the apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did that till I was like,</v>

2944
02:19:59.661 --> 02:20:02.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until two years ago it was totally.</v>

2945
02:20:02.810 --> 02:20:03.591
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

2946
02:20:03.591 --> 02:20:05.000
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2947
02:20:05.001 --> 02:20:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I asked dad if he was a commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2948
02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:09.710
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point I'm making is this,</v>

2949
02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:12.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people who voted for </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

2950
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Were you say Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say a bunch of sons of bitches.</v>

2951
02:20:17.931 --> 02:20:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Trust them as far as you can throw your </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

2952
02:20:20.390 --> 02:20:21.223
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I see staunch conservative </v>

2953
02:20:24.141 --> 02:20:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Republicans is going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2954
02:20:25.251 --> 02:20:26.390
<v Speaker 1>that Burton guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2955
02:20:27.170 --> 02:20:31.700
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad's heads are exploding.</v>

2956
02:20:31.701 --> 02:20:36.701
<v Speaker 1>He's an old Cold War Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would wash a Boris and Natasha,</v>

2957
02:20:36.711 --> 02:20:38.960
<v Speaker 1>whatever that cartoon was as a Winco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2958
02:20:38.961 --> 02:20:41.630
<v Speaker 1>as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm laughing because the guy with,</v>

2959
02:20:41.650 --> 02:20:44.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad's laughing on a whole other level</v>

2960
02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:48.260
<v Speaker 1>because it's Cold War funnies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's was written for the parents.</v>

2961
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:52.300
<v Speaker 1>The kids get the cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parents got the jokes that,</v>

2962
02:20:52.301 --> 02:20:54.980
<v Speaker 1>that was for adults with their kids on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday.</v>

2963
02:20:55.430 --> 02:20:56.960
<v Speaker 1>You watch them later on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2964
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:58.580
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is cold war humor.</v>

2965
02:20:58.970 --> 02:21:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's my dad's world.</v>

2966
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:02.443
<v Speaker 1>You say Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd probably hate my guts because I've </v>

2967
02:21:04.140 --> 02:21:08.360
<v Speaker 1>been there six times for shows and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the Trans Siberian express.</v>

2968
02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And so this warming up to a guy who is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>true bad guy,</v>

2969
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:18.980
<v Speaker 1>he's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's bodies buried because of him.</v>

2970
02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:22.640
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the scariest cars on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet in and capably violent.</v>

2971
02:21:22.641 --> 02:21:25.970
<v Speaker 1>And we'll have you taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like an a political sky.</v>

2972
02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:27.650
<v Speaker 1>One of the greatest journalists of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2973
02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:31.850
<v Speaker 1>She was critical of Putin and she got </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassinated in your apartment building.</v>

2974
02:21:31.851 --> 02:21:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Her books are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her books from Chechnya are amazing.</v>

2975
02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:35.473
<v Speaker 1>And like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was critical of him and she had to </v>

2976
02:21:37.401 --> 02:21:38.234
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you see our president cozying </v>

2977
02:21:40.131 --> 02:21:41.930
<v Speaker 1>up to this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to go,</v>

2978
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:44.150
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk.</v>

2979
02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a walk in the garden for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

2980
02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:49.810
<v Speaker 1>You can't be friends with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My theory is he,</v>

2981
02:21:50.410 --> 02:21:51.230
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2982
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:52.790
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some kind of finances.</v>

2983
02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:53.953
<v Speaker 1>Whereas he's got a stick up for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a tape of people </v>

2984
02:21:57.081 --> 02:21:58.160
<v Speaker 1>urinating on anyone.</v>

2985
02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:00.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it says money too cliche to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2986
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2987
02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:02.600
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2988
02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:03.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a money thing.</v>

2989
02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a hotel deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's money sitting in Cyprus.</v>

2990
02:22:06.381 --> 02:22:07.214
<v Speaker 1>It's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that we're being becoming </v>

2991
02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:11.533
<v Speaker 1>okay with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the part that bugs me the most </v>

2992
02:22:16.250 --> 02:22:17.083
<v Speaker 1>and why people in Congress or guy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean Hannity who like probably likes </v>

2993
02:22:21.561 --> 02:22:26.561
<v Speaker 1>Communist as much as my dad even me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trust people like that at all.</v>

2994
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Putin is a criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should be in jail for a million,</v>

2995
02:22:31.471 --> 02:22:33.600
<v Speaker 1>billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact like,</v>

2996
02:22:33.601 --> 02:22:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like when he's a strong leader,</v>

2997
02:22:36.290 --> 02:22:37.160
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2998
02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:38.850
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a human being.</v>

2999
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:40.240
<v Speaker 1>We can talk like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>

3000
02:22:40.290 --> 02:22:44.730
<v Speaker 1>he's a kgb guy who and there's no such </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as next KGB guy,</v>

3001
02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:45.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3002
02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Gb for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for life.</v>

3003
02:22:47.730 --> 02:22:50.880
<v Speaker 1>And he's a supreme operative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he does is he,</v>

3004
02:22:50.910 --> 02:22:52.950
<v Speaker 1>he rolls people like you dude.</v>

3005
02:22:53.250 --> 02:22:56.160
<v Speaker 1>And like cut you are a guppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a shark.</v>

3006
02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:57.653
<v Speaker 1>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3007
02:22:57.690 --> 02:22:58.523
<v Speaker 1>Two guys hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one guy getting played in one guy </v>

3008
02:23:00.811 --> 02:23:03.620
<v Speaker 1>playing someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he admires the fact that Putin's</v>

3009
02:23:03.630 --> 02:23:05.760
<v Speaker 1>able to run his country the way he does </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3010
02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:06.653
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why he likes to tear Tay and </v>

3011
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:09.840
<v Speaker 1>wound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been tested.</v>

3012
02:23:09.841 --> 02:23:10.650
<v Speaker 1>We said about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

3013
02:23:10.650 --> 02:23:12.420
<v Speaker 1>He said he's a strong head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was.</v>

3014
02:23:13.370 --> 02:23:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to the Philippines,</v>

3015
02:23:14.761 --> 02:23:18.660
<v Speaker 1>I've been to North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tough places to live and like,</v>

3016
02:23:18.661 --> 02:23:20.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't want your country looking like</v>
<v Speaker 1>those places.</v>

3017
02:23:20.701 --> 02:23:21.534
<v Speaker 1>You don't want America to be like Russia</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the economy is destroyed and there's </v>

3018
02:23:26.551 --> 02:23:29.490
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people like in the wintertime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really tough.</v>

3019
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:31.770
<v Speaker 1>How do you think the scene is the scene?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to jail?</v>

3020
02:23:31.950 --> 02:23:33.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3021
02:23:34.210 --> 02:23:37.890
<v Speaker 1>because I don't believe in Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karma.</v>

3022
02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Here's my two words that disproved </v>
<v Speaker 1>Karma.</v>

3023
02:23:40.110 --> 02:23:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Dick Cheney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a new heart and a new heart.</v>

3024
02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:45.750
<v Speaker 1>He has no pulse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is perfectly.</v>

3025
02:23:45.751 --> 02:23:48.240
<v Speaker 1>He's got a pulse now with the new heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

3026
02:23:48.250 --> 02:23:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Machine.</v>

3027
02:23:49.231 --> 02:23:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And he just heard a wash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is perfect for him.</v>

3028
02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:57.150
<v Speaker 1>He may very well live because he looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's watching his weight now.</v>

3029
02:23:57.180 --> 02:24:00.300
<v Speaker 1>He's like looking lean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might live to be 105.</v>

3030
02:24:00.810 --> 02:24:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he'll never go to jail.</v>

3031
02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:05.640
<v Speaker 1>And like how many millions does he make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a year?</v>

3032
02:24:05.641 --> 02:24:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Just from his dividends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from whatever.</v>

3033
02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Like who knows what you do with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of money?</v>

3034
02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't think he goes to jail.</v>

3035
02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think jared cushner goes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>

3036
02:24:15.450 --> 02:24:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they leave like maybe next year.</v>

3037
02:24:18.481 --> 02:24:19.314
<v Speaker 1>And they go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drained the swamp I did when I came </v>

3038
02:24:21.031 --> 02:24:21.864
<v Speaker 1>here to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fake news media brought me down </v>

3039
02:24:23.970 --> 02:24:26.610
<v Speaker 1>and all his people buy one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3040
02:24:26.610 --> 02:24:27.443
<v Speaker 1>He makes forever stake vodka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's possible that Donald Trump </v>

3041
02:24:29.971 --> 02:24:32.760
<v Speaker 1>jr goes to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible they're talking about</v>

3042
02:24:32.761 --> 02:24:36.210
<v Speaker 1>perjury charges against him now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own dad admitted on twitter.</v>

3043
02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:38.033
<v Speaker 1>I follow all that stuff as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think white collar guys go </v>

3044
02:24:41.371 --> 02:24:43.470
<v Speaker 1>to prison for stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't believe it.</v>

3045
02:24:44.490 --> 02:24:46.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't believe it.</v>

3046
02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:49.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to be proven wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have all the facts.</v>

3047
02:24:49.470 --> 02:24:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a news watcher.</v>

3048
02:24:50.791 --> 02:24:51.624
<v Speaker 1>I know nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get any classified briefs so I </v>

3049
02:24:53.971 --> 02:24:57.180
<v Speaker 1>only know what I read and what I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talk about any of this stuff and your</v>

3050
02:24:57.181 --> 02:25:00.510
<v Speaker 1>stage act a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But knowing my audience,</v>

3051
02:25:00.511 --> 02:25:05.511
<v Speaker 1>they're very sharp and they read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>readers and they don't need me repeating</v>

3052
02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:08.460
<v Speaker 1>what they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

3053
02:25:08.490 --> 02:25:09.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you for that.</v>

3054
02:25:09.570 --> 02:25:10.403
<v Speaker 1>If I make a point as my dad used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to score hidden where they </v>

3055
02:25:14.191 --> 02:25:16.410
<v Speaker 1>ain't the baseball idea.</v>

3056
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:17.543
<v Speaker 1>And so if I can make a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I was on stage tonight talking </v>

3057
02:25:20.731 --> 02:25:23.680
<v Speaker 1>about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would roll out that idea of trump is a</v>

3058
02:25:23.681 --> 02:25:24.514
<v Speaker 1>guy who's been played by so many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around him and no one talks about his </v>

3059
02:25:27.791 --> 02:25:30.280
<v Speaker 1>wife playing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no love in that marriage.</v>

3060
02:25:30.281 --> 02:25:34.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she saw a way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came to New York and went,</v>

3061
02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:38.080
<v Speaker 1>that guy gets naked with the toad a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>nights a month,</v>

3062
02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:43.960
<v Speaker 1>a handful of Prozac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Stoli and a credit card and a seven</v>

3063
02:25:43.961 --> 02:25:44.794
<v Speaker 1>figure expense account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take a shower and make it go </v>

3064
02:25:48.251 --> 02:25:49.600
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think he,</v>

3066
02:25:51.090 --> 02:25:53.080
<v Speaker 1>and I think he kinda knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3067
02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:54.640
<v Speaker 1>she was not like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:03.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3074
02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before his,</v>

3075
02:26:06.341 --> 02:26:08.020

3076
02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:11.500

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see that a lot in this town </v>

3078

<v Speaker 1>where you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old weird dude with like the,</v>

3079
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:19.330
<v Speaker 1>the eight year old girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3080
02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:20.260
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

3081
02:26:20.261 --> 02:26:21.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a setup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an agency.</v>

3082
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:22.743
<v Speaker 1>That's an agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's someone's getting a salary or an </v>

3083
02:26:25.511 --> 02:26:26.800
<v Speaker 1>implied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3084
02:26:26.801 --> 02:26:27.341
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3085
02:26:27.341 --> 02:26:29.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some kind of quid pro quo.</v>

3086
02:26:29.201 --> 02:26:30.034
<v Speaker 1>There's a credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an expense account or there's </v>

3087
02:26:31.841 --> 02:26:35.380
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big fist full of hundreds and just let</v>

3088
02:26:35.381 --> 02:26:40.381
<v Speaker 1>me chew on you for the next four weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the agreement is.</v>

3089
02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:42.040
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I.</v>

3090
02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:47.000
<v Speaker 1>So if I was going to say anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump on stage with Alex and I,</v>

3091
02:26:47.290 --> 02:26:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I never talked about any problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage.</v>

3092
02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:52.240
<v Speaker 1>And I learned this from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all people President Clinton,</v>

3093
02:26:52.780 --> 02:26:53.613
<v Speaker 1>because some of his later has </v>
<v Speaker 1>post-presidency I'm not a huge fan of </v>

3094
02:26:55.841 --> 02:26:57.520
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a good speaker.</v>

3095
02:26:57.850 --> 02:26:58.683
<v Speaker 1>And he did some speeches in the UK a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and I happened to be in in </v>

3096
02:27:01.911 --> 02:27:05.470
<v Speaker 1>England when he was there and I watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>him on tv the last part of this huge,</v>

3097
02:27:05.471 --> 02:27:07.960
<v Speaker 1>the last 10 minutes was here's a problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's three solutions.</v>

3098
02:27:07.961 --> 02:27:08.794
<v Speaker 1>Here's another problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three solutions were like for for </v>

3099
02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:14.830
<v Speaker 1>$60,000,000 we could put Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this thing or we could open this</v>

3100
02:27:14.831 --> 02:27:19.831
<v Speaker 1>waterway or we could reconfigure this </v>
<v Speaker 1>workforce to upgrade so everyone can get</v>

3101
02:27:19.871 --> 02:27:22.870
<v Speaker 1>a paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had logical ways forward.</v>

3102
02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:25.990
<v Speaker 1>So what I took from that is to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>

3103
02:27:25.991 --> 02:27:27.970
<v Speaker 1>don't propose a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will he sucks.</v>

3104
02:27:27.971 --> 02:27:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good night.</v>

3105
02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Don't give them a Gordian knot unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go.</v>

3106
02:27:32.290 --> 02:27:33.123
<v Speaker 1>Actually it's not a Gordian knot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's three ways to get out of this </v>

3107
02:27:36.131 --> 02:27:36.964
<v Speaker 1>burning rec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like when when trump became </v>

3108
02:27:39.851 --> 02:27:40.601
<v Speaker 1>elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3109
02:27:40.601 --> 02:27:41.434
<v Speaker 1>I was on tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a bunch of nights in La and </v>

3110
02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:44.351
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3111
02:27:44.351 --> 02:27:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you have a new president and some of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are depressed.</v>

3112
02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:47.853
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3113
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:51.610
<v Speaker 1>And so gay people are on the endangered </v>
<v Speaker 1>species list.</v>

3114
02:27:51.611 --> 02:27:55.210
<v Speaker 1>It's as if they've never been brown </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3115
02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:56.410
<v Speaker 1>black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

3116
02:27:56.411 --> 02:27:57.760
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with ovaries,</v>

3117
02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.360
<v Speaker 1>these were all on the you're screwed </v>
<v Speaker 1>list.</v>

3118
02:28:01.450 --> 02:28:05.020
<v Speaker 1>So instead of being coming depressed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

3119
02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:08.590
<v Speaker 1>let's we get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start doing more benefits now.</v>

3120
02:28:08.591 --> 02:28:10.960
<v Speaker 1>All your words matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your actions matter.</v>

3121
02:28:10.990 --> 02:28:14.470
<v Speaker 1>How you stick up for your lgbt friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>really matters.</v>

3122
02:28:14.471 --> 02:28:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you stick up for women,</v>

3123
02:28:17.350 --> 02:28:18.183
<v Speaker 1>how you stick up for racial equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality in the like how you check </v>

3124
02:28:23.421 --> 02:28:25.850
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you rule a view with other people,</v>

3125
02:28:26.090 --> 02:28:28.640
<v Speaker 1>words matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions matter more than ever.</v>

3126
02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:29.713
<v Speaker 1>And so to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an exciting time to show how great </v>

3127
02:28:32.631 --> 02:28:34.880
<v Speaker 1>you can be because now it's all on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

3128
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:38.000
<v Speaker 1>The fat is off the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're being tested.</v>

3129
02:28:38.390 --> 02:28:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I love a test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's get it on.</v>

3130
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:43.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like a in your line of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the guy goes,</v>

3131
02:28:43.791 --> 02:28:46.640
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I saw it.</v>

3132
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:47.743
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3133
02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:49.033
<v Speaker 1>let's let's get the money to the ACU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get some money to planned </v>

3134
02:28:51.921 --> 02:28:52.754
<v Speaker 1>parenthood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get a conversation going about a </v>

3135
02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:58.070
<v Speaker 1>child suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidation to facebook.</v>

3136
02:28:58.310 --> 02:29:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Let's start making things better because</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is not our ally.</v>

3137
02:29:02.330 --> 02:29:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Governments not necessarily going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help at its best.</v>

3138
02:29:06.351 --> 02:29:09.620
<v Speaker 1>It's inactive at its worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's divisive and predatory,</v>

3139
02:29:09.890 --> 02:29:14.890
<v Speaker 1>so let's be the antidote by being cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>by not throwing rocks through windows or</v>

3140
02:29:15.941 --> 02:29:18.740
<v Speaker 1>like you getting into the Tiki torch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>beating them up.</v>

3141
02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

3142
02:29:20.270 --> 02:29:23.090
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to convince that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's wrong,</v>

3143
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:24.103
<v Speaker 1>so get to the people you agree with and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start sticking together more and </v>

3144
02:29:27.351 --> 02:29:28.184
<v Speaker 1>raising more money and get some more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting people in office and let's </v>

3145
02:29:31.281 --> 02:29:33.920
<v Speaker 1>get some young people in office and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's what's happening.</v>

3146
02:29:34.190 --> 02:29:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Like you're seeing all these young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like twenties,</v>

3147
02:29:36.861 --> 02:29:38.330
<v Speaker 1>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

3148
02:29:38.331 --> 02:29:40.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of kids who died at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school in Florida,</v>

3149
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:41.833
<v Speaker 1>but look what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at all those kids hitting the </v>

3150
02:29:43.221 --> 02:29:44.054
<v Speaker 1>streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at all these kids who through cell </v>

3151
02:29:45.841 --> 02:29:48.350
<v Speaker 1>phones and selfies and instagram and </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapchat,</v>

3152
02:29:48.650 --> 02:29:49.483
<v Speaker 1>they're already ready for primetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see these high school juniors in </v>

3153
02:29:53.541 --> 02:29:55.520
<v Speaker 1>front of a CNN camera going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

3154
02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm 17 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happened to my school and next year</v>

3155
02:29:58.461 --> 02:30:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to vote and here's what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen and here's the march.</v>

3156
02:30:01.011 --> 02:30:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3157
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:04.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a future senator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just.</v>

3158
02:30:04.971 --> 02:30:08.510
<v Speaker 1>That school shooting just birthed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>voting demographic.</v>

3159
02:30:09.050 --> 02:30:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those kids are going to vote.</v>

3160
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:13.610
<v Speaker 1>All of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those kids who marched,</v>

3161
02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:14.953
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be no millennial apathy</v>
<v Speaker 1>with those kids that are all going to </v>

3162
02:30:16.751 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have an idea what side they're</v>

3163
02:30:19.341 --> 02:30:22.970
<v Speaker 1>going to vote with and if you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sell those kids on their</v>

3164
02:30:22.971 --> 02:30:25.640
<v Speaker 1>grandfathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunken homophobia,</v>

3165
02:30:25.641 --> 02:30:28.820
<v Speaker 1>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just overall bigotry and xenophobia,</v>

3166
02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:30.170
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

3167
02:30:30.170 --> 02:30:32.060
<v Speaker 1>He never had a password.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to travel.</v>

3168
02:30:32.061 --> 02:30:34.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to meet some damn Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

3169
02:30:34.731 --> 02:30:37.190
<v Speaker 1>the kids going to travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go to India.</v>

3170
02:30:37.460 --> 02:30:42.020
<v Speaker 1>She's going to go to Columbia and meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and get a more global sense</v>

3171
02:30:42.021 --> 02:30:43.550
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sense of water,</v>

3172
02:30:43.551 --> 02:30:45.320
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

3173
02:30:45.321 --> 02:30:47.450
<v Speaker 1>where it comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens with money,</v>

3174
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:49.760
<v Speaker 1>what happens with mediocrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the danger of it.</v>

3175
02:30:50.090 --> 02:30:53.300
<v Speaker 1>So I think we're in for some tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

3176
02:30:53.390 --> 02:30:56.460
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're going to lead to </v>
<v Speaker 1>good times and so that's.</v>

3177
02:30:56.690 --> 02:30:59.350
<v Speaker 1>If I get political onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I say is like,</v>

3178
02:30:59.390 --> 02:31:03.620
<v Speaker 1>here's five ways forward because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>despair part you like,</v>

3179
02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:06.140
<v Speaker 1>you need me to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch the news,</v>

3180
02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:10.320
<v Speaker 1>so don't get down in the mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start burning more calories and that and</v>

3181
02:31:10.330 --> 02:31:11.163
<v Speaker 1>that's not my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would never weigh in on stage any </v>

3182
02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:20.550
<v Speaker 1>other way about that stuff because all I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be as obvious</v>

3183
02:31:20.970 --> 02:31:24.780
<v Speaker 2>and my audience is pretty sharp and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't need to be told twice.</v>

3184
02:31:28.170 --> 02:31:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Outstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you sir.</v>

3185
02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Well said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree more.</v>

3186
02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Friday night show time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>August 10th.</v>

3187
02:31:34.530 --> 02:31:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Henry motherfucking Rawlins.</v>
