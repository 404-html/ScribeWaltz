00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.074
<v Speaker 1>life and it's always a disappointment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is always so heartbreaking because </v>

<v Speaker 1>people expect somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

12
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And I'm constantly breaking their heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they meet me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.290

<v Speaker 1>involved there.</v>

21
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

30
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I would love to talk to you about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing process because one of the,</v>

32
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've read once </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

33
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you were writing down,</v>

34
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>it was on the Cape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in Massachusetts.</v>

35
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.423
<v Speaker 1>We ever writing down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a writing somewhere where you </v>

36
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:23.544
<v Speaker 1>made a deal with yourself where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't turn the heat on unless you </v>

37
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>were writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

38
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you think I'm a white person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you feel weird?</v>

39
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>The Cape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cape?</v>

40
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>He never been to the Cape Cod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like an angel white people that's</v>

41
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>in England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New England,</v>

42
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>New England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

43
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.093
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never read anything like that about </v>

44
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

45
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:41.094
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

46
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Never been on the Cape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never been to Cape Cod.</v>

47
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Never had a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She seems wonderful.</v>

48
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A class?</v>

49
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

50
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

51
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.133
<v Speaker 1>It's just something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's something that I attributed </v>

52
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>to for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years,</v>

53
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.263
<v Speaker 1>but it's just an interesting story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone said that they were forcing </v>

54
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>themselves to be disciplined writing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they wouldn't,</v>

55
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless they have the heat on.</v>

56
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lived in this place,</v>

57
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the winter.</v>

58
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.273
<v Speaker 1>God wasn't you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about Michael </v>

59
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Cunningham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that who was yeah,</v>

60
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.000
<v Speaker 1>because he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

61
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that's his story about living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>province town.</v>

62
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Might've been fuck this all up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but terrible way to get going.</v>

63
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one thing I wanted to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you though being much lately.</v>

64
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't any at all.</v>

65
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I just sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fortunate in that regard.</v>

66
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't take that shit to you?</v>

67
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Of course I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

68
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times a day.</v>

69
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking with me.</v>

70
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>We've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got started off poorly with me once a</v>

71
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really take ambien?</v>

72
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

73
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>to tell the truth just before I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything I don't want to do.</v>

74
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like a sh elves in the shoemaker </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is I don't want to do my taxes.</v>

75
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>So I take ambien and then I wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my taxes are done.</v>

76
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.703
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do you have plausible deniability </v>

77
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can get videotape,</v>

78
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.043
<v Speaker 1>you take an ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have committed murder on ambien </v>

79
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>and gotten off because they had no </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

80
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

81
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:07.654
<v Speaker 1>it's a hypnotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually did a pretty in depth </v>

82
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:14.760
<v Speaker 1>discussion about that after the Roseanne</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barr thing came out.</v>

83
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>My own mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.613
<v Speaker 1>has taken and she stopped taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the reasons why I stopped </v>

85
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:21.470
<v Speaker 1>taking it because she woke up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night and uh,</v>

86
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.550
<v Speaker 1>she had a white bathroom mat and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>painted it with lipstick and makeup.</v>

87
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>She had no recollection of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

88
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>but she painted it like a two year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>

89
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.943
<v Speaker 1>They got ahold of their mom's lipstick </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she just woke up and what the fuck </v>

90
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this?</v>

91
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got off easy.</v>

92
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>I've heard worse stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 war stories.</v>

93
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

94
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:43.354
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

95
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.223
<v Speaker 1>I have heard about murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard about people driving their </v>

96
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>car to someone's house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing them,</v>

97
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>driving home and having no recollection </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

98
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.193
<v Speaker 1>A young woman in London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbed at the top of a construction </v>

99
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>crane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell asleep on the huge counterweight so</v>

100
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>far up over London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wakes up in the morning,</v>

101
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>birds around her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has no idea where she's at.</v>

102
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>She is terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

103
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You writing about Ambien right now?</v>

104
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.583
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

105
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you locked in ambient and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred other other things.</v>

106
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:19.501
<v Speaker 1>So if it's fair to say you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you're writing like one of</v>

107
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:20.494
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the ways you collect data </v>

108
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>is almost like you're reporting on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

109
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're collecting real life interactions</v>

110
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>between people in real life </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics and then you incorporate</v>

111
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 1>them into fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

112
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>That's fair to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My degree is journalism.</v>

113
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.263
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea how to be with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I need to introduce a topic and see </v>

114
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:45.904
<v Speaker 1>if it resonates and then get everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>take on these common experiences and </v>

115
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>then pick the very best one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a way,</v>

116
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:52.384
<v Speaker 1>basically what I'm doing is kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ongoing field study that becomes </v>

117
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>whatever my next book is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you wrote Fight Club,</v>

118
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>you tapped into something that w it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating for me.</v>

119
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.653
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as someone who's been involved in </v>

120
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:06.244
<v Speaker 1>martial arts my whole life and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of understood the Cathartic </v>

121
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:11.584
<v Speaker 1>release of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never saw it articulated the way </v>

122
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>you did and you made it entices </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] for a thinking person.</v>

123
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.880
<v Speaker 1>He made it like you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it,</v>

124
00:05:23.881 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of opened up these,</v>

125
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these doors of understanding for someone</v>

126
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:35.071
<v Speaker 1>who may be maybe had frustration or had </v>
<v Speaker 1>some pent up rage or had some,</v>

127
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>some adjuncts that just was not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out any other way.</v>

128
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And then you wrote about it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you bro,</v>

129
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>you reading what you wrote at bank made </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

130
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:45.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

131
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

132
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.093
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you added an element to it that really </v>

133
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>didn't exist before in pop culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really fascinating for me as a,</v>

134
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:56.644
<v Speaker 1>as someone who's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching that whole thing unfurl and </v>

135
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>watching people get like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>resonating with people,</v>

136
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>watching people really getting excited </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your work.</v>

137
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.461
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

138
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>he hit some nerve that nobody really hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

139
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.943
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a nerve that gets hit very </v>

140
00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:15.720
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.610
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different aspects to it.</v>

142
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.833
<v Speaker 2>And what is just my classic thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are so few social model </v>

143
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.970
<v Speaker 2>novels or stories for men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for women.</v>

144
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.480
<v Speaker 2>There are a s you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every season there's a new joy,</v>

145
00:06:31.481 --> 00:06:32.314
<v Speaker 2>luck club and knew how to make an </v>
<v Speaker 2>American quilt a new traveling </v>

146
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 2>sisterhood of the Yamaha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just all these different models in which</v>

148
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.450
<v Speaker 2>women can come together and talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives.</v>

149
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.410
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got either fight club or you have</v>

150
00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:51.940
<v Speaker 2>the dead poets society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is really it.</v>

151
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.043
<v Speaker 2>So we don't have a lot of narratives </v>
<v Speaker 2>that depict to men a role or a kind of </v>

152
00:06:57.341 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 2>script of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

153
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which to come together and talk about</v>

154
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:02.144
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their shed.</v>

155
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.320
<v Speaker 2>And another thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

156
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Peterson back to Jordan Peterson.</v>

157
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.710
<v Speaker 2>He talks about that need for really </v>
<v Speaker 2>rough play.</v>

158
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 2>And he talks about it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of my friends did.</v>

159
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.020
<v Speaker 2>They brag about how badly they're kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt them all.</v>

160
00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:21.880
<v Speaker 2>My Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughter came at me the other day.</v>

161
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:22.714
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea how strong she was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She pulled my arm out of the socket and </v>

162
00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:27.604
<v Speaker 2>they're proud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're proud that their kid can play </v>

163
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:32.140
<v Speaker 2>that rough in his growing up that </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>

164
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.550
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've kind of fallen away from this idea</v>

165
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:38.440
<v Speaker 2>of consensual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rough play.</v>

166
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.990
<v Speaker 2>And I think fight club resonated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot.</v>

167
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.543
<v Speaker 2>And also the idea of Joseph Campbell's </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that there needs to be a secondary </v>

168
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:51.850
<v Speaker 2>father in men's lives that you're born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're lucky with a biological father</v>

169
00:07:51.851 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 2>that you do not choose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is the,</v>

170
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:55.563
<v Speaker 2>the nurturing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving father that you eventually kind </v>

171
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:58.570
<v Speaker 2>of have to reject.</v>

172
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.770
<v Speaker 2>But in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to choose a new father and that</v>

173
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.633
<v Speaker 2>that father by choice typically is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a minister or a teacher or a drill </v>

174
00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:11.860
<v Speaker 2>sergeant or a coach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those fathers.</v>

175
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.053
<v Speaker 2>And you kind of put yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>apprenticeship to the secondary father </v>

176
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.433
<v Speaker 2>and you have to sort of consign your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life to the secondary father and agree </v>

177
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:22.870
<v Speaker 2>to learn what they're going to teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

178
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.633
<v Speaker 2>just like in karate kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is getting harder and harder </v>

179
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:29.194
<v Speaker 2>and harder to find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fight club was also depicting a new </v>

180
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:34.630
<v Speaker 2>form of the secondary father with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

181
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.220
<v Speaker 2>these kids that were showing up on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doorstep of this ramshackle old house.</v>

182
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.833
<v Speaker 2>So there was just so many aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 2>men's lives that were not being </v>

183
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.693
<v Speaker 2>addressed when fight club came out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of reinvented so many of those </v>

184
00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:53.260
<v Speaker 2>things that had fallen by the wayside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge part of martial arts.</v>

185
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 2>A huge part of martial arts is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the master,</v>

186
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.813
<v Speaker 1>with the coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with finding someone who can guide you </v>

187
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:02.490
<v Speaker 1>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most dangerous waters,</v>

188
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of competition that it's,</v>

189
00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:05.894
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely imperative that bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with coaches are </v>

190
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:10.970
<v Speaker 1>absolutely disastrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

191
00:09:10.971 --> 00:09:11.804
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's imperative that someone find the </v>

192
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:13.884
<v Speaker 1>right coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find someone who they really can trust </v>

193
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 1>and appreciate and you do develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a such a common theme.</v>

194
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>They talk about this person being like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>son or this person being like a father.</v>

195
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:25.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

196
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:26.814
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

197
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

198
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

199
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about that part of Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 1>Campbell.</v>

200
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.110
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

201
00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 1>that is a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge issue with,</v>

202
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.660
<v Speaker 1>with young men and young men getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>into martial arts is something that I've</v>

203
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>talked about so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't discuss it as the need for rough</v>

204
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that human reward systems that are</v>

205
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 1>just not being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not being met,</v>

206
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.143
<v Speaker 1>and that systems that have been in place</v>
<v Speaker 1>for thousands and thousands of years </v>

207
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>that are designed to reward us for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting off the enemy,</v>

208
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:59.721
<v Speaker 1>running away from danger or developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical skills and having a body that's</v>

209
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:01.434
<v Speaker 1>capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of not just a physical activity but </v>

210
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:06.384
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

211
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Well and beyond just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.990
<v Speaker 1>it's also the whole idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprenticeship in a,</v>

213
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:17.970
<v Speaker 1>whether you're apprenticing yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fighting coach or to a metallurgist or</v>

214
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 1>to a welder or to a brick layer or to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mason,</v>

215
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.463
<v Speaker 1>you are apprenticing yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody that you're going to do all </v>

216
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:28.050
<v Speaker 1>this grunt work for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in exchange you're going to,</v>

217
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 1>you're going to learn that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>really master skill at something.</v>

218
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's a way of mastering yourself </v>

219
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.240
<v Speaker 1>as you mastered this other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

220
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just always a physical,</v>

221
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting thing.</v>

222
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:46.740
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be in that form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just difficult.</v>

223
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Something that's a struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's hard to learn.</v>

224
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

225
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.280
<v Speaker 1>And that relationship that you have with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that secondary father to the,</v>

226
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.640
<v Speaker 1>it's almost in some ways more intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

227
00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.613
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pride of someone teaching you </v>

228
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:02.154
<v Speaker 1>something and then you eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing those skills and then this </v>

229
00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:06.054
<v Speaker 1>person who is teaching you this being </v>
<v Speaker 1>proud of your work is extremely </v>

230
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:10.314
<v Speaker 1>satisfactory.</v>

231
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do you remember officer and a </v>

232
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>gentleman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

233
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Gere really has this drunken dis</v>

234
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 1>not their dad and then he has this drill</v>
<v Speaker 1>sergeant who's constantly trying to wash</v>

235
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:26.310
<v Speaker 1>them out and then finally he reaches it </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the existential crisis of saying,</v>

236
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 1>you can't throw me out of the service </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have no nothing else.</v>

237
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.523
<v Speaker 1>I have nowhere else to go in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life will amount to nothing unless I </v>

238
00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:37.500
<v Speaker 1>can master this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

239
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:38.334
<v Speaker 1>relatively young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is that existentialist stick </v>

240
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:41.664
<v Speaker 1>moment where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize that you have to sacrifice </v>

241
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:47.790
<v Speaker 1>your youth for something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to live forever.</v>

242
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.953
<v Speaker 1>It's a very martin heidegger moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you realize you have to become a </v>

243
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living towards death.</v>

244
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.113
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to live forever and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to give your life to </v>

245
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

246
00:11:58.571 --> 00:11:59.240
<v Speaker 2>when you</v>

247
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.073
<v Speaker 1>approach a novel like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a story like that that's </v>

248
00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:02.804
<v Speaker 1>brewing your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you decide what to pull the </v>

249
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:08.180
<v Speaker 1>trigger on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you just go on instinct?</v>

250
00:12:08.181 --> 00:12:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Did you just have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a concept in your head and it just seems</v>

251
00:12:11.271 --> 00:12:13.100
<v Speaker 1>more and more attractive and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

252
00:12:13.101 --> 00:12:13.940
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

253
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.123
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one really good test is if you can take </v>

254
00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:22.500
<v Speaker 2>it to a party and you can tell a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>small part of it,</v>

255
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:23.663
<v Speaker 2>as much of it as you know at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people will vie for a chance to </v>

256
00:12:30.391 --> 00:12:33.990
<v Speaker 2>relate some aspect of their life that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>very much like that,</v>

257
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.050
<v Speaker 2>but an even more extreme example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

258
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.333
<v Speaker 2>So in a way they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're flushing out your theme with </v>

259
00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:41.844
<v Speaker 2>parts of their own lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you find yourself drawing from </v>

260
00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:48.090
<v Speaker 2>the experience of dozens or hundreds or </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people,</v>

261
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.820
<v Speaker 2>and at the same time you're Beta testing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

262
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.953
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of taking it on the road and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing that it's an idea that </v>

263
00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:55.374
<v Speaker 2>resonates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resonates with a huge number of people </v>

264
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 2>that everyone can relate to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

265
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.793
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you purposely let go to parties </v>

266
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.703
<v Speaker 2>with like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple bullets in the chamber </v>

267
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.143
<v Speaker 2>sometimes or sometimes they just go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the party and I listened to hear </v>

268
00:13:12.061 --> 00:13:12.894
<v Speaker 2>somebody tell that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that personal anecdote that does evoke </v>

269
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.333
<v Speaker 2>all those other anecdotes because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great anecdote doesn't leave people </v>

270
00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:22.074
<v Speaker 2>speechless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It leaves some competing to tell a </v>

271
00:13:24.901 --> 00:13:25.734
<v Speaker 2>better version of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's when a real writer to starts </v>

272
00:13:30.181 --> 00:13:30.811
<v Speaker 2>realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

273
00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:34.140
<v Speaker 2>there's a pattern and that can be turned</v>
<v Speaker 2>into something really big.</v>

274
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.350
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a parallel there,</v>

275
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.580
<v Speaker 1>comedy for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's if you in good material,</v>

276
00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:42.750
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not always,</v>

277
00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:44.370
<v Speaker 1>but oftentimes you'll see the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

278
00:13:44.371 --> 00:13:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that or yeah,</v>

279
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.720
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

280
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.683
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing I really wanted to talk to you </v>

281
00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:52.140
<v Speaker 1>about is something that you brought up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

282
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.790
<v Speaker 1>when you send the notes to Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

283
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.290
<v Speaker 1>was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>censorship and that and,</v>

284
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and self censorship,</v>

285
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.113
<v Speaker 1>which is going on apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And writer groups and groups of people </v>

286
00:14:04.141 --> 00:14:08.580
<v Speaker 1>that are deciding that certain words </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be eliminated from vocabulary and</v>

287
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.300
<v Speaker 1>from vernacular and that you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss certain things anymore.</v>

288
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.433
<v Speaker 1>These things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's harming fiction and harming </v>

289
00:14:16.561 --> 00:14:19.260
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you can't explore the darker ideas,</v>

290
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.290
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

291
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.130
<v Speaker 2>you want to see me crucify myself right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

292
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

293
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.550
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

294
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 2>career ending moment for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

295
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.910
<v Speaker 2>for several years I was in a writer's </v>
<v Speaker 2>workshop and uh,</v>

296
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.100
<v Speaker 2>the core group of us had been meeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>since 1990.</v>

297
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.800
<v Speaker 2>So this is a workshop that was almost 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

298
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.820
<v Speaker 2>And gradually people were asking each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other not to use certain words.</v>

299
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

300
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody really used the n word,</v>

301
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 2>but it was definitely a word you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>not bring to workshop.</v>

302
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.363
<v Speaker 2>And then in a story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use the word faggot and a very good </v>

303
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:01.994
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not bringing that word into </v>

304
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:05.084
<v Speaker 2>workshop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not writing anything with the F </v>

305
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:08.860
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

306
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.940
<v Speaker 2>and it just became more and more tightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>structured that way.</v>

307
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.690
<v Speaker 2>And so eventually I realized we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of writing to make each other happy</v>

308
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 2>instead of to kind of confront each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

309
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.373
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the writers in our workshop is a </v>

310
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:28.230
<v Speaker 2>writer named Cheryl strayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

311
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 2>who had written a book called wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a hugely successful book.</v>

312
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:32.714
<v Speaker 2>It was chosen as an oprah book and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be on bookstore shelves for the </v>

313
00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 2>rest of history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sheryl's book,</v>

314
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 2>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But while she was writing it,</v>

315
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.403
<v Speaker 2>she had written a segment about how as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>child she would be sat on the sofa with </v>

316
00:15:49.071 --> 00:15:54.071
<v Speaker 2>her grandfather and her grandfather </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught her how to masturbate him.</v>

317
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:55.603
<v Speaker 2>And so as a child she would masturbate </v>
<v Speaker 2>her grandfather until he achieved </v>

318
00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:00.344
<v Speaker 2>orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then later she would find these </v>

319
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.740
<v Speaker 2>featherless featherless birds that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen out of a nest.</v>

320
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.550
<v Speaker 2>And she picked one up and she knew it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would die.</v>

321
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.490
<v Speaker 2>So she crushed it between her bare </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

322
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:17.324
<v Speaker 2>This is a very small child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she wrote how as that bird died </v>

323
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:27.320
<v Speaker 2>crushed between her hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it its death throes.</v>

324
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.303
<v Speaker 2>It's spasms of death felt exactly like </v>
<v Speaker 2>her grandfather's penis ejaculating in </v>

325
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:34.860
<v Speaker 2>her little hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

326
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.540
<v Speaker 2>That was the best thing she ever wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And her editor,</v>

327
00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:41.744
<v Speaker 2>Rick [inaudible] said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not going in this book because </v>

328
00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:46.694
<v Speaker 2>we want this book to be a big book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we see you jerking off your </v>

329
00:16:51.141 --> 00:16:51.974
<v Speaker 2>grandfather and then killing baby birds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not going to make Oprah Winfrey </v>

330
00:16:57.471 --> 00:17:01.940
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a magnificent piece of writing</v>

331
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.470
<v Speaker 2>and a magnificent kind of parallel and </v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness for a child to have.</v>

332
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.310
<v Speaker 2>And this juxtaposition of sexual abuse </v>
<v Speaker 2>and death.</v>

333
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.110
<v Speaker 2>It was magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

334
00:17:12.111 --> 00:17:16.100
<v Speaker 2>it worked on every level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the publisher said,</v>

335
00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:16.934
<v Speaker 2>this is not going to be in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did she send it to you or did she show </v>

336
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 2>it to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She brought her to workshop and she read</v>

337
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:24.090
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was even a newspaper reporter pre,</v>

338
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>present there and we all realized it was</v>

339
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:29.390
<v Speaker 2>fantastically powerful.</v>

340
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.800
<v Speaker 2>But then she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they won't take this.</v>

341
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.670
<v Speaker 2>This can't go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

342
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Did she do anything with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she published it online or no end.</v>

343
00:17:41.871 --> 00:17:42.704
<v Speaker 2>There was so many parts of that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was so much better than what they </v>

344
00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:47.870
<v Speaker 2>actually did publish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

345
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:48.763
<v Speaker 2>And so it's that kind of censorship </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're trying to reach a reader </v>

346
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.893
<v Speaker 2>standing in line at starbucks and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>has got to go in that point of purchase </v>

347
00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:03.630
<v Speaker 2>stand and it's gotta be a face out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I understand for a long time,</v>

348
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to face out yet a barnes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and noble,</v>

349
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.310
<v Speaker 2>especially on the discover new writers </v>
<v Speaker 2>face out stack,</v>

350
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.563
<v Speaker 2>you can not have the word fuck on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first page because they did not want </v>

351
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:17.184
<v Speaker 2>people picking up that book and opening </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and seeing the f word that that just </v>

352
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 2>did not fit their corporate culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

353
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much of the censorship is,</v>

354
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:28.074
<v Speaker 2>is because people really want to reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>the largest audience without offending </v>

355
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:36.861
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's giant problems with that.</v>

356
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

357
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.043
<v Speaker 2>one of the more fascinating things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>books is that the story plays out in </v>

358
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:48.540
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

359
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:49.374
<v Speaker 2>The nature of consumption makes it about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only medium in which you can go to </v>

360
00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 2>those places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

361
00:18:55.441 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Literally you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't,</v>

362
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.630
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you'd be able to find,</v>

363
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.653
<v Speaker 2>to put that in a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her story about her grandfather and the </v>

364
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 2>bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could put the burden,</v>

365
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 2>but the grandfather par,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no snow way.</v>

366
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

367
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.733
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm telling stories out of </v>

368
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:18.474
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's such a perfect example of that </v>

369
00:19:20.731 --> 00:19:23.080
<v Speaker 2>kind of self censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

370
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.850
<v Speaker 2>and it's also something so magnificent </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I feel is should come out.</v>

371
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.050
<v Speaker 2>It should sort of be stated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

372
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to steal her thunder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to honor the story,</v>

373
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's like so many stories that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people tell me.</v>

374
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of seen as a safe person,</v>

375
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a degraded monster maybe,</v>

376
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.960
<v Speaker 2>but as a degraded monster with no self </v>
<v Speaker 2>esteem whatsoever.</v>

377
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.183
<v Speaker 2>They feel safe telling me these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>because in a way they probably feel a </v>

378
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 2>little morally superior to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

379
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.670
<v Speaker 2>why do you think people would consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>you a degraded monster?</v>

380
00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:57.863
<v Speaker 2>Because I can read a story like guts </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is so completely humiliating </v>

381
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.510
<v Speaker 2>because as I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in the first person.</v>

382
00:20:06.511 --> 00:20:10.050
<v Speaker 2>So people more or less assume that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>my story,</v>

383
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.650
<v Speaker 2>even though it's stories garnered from </v>
<v Speaker 2>many different people.</v>

384
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.113
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that I'm presenting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means that I'm the person that is this </v>

385
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.463
<v Speaker 2>losing face and afterwards people feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they can risk losing face by </v>

386
00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:27.360
<v Speaker 2>telling me their story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very much like the gut story.</v>

387
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 2>So when someone is writing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's deeply disturbing like that,</v>

388
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.250
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

389
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:37.250
<v Speaker 2>when you hit those parts of your mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you come to this pathway d,</v>

390
00:20:37.351 --> 00:20:38.610
<v Speaker 2>do you consider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you say,</v>

391
00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:40.980
<v Speaker 2>well no one's ever going to allow this </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in a book.</v>

392
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.580
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you consider those thoughts or do you</v>

393
00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:49.510
<v Speaker 2>just go through with it first and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>review it?</v>

394
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Or do you not do that at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

395
00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 2>my formative years with a punk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heres the 70s into the 80s and we always</v>

396
00:20:57.371 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 2>used to have a saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would say,</v>

397
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.363
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't hit the brake until you hear the </v>

398
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 2>glass break or don't stop until you hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>glass break.</v>

399
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.633
<v Speaker 2>And so I always think the point of </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing is to coach yourself to that </v>

400
00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 2>point that you would never have gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily.</v>

401
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.413
<v Speaker 2>And also to coach your reader to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where the reader would never have </v>

402
00:21:19.271 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 2>gone voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a story like guts,</v>

403
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very funny on the front end and if </v>

404
00:21:25.331 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 2>you told people on the front end where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was going to go,</v>

405
00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:28.774
<v Speaker 2>they'd never read that story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's very funny and charming and </v>

406
00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:32.524
<v Speaker 2>well paced on the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once people realize where it's </v>

407
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 2>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're already trapped.</v>

408
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.390
<v Speaker 2>And so in a way is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a way to enjoy that though.</v>

409
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Like the way you said they're already </v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped.</v>

410
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 2>You seem to take some satisfaction in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

411
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.993
<v Speaker 2>But in writing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also sort of springing the trap on </v>

412
00:21:52.751 --> 00:21:57.751
<v Speaker 2>myself starting down a path that I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>no idea is going to be so humiliating or</v>

413
00:21:58.691 --> 00:21:59.640
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

414
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 2>emotionally upsetting or so dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if,</v>

415
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.430
<v Speaker 2>if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never go down that path.</v>

416
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 2>When you write a story like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of a deep plan out in advance</v>

417
00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I might plan out up to the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second act.</v>

418
00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment of greatest crisis,</v>

419
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.840
<v Speaker 2>this will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:22:23.841 --> 00:22:24.674
<v Speaker 2>in fight club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment of greatest crisis is going </v>

421
00:22:26.841 --> 00:22:27.674
<v Speaker 2>to be when everyone in the support </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups figures out that this guy is </v>

422
00:22:30.861 --> 00:22:31.694
<v Speaker 2>lying to them and they're all given the </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice of either accepting him for his </v>

423
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.630
<v Speaker 2>transgressions or rejecting him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing in choke.</v>

424
00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.580
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

425
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.653
<v Speaker 2>when people realize that he has faked </v>
<v Speaker 2>choking and that he's made them into a </v>

426
00:22:49.011 --> 00:22:54.011
<v Speaker 2>fake hero and they're going to either </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill him or accept him.</v>

427
00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.520
<v Speaker 2>And so I typically know that the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>act is going to end with a transgression</v>

428
00:23:00.681 --> 00:23:03.320
<v Speaker 2>being revealed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But beyond that,</v>

429
00:23:03.321 --> 00:23:04.154
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know because I want the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story to complete itself with its own </v>

430
00:23:07.101 --> 00:23:10.310
<v Speaker 2>momentum at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it doesn't surprise me beyond the</v>

431
00:23:10.311 --> 00:23:11.144
<v Speaker 2>second act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not going to surprise the </v>

432
00:23:12.771 --> 00:23:13.604
<v Speaker 2>reader.</v>

433
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.343
<v Speaker 2>Do you write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have like a storyboard laid out </v>

434
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.403
<v Speaker 2>and do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you use like index cards or anything </v>

435
00:23:20.091 --> 00:23:23.750
<v Speaker 2>to figure out where things are going or </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you just Kinda know now?</v>

436
00:23:23.751 --> 00:23:24.584
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

437
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.550
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the glory is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I get stuck,</v>

438
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I go to the gym and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

439
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:31.993
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on this scene where this </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens and this happens and this </v>

440
00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:36.920
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my friends will say,</v>

441
00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.813
<v Speaker 2>they'll always be somebody there with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really fresh take and life experience </v>

442
00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:41.960
<v Speaker 2>who can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

443
00:23:41.961 --> 00:23:42.794
<v Speaker 2>have you thought about this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it will take the story in a </v>

444
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:46.814
<v Speaker 2>direction that is so unexpected because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not from my experience and that </v>

445
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:52.514
<v Speaker 2>that's the glory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they feel like they've contributed </v>

446
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so happy.</v>

447
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm happy to spend time among people</v>

448
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.750
<v Speaker 2>and I'm happy to have the story complete</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that I never,</v>

449
00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:04.190
<v Speaker 2>ever could have anticipated.</v>

450
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.100
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you do it at the gym.</v>

451
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gym is really great because you're </v>

452
00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 2>around people and you have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>recoveries between sets.</v>

453
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:16.760
<v Speaker 2>So you have a little time to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time you have,</v>

454
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 2>during the exercise itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have time to think.</v>

455
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.973
<v Speaker 2>And so it paces the talking versus a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and it's also kind of highly </v>

456
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:28.154
<v Speaker 2>oxygenated and it's physically active.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your mind is kind of mind is not </v>

457
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:36.770
<v Speaker 2>engaged with something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind has kind of disengaged like it</v>

458
00:24:36.771 --> 00:24:39.310
<v Speaker 2>is while you're taking a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

459
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.340
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people like to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like to read a write,</v>

460
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:43.603
<v Speaker 2>read a little bit of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then walk and bring a recorder or </v>

461
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 2>their phone to record on think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably along the same lines,</v>

462
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Charles Dickens walked somewhere between</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 and 20 miles a day as he wrote.</v>

463
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

464
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:57.430
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

465
00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.290
<v Speaker 2>the lakeland poets walked constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

466
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:03.320
<v Speaker 2>walking is a big part of writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything physical,</v>

467
00:25:03.321 --> 00:25:04.041
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like anything,</v>

468
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:05.330
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're forcing your body to move,</v>

469
00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:06.164
<v Speaker 2>forcing the blood to flow and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindless so it allows your mind to </v>

470
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:11.780
<v Speaker 2>wander.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

471
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 2>So I love the fact that you're so open </v>
<v Speaker 2>with these ideas too,</v>

472
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:18.554
<v Speaker 2>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you bring them to people and get their </v>

473
00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:22.460
<v Speaker 2>take on it and then incorporate their </v>
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>

474
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Is this something you've always done </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the workshopping?</v>

475
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.163
<v Speaker 2>Is it because it just is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>willingness to be open with your ideas </v>

476
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:32.880
<v Speaker 2>and express them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

477
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Really in a workshop was the crucial </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

478
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Having that social expectation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to bring work every week.</v>

479
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.920
<v Speaker 2>And it was also kind of a party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reward for having brought the work.</v>

480
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.233
<v Speaker 2>And it was also a way of testing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>work so that you knew whether it was </v>

481
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.920
<v Speaker 2>working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

482
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:52.400
<v Speaker 2>you weren't constantly sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>questioning yourself.</v>

483
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.900
<v Speaker 2>A workshop just provide so many really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important ways of uh,</v>

484
00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.083
<v Speaker 2>keeping right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping you writing now w e and you've </v>

485
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:05.180
<v Speaker 2>done this always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've seems like you've done this most</v>

486
00:26:05.181 --> 00:26:07.070
<v Speaker 2>of your career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

487
00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:09.950
<v Speaker 2>and this is not the first workshop I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been bumped out of.</v>

488
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:11.143
<v Speaker 2>The first workshop I was in was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of very nice ladies and I was </v>

489
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:18.830
<v Speaker 2>probably 28 and I had written a scene in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

490
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man,</v>

491
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 2>a young man has done up an inflatable </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex doll.</v>

492
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:26.840
<v Speaker 2>So it looks exactly like the woman he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with.</v>

493
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:32.240
<v Speaker 2>And during the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seduction of this sex doll,</v>

494
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.553
<v Speaker 2>he accidentally snags the back of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a zipper of its dress and he </v>

495
00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:41.831
<v Speaker 2>realizes during the fornication that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is gradually losing air.</v>

496
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.063
<v Speaker 2>So he's got to copulate faster and </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster to try to achieve orgasm before </v>

497
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:48.900
<v Speaker 2>this thing completely goes flat.</v>

498
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.850
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's standing there with this completely</v>

499
00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:57.570
<v Speaker 2>deflated sex doll hanging off of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>erection like this,</v>

500
00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.930
<v Speaker 2>the surrender flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

501
00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:05.670
<v Speaker 2>his mother walks into the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And after I wrote that scene,</v>

502
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 2>the leader of the workshop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in my first workshop,</v>

503
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.620
<v Speaker 2>she took me aside afterwards and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

504
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:14.463
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other writers in the workshop no </v>

505
00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:20.010
<v Speaker 2>longer feel safe around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She really did.</v>

506
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:22.110
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

507
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:24.210
<v Speaker 2>you've written something that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>frightens them,</v>

508
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.333
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would like you to politely </v>

509
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.200
<v Speaker 2>leave the workshop and not come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

510
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.380
<v Speaker 2>And so that's when I started with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

511
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Tom Spann bowers workshop in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost anything wet.</v>

512
00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.013
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so this kind of periodic implosion </v>

513
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:43.440
<v Speaker 2>of the workshop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

514
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.720
<v Speaker 2>is kind of part of the process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

515
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:48.360
<v Speaker 2>it seems only twice right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or more and more times than that.</v>

516
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been twice,</v>

517
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the past it's catastrophic.</v>

518
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Twice catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

519
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a few other flat tires along the </v>

520
00:27:57.271 --> 00:27:58.104
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

521
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.880
<v Speaker 2>periodically we've kind of had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend that we were disbanding in order</v>

522
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:04.950
<v Speaker 2>to get rid of a member who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

523
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 2>just more trouble than they were worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people are in these workshops?</v>

524
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lately it's been last,</v>

525
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.470
<v Speaker 2>it was about eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've been up to like 16,</v>

526
00:28:13.471 --> 00:28:14.880
<v Speaker 2>17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now when I teach,</v>

527
00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:16.710
<v Speaker 2>I typically have about 25 people.</v>

528
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:19.950
<v Speaker 2>What does it feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

529
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 2>to be in a workshop for that long and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then have such a,</v>

530
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:29.580
<v Speaker 2>a disagreement and to disband like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>or to have you forced out,</v>

531
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.500
<v Speaker 2>what does that feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to suck.</v>

532
00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:33.181
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

533
00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I think in a way we all need a kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>respite from each other.</v>

534
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.710
<v Speaker 2>We all had kind of knew what to expect </v>
<v Speaker 2>from one another and I think we were all</v>

535
00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:43.620
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less of a resource for one another.</v>

536
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

537
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.490
<v Speaker 2>there's always a chance we'll come back </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

538
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:48.773
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

539
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.500
<v Speaker 2>so it's not a big tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a chance that they might,</v>

540
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.830
<v Speaker 2>so did they kick you out or did they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just disband?</v>

541
00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I left the workshop and I understood </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it disbanded wreck after that.</v>

542
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.793
<v Speaker 2>The seams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand how someone who </v>

543
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:08.320
<v Speaker 2>is a creative writer can't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

544
00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.053
<v Speaker 2>the not just the necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the need to delve into the darker </v>

545
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.610
<v Speaker 2>possibilities of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of human reality that this,</v>

546
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.153
<v Speaker 2>those stories she wrote about her </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather in the bird is a perfect </v>

547
00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:24.954
<v Speaker 2>example of that.</v>

548
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although very few people will experience</v>

549
00:29:27.431 --> 00:29:28.264
<v Speaker 2>that in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all can appreciate that these are </v>

550
00:29:29.941 --> 00:29:32.370
<v Speaker 2>possible scenarios.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it,</v>

551
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.860
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really comes down to what people,</v>

552
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.073
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what purpose reading and writing serves </v>

553
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:40.350
<v Speaker 2>in people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most people,</v>

554
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.880
<v Speaker 2>they want reading to be a comforting </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>

555
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.073
<v Speaker 2>They want to be able to read a book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then fall asleep knowing the detective </v>

556
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 2>will apprehend the killer by the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book.</v>

557
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.733
<v Speaker 2>That things will end very well in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want to be bored or lulled by </v>

558
00:29:53.561 --> 00:29:54.930
<v Speaker 2>the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

559
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.540
<v Speaker 2>not so many people really want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of confronted by books,</v>

560
00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.380
<v Speaker 1>but some people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

561
00:30:01.381 --> 00:30:01.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>

562
00:30:01.951 --> 00:30:05.190
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like a pretty much all </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of art.</v>

563
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's music or movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's superhero movies and then</v>

564
00:30:09.151 --> 00:30:09.984
<v Speaker 1>there's movies like no country for old </v>
<v Speaker 1>men or the bad guy gets away at the end </v>

565
00:30:12.841 --> 00:30:13.674
<v Speaker 1>and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave the movie theater and you're </v>

566
00:30:14.491 --> 00:30:15.420
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

567
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.460
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those,</v>

568
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:22.050
<v Speaker 1>those are all satisfying in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to different people.</v>

569
00:30:22.051 --> 00:30:22.884
<v Speaker 1>And isn't that sort of the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative expression is that you're </v>

570
00:30:26.851 --> 00:30:30.000
<v Speaker 1>getting surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting taken down a row that is,</v>

571
00:30:30.001 --> 00:30:34.020
<v Speaker 1>here's the world through this person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes and they create this world.</v>

572
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.790
<v Speaker 1>If you put limitations on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

573
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.903
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to eliminate some </v>

574
00:30:38.821 --> 00:30:41.100
<v Speaker 1>disturbing aspects that my bother some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

575
00:30:41.101 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 1>But you're also gonna eliminate some </v>
<v Speaker 1>magical moments that might just carry,</v>

576
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:47.790
<v Speaker 1>might literally let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might change the way you view people.</v>

577
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it has to do with the nature of,</v>

578
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

579
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.880
<v Speaker 2>movies are going to always kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attract,</v>

580
00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more dynamic audience.</v>

581
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.323
<v Speaker 2>Movies carry their own authority through</v>
<v Speaker 2>motion and books are going to be a </v>

582
00:31:04.711 --> 00:31:08.820
<v Speaker 2>slower medium that's harder to consume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe books are always going to,</v>

583
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.620
<v Speaker 2>at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be seen of it as kind of a sedative as a</v>

584
00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:17.670
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing that lulls you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference you and puts you to sleep.</v>

585
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.140
<v Speaker 2>But by who?</v>

586
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.630
<v Speaker 1>By some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

587
00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

588
00:31:21.231 --> 00:31:23.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a market for those kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of books,</v>

589
00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:25.100
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a market for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

590
00:31:25.101 --> 00:31:25.934
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

591
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.793
<v Speaker 1>there's clearly a market for people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to tap into those more </v>

592
00:31:30.291 --> 00:31:31.124
<v Speaker 1>disturbing</v>

593
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:36.150
<v Speaker 2>backs of consciousness and reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that market is moving to video games</v>

594
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 2>and that market is moving to edgier </v>
<v Speaker 2>films.</v>

595
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.210
<v Speaker 2>There's just other forms of storytelling</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are serving that market better.</v>

596
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

597
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Better than books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

598
00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

599
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:47.973
<v Speaker 1>But why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that because of the censorship or </v>

600
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 1>it's because artists aren't exploring </v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas as much anymore.</v>

601
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.843
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of it is because books are </v>

602
00:31:56.871 --> 00:31:57.704
<v Speaker 2>harder to consume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Books take an enormous amount of a </v>

603
00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:06.580
<v Speaker 2>commitment of time and effort to read a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book where everything else is 30 minutes</v>

604
00:32:07.491 --> 00:32:10.160
<v Speaker 2>to two hours and to write a book as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>

605
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:15.230
<v Speaker 2>such a solitary discipline to sit alone </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your computer.</v>

606
00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is not,</v>

607
00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.080
<v Speaker 2>not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

608
00:32:18.081 --> 00:32:20.570
<v Speaker 2>I hate that model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

609
00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:22.243
<v Speaker 2>I want to be in the mermaid tavern </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about my ideas with my </v>

610
00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:25.723
<v Speaker 2>compatriots and getting their take on </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and finding out how it resonates </v>

611
00:32:29.601 --> 00:32:32.300
<v Speaker 2>with everything else in people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's The mermaid tavern?</v>

612
00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the,</v>

613
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.700
<v Speaker 2>the reference to where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

614
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not coleridge.</v>

615
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:42.980
<v Speaker 2>All the famous writers of Shakespeare's </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

616
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.620
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically hung out at a,</v>

617
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 2>it was like the white horse tavern in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>

618
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.300
<v Speaker 2>but the mermaid tavern was in London </v>
<v Speaker 2>during that time.</v>

619
00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

620
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Boswell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

621
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.513
<v Speaker 2>all the writers hung out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange ideas and entertained one </v>

622
00:32:57.841 --> 00:32:59.550
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

623
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:04.490
<v Speaker 2>And so I want writing to be my social </v>
<v Speaker 2>outlet,</v>

624
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.080
<v Speaker 2>but you have to write it by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

625
00:33:09.081 --> 00:33:09.914
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're sitting alone actually </v>

626
00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:15.590
<v Speaker 2>putting your fingers on the keyboards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

627
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.630
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do that part in airplanes.</v>

628
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

629
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I've right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Notebooks and notebooks and notebooks in</v>

630
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:22.604
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I'm trapped in some </v>

631
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:26.510
<v Speaker 2>unbearable place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an airplane or an airport,</v>

632
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.140
<v Speaker 2>then I do that horrible part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>keyboarding.</v>

633
00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the only time you actually </v>

634
00:33:33.231 --> 00:33:34.064
<v Speaker 2>write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

635
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.180
<v Speaker 2>The keyboarding is not writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember the Truman Capote,</v>

636
00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:39.950
<v Speaker 2>he quote about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the road,</v>

637
00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Jack Kerouac Capote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that's not writing.</v>

638
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:44.023
<v Speaker 2>That's typing and still the part on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>airplane or in the airport where you </v>

639
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:50.480
<v Speaker 2>have the laptop open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not writing.</v>

640
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

641
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:53.810
<v Speaker 2>That's typing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is writing.</v>

642
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Writing to you is physical pen to paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

643
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.970
<v Speaker 2>sloppy everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

644
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it different?</v>

645
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.400
<v Speaker 2>Because it's written down in the moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you hear it.</v>

646
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:05.953
<v Speaker 2>And that is not set in new times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman 12 point so that it looks so </v>

647
00:34:09.861 --> 00:34:10.694
<v Speaker 2>finished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a finished book and it's </v>

648
00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:15.230
<v Speaker 2>much harder to monkey with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you see it on that screen.</v>

649
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:16.870
<v Speaker 2>And in word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

650
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.940
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much harder to edit it,</v>

651
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.540
<v Speaker 2>but when it's scrawled on the page in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of you,</v>

652
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 2>you can draw arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can scribble it out,</v>

653
00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:28.160
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever you want to.</v>

654
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much less precious.</v>

655
00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Is this something that you voted this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the approach of Oh taken.</v>

656
00:34:34.131 --> 00:34:34.964
<v Speaker 2>Did you learn this approach or is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that just sort of made sense </v>

657
00:34:37.761 --> 00:34:38.594
<v Speaker 2>to you?</v>

658
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:42.560
<v Speaker 2>This is how old I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be,</v>

659
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.713
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in the age of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>typewriters when even typewriters were </v>

660
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:51.200
<v Speaker 2>kind of precious because you would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to buy ribbons for them.</v>

661
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.423
<v Speaker 2>And those ribbons were really expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so something had to be written out </v>

662
00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:57.703
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Long hand had to be perfect longhand </v>

663
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.400
<v Speaker 2>before you could risk wasting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>typewriter ribbon to type it out.</v>

664
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.373
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just developed it this way and </v>

665
00:35:11.721 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 2>just stuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the age of computers.</v>

666
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:15.463
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also because writing is something I </v>

667
00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 2>do in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody says something insightful,</v>

668
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.263
<v Speaker 2>something really bright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something phrased just wrong so that </v>

669
00:35:26.421 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 2>it's suddenly really fresh and I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to write it down in that moment.</v>

670
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.250
<v Speaker 2>So that when I do have to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boring part with a keyboard,</v>

671
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.623
<v Speaker 2>I have got so much wonderful fresh stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it makes a keyboarding part fun </v>

672
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.410
<v Speaker 2>because it allows me to sort of archive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a cure rate,</v>

673
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.543
<v Speaker 2>preserve these fantastically bright </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that were said by so many </v>

674
00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 2>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't,</v>

675
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.293
<v Speaker 2>do you ever record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever record yourself like record </v>

676
00:35:54.631 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 2>ideas then listened to them transcribe </v>
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>

677
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.593
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

678
00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.493
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate that.</v>

679
00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.573
<v Speaker 2>That was a big hunter s Thompson thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would record a lot of his ideas and </v>

680
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:06.870
<v Speaker 2>then transcribe them and write them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

681
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I kinda write word for word sentence for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence.</v>

682
00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.270
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

683
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.780
<v Speaker 2>the transcription is just too much of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort for me.</v>

684
00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Usually when I do interviews for </v>
<v Speaker 2>magazines,</v>

685
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:20.743
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will record my interview subjects and </v>

686
00:36:23.111 --> 00:36:25.050
<v Speaker 2>even then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

687
00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.770
<v Speaker 2>transcribing the interviews is so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a misery because people seldom talk</v>

688
00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:30.604
<v Speaker 2>in complete sentences and there's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many false starts and so many sentences </v>

689
00:36:34.481 --> 00:36:36.540
<v Speaker 2>that just don't go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

690
00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.253
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking into a recorder is just that a </v>

691
00:36:42.311 --> 00:36:45.070
<v Speaker 2>mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this notebook,</v>

692
00:36:45.071 --> 00:36:48.910
<v Speaker 2>do you have in front of you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a notebook for life or is this a</v>

693
00:36:48.911 --> 00:36:51.400
<v Speaker 2>notebook for particular project?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you,</v>

694
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:55.840
<v Speaker 2>how do you organize it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a notebook where three pages are</v>

695
00:36:55.841 --> 00:37:00.340
<v Speaker 2>devoted to topics that I will talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you about if we're desperate.</v>

696
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:02.763
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a little notes in here about </v>

697
00:37:04.271 --> 00:37:06.850
<v Speaker 2>contacting my agent for different </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

698
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all universal.</v>

699
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like for all sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for tasks that you need to do.</v>

700
00:37:12.371 --> 00:37:14.950
<v Speaker 2>And then as well as that parts of books </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're writing.</v>

701
00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.940
<v Speaker 2>And there's all these little notes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie just gave me about microphones.</v>

702
00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:20.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're writing something about someone </v>

703
00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:23.170
<v Speaker 2>who's into recording equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

704
00:37:23.171 --> 00:37:25.660
<v Speaker 2>That's just a small part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what she knows.</v>

705
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:26.723
<v Speaker 2>And now this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back to this workshop </v>

706
00:37:30.191 --> 00:37:32.710
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was it?</v>

707
00:37:32.711 --> 00:37:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Just words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

708
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:37.210
<v Speaker 2>the use of the word faggot or the n </v>
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>

709
00:37:37.211 --> 00:37:38.044
<v Speaker 2>It was just words that characters were </v>
<v Speaker 2>utilizing in your story that was so </v>

710
00:37:42.371 --> 00:37:43.300
<v Speaker 2>disturbing to them.</v>

711
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.083
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

712
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.483
<v Speaker 2>it was words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was also some situations that I </v>

713
00:37:48.091 --> 00:37:49.160
<v Speaker 2>thought were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

714
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I got that people were very upset by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people would leave the room where people</v>

715
00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.000
<v Speaker 2>would leave the room or what would weep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

716
00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:01.010
<v Speaker 2>would weep in just complete upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does part of you go,</v>

717
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:01.903
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this and you see someone weeping </v>

718
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.840
<v Speaker 2>some shit you wrote?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

719
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:07.003
<v Speaker 2>most of the time people would go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom and weep and I would find out </v>

720
00:38:09.141 --> 00:38:11.680
<v Speaker 2>about it much later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

721
00:38:11.681 --> 00:38:13.820
<v Speaker 2>did you get post satisfaction that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

722
00:38:13.821 --> 00:38:14.654
<v Speaker 2>It just made me feel like a bully and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really kind of another thing that </v>

723
00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.753
<v Speaker 2>is a thin line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when I read a story like </v>

724
00:38:21.771 --> 00:38:22.604
<v Speaker 2>guts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I entertaining people or am I </v>

725
00:38:27.261 --> 00:38:31.640
<v Speaker 2>bullying them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I beating them up and I also bullying</v>

726
00:38:31.641 --> 00:38:33.230
<v Speaker 2>wine that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you what?</v>

727
00:38:33.231 --> 00:38:34.064
<v Speaker 2>Describe it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of charming them into a story that </v>

728
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:39.190
<v Speaker 2>eventually will make them faint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or eventually we'll,</v>

729
00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.120
<v Speaker 2>we'll make them Rach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but will upset them very deeply.</v>

730
00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

731
00:38:45.451 --> 00:38:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I feel a real reluctance about that.</v>

732
00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that sort of have to bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be crossed though if you're,</v>

733
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:54.904
<v Speaker 1>if you're really going to explore every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single possibility in a creative </v>

734
00:38:58.121 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

735
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:03.100
<v Speaker 1>if you're really gonna write a book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just let your mind go wild,</v>

736
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.140
<v Speaker 1>that has to be on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

737
00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.070
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think it hurts to be aware,</v>

738
00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:11.903
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you don't lapse into being a </v>

739
00:39:14.241 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 2>bully for the sake of being a bully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

740
00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I think anybody who has a really hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>trainer,</v>

741
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:20.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

742
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes up against that and my,</v>

743
00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:26.390
<v Speaker 2>a really good trainer or as part of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sadist,</v>

744
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.810
<v Speaker 2>and you have to make sure that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>become that sadist,</v>

745
00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:32.750
<v Speaker 2>but so you're not a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>

746
00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I worry about it.</v>

747
00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you're not,</v>

748
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's the</v>

749
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.713
<v Speaker 1>being able to explore those </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities and being able to just </v>

750
00:39:46.341 --> 00:39:51.320
<v Speaker 1>delve into the deep recesses of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind in the interest of creativity.</v>

751
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:52.783
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anybody's going to appreciate that </v>

752
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:55.640
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be creative writers,</v>

753
00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's not my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm delving into the deep recesses,</v>

754
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:02.620
<v Speaker 2>if I'm lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm doing it right,</v>

755
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.340
<v Speaker 2>your mind of something that they'll like</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians and they'll say,</v>

756
00:40:09.221 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened to you too.</v>

757
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:16.830
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of times there are things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have never ever talked about.</v>

758
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell a classic anecdote after I'd read</v>

759
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:21.484
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

760
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:26.610
<v Speaker 2>the guts story at an event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman came up and uh,</v>

761
00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.940
<v Speaker 2>she was a middle aged woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was about my age and she said,</v>

762
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I really loved that you read that story </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how you,</v>

763
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:37.723
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

764
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:42.240
<v Speaker 2>got your anus prolapsed while </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbating and swimming pool,</v>

765
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.740
<v Speaker 2>which is not my story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm the one that read it.</v>

766
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:47.903
<v Speaker 2>So that's the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one that they're picturing in </v>

767
00:40:49.981 --> 00:40:53.340
<v Speaker 2>this horrendous situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>

768
00:40:53.341 --> 00:40:56.370
<v Speaker 2>since you can tell that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you a story.</v>

769
00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:57.953
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how when,</v>

770
00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:02.450
<v Speaker 2>when she was seven years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was in second grade and she was in a</v>

771
00:41:02.451 --> 00:41:07.050
<v Speaker 2>little organization called the brownies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a precursor to the girl scouts.</v>

772
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.120
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wear a brown dress,</v>

773
00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:12.180
<v Speaker 2>little brown hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get these little merit badges.</v>

774
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:13.913
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day I had a stomachache and my mom </v>

775
00:41:19.381 --> 00:41:23.100
<v Speaker 2>kept me home from school and we had this</v>
<v Speaker 2>heating pad,</v>

776
00:41:23.101 --> 00:41:23.934
<v Speaker 2>it must've been in the 1960s and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>heating pad had this vibrating function </v>

777
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:28.883
<v Speaker 2>and she put me face down on this heating</v>
<v Speaker 2>pad on my stomach and I fell asleep and </v>

778
00:41:32.851 --> 00:41:33.684
<v Speaker 2>while was asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this vibrating warm heating pad must </v>

779
00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 2>have slid down between my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>

780
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:41.594
<v Speaker 2>because I woke up with the most amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling I feeling like I had never felt </v>

781
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

782
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 2>it felt so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

783
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.100
<v Speaker 2>next time it was my turn to host the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brownies.</v>

784
00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.150
<v Speaker 2>I said Brownies because you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try this heating pad.</v>

785
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.823
<v Speaker 2>And she says all the brownies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they turn the heating pad on the </v>

786
00:42:06.041 --> 00:42:06.874
<v Speaker 2>vibrating heating pad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they wrote it like a pony all </v>

787
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.630
<v Speaker 2>afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said it was like sex in the city</v>

788
00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:14.464
<v Speaker 2>for seven year old girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could not get enough of this </v>

789
00:42:16.661 --> 00:42:17.494
<v Speaker 2>heating pad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were all riding this heating </v>

790
00:42:19.271 --> 00:42:21.970
<v Speaker 2>pad and they had a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

791
00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.163
<v Speaker 2>and for the first time in my life I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most popular girl in my class and I </v>

792
00:42:28.151 --> 00:42:30.910
<v Speaker 2>was the girl that all the girls wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to play with.</v>

793
00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.313
<v Speaker 2>And for every Brownie troop meeting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was at my house and I was the leader </v>

794
00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:42.400
<v Speaker 2>until the day that my mother came home </v>
<v Speaker 2>from work early and she caught us with a</v>

795
00:42:42.401 --> 00:42:43.234
<v Speaker 2>heating pad and she sent the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>brownies home and she whipped the cord </v>

796
00:42:49.241 --> 00:42:49.870
<v Speaker 2>out of the wall.</v>

797
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:50.703
<v Speaker 2>She just ripped it out of the socket and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she started to beat me with it and she </v>

798
00:42:55.211 --> 00:42:58.030
<v Speaker 2>beat me with that court and she beat me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she said,</v>

799
00:42:58.031 --> 00:43:01.450
<v Speaker 2>you fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You dirty whore.</v>

800
00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:05.050
<v Speaker 2>What kind of a fucking whore am I </v>
<v Speaker 2>raising you?</v>

801
00:43:05.051 --> 00:43:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Whore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she beat me,</v>

802
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.963
<v Speaker 2>she beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she says this woman who's my age </v>

803
00:43:11.081 --> 00:43:12.910
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she says,</v>

804
00:43:12.911 --> 00:43:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I have not had an orgasm since I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven years old.</v>

805
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.473
<v Speaker 2>And then she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you can tell that swimming pool </v>

806
00:43:22.031 --> 00:43:27.031
<v Speaker 2>story about how you got hurt jacking off</v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater,</v>

807
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:29.223
<v Speaker 2>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell my heating pad story and I </v>

808
00:43:31.751 --> 00:43:34.030
<v Speaker 2>can tell that story until I can make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

809
00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.810
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe somebody I can go back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom and I can say,</v>

810
00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:39.123
<v Speaker 2>do you remember that heating pad we used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have and it'll be complete whole </v>

811
00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.020
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so cc cc,</v>

812
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:48.123
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to create the opening for </v>

813
00:43:52.061 --> 00:43:52.894
<v Speaker 2>people to tell these stories that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never thought that they could tell </v>

814
00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:58.383
<v Speaker 2>because that's the way in which they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to resolve these stories and </v>

815
00:44:01.451 --> 00:44:03.100
<v Speaker 2>they're going to master these stories.</v>

816
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:05.560
<v Speaker 1>We have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

817
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:07.623
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but de toilette things that have a </v>

818
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:12.460
<v Speaker 1>little button on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you press it,</v>

819
00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it shoots hot water up your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

820
00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:16.444
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids come over and did love these </v>

821
00:44:19.811 --> 00:44:24.280
<v Speaker 1>toilets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two daughters and my youngest,</v>

822
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:25.203
<v Speaker 1>when she was seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would sit on the toilet and she was </v>

823
00:44:28.001 --> 00:44:33.001
<v Speaker 1>laughing and giggling and we didn't tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>her there's anything wrong with it.</v>

824
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:37.230
<v Speaker 1>So she was telling us how much she loves</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

825
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.810
<v Speaker 1>how much she loves the hot water when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoots onto her.</v>

826
00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:42.210
<v Speaker 1>But she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels so good.</v>

827
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:43.343
<v Speaker 1>And there was no shame in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was this weird moment where </v>

828
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I supposed to react to this?</v>

829
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Am I supposed to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

830
00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I know I like it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I supposed to say,</v>

831
00:44:55.591 --> 00:44:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that too much.</v>

832
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Am I supposed to say don't tell anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>you like that you can like it,</v>

833
00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 1>but don't tell anybody you like it.</v>

834
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Like what am I supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

835
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.823
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just let her smile and she walked out </v>

836
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 1>of the bathroom laughing like it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>great and it was,</v>

837
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:15.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no issue.</v>

838
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.060
<v Speaker 1>But it was this moment where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

839
00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:19.943
<v Speaker 1>if I was a religious person or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressive person or some person with </v>

840
00:45:23.761 --> 00:45:24.594
<v Speaker 1>some sexual issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could be a real problem for this </v>

841
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:30.270
<v Speaker 1>little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead I was like,</v>

842
00:45:30.271 --> 00:45:31.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get out of the bathroom now.</v>

843
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:34.500
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All righty.</v>

844
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:35.663
<v Speaker 1>And she has no idea that this was even </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a moment of crisis in my mind or I </v>

845
00:45:43.651 --> 00:45:44.221
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

846
00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:45.054
<v Speaker 1>how do I handle this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the bathroom with my seven year </v>

847
00:45:46.531 --> 00:45:47.364
<v Speaker 1>old daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't water shot up her ass and </v>

848
00:45:48.601 --> 00:45:49.450
<v Speaker 1>she's enjoying it.</v>

849
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.880
<v Speaker 2>So you talk about it on the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that how you deal with that?</v>

850
00:45:53.881 --> 00:45:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

851
00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Joy to share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy too.</v>

852
00:45:56.541 --> 00:45:58.160
<v Speaker 1>We all do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk about these toilets.</v>

853
00:45:58.161 --> 00:46:00.260
<v Speaker 1>They're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's warm water.</v>

854
00:46:00.261 --> 00:46:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Choosing your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

855
00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.533
<v Speaker 1>It feels awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not supposed to feel awesome </v>

856
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.370
<v Speaker 1>for like a little girl for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

857
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:13.510
<v Speaker 2>See you tell that story and people will </v>
<v Speaker 2>have so many versions of that story.</v>

858
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:15.290
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Germany.</v>

859
00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:19.520
<v Speaker 2>I went in the bathroom in the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what this button was,</v>

860
00:46:19.521 --> 00:46:20.354
<v Speaker 2>so I pressed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked down just in time to see this </v>

861
00:46:22.251 --> 00:46:23.084
<v Speaker 2>little plastic arm swing out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what that thing was going </v>

862
00:46:25.881 --> 00:46:26.714
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I jumped off the head and this thing </v>

863
00:46:29.181 --> 00:46:30.014
<v Speaker 2>shot up with such force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It knocked a ceiling panel out of the </v>

864
00:46:32.931 --> 00:46:37.910
<v Speaker 2>ceiling and all this hot toilet water </v>
<v Speaker 2>came sprinkling down on me.</v>

865
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

866
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.590
<v Speaker 2>that's the only time I've ever been </v>
<v Speaker 2>around one of those.</v>

867
00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:45.590
<v Speaker 1>While we have one here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to try it out,</v>

868
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It scares me.</v>

869
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.360
<v Speaker 1>There's two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one in that bathroom,</v>

870
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:53.420
<v Speaker 1>one of that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of that bathroom you could lock.</v>

871
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:54.660
<v Speaker 1>It's private.</v>

872
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.493
<v Speaker 2>And see that's my process is you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell these stories and you kind of </v>

873
00:46:58.471 --> 00:46:59.304
<v Speaker 2>gathered the stories that people tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>related to these stories and you choose </v>

874
00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:05.790
<v Speaker 2>the ones that escalate the fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the escalate the best.</v>

875
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.013
<v Speaker 2>And that gives you a gradual sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've established the precedent and </v>

876
00:47:11.281 --> 00:47:13.650
<v Speaker 2>then something worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>escalating,</v>

877
00:47:13.651 --> 00:47:14.700
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>escalating,</v>

878
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:15.534
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>escalating to the most atrocious or </v>

879
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.820
<v Speaker 2>extreme version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what brings a story to crisis</v>

880
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:21.654
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

881
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:23.963
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time believing that </v>

882
00:47:26.621 --> 00:47:29.020
<v Speaker 1>someone would be angry with that woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>for her story.</v>

883
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>

884
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:34.270
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about her and her story,</v>

885
00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:36.460
<v Speaker 2>her relationship to that story.</v>

886
00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:41.180
<v Speaker 1>That one you're going to get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get away with that one.</v>

887
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:46.280
<v Speaker 1>The d jerking off the grandfather one is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a different place.</v>

888
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.580
<v Speaker 1>She's because she's a victim of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse.</v>

889
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:53.840
<v Speaker 1>She's a victim of VI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's strange that violence,</v>

890
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:54.733
<v Speaker 1>for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more acceptable than sexual abuse </v>

891
00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:02.270
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of ways sexual abuse seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be transformative.</v>

892
00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse that it,</v>

893
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.650
<v Speaker 1>it ruins you introduce a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an experience,</v>

894
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:14.660
<v Speaker 1>a memory into a person's life that ruins</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

895
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.773
<v Speaker 2>This is the rough segue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I find with so many beginning </v>

896
00:48:21.391 --> 00:48:26.391
<v Speaker 2>writers is that they have absolutely no </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to be with tension or suspense.</v>

897
00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:33.330
<v Speaker 2>So they might start to create suspense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they'll resolve it instantly.</v>

898
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:34.583
<v Speaker 2>And so the story never really gets off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground because something has </v>

899
00:48:37.411 --> 00:48:38.244
<v Speaker 2>happened to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's violent or whether it's </v>

900
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:40.763
<v Speaker 2>sexual abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that makes them cling to a kind of </v>

901
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:48.690
<v Speaker 2>calm serenity and that's all they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's all they ever want.</v>

902
00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:50.183
<v Speaker 2>And then writing in a way seems to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of coaching them back to a greater </v>

903
00:48:53.911 --> 00:48:56.690
<v Speaker 2>and greater tolerance with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unresolved with,</v>

904
00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.800
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tense,</v>

905
00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:58.770
<v Speaker 2>with suspense</v>

906
00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.433
<v Speaker 1>is some of the best moments in books </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've read are moments where you're </v>

907
00:49:02.641 --> 00:49:04.320
<v Speaker 1>reading and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>

908
00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Like where's this going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

909
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:09.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get introduced into some</v>

910
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:11.670
<v Speaker 1>really disturbing scene</v>

911
00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:14.423
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be with that until it's </v>

912
00:49:16.261 --> 00:49:18.150
<v Speaker 2>resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's good writing.</v>

913
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad writing is where it comes up.</v>

914
00:49:20.911 --> 00:49:21.744
<v Speaker 2>It's resolved.</v>

915
00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:23.163
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're in this workshop and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're discussing with you this </v>

916
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.713
<v Speaker 1>possibility of censorship of you sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>censoring or have them not accepting </v>

917
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:34.810
<v Speaker 1>your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you,</v>

918
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:38.590
<v Speaker 1>how do you debate that with them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

919
00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:39.790
<v Speaker 1>how do you talk about that?</v>

920
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's really no debate,</v>

921
00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:46.020
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

922
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.440
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was another aspect,</v>

923
00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:50.483
<v Speaker 2>aspect of the workshop is that we had </v>
<v Speaker 2>all known each other for so many years </v>

924
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.623
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

925
00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:55.943
<v Speaker 4>mmm,</v>

926
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.233
<v Speaker 2>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have the freedom to kind of </v>

927
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:01.800
<v Speaker 2>teach each other or anything new.</v>

928
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:03.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

929
00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:05.143
<v Speaker 2>So there was a staleness there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were all kind of hardened into the </v>

930
00:50:08.031 --> 00:50:09.290
<v Speaker 2>people we were going to be.</v>

931
00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand their argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand.</v>

932
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.980
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to really paint a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>

933
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:19.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to have monster's actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

934
00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.290
<v Speaker 1>They have to be a real monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know of real monsters.</v>

935
00:50:22.291 --> 00:50:23.124
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just some,</v>

936
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:28.670
<v Speaker 1>some guy just got arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some had sex slaves in his basement.</v>

937
00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:31.520
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about those people and you go,</v>

938
00:50:31.521 --> 00:50:32.271
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

939
00:50:32.271 --> 00:50:33.104
<v Speaker 1>they're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a hundred of them </v>

940
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:37.550
<v Speaker 1>scattered across the country right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they have a locked basement and we</v>

941
00:50:37.551 --> 00:50:39.920
<v Speaker 1>don't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are real people.</v>

942
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:40.754
<v Speaker 1>But if you wrote about one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people using real scenes that were </v>

943
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:47.660
<v Speaker 1>depicted in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

944
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:52.130
<v Speaker 1>real eyewitness testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real interviews with these monsters,</v>

945
00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:56.613
<v Speaker 1>some people would object to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're gonna write about a </v>

946
00:50:59.411 --> 00:51:00.244
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to write them in a monstrous </v>

947
00:51:03.251 --> 00:51:04.084
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

948
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.961
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

949
00:51:06.961 --> 00:51:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

950
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:13.833
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

951
00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.230
<v Speaker 1>What are they trying to achieve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just don't understand what,</v>

952
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.810
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

953
00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:23.980
<v Speaker 1>They might not enjoy what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might not,</v>

954
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:27.160
<v Speaker 1>might not be something that they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take in recreationally,</v>

955
00:51:27.161 --> 00:51:30.400
<v Speaker 1>that they want to read your work in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that way.</v>

956
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:32.583
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that they don't appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing or the fact that they </v>

957
00:51:34.601 --> 00:51:35.434
<v Speaker 1>don't want you to do what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't want you to bring it to </v>

958
00:51:37.331 --> 00:51:40.720
<v Speaker 1>the workshop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a new thing?</v>

959
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.970
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a new trend?</v>

960
00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:45.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

961
00:51:45.031 --> 00:51:48.360
<v Speaker 2>in a way it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an ongoing thing for me because,</v>

962
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:50.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been kicked out of workshops before</v>

963
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:53.940
<v Speaker 2>for just going a little bit too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

964
00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.500
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in a way it's kind of a,</v>

965
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:02.580
<v Speaker 2>it's maybe my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe my goal is to,</v>

966
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:06.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always piss off my Beta audience.</v>

967
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:07.993
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a way of kind of proving that I've </v>

968
00:52:10.111 --> 00:52:11.770
<v Speaker 2>gone too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

969
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:12.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

970
00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:14.740
<v Speaker 1>too far though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too far.</v>

971
00:52:14.741 --> 00:52:18.220
<v Speaker 1>When you piss off the Alphas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not the Betas,</v>

972
00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:19.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

973
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:20.143
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go really far when you piss off </v>

974
00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Psychos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're like,</v>

975
00:52:23.651 --> 00:52:24.484
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

976
00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:25.840
<v Speaker 1>the fuck you doing in my brain,</v>

977
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

978
00:52:29.031 --> 00:52:31.760
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing not to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just keep calling.</v>

979
00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh my books were banned so many places </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

980
00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:41.380
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes I think that maybe that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a good thing because they don't,</v>

981
00:52:41.381 --> 00:52:44.870
<v Speaker 2>aren't reaching the psychos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My books are abandoned prison systems,</v>

982
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Watson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they are enormously popular.</v>

983
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:49.573
<v Speaker 2>These prison librarians tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the books are considered way too </v>

984
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:55.040
<v Speaker 2>stimulating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wow.</v>

985
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:59.150
<v Speaker 2>People in prison cannot read my books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Holy Shit.</v>

986
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.693
<v Speaker 2>All prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm don't know if it's all but it's </v>

987
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Texas and a number of other really big </v>
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>

988
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:10.970
<v Speaker 2>So I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of a badge of honor.</v>

989
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:13.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't equate to the like the </v>

990
00:53:14.631 --> 00:53:16.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mortality of being banned.</v>

991
00:53:16.821 --> 00:53:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Like a how or a tropic of cancer or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Salman Rushdie.</v>

992
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

993
00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

994
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 2>That fucking struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

995
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:33.440
<v Speaker 2>The struggle of wanting to express </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself as freely as possible,</v>

996
00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:36.810
<v Speaker 2>but being limited even by your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>peers.</v>

997
00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:39.290
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

998
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:43.010
<v Speaker 2>that's unexpected to someone who's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the outside of literature.</v>

999
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Someone who just reads it.</v>

1000
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's not in the comedy world what </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in the comedy world,</v>

1001
00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:50.750
<v Speaker 2>but not amongst good comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1002
00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:52.333
<v Speaker 2>another aspect of that is that so often </v>
<v Speaker 2>people aren't censoring it because it </v>

1003
00:53:56.091 --> 00:53:56.924
<v Speaker 2>offends them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're censoring it because they're </v>

1004
00:53:58.521 --> 00:54:01.670
<v Speaker 2>afraid it will offend someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know they're doing it.</v>

1005
00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.670
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of white knighting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>behalf of someone else.</v>

1006
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:09.340
<v Speaker 2>David Sedaris told me this story about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1007
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:11.170
<v Speaker 2>telling a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1008
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:12.043
<v Speaker 2>or something very funny about a girl in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a wheelchair and how he looked out in </v>

1009
00:54:15.621 --> 00:54:16.454
<v Speaker 2>the audience and no one was laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were all looking at a girl in a </v>

1010
00:54:20.481 --> 00:54:23.750
<v Speaker 2>wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the moment she started to laugh,</v>

1011
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:27.470
<v Speaker 2>the entire audience started to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1012
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:30.710
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so often people in the workshop,</v>

1013
00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.980
<v Speaker 2>they might not personally feel offended </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the word,</v>

1014
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:37.610
<v Speaker 2>but they're thinking how that word might</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt people.</v>

1015
00:54:37.611 --> 00:54:39.230
<v Speaker 2>They know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1016
00:54:39.231 --> 00:54:39.920
<v Speaker 2>that's a fact.</v>

1017
00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1018
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:42.560
<v Speaker 2>that's a giant issue in comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

1019
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:45.590
<v Speaker 2>if someone's telling you a joke of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's on stage talking about someone</v>

1020
00:54:45.591 --> 00:54:48.080
<v Speaker 2>who's fat and there's a fat person in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the front row,</v>

1021
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:49.970
<v Speaker 2>that joke will bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:51.920
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1023
00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:54.260
<v Speaker 2>But that's because people are good </v>
<v Speaker 2>people overall.</v>

1024
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.123
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they recognize that they don't want to </v>

1025
00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:57.853
<v Speaker 2>cause pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another really odd comic David Sedaris </v>

1026
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.710
<v Speaker 2>story is that he always told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1027
00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:07.430
<v Speaker 2>when you're on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't read from your current book.</v>

1028
00:55:07.431 --> 00:55:08.264
<v Speaker 2>Always read from the next book pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have road testing the stories and </v>

1029
00:55:11.361 --> 00:55:14.630
<v Speaker 2>finding out which ones work and should </v>
<v Speaker 2>go into the next book.</v>

1030
00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:16.813
<v Speaker 2>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was telling the story about being in </v>

1031
00:55:18.471 --> 00:55:19.304
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1032
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:20.860
<v Speaker 2>this forensic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1033
00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:22.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory isn't an,</v>

1034
00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:23.443
<v Speaker 2>as an autopsy was taking place and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>autopsy table was adjacent to dis this </v>

1035
00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:29.324
<v Speaker 2>huge indoor window that separated the </v>
<v Speaker 2>autopsy suite from this lunch room and </v>

1036
00:55:34.881 --> 00:55:37.100
<v Speaker 2>in the lunch room where the rest of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1037
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.380
<v Speaker 2>the forensic staff and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating their lunches.</v>

1038
00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:44.390
<v Speaker 2>They all had tuna sandwiches and cans of</v>
<v Speaker 2>coke and barbecue potato chips.</v>

1039
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:50.900
<v Speaker 2>And they were watching through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>window as is absolutely perfect.</v>

1040
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:56.470
<v Speaker 2>12 year old boy was being autopsied and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just hours before this kid,</v>

1041
00:55:57.261 --> 00:55:59.900
<v Speaker 2>like two hours before this kid had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>riding his bicycle,</v>

1042
00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:01.213
<v Speaker 2>he'd fallen over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd hit his head on the curb and now </v>

1043
00:56:04.311 --> 00:56:09.311
<v Speaker 2>two hours later he was dead and dead </v>
<v Speaker 2>without almost a scratch on him.</v>

1044
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:10.633
<v Speaker 2>Just this perfect naked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead 12 year old boy on the autopsy </v>

1045
00:56:15.021 --> 00:56:17.180
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as he,</v>

1046
00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:19.460
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technicians eating their lunch,</v>

1047
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 2>watching it through a window that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch as the,</v>

1048
00:56:24.101 --> 00:56:25.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the,</v>

1049
00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:26.203
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathologist in sizes around the top of </v>

1050
00:56:29.801 --> 00:56:31.870
<v Speaker 2>the kid's face at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forehead,</v>

1051
00:56:31.871 --> 00:56:32.704
<v Speaker 2>the hairline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then peels a face down like peeling </v>

1052
00:56:36.011 --> 00:56:36.844
<v Speaker 2>an orange peels the entire face off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the skull of this little boy and leaves </v>

1053
00:56:41.591 --> 00:56:45.940
<v Speaker 2>the face around the neck like a mask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a rubber mask.</v>

1054
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:47.223
<v Speaker 2>And this exposes this liver colored dark</v>
<v Speaker 2>red musculature of the child's </v>

1055
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.983
<v Speaker 2>underlying face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this one guy watching it with a </v>

1056
00:56:56.891 --> 00:57:00.190
<v Speaker 2>mouthful of tuna sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he points this out and he says,</v>

1057
00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:02.020
<v Speaker 2>see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there,</v>

1058
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 2>that's the color of red that I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>paint our rec room.</v>

1059
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:07.263
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once the Darice told that story in </v>

1060
00:57:10.901 --> 00:57:12.610
<v Speaker 2>front of 600 people,</v>

1061
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:14.230
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1062
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:18.550
<v Speaker 2>it was dead silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could hear people weeping.</v>

1063
00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1064
00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:24.360
<v Speaker 2>People were crying and they were hating </v>
<v Speaker 2>David Sedaris in that moment.</v>

1065
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.560
<v Speaker 2>And so I had to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I laughed really loud like a donkey.</v>

1066
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:30.263
<v Speaker 2>And it was amazing how that hatred in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that auditorium swung from hating David </v>

1067
00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.353
<v Speaker 2>who they did not want to hate to hating </v>
<v Speaker 2>this jackass over here who was actually </v>

1068
00:57:40.831 --> 00:57:41.664
<v Speaker 2>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I threw myself on the sword for </v>

1069
00:57:44.131 --> 00:57:47.190
<v Speaker 2>David and that story never went in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

1070
00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:50.233
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did the story Naco in any book just </v>

1071
00:57:52.401 --> 00:57:55.280
<v Speaker 2>because of the reaction by the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>or just an uncomfortable moment?</v>

1072
00:57:55.281 --> 00:57:57.440
<v Speaker 2>He just decided he would speak to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1073
00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:58.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

1074
00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Not afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just such an awkward,</v>

1075
00:58:00.801 --> 00:58:01.634
<v Speaker 2>painful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never kind of throw it back in </v>

1076
00:58:03.081 --> 00:58:04.530
<v Speaker 2>his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1077
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:05.503
<v Speaker 2>To my knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the only time the story was </v>

1078
00:58:07.101 --> 00:58:10.570
<v Speaker 2>told to have those like scattered about </v>
<v Speaker 2>or there this,</v>

1079
00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:14.270
<v Speaker 2>are there scenes what you wrote and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sat and looked at him and went,</v>

1080
00:58:14.271 --> 00:58:15.104
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got to put that one somewhere </v>

1081
00:58:16.431 --> 00:58:17.360
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1082
00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:22.400
<v Speaker 2>there's that other side jokes that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>told where I got hist by 800 people.</v>

1083
00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:23.683
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can live through those moments </v>

1084
00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:28.100
<v Speaker 2>when you realize you can live through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot,</v>

1085
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:34.120
<v Speaker 2>if you can be hated by 1100 people at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>barnes and noble on Union Square.</v>

1086
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be hated by your mother.</v>

1087
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.293
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know when those people come to see </v>

1088
00:58:40.461 --> 00:58:41.294
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of those people are fans of </v>

1089
00:58:41.691 --> 00:58:44.870
<v Speaker 2>literature and how many of those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are specifically fans of your work?</v>

1090
00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be a difference.</v>

1091
00:58:46.341 --> 00:58:47.174
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people were fans of your work would </v>

1092
00:58:48.351 --> 00:58:52.160
<v Speaker 2>at least expect some uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments.</v>

1093
00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.473
<v Speaker 2>And for the most part they tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less just fans of my work and </v>

1094
00:58:57.770 --> 00:59:01.280
<v Speaker 2>still still his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

1095
00:59:01.281 --> 00:59:02.114
<v Speaker 2>But it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hissing on behalf of someone </v>

1096
00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.690
<v Speaker 2>than I hissing up for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1097
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I made this horrible cheap shot and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>always knew a cheap shot.</v>

1098
00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.080
<v Speaker 2>People always know a cheap shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1099
00:59:15.081 --> 00:59:15.914
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was commenting about how in breakfast </v>

1100
00:59:17.901 --> 00:59:18.734
<v Speaker 2>at tiffany's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truman capote had made this observation </v>

1101
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:26.410
<v Speaker 2>that Americans don't like true beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true classical natural beauty.</v>

1102
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:31.040
<v Speaker 2>They want to see a very plain person who</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been so groomed.</v>

1103
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:32.023
<v Speaker 2>So exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so made up so style stylized that she </v>

1104
00:59:35.601 --> 00:59:40.601
<v Speaker 2>can kind of pass as this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this amazing,</v>

1105
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:41.833
<v Speaker 2>strange beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what Americans want because </v>

1106
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:47.840
<v Speaker 2>natural classic beauty is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>egalitarian.</v>

1107
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:50.150
<v Speaker 2>You're either born with it or you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1108
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.380
<v Speaker 2>They want to see a plain person who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been transformed.</v>

1109
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.830
<v Speaker 2>And to make my point at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

1110
00:59:57.831 --> 00:59:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I made a cheap shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1111
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:00.943
<v Speaker 2>and that's why we have Sarah Jessica </v>
<v Speaker 2>Parker and I said this in New York and </v>

1112
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:11.023
<v Speaker 2>in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Jessica Parker is worshipped like </v>

1113
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:13.994
<v Speaker 2>a god and that whole crowd hissed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>booed and did everything but throw </v>

1114
01:00:20.511 --> 01:00:23.240
<v Speaker 2>excrement at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1115
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 2>But then later in line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of them came up and whispered.</v>

1116
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.610
<v Speaker 2>That was really funny.</v>

1117
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1118
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:35.150
<v Speaker 1>well that's one of the things about dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy clubs.</v>

1119
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>You want them dark?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1120
01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>you don't want everyone illuminated like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1121
01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:41.860
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd is like the one,</v>

1122
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:45.040
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the real issues with </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a comedy special is that uh,</v>

1123
01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>especially the old way they used to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they still like to light up the</v>

1124
01:00:47.901 --> 01:00:48.734
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which completely changes the dynamic of </v>

1125
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room changes,</v>

1126
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>what you'll laugh and what you won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh at.</v>

1127
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a scene like this,</v>

1128
01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Erica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Jessica Parker joke,</v>

1129
01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.433
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want to be caught dead </v>

1130
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.520
<v Speaker 1>being the one person that throws her </v>
<v Speaker 1>head back and how's it that</v>

1131
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:08.580
<v Speaker 2>no cheap shots or just to stay away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1132
01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.410
<v Speaker 2>But that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask you,</v>

1133
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.030
<v Speaker 2>ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1134
01:01:12.031 --> 01:01:12.864
<v Speaker 2>with so many colleges becoming these </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of strident safe places to demand </v>

1135
01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:20.250
<v Speaker 2>their own aesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it like doing comedy?</v>

1136
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1137
01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't changed that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People getting a little got a little bit</v>

1138
01:01:27.341 --> 01:01:28.174
<v Speaker 1>more sensitive because they're aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people were more sensitive </v>

1139
01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>without the audiences that come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightclubs,</v>

1140
01:01:35.261 --> 01:01:39.310
<v Speaker 1>which is primarily where I perform with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a theater.</v>

1141
01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Those people were there to see</v>

1142
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.660
<v Speaker 2>May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1143
01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>they're usually pretty loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty fun.</v>

1144
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>But if you're in a nightclub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there to see,</v>

1145
01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.013
<v Speaker 1>especially the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the good things about the </v>

1146
01:01:49.891 --> 01:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>comedy store is there's literally two </v>
<v Speaker 1>dozen people on the lineup then,</v>

1147
01:01:53.551 --> 01:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily just here at cu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there to see Anthony Jessel neck</v>

1148
01:01:57.961 --> 01:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>and Chris delea and all these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians that are also there as well.</v>

1149
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>So you get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a much broader comedy audience,</v>

1150
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but their nightclub audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a few drinks in them.</v>

1151
01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they smoked a little pot before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got there.</v>

1152
01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Those people there to have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colleges are a nightmare now.</v>

1153
01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a nightmare because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreational outrage.</v>

1154
01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:21.803
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kids who have been under the </v>

1155
01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:25.044
<v Speaker 1>control of their parents for most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their life and haven't had their own </v>

1156
01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:32.811
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty and identity and now they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>free and they are very quick to uh,</v>

1157
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>be outraged.</v>

1158
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want a porn out there.</v>

1159
01:02:37.531 --> 01:02:38.364
<v Speaker 1>Moral superiority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't virtue signal and every </v>

1160
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:40.884
<v Speaker 1>opportunity they want to shut down </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to think is air quotes </v>

1161
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:44.574
<v Speaker 1>problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want things to go on a bad </v>

1162
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>when they think for some reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy should be uplifting and it should</v>

1163
01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>only punch up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had this conversation once with a</v>

1164
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:58.341
<v Speaker 1>professor who wrote a book on a comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said all great comedy punches up,</v>

1165
01:02:58.471 --> 01:02:59.790
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>

1166
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:00.953
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest bits of all time is </v>

1167
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:02.784
<v Speaker 1>Sam kinisons bit about starving children</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Africa about watching those </v>

1168
01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:08.880
<v Speaker 1>commercials were starving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids are in Africa and you know,</v>

1169
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.370
<v Speaker 1>couldn't you please help?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes in,</v>

1170
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.980
<v Speaker 1>you know kinnisons like he just want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grab the guy but hey,</v>

1171
01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.113
<v Speaker 5>why don't you help them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're right fucking there or send </v>

1172
01:03:17.311 --> 01:03:18.540
<v Speaker 5>someone like me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1173
01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:20.490
<v Speaker 5>send something like me was going to take</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people go,</v>

1174
01:03:20.491 --> 01:03:23.190
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just drove here 5,000 miles with your</v>

1175
01:03:23.191 --> 01:03:27.360
<v Speaker 5>food and it occurred to us you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>be world hunger if you people would live</v>

1176
01:03:27.361 --> 01:03:30.450
<v Speaker 5>her the fucking food as he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I hear you say that?</v>

1177
01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.330
<v Speaker 5>That sand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got sand in America too.</v>

1178
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.490
<v Speaker 5>We just don't live in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>asshole and he's done.</v>

1179
01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:37.403
<v Speaker 5>He goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the greatest bits of all time is </v>

1180
01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:40.980
<v Speaker 5>literally about</v>

1181
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.313
<v Speaker 1>starving babies in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the greatest bits of all </v>

1182
01:03:45.861 --> 01:03:48.290
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't have anything to say.</v>

1183
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:49.790
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know where to go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1184
01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:50.624
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't say comedy is only about punching </v>

1185
01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:54.440
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy talk.</v>

1186
01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:56.870
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing is you're f </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1187
01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.813
<v Speaker 1>there's this moral thing that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to achieve that literally is </v>

1188
01:04:03.051 --> 01:04:08.051
<v Speaker 1>completely independent of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what's funny.</v>

1189
01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:13.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like there they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want it to be a multipurpose tool.</v>

1190
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:14.933
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want it to be funny as well as </v>

1191
01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:17.894
<v Speaker 1>morally uplifting and great for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are discriminated against and </v>

1192
01:04:22.581 --> 01:04:23.414
<v Speaker 1>amazing for folks who are marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uplifting for those who are </v>

1193
01:04:26.661 --> 01:04:28.910
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not what comedy is.</v>

1194
01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.093
<v Speaker 1>Comedy is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are wonderful and if you </v>

1195
01:04:33.261 --> 01:04:38.210
<v Speaker 1>want to do a spoken word show or poetry </v>
<v Speaker 1>or writing or you know,</v>

1196
01:04:38.211 --> 01:04:41.120
<v Speaker 1>a one person play those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are great.</v>

1197
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:44.720
<v Speaker 1>But that's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy is funny.</v>

1198
01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.033
<v Speaker 1>So it's either funny or it's not funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some things are funny that are </v>

1199
01:04:49.551 --> 01:04:51.560
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1200
01:04:51.561 --> 01:04:52.394
<v Speaker 1>Kennison had a bit about homosexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>necrophilia acts or paying money to </v>

1201
01:04:56.181 --> 01:04:59.930
<v Speaker 1>spend a few hours undisturbed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>freshest male corpses.</v>

1202
01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.093
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he had lied down on his stomach and </v>

1203
01:05:02.301 --> 01:05:03.350
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine these people,</v>

1204
01:05:03.351 --> 01:05:04.184
<v Speaker 1>they're on the slabs are like well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went through life and had a good time </v>

1205
01:05:07.341 --> 01:05:10.290
<v Speaker 1>and everything and now I guess I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go and be with Jesus and</v>

1206
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:12.900
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell is this?</v>

1207
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.810
<v Speaker 5>And he's rocking back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels like some guy's got his dick in</v>

1208
01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:16.644
<v Speaker 5>my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You mean life keeps fucking with they </v>

1209
01:05:18.431 --> 01:05:21.220
<v Speaker 5>ass even after you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It never ends.</v>

1210
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:22.540
<v Speaker 5>It never ends.</v>

1211
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.890
<v Speaker 2>You would close on it cause it was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't follow it.</v>

1212
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:28.083
<v Speaker 2>Who was such a powerful bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about a dead guy getting fucked </v>

1213
01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:30.934
<v Speaker 2>in the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no further down that you could </v>

1214
01:05:33.451 --> 01:05:36.580
<v Speaker 2>punch other than starving babies in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>

1215
01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:38.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not sure about it,</v>

1216
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:39.634
<v Speaker 2>this is punching down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you remember the s the routine </v>

1217
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:44.044
<v Speaker 2>that kind of put Whoopi Goldberg on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>map a million years ago about being a </v>

1218
01:05:47.591 --> 01:05:49.720
<v Speaker 2>black surfer chick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1219
01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:50.651
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1220
01:05:50.651 --> 01:05:51.484
<v Speaker 2>she did it on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must've seen it on cable when I was </v>

1221
01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:58.330
<v Speaker 2>like 19 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she talks in valley speak.</v>

1222
01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's seen this will be person </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1223
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:02.950
<v Speaker 2>She's brand new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever seen her on television and</v>

1224
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:05.290
<v Speaker 2>she's got this funny name and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this.</v>

1225
01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:06.124
<v Speaker 2>Val speak about being the only black </v>
<v Speaker 2>surfer chick on the beach and she loves </v>

1226
01:06:09.491 --> 01:06:12.280
<v Speaker 2>surfing and she loves this one white </v>
<v Speaker 2>surfer guy.</v>

1227
01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.113
<v Speaker 2>And she finally hooks up with them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then she realized that she's pregnant </v>

1228
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:18.310
<v Speaker 2>and it's all very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole front end,</v>

1229
01:06:18.311 --> 01:06:23.311
<v Speaker 2>you're just roaring with laughter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then she's pregnant and she doesn't know</v>

1230
01:06:23.411 --> 01:06:28.060
<v Speaker 2>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she gets a rusty wire coat hanger and</v>

1231
01:06:28.061 --> 01:06:28.894
<v Speaker 2>she goes into a public bathroom on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beach and she gives herself a coat </v>

1232
01:06:33.401 --> 01:06:34.234
<v Speaker 2>hanger abortion and it spills out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the concrete floor and everything's </v>

1233
01:06:41.201 --> 01:06:42.034
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I'm back on the beach and I'm </v>

1234
01:06:43.961 --> 01:06:44.794
<v Speaker 2>just doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why don't you come on down and see </v>

1235
01:06:46.931 --> 01:06:48.910
<v Speaker 2>me here on the beach?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great down here.</v>

1236
01:06:48.911 --> 01:06:51.500
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1237
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:56.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a fantastic piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she did it on television and she did</v>

1238
01:06:56.351 --> 01:07:00.850
<v Speaker 2>it on tv and it started so light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an IRA,</v>

1239
01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:03.670
<v Speaker 2>11 novel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I went to such a dark,</v>

1240
01:07:03.671 --> 01:07:08.380
<v Speaker 2>horrible place and then it came up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>just this kind of token.</v>

1241
01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Everything is okay ending every I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be all right,</v>

1242
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:14.223
<v Speaker 2>don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just something that happened to </v>

1243
01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:21.490
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just leaves you shaken.</v>

1244
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:25.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's the kind of comedy I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1245
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.033
<v Speaker 2>it goes to the dark or that sentimental </v>
<v Speaker 2>place and it breaks your heart and then </v>

1246
01:07:31.721 --> 01:07:36.721
<v Speaker 2>it kind of comes out of it a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I were 11 to that so.</v>

1247
01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nora Ephron in her books,</v>

1248
01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.450
<v Speaker 2>she was so good at doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1249
01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.330
<v Speaker 2>heartburn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heartburn is fantastically funny,</v>

1250
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.510
<v Speaker 2>but by the end you're just weeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book is so sad,</v>

1251
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.570
<v Speaker 2>but these are moments that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>

1252
01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you're going to censor people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to self censor,</v>

1253
01:07:56.211 --> 01:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to decide the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't use certain words,</v>

1254
01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:00.123
<v Speaker 1>have you going to decide the certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios are just too upsetting for </v>

1255
01:08:02.151 --> 01:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reader,</v>

1256
01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.770
<v Speaker 1>the these words are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these moments are going to be harder and</v>

1257
01:08:06.771 --> 01:08:09.610
<v Speaker 1>harder to achieve and these are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments that we're going to talk about.</v>

1258
01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Like if you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in here,</v>

1259
01:08:11.451 --> 01:08:14.120
<v Speaker 1>if we were in a bar somewhere and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a few drinks,</v>

1260
01:08:14.121 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>talking about great are great moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the moments we would bring up.</v>

1261
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:23.530
<v Speaker 1>These are the impactful things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that Sarah Jessica Parker joke in</v>

1262
01:08:23.691 --> 01:08:26.530
<v Speaker 1>front of those thousand people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're booing and hissing and you were,</v>

1263
01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>you're literally on fire under your skin</v>

1264
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.730
<v Speaker 2>and you're beating yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 2>viciously.</v>

1265
01:08:31.731 --> 01:08:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did I say that?</v>

1266
01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm such a jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't need to say that.</v>

1267
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:38.960
<v Speaker 2>That was just cruel and thoughtless and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1268
01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.830
<v Speaker 2>but if you said that exact same joke and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it killed,</v>

1269
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I'd still kind of beat myself up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1270
01:08:48.111 --> 01:08:49.280
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is awful?</v>

1271
01:08:49.281 --> 01:08:52.580
<v Speaker 2>People that are laughing at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate girl.</v>

1272
01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the reason why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>love the transformation thing is because</v>

1273
01:08:56.421 --> 01:09:01.421
<v Speaker 2>it almost like if everyone feels like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a chance instead of like,</v>

1274
01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.250
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1275
01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:06.110
<v Speaker 2>That you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to be born with it.</v>

1276
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a chance of attaining it.</v>

1277
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1278
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:12.980
<v Speaker 2>The unfairness.</v>

1279
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1280
01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is just the reality of life.</v>

1281
01:09:17.730 --> 01:09:18.563
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Jordan talks </v>

1282
01:09:19.171 --> 01:09:21.570
<v Speaker 1>about all the time is the equality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

1283
01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:22.853
<v Speaker 1>That the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1284
01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:26.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of equality of outcome is,</v>

1285
01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.620
<v Speaker 1>it's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never going to happen.</v>

1286
01:09:28.621 --> 01:09:30.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not what life is.</v>

1287
01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:31.133
<v Speaker 1>Life is not about equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen that way because not </v>

1288
01:09:33.570 --> 01:09:34.403
<v Speaker 1>everyone's willing to put the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort in and not everyone's given the </v>

1289
01:09:37.351 --> 01:09:37.560
<v Speaker 1>same</v>

1290
01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.230
<v Speaker 2>tools at birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1291
01:09:40.231 --> 01:09:41.064
<v Speaker 2>you've gotta be a little careful too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you fall into that Jay gatsby trap </v>

1292
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:45.383
<v Speaker 2>where you get exactly what you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were four or 14 years old and </v>

1293
01:09:49.981 --> 01:09:50.761
<v Speaker 2>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1294
01:09:50.761 --> 01:09:54.780
<v Speaker 2>this is not an adult's dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a dream of a child.</v>

1295
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:57.800
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

1296
01:09:57.801 --> 01:09:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1297
01:09:57.850 --> 01:09:58.683
<v Speaker 1>About your current situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I've read </v>

1298
01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:02.793
<v Speaker 1>about your take on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much you want to go </v>

1299
01:10:05.051 --> 01:10:06.700
<v Speaker 1>into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got ripped off.</v>

1300
01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I got embezzled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a word I can now spell.</v>

1301
01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it someone you trusted?</v>

1302
01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:16.730
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1303
01:10:16.731 --> 01:10:17.564
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the accountant for the agency that </v>

1304
01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:19.964
<v Speaker 2>represented my work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a man who had worked with </v>

1305
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.293
<v Speaker 2>for almost 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>21 years and one of my favorite people </v>

1306
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.350
<v Speaker 2>in my professional life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1307
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:31.263
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1308
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.633
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1309
01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:35.590
<v Speaker 1>what I thought was interesting was your </v>
<v Speaker 1>take on it.</v>

1310
01:10:35.591 --> 01:10:36.424
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is horrific and </v>

1311
01:10:37.061 --> 01:10:38.140
<v Speaker 1>everyone's worst nightmare.</v>

1312
01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:40.211
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1313
01:10:40.211 --> 01:10:41.920
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who trust people with their money.</v>

1314
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:44.520
<v Speaker 2>But what was interesting is you,</v>

1315
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you decided that there's some merit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1316
01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:49.293
<v Speaker 1>There's some benefit to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is going to make you hungry </v>

1317
01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:51.830
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1318
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:55.670
<v Speaker 2>This is like you have to work now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also that,</v>

1319
01:10:55.671 --> 01:10:56.504
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have been really poor in my life </v>

1320
01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.820
<v Speaker 2>and it was never my goal to be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich.</v>

1321
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:04.430
<v Speaker 2>It was never my goal to have money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was my goal to be a writer.</v>

1322
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:09.910
<v Speaker 2>It was my goal to be able to write books</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a living and I can still do that.</v>

1323
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been poor.</v>

1324
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Poor is not something I'm afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1325
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:19.140
<v Speaker 2>as long as I can write books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be a happy person.</v>

1326
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:21.090
<v Speaker 2>You had to be rich and to not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative.</v>

1327
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Like as if you know people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>parties and all they have to talk about </v>

<v Speaker 2>all they have to talk about in their </v>

1332

<v Speaker 2>lives is their household help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate those parties</v>

1333
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:47.240
<v Speaker 1>or objects or objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1334
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:48.103
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy that used to live down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the street from as to call them bling </v>

1335
01:11:49.431 --> 01:11:52.250
<v Speaker 1>bling because every conversation that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have with them,</v>

1336
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:54.320
<v Speaker 1>it would eventually be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1337
01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this new car.</v>

1338
01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:57.200
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where'd you get that watch?</v>

1339
01:11:57.210 --> 01:11:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1340
01:11:58.341 --> 01:11:59.174
<v Speaker 1>w w what kind of car you drive it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like we didn't know is what did you do </v>

1341
01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:02.390
<v Speaker 1>to the house?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a new sank,</v>

1342
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a new TV,</v>

1343
01:12:03.471 --> 01:12:04.070
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1344
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.710
<v Speaker 1>which size did you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always objects.</v>

1345
01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It was always things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1346
01:12:08.901 --> 01:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>he was just this strange guy that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just working for things.</v>

1347
01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same things that everybody else has</v>

1348
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>working for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a different combination of things.</v>

1349
01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:20.990
<v Speaker 1>But it's a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1350
01:12:20.991 --> 01:12:23.270
<v Speaker 1>trying to accumulate points in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1351
01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.490
<v Speaker 1>and because these things are difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve,</v>

1352
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:26.623
<v Speaker 1>then they become attractive and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they become the main focus because it's </v>

1353
01:12:29.901 --> 01:12:32.450
<v Speaker 1>hard to get a Bentley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to save up a lot of money to get</v>

1354
01:12:32.451 --> 01:12:33.620
<v Speaker 1>a Bentley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1355
01:12:33.621 --> 01:12:35.420
<v Speaker 1>how much those costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which model is that?</v>

1356
01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Is that the one with the delay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at,</v>

1357
01:12:37.461 --> 01:12:38.294
<v Speaker 1>you got the perforated leather seats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's extra expensive and then this </v>

1358
01:12:41.211 --> 01:12:43.700
<v Speaker 1>becomes the main goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1359
01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:49.480
<v Speaker 1>But so many people fall into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre trial says such a strange common</v>

1360
01:12:49.911 --> 01:12:50.460
<v Speaker 1>trap.</v>

1361
01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1362
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's the only trap that we kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1363
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 2>You are not really trained to again go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that,</v>

1364
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that place of,</v>

1365
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:01.800
<v Speaker 2>of wanting to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1366
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:06.870
<v Speaker 2>learn something to wanting to create </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to apprentice yourself,</v>

1367
01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:10.800
<v Speaker 2>to somebody who creates the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you dream of creating.</v>

1368
01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:11.843
<v Speaker 2>It's much easier to kind of fall into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the readymade trap of these things are </v>

1369
01:13:15.361 --> 01:13:19.230
<v Speaker 2>for sale and the people who sell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll treat you really nice.</v>

1370
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.863
<v Speaker 2>You go into their showroom and they will</v>
<v Speaker 2>treat you so nice and you are always </v>

1371
01:13:23.551 --> 01:13:24.384
<v Speaker 2>welcomed there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can have a way of kind of </v>

1372
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:31.530
<v Speaker 2>signaling that you've accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in a very public way.</v>

1373
01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much,</v>

1374
01:13:32.671 --> 01:13:33.504
<v Speaker 2>much harder to apprentice yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sit down and do those 10,000 million </v>

1375
01:13:36.961 --> 01:13:38.730
<v Speaker 2>words or to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1376
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:39.833
<v Speaker 2>paint those pictures or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build those brick walls and really </v>

1377
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:47.640
<v Speaker 2>develop the pride of a skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1378
01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:49.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1379
01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:50.920
<v Speaker 2>the privates Gillen,</v>

1380
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.033
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your discipline and your focus allows </v>

1381
01:13:56.391 --> 01:14:00.170
<v Speaker 1>you to achieve these works at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things when they're done.</v>

1382
01:14:00.171 --> 01:14:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that feeling of satisfaction?</v>

1383
01:14:01.941 --> 01:14:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Like when you touch the back cover of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book for the first time and it's over.</v>

1384
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:07.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nothing.</v>

1385
01:14:07.031 --> 01:14:07.864
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing compared to when you hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>it echoed in the culture and you hear </v>

1386
01:14:11.501 --> 01:14:16.501
<v Speaker 2>people pick up the word snowflake and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear all these people say,</v>

1387
01:14:16.511 --> 01:14:21.511
<v Speaker 2>the first rule of blank is when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that you've kind of dictated the</v>

1388
01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:28.390
<v Speaker 2>semantics of the culture for a period </v>
<v Speaker 2>that feels like power.</v>

1389
01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:29.800
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1390
01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.053
<v Speaker 2>that's glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you found out that this guy ripped </v>

1391
01:14:35.591 --> 01:14:36.424
<v Speaker 2>you off,</v>

1392
01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:40.680
<v Speaker 2>we shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have suspicions before this?</v>

1393
01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1394
01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:42.893
<v Speaker 2>almost a year before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had an idea for a year and then </v>

1395
01:14:47.311 --> 01:14:49.690
<v Speaker 2>it was confirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was finally what,</v>

1396
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:51.720
<v Speaker 2>what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1397
01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:56.790
<v Speaker 2>a year ago I was supposed to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>receiving some significant payments from</v>

1398
01:14:56.791 --> 01:14:57.624
<v Speaker 2>this year's book and they never came </v>
<v Speaker 2>through and they still never came </v>

1399
01:15:00.271 --> 01:15:02.730
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every time I requested them,</v>

1400
01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:04.800
<v Speaker 2>the publisher said that they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid.</v>

1401
01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.293
<v Speaker 2>But the accountant said that there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical difficulties with wiring me </v>

1402
01:15:09.971 --> 01:15:14.280
<v Speaker 2>the money or he had personal problems in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his life caring for his mother.</v>

1403
01:15:14.730 --> 01:15:17.700
<v Speaker 2>And so there was always some reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>the money never came through.</v>

1404
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:19.630
<v Speaker 2>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1405
01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.293
<v Speaker 2>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told my agent I didn't want to do any </v>

1406
01:15:22.681 --> 01:15:24.990
<v Speaker 2>more deals until we had this money thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>resolved.</v>

1407
01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:27.960
<v Speaker 2>And at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the accountant,</v>

1408
01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.173
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a videotaped confession and his </v>

1409
01:15:31.461 --> 01:15:33.280
<v Speaker 2>sense of pled guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1410
01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.850
<v Speaker 2>and I believe his sentencing is it going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in November.</v>

1411
01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but according to the district attorney,</v>

1412
01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.450
<v Speaker 2>they can't seem to find any of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1413
01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:47.310
<v Speaker 2>So the money seems to be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kamasi's still,</v>

1414
01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of up in the air.</v>

1415
01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.513
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>initially they said it was 3.5 million </v>

1416
01:15:53.610 --> 01:15:56.310
<v Speaker 2>and now they're saying it could be as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as 25 million.</v>

1417
01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:59.910
<v Speaker 2>And this is from not just me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is from Mario Puzo,</v>

1418
01:15:59.911 --> 01:16:01.920
<v Speaker 2>his estate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man that wrote the Godfather,</v>

1419
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:05.940
<v Speaker 2>this is from a lot of different estates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The agency handled the estate of,</v>

1420
01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.213
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lillian Hellman and Jacquelynne Susanne </v>

1421
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:11.880
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of very big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big writers.</v>

1422
01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edward Gorey,</v>

1423
01:16:13.471 --> 01:16:16.020
<v Speaker 2>he wrote those creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful cartoon books.</v>

1424
01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different writers,</v>

1425
01:16:18.241 --> 01:16:19.980
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different estates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lost money.</v>

1426
01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.053
<v Speaker 2>So it was this guy doing this from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump or does this somewhere along the </v>

1427
01:16:23.521 --> 01:16:27.270
<v Speaker 2>line he lost his mind and nobody really </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>

1428
01:16:27.570 --> 01:16:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1440
01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1441

<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

1442
01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.470
<v Speaker 2>He's waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got here way early though,</v>

1443
01:16:58.471 --> 01:16:59.304
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1444
01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:01.340
<v Speaker 2>That was the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has got some work to do before.</v>

1445
01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:02.213
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1446
01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:05.040
<v Speaker 2>He's probably in the tank right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope.</v>

1447
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Student tents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1448
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't believe I fucked up that original.</v>

1449
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:09.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1450
01:17:09.471 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to look</v>

1451
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.260
<v Speaker 1>to see if anyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

1452
01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I really thought it was attributed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1453
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:16.730
<v Speaker 1>but that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1454
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.340
<v Speaker 1>my fucked up brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's intense though.</v>

1455
01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Kind of creeps me out with the intensity</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

1456
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:24.790
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifts,</v>

1457
01:17:24.791 --> 01:17:26.710
<v Speaker 1>these written like guts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:28.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choke.</v>

1459
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple other ones.</v>

1460
01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.520
<v Speaker 1>What was the one where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1461
01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>someone turn into a Werewolf on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>airplane?</v>

1462
01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that was from his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1463
01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.790
<v Speaker 1>collection of horror stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one,</v>

1464
01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:46.791
<v Speaker 1>the alien on the cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1465
01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:50.250
<v Speaker 1>the process though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like survivor.</v>

1466
01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:55.490
<v Speaker 1>He's so perfectly designed for being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>

1467
01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:57.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

1468
01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.253
<v Speaker 1>one of the more fascinating things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast is getting to pick the </v>

1469
01:18:00.241 --> 01:18:01.074
<v Speaker 1>brain of someone like him and however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when would you ever have two plus hours </v>

1470
01:18:06.991 --> 01:18:11.991
<v Speaker 1>to sit down with a guy like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just find out how he thinks about shit?</v>

1471
01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1472
01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:15.063
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is it?</v>

1473
01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:16.163
<v Speaker 1>You know how he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's never going to let you in like </v>

1474
01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:19.224
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the weirder things about </v>

1475
01:18:20.941 --> 01:18:24.300
<v Speaker 1>podcasts is that for three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the time is,</v>

1476
01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:26.490
<v Speaker 1>the phones go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1477
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:27.383
<v Speaker 1>you're wearing headsets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I try to encourage people to wear </v>

1478
01:18:29.281 --> 01:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>it now because for awhile I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1479
01:18:30.871 --> 01:18:31.830
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you want.</v>

1480
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:34.920
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about the headset </v>
<v Speaker 1>that locks you in.</v>

1481
01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Your voice is exactly the same level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound as my voices.</v>

1482
01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Cause there it's all coming through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>headsets so it's all combined.</v>

1483
01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:46.650
<v Speaker 1>So you're much more aware of talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>over each other and shit like that.</v>

1484
01:18:46.651 --> 01:18:47.484
<v Speaker 1>But you're also much more aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing else going on that the </v>

1485
01:18:50.881 --> 01:18:52.860
<v Speaker 1>sound of your voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1486
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:53.783
<v Speaker 1>it's by isolating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by putting the headset on and or </v>

1487
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:58.440
<v Speaker 1>eliminating the outside noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would never be able to,</v>

1488
01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you'd never be able to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with a guy like that.</v>

1489
01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Like that's gotten this deep into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1490
01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was going to hit.</v>

1491
01:19:07.011 --> 01:19:08.850
<v Speaker 1>The depth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depth of everything.</v>

1492
01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:09.843
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Background in journalism is probably </v>

1493
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.430
<v Speaker 1>where that's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his appreciation for darkness too.</v>

1494
01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:16.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like his appreciation for that story of </v>

1495
01:19:18.451 --> 01:19:20.070
<v Speaker 1>the little girl jerk and the GRANDPA.</v>

1496
01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.233
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a always back gotta stop talking </v>

1497
01:19:25.081 --> 01:19:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Shit about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel better.</v>

1498
01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Some of this podcast makes people p </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricky on his coffee.</v>

1499
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:34.103
<v Speaker 1>That's it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've developed a superhuman bladder </v>

1500
01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:40.020
<v Speaker 1>occasionally though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to get up occasionally.</v>

1501
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so back to this dude ripping you off,</v>

1502
01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.140
<v Speaker 1>this guy who is your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1503
01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:51.750
<v Speaker 1>so they don't know where the fuck the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money is and now they don't and he's not</v>

1504
01:19:51.751 --> 01:19:53.370
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1505
01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:54.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he hasn't really talked about </v>

1506
01:19:55.981 --> 01:19:56.814
<v Speaker 1>where the money has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first they thought there was some </v>

1507
01:19:58.081 --> 01:20:00.930
<v Speaker 1>dummy corporations and they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover the money.</v>

1508
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.393
<v Speaker 1>So we were all looking for a big payday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now the DA says they cannot the </v>

1509
01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:08.094
<v Speaker 1>money</v>

1510
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:10.990
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't want to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1511
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.260
<v Speaker 2>or he's saying the money is spent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

1512
01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:15.030
<v Speaker 2>Don't you want to torture him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1513
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you want someone to torture him?</v>

1514
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so sweet.</v>

1515
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:21.413
<v Speaker 2>It's so sweet because I've had readers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>readers offer the torture him to kill </v>

1516
01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:29.100
<v Speaker 2>him and they say they'll do it free of </v>
<v Speaker 2>charge.</v>

1517
01:20:29.101 --> 01:20:31.590
<v Speaker 2>So apparently these are people who kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of do it for a living.</v>

1518
01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So damn,</v>

1519
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I need to make a list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1520
01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:38.253
<v Speaker 2>Like me to get some free killings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to have to be some people I </v>

1521
01:20:40.351 --> 01:20:42.870
<v Speaker 2>really don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want the money first.</v>

1522
01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:43.883
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to just kill some money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to make sure you get that money </v>

1523
01:20:45.361 --> 01:20:46.194
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it's sitting in coffee cans </v>

1524
01:20:47.101 --> 01:20:48.990
<v Speaker 2>buried in the Nevada desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1525
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between you and me,</v>

1526
01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:52.710
<v Speaker 2>I really don't care.</v>

1527
01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.850
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1528
01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:54.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1529
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.850
<v Speaker 2>I really am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously not somebody,</v>

1530
01:20:57.090 --> 01:20:59.370
<v Speaker 2>it would've given me a little more </v>
<v Speaker 2>wiggle room.</v>

1531
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be writing so frantically on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next book,</v>

1532
01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I could maybe take a little time off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1533
01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:09.060
<v Speaker 2>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1534
01:21:09.061 --> 01:21:11.760
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what the hell?</v>

1535
01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your health,</v>

1536
01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:17.160
<v Speaker 2>you have a million ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great ideas,</v>

1537
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:20.670
<v Speaker 2>a great profession that you love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're involved in it right now.</v>

1538
01:21:20.671 --> 01:21:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Currently I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in the process,</v>

1539
01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:25.710
<v Speaker 2>all these projects and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1540
01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:28.320
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really lost any of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I really love.</v>

1541
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:29.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad is dead,</v>

1542
01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:32.730
<v Speaker 2>my mother's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think after your parents are dead,</v>

1543
01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:36.480
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot that can hurt you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>much except,</v>

1544
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:38.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course the death of a child.</v>

1545
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.110
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1546
01:21:40.111 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1547
01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:45.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bulletproof after those things.</v>

1548
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:46.913
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real issue that happens with </v>

1549
01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:50.430
<v Speaker 2>successful people is they lose their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunger,</v>

1550
01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lose that.</v>

1551
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:54.150
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a death sentence for comedians.</v>

1552
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:55.253
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that happens with </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians is the early specials tend to </v>

1553
01:21:57.631 --> 01:21:58.464
<v Speaker 2>be really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the later specials tend to be </v>

1554
01:22:00.301 --> 01:22:01.134
<v Speaker 2>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because these people are now </v>

1555
01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:08.370
<v Speaker 2>super wealthy and coddled and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>danger in their life and there's no,</v>

1556
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:11.790
<v Speaker 2>no real risk or challenges and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no growing or learning.</v>

1557
01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Everything is just like performing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that adore you.</v>

1558
01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Another aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I talk about this more and more with</v>

1559
01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:20.490
<v Speaker 2>writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1560
01:22:21.150 --> 01:22:23.820
<v Speaker 2>is it when you're starting out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a lot of downtime,</v>

1561
01:22:23.821 --> 01:22:26.460
<v Speaker 2>a lot of daydreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daydreaming time,</v>

1562
01:22:26.461 --> 01:22:31.461
<v Speaker 2>a lot of slack on structured time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the more successful you become,</v>

1563
01:22:32.401 --> 01:22:36.330
<v Speaker 2>the more your time is really scheduled </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just don't have those.</v>

1564
01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm really bored times when you tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with fantastic ideas,</v>

1565
01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.593
<v Speaker 2>and so in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being somewhat poor again gives me </v>

1566
01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:47.154
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does really slack times when the ideas </v>

1567
01:22:49.201 --> 01:22:52.230
<v Speaker 2>occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes a lot of sense.</v>

1568
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1569
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:56.670
<v Speaker 2>again to bring back to Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedians,</v>

1570
01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:57.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

1571
01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:01.050
<v Speaker 2>they get movie careers and it's another </v>
<v Speaker 2>death sentence for their comedy.</v>

1572
01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:03.570
<v Speaker 2>They start doing movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're on sets all day,</v>

1573
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.240
<v Speaker 2>they're constantly working and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have enough time to concentrate on</v>

1574
01:23:07.241 --> 01:23:08.074
<v Speaker 2>your standup and you have zero fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>around time cause you're just doing </v>

1575
01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:14.320
<v Speaker 2>things all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You lose that.</v>

1576
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:18.610
<v Speaker 2>This is weird namedrop be Brad Pitt </v>
<v Speaker 2>advice.</v>

1577
01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.073
<v Speaker 2>Brad Pitt told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brad Pitt said that success is actually </v>

1578
01:23:25.031 --> 01:23:25.864
<v Speaker 2>one of the failure is actually one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best things that can happen because </v>

1579
01:23:29.201 --> 01:23:32.710
<v Speaker 2>only failure gives you that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>alone isolation,</v>

1580
01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:38.400
<v Speaker 2>downtime when you can really reinvent </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself in a significant way and create</v>

1581
01:23:38.621 --> 01:23:43.621
<v Speaker 2>something remarkable again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ongoing success becomes kind of a,</v>

1582
01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mediocrity.</v>

1583
01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:48.483
<v Speaker 2>You really need to fail to fall out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the limelight long enough to produce </v>

1584
01:23:51.581 --> 01:23:52.930
<v Speaker 2>something really strong again.</v>

1585
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:55.363
<v Speaker 1>Totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the best things that can happen </v>

1586
01:23:57.501 --> 01:24:02.501
<v Speaker 1>to a comedian is bombing when you bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That feeling is so bad.</v>

1587
01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.320
<v Speaker 1>I was describing as like sucking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand Dick's in front of your mother.</v>

1588
01:24:07.670 --> 01:24:08.503
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is the differences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably someone out there who </v>

1589
01:24:10.521 --> 01:24:12.680
<v Speaker 1>would enjoy suck a thousand Dick's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of their mother,</v>

1590
01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.800
<v Speaker 1>but nobody enjoys bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably worse than that.</v>

1591
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.903
<v Speaker 1>But that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is reignites your </v>

1592
01:24:20.661 --> 01:24:25.661
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for people's attention span</v>
<v Speaker 1>your appreciation for tightening up your</v>

1593
01:24:26.811 --> 01:24:29.240
<v Speaker 1>delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your concepts,</v>

1594
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:31.220
<v Speaker 1>figuring out a better way to get them </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

1595
01:24:31.221 --> 01:24:32.054
<v Speaker 1>You never want to experience that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of the greatest moments in my </v>

1596
01:24:35.901 --> 01:24:39.530
<v Speaker 1>own personal journey of standup have </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from eating shit.</v>

1597
01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.470
<v Speaker 1>That's where they come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got each,</v>

1598
01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's great to do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful feels great.</v>

1599
01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:46.093
<v Speaker 1>But those eating shit ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the ones that get you to the </v>

1600
01:24:48.591 --> 01:24:49.010
<v Speaker 1>notebook.</v>

1601
01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:49.843
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the ones that reinvigorate </v>

1602
01:24:51.351 --> 01:24:52.184
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you spending hours and hours in </v>

1603
01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:57.520
<v Speaker 1>your hotel room going over sheets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper and checking out idea,</v>

1604
01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:58.373
<v Speaker 1>making sure these concepts connect </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in some sort of a meaningful </v>

1605
01:25:00.531 --> 01:25:02.120
<v Speaker 1>way and figuring out what tightened </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1606
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:03.163
<v Speaker 1>Cut out the fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're in this situation right now </v>

1607
01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:08.280
<v Speaker 1>and you're frantically writing now and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1608
01:25:08.281 --> 01:25:11.810
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of forced into this,</v>

1609
01:25:11.811 --> 01:25:13.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>element of creativity,</v>

1610
01:25:13.371 --> 01:25:14.510
<v Speaker 1>this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1611
01:25:14.511 --> 01:25:17.990
<v Speaker 1>you're forced to be hungry again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1612
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't wish it on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a way,</v>

1613
01:25:20.121 --> 01:25:21.530
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like it's kind of a gift?</v>

1614
01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1615
01:25:23.301 --> 01:25:24.134
<v Speaker 2>You in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to accept ultimately that </v>

1616
01:25:25.881 --> 01:25:26.714
<v Speaker 2>everything is a gift because it's always</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what they call cognitive </v>

1617
01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:34.250
<v Speaker 2>reframing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive reframing,</v>

1618
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:35.323
<v Speaker 2>whatever happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you reframe it in such a way that you </v>

1619
01:25:38.061 --> 01:25:40.370
<v Speaker 2>recognize the value of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1620
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:43.460
<v Speaker 2>and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of what happens,</v>

1621
01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:46.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before my father got murdered,</v>

1622
01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:49.460
<v Speaker 2>he had been asking me for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduction to what Nolan,</v>

1623
01:25:49.461 --> 01:25:54.461
<v Speaker 2>a writer in 1998 and I kept on thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not going to introduce my father to</v>

1624
01:25:55.671 --> 01:25:58.910
<v Speaker 2>one a writer because I know he's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hit on her.</v>

1625
01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:01.683
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't just going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>mortified to have dad hitting on Winona </v>

1626
01:26:04.311 --> 01:26:05.144
<v Speaker 2>on a rider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he'd always talk about how pretty </v>

1627
01:26:06.501 --> 01:26:09.680
<v Speaker 2>she was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any chance I can meet her and,</v>

1628
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:12.140
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to tell the truth,</v>

1629
01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.033
<v Speaker 2>when I got the word that my father had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been murdered by white supremacists to </v>

1630
01:26:15.690 --> 01:26:17.210
<v Speaker 2>the mountains of Idaho.</v>

1631
01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:18.660
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1632
01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:23.250
<v Speaker 2>One of my first thoughts was I'm off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hook without Wynona rider thing.</v>

1633
01:26:27.010 --> 01:26:27.260
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1634
01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:32.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's cognitive reframing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you had to do it all the time.</v>

1635
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:38.310
<v Speaker 2>That's glass half full right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long my father,</v>

1636
01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:42.790
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>

1637
01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:45.310
<v Speaker 2>none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of our relationships are completely</v>

1638
01:26:45.311 --> 01:26:46.700
<v Speaker 2>perfect all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1639
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:48.910
<v Speaker 1>It's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1640
01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's again,</v>

1641
01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:52.083
<v Speaker 1>the great thing about unchained writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you can express those ideas and </v>

1642
01:26:58.091 --> 01:26:58.924
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be my main concern about any </v>

1643
01:27:01.391 --> 01:27:02.224
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1644
01:27:02.670 --> 01:27:04.860
<v Speaker 1>a workshop or support group or any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

1645
01:27:04.861 --> 01:27:05.694
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of group of like minded peers </v>

1646
01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.920
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't understand that and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would want you to limit your language.</v>

1647
01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't compute.</v>

1648
01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the platonic world,</v>

1649
01:27:20.411 --> 01:27:22.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody should kind of get it.</v>

1650
01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:26.020
<v Speaker 2>But unless you're ruffling feathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even within workshop,</v>

1651
01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.900
<v Speaker 2>you're not going far enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1652
01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I loved riding that line in Fight Club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1653
01:27:32.291 --> 01:27:34.870
<v Speaker 2>where tyler and Marla have sex for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time.</v>

1654
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:38.260
<v Speaker 2>And then the most romantic thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Marla can say is,</v>

1655
01:27:38.261 --> 01:27:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I want to have your baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is the inverse?</v>

1656
01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:44.260
<v Speaker 2>So of course Marla turns to him and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1657
01:27:44.261 --> 01:27:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I hope I got pregnant because I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have your abortion.</v>

1658
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:53.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's the line that the movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>studio went around and around.</v>

1659
01:27:53.111 --> 01:27:54.550
<v Speaker 2>And even Brad Pitt said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1660
01:27:54.551 --> 01:27:59.380
<v Speaker 2>my mom's going to see this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want her to see this line.</v>

1661
01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:04.240
<v Speaker 2>And they shot that scene with so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different substitute lines.</v>

1662
01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:08.290
<v Speaker 2>And then finally fincher wrote the line </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Helena Bonham Carter says,</v>

1663
01:28:08.291 --> 01:28:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been fuck like that since </v>
<v Speaker 2>grade school.</v>

1664
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:13.630
<v Speaker 2>And at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20th Century Fox said,</v>

1665
01:28:13.631 --> 01:28:14.464
<v Speaker 2>can we switch it back to the abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so unless you're always kind of </v>

1666
01:28:22.981 --> 01:28:27.030
<v Speaker 2>pushing to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1667
01:28:27.690 --> 01:28:28.523
<v Speaker 2>until you get some push back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel like you're pushing hard </v>

1668
01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:34.290
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so push back is not a bad thing.</v>

1669
01:28:34.291 --> 01:28:36.870
<v Speaker 2>It's just kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's proof that you're doing your job.</v>

1670
01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Does it trend that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putting</v>

1671
01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:41.370
<v Speaker 1>down though this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1672
01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.230
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pushback is coming far quicker than</v>

1673
01:28:44.231 --> 01:28:47.020
<v Speaker 1>it ever has before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a trend now to,</v>

1674
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:52.070
<v Speaker 1>to limit language and limit creativity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just limit the subject matter,</v>

1675
01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:56.920
<v Speaker 1>trigger warnings and stop people from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1676
01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.250
<v Speaker 1>it stopped people from experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that might be disturbing.</v>

1677
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:03.173
<v Speaker 1>And I could see both sides of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because on one hand we've got a </v>

1678
01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:06.864
<v Speaker 1>generation that has been exposed to so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much sensationalistic stuff in order to </v>

1679
01:29:11.341 --> 01:29:12.174
<v Speaker 1>attain their attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've really been overloaded with the </v>

1680
01:29:15.121 --> 01:29:18.770
<v Speaker 1>most extreme versions of everything in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to get there,</v>

1681
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:19.673
<v Speaker 1>their ticket money or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've really been pounded by so much </v>

1682
01:29:23.341 --> 01:29:24.174
<v Speaker 1>stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see them kind of really pulling </v>

1683
01:29:26.131 --> 01:29:28.770
<v Speaker 1>back and wanting to be monastic for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of their lives.</v>

1684
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see them as being a,</v>

1685
01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:35.773
<v Speaker 1>as wanting to sort of counter dominate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to just create room enough in </v>

1686
01:29:39.951 --> 01:29:43.160
<v Speaker 1>the world for their statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1687
01:29:43.190 --> 01:29:44.023
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're moving into a world that's </v>

1688
01:29:44.901 --> 01:29:49.901
<v Speaker 1>already so occupied by attention getters</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they can shut some down,</v>

1689
01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:53.000
<v Speaker 1>there might be room for their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>

1690
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:54.583
<v Speaker 1>So I kinda see benefit on both sides and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way to there they're dominating </v>

1691
01:29:59.751 --> 01:30:03.170
<v Speaker 1>their teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good because it's this in a way</v>

1692
01:30:03.171 --> 01:30:04.004
<v Speaker 1>of exploring your own power and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and figuring out what you can do in the </v>

1693
01:30:07.491 --> 01:30:11.900
<v Speaker 1>world and that you can have a effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have agency.</v>

1694
01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:14.840
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think it's a totally bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1695
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:16.710
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1696
01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.593
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that damn dominating their </v>

1697
01:30:18.981 --> 01:30:22.130
<v Speaker 1>teachers is in some way good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having the,</v>

1698
01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:23.293
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly gives you confidence and </v>

1699
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:31.520
<v Speaker 1>lets you understand that you can affect </v>
<v Speaker 1>change even if it's meaningless.</v>

1700
01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.353
<v Speaker 1>Changed you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you pay attention to what happened </v>

1701
01:30:33.861 --> 01:30:35.220
<v Speaker 1>in Evergreen state?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In,</v>

1702
01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.340
<v Speaker 1>in Washington?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Did you see when there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people don't know the story.</v>

1704
01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:41.653
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bret Weinstein story where the </v>

1705
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:47.300
<v Speaker 1>students decided that there was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a day of absence.</v>

1706
01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Traditionally it had been where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>of color stayed home just so that people</v>

1707
01:30:51.231 --> 01:30:55.310
<v Speaker 1>could recognize the important part that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they play in the culture and society.</v>

1708
01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:56.413
<v Speaker 1>But then they had ramped it up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided white people are going to have </v>

1709
01:30:58.611 --> 01:31:00.470
<v Speaker 1>to stay home now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

1710
01:31:00.471 --> 01:31:01.304
<v Speaker 1>that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the whole thing went crazy and went </v>

1711
01:31:03.321 --> 01:31:04.154
<v Speaker 1>haywire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

1712
01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:07.490
<v Speaker 1>the schools basically fallen apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1713
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:08.383
<v Speaker 1>but there was a scene that was filmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the president of the university </v>

1714
01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:15.910
<v Speaker 1>was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1715
01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:16.933
<v Speaker 1>the president of college was in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>auditorium and he was addressing these </v>

1716
01:31:19.761 --> 01:31:20.594
<v Speaker 1>children and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they told him to stop moving his hands </v>

1717
01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.490
<v Speaker 1>because it was threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he put his hands down,</v>

1718
01:31:28.491 --> 01:31:30.530
<v Speaker 1>he put them behind his back and they all</v>
<v Speaker 1>started laughing.</v>

1719
01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1720
01:31:33.911 --> 01:31:36.010
<v Speaker 1>this dumb fuck like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1721
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:41.070
<v Speaker 1>this guy's running this university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he let them tell him not to move his</v>

1722
01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:43.450
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gesturing is you speaking.</v>

1723
01:31:43.451 --> 01:31:44.290
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the ones,</v>

1724
01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:47.830
<v Speaker 1>one of the most nonthreatening Beta </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the planet?</v>

1725
01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:48.933
<v Speaker 1>And this guy is just giving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wants to keep his job and try to </v>

1726
01:31:51.641 --> 01:31:54.850
<v Speaker 1>silence this mob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this angry horde of,</v>

1727
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:56.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking kids.</v>

1728
01:31:56.950 --> 01:32:01.420
<v Speaker 1>They're kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when he and puts his hands down,</v>

1729
01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I probably watched it 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all start laughing,</v>

1730
01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:06.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>

1731
01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it just demonstrates how </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperately they want a stronger leader.</v>

1732
01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want,</v>

1733
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:13.343
<v Speaker 2>they don't respect their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to learn from somebody who </v>

1734
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:20.760
<v Speaker 2>is a college professor and has never </v>
<v Speaker 2>really attained anything in the world.</v>

1735
01:32:20.761 --> 01:32:23.670
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want to become another </v>
<v Speaker 2>cog in that same kind of,</v>

1736
01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

1737
01:32:25.770 --> 01:32:26.603
<v Speaker 2>they want to learn from somebody the </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect and whose attainments the they </v>

1738
01:32:31.711 --> 01:32:35.030
<v Speaker 2>respect whose achievements they respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>where that's probably right.</v>

1739
01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Part of the issue of universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1740
01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Is it these professors are so terrified </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reactions of the students,</v>

1741
01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.433
<v Speaker 1>which is not the place you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be with a mentor student </v>

1742
01:32:46.901 --> 01:32:49.540
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not supposed to be that way.</v>

1743
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:52.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mentor desperately needs the student</v>

1744
01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:53.953
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you see that sometimes in private </v>

1745
01:32:54.821 --> 01:32:58.090
<v Speaker 1>schools with rich kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they treat their teachers like shit.</v>

1746
01:32:58.091 --> 01:33:00.730
<v Speaker 1>And the teachers have to bite their </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue and cause they,</v>

1747
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:03.070
<v Speaker 1>they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now this is not,</v>

1748
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:04.833
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1749
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:09.850
<v Speaker 1>it's not the normal dynamic that exists </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the older wise person and the young</v>

1750
01:33:09.851 --> 01:33:10.684
<v Speaker 1>person who's trying to learn from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that deeply respects not that </v>

1751
01:33:13.091 --> 01:33:13.924
<v Speaker 1>dynamic at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this old person who's weak and </v>

1752
01:33:16.961 --> 01:33:17.794
<v Speaker 1>wants to keep their job and is willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to tailor their own thoughts and ideas </v>

1753
01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:27.400
<v Speaker 1>to this irrational mob of social justice</v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors.</v>

1754
01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:29.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're seeing on campuses</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1755
01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:33.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professors calling for censorship and,</v>

1756
01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:35.170
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1757
01:33:35.230 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Speaker 1>to stop freedom of expression.</v>

1758
01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in college,</v>

1759
01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:43.170
<v Speaker 2>my favorite professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy Halverson,</v>

1760
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:46.320
<v Speaker 2>he was the John Houseman of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism school.</v>

1761
01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:50.550
<v Speaker 2>He was this old gray eminence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing made him happy.</v>

1762
01:33:50.551 --> 01:33:52.710
<v Speaker 2>You could never please this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1763
01:33:52.711 --> 01:33:55.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this John houseman paper chase guy.</v>

1764
01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Nothing was good enough and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1765
01:33:58.260 --> 01:33:59.093
<v Speaker 2>nothing would make him smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I worked my ass off to make him </v>

1766
01:34:03.001 --> 01:34:03.834
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I finally got an a in one of his </v>

1767
01:34:05.281 --> 01:34:06.114
<v Speaker 2>courses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he is about the only professor I </v>

1768
01:34:09.031 --> 01:34:09.864
<v Speaker 2>remember out of my entire four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this man that just didn't take </v>

1769
01:34:14.341 --> 01:34:15.330
<v Speaker 2>shit from anybody.</v>

1770
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:17.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This the dynamic of the kid being in </v>

1771
01:34:21.601 --> 01:34:23.880
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for the kid either.</v>

1772
01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:26.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they get out of school,</v>

1773
01:34:26.851 --> 01:34:27.684
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be baffled and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna look for that power in other </v>

1774
01:34:30.511 --> 01:34:31.344
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that power that they enjoyed in the </v>

1775
01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:35.520
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're seeing that spill off.</v>

1776
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.370
<v Speaker 1>You seen that spill out into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1777
01:34:38.371 --> 01:34:39.204
<v Speaker 1>social media and different forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>activism when people trying to re </v>

1778
01:34:43.501 --> 01:34:47.520
<v Speaker 1>achieve that power that they had and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of forcing people to their will.</v>

1779
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:48.833
<v Speaker 1>And in a way it's kind of a farm camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a few of those people will </v>

1780
01:34:52.051 --> 01:34:52.884
<v Speaker 1>achieve that power and they will be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of leverage that power to </v>

1781
01:34:55.951 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 1>something more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something</v>

1782
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.480
<v Speaker 2>larger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those will be the,</v>

1783
01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:00.323
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next generation of leaders that </v>

1784
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:02.114
<v Speaker 2>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this isn't a way a laboratory where </v>

1785
01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:05.773
<v Speaker 2>we're leaders are taking form and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of them we'll just kind of filter </v>

1786
01:35:09.861 --> 01:35:12.050
<v Speaker 2>down into whatever jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever careers.</v>

1787
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:13.123
<v Speaker 2>But there will always have their kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>glory days when they say to remember </v>

1788
01:35:15.201 --> 01:35:17.810
<v Speaker 2>that time we shut down the ROTC </v>
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>

1789
01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that will seem like a,</v>

1790
01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:23.060
<v Speaker 2>a big glorious past to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that will be enough.</v>

1791
01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:26.840
<v Speaker 2>What's causing all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exam,</v>

1792
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:28.550
<v Speaker 2>if you thought about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why,</v>

1793
01:35:28.551 --> 01:35:31.460
<v Speaker 2>why is this ramping up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it seems like it is.</v>

1794
01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:38.513
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1795
01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:40.413
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on one level it is a disillusionment </v>

1796
01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:44.433
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1797
01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:47.930
<v Speaker 2>the goals of the baby boomers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so many people have seen their,</v>

1798
01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:48.773
<v Speaker 2>their parents achieve what they thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to make them happy with the </v>

1799
01:35:52.541 --> 01:35:53.374
<v Speaker 2>houses and the trips and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the careers and the possessions and the </v>

1800
01:35:56.831 --> 01:36:00.460
<v Speaker 2>wives and the second wives and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the step siblings.</v>

1801
01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:02.073
<v Speaker 2>And they're seeing their parents get </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that they want and still not </v>

1802
01:36:04.991 --> 01:36:05.824
<v Speaker 2>be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you see a generation that's kind </v>

1803
01:36:08.621 --> 01:36:10.150
<v Speaker 2>of floundering thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1804
01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:14.080
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what's going to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>them happy.</v>

1805
01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going to make me </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

1806
01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:19.620
<v Speaker 2>And so people were really distrustful of</v>
<v Speaker 2>advertisements.</v>

1807
01:36:19.621 --> 01:36:21.190
<v Speaker 2>It tell them what's gonna make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

1808
01:36:21.730 --> 01:36:23.740
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1809
01:36:23.741 --> 01:36:27.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a struggle,</v>

1810
01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:30.070
<v Speaker 2>a big everyone in blind in the dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1811
01:36:31.570 --> 01:36:32.470
<v Speaker 2>So just,</v>

1812
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:38.990
<v Speaker 2>just a reaction to what they see that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ineffective.</v>

1813
01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:39.853
<v Speaker 2>What did they see this going wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they're choosing to embrace a </v>

1814
01:36:43.791 --> 01:36:45.620
<v Speaker 2>different group of values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1815
01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Well and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't,</v>

1816
01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:47.953
<v Speaker 2>not even sure even that new group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>values kind of dictated to them with a </v>

1817
01:36:51.831 --> 01:36:55.780
<v Speaker 2>lot of preexisting language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't,</v>

1818
01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I think ultimately that's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be very fulfilling either.</v>

1819
01:36:58.700 --> 01:36:59.533
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be something that emerges </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a kind of lymphoid laboratory like </v>

1820
01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:05.084
<v Speaker 2>burning man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kind of fringe things that are </v>

1821
01:37:07.971 --> 01:37:09.890
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1822
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:11.203
<v Speaker 2>as Victor Turner would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are all kinds of experiments in </v>

1823
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:18.110
<v Speaker 2>how to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1824
01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:18.973
<v Speaker 2>that's what fight club was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just this kind of experiment in how </v>

1825
01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:24.050
<v Speaker 2>interaction could be structured in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>

1826
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:25.423
<v Speaker 2>And these things take place in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a playful environments like </v>

1827
01:37:28.851 --> 01:37:31.540
<v Speaker 2>burning man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cacophony society used to,</v>

1828
01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.060
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1829
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:37.490
<v Speaker 2>and they're fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the ones that are the most fun,</v>

1830
01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:40.460
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be the ones that are perpetuated.</v>

1831
01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Burning man is fun and that is why </v>
<v Speaker 2>burning man has existed for 30 years and</v>

1832
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:50.690
<v Speaker 2>occupy was not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we had one occupy.</v>

1833
01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.080
<v Speaker 2>And I know people are going to be pissed</v>
<v Speaker 2>off about that,</v>

1834
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every year burning</v>

1835
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.873
<v Speaker 1>man is bigger and it's funner and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go there and every year we don't </v>

1836
01:38:00.631 --> 01:38:01.464
<v Speaker 1>have another occupy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't know if that's a valid </v>

1837
01:38:04.891 --> 01:38:05.724
<v Speaker 1>comparison cause occupy was infiltrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by cops and the FBI and they pretended </v>

1838
01:38:10.231 --> 01:38:11.064
<v Speaker 1>to be protestors and sat amongst them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole thing was kind of </v>

1839
01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:14.893
<v Speaker 1>misguided in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas what burning man is is a </v>

1840
01:38:17.461 --> 01:38:20.070
<v Speaker 1>complete removal of these people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1841
01:38:20.071 --> 01:38:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean they decided to meet and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most hostile climates in the world.</v>

1842
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:26.400
<v Speaker 1>And there's something about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recognition that you're out there in</v>

1843
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:27.234
<v Speaker 1>the desert with a fucking mask over your</v>
<v Speaker 1>face and you're dancing with dirty </v>

1844
01:38:29.731 --> 01:38:30.564
<v Speaker 1>underwear on and then all these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing it together and then half of </v>

1845
01:38:33.421 --> 01:38:38.040
<v Speaker 1>them are fucked out of their mind on </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and you're not against something,</v>

1846
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you're not protesting something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're there to create,</v>

1847
01:38:40.591 --> 01:38:42.000
<v Speaker 1>celebrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate,</v>

1848
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:43.050
<v Speaker 1>contribute something.</v>

1849
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1850
01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:46.313
<v Speaker 1>In the protests also at occupy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them were misinformed and they </v>

1851
01:38:50.101 --> 01:38:52.830
<v Speaker 1>didn't really understand the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're protesting against.</v>

1852
01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a very funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1853
01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:55.913
<v Speaker 1>famous video with Peter Schiff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's been on this podcast before as a </v>

1854
01:38:59.611 --> 01:39:01.440
<v Speaker 1>financial wizard who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1855
01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:05.820
<v Speaker 1>was set up shop there with a $5,000 suit</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1856
01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.430
<v Speaker 1>And he basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the 1%,</v>

1857
01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:09.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask me questions.</v>

1858
01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.033
<v Speaker 1>And he interviewed these kids who they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would tell him what's wrong with the </v>

1859
01:39:13.951 --> 01:39:15.280
<v Speaker 1>world and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1860
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:16.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the imbalance of finances and financial </v>

1861
01:39:21.571 --> 01:39:22.404
<v Speaker 1>inequity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just didn't understand what </v>

1862
01:39:24.421 --> 01:39:25.254
<v Speaker 1>they were upset about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would explain to them how </v>

1863
01:39:27.241 --> 01:39:30.150
<v Speaker 1>capitalism actually works and how he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>employing all these people.</v>

1864
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why he makes so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

1865
01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:34.410
<v Speaker 1>cause he employs so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he wasn't doing this,</v>

1866
01:39:34.411 --> 01:39:35.460
<v Speaker 1>these people would be out of work.</v>

1867
01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:36.293
<v Speaker 1>You understand that I'm creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you can create something </v>

1868
01:39:38.221 --> 01:39:40.410
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can create a business and you can,</v>

1869
01:39:40.411 --> 01:39:41.244
<v Speaker 1>if you work hard and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's going over these and you could </v>

1870
01:39:43.831 --> 01:39:48.600
<v Speaker 1>see that what they're fighting against </v>
<v Speaker 1>is almost like a concept.</v>

1871
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:49.793
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting against this I idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this evil tyranny that's controlling </v>

1872
01:39:54.931 --> 01:39:58.410
<v Speaker 1>their fate where they really don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it though.</v>

1873
01:39:59.330 --> 01:40:02.330
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what occupy was in my opinion.</v>

1874
01:40:02.331 --> 01:40:04.800
<v Speaker 1>It was like they knew something was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1875
01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:08.610
<v Speaker 1>It was almost to me like white blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells surrounding an infection,</v>

1876
01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:09.773
<v Speaker 1>like there's something fucked up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just surround this thing and </v>

1877
01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:15.510
<v Speaker 1>figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the swelling and pus and that's</v>

1878
01:40:15.511 --> 01:40:16.344
<v Speaker 1>really what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a real recognition </v>

1879
01:40:18.541 --> 01:40:21.660
<v Speaker 1>that is a gigantic problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial institutions.</v>

1880
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.823
<v Speaker 1>The gigantic problem with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole reason why the economy </v>

1881
01:40:25.741 --> 01:40:26.574
<v Speaker 1>collapsed and the bailouts and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking creeps are getting all these </v>

1882
01:40:30.181 --> 01:40:31.770
<v Speaker 1>bonuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the the,</v>

1883
01:40:31.771 --> 01:40:35.880
<v Speaker 1>their companies failed and the tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars had a rescue them.</v>

1884
01:40:36.450 --> 01:40:37.283
<v Speaker 1>There was a recognition that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong but not a deep </v>

1885
01:40:39.991 --> 01:40:44.040
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what the system was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were actually protesting.</v>

1886
01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:45.173
<v Speaker 1>There was too much of that burning man </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any of that burning man is </v>

1887
01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 1>obviously society's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no arguments that it's not even</v>

1888
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:56.230
<v Speaker 2>if it's better than it's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

1889
01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:57.730
<v Speaker 2>which it probably is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1890
01:40:57.731 --> 01:40:58.564
<v Speaker 2>if you want to listen to pinker or a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of other people that will argue that </v>

1891
01:41:01.481 --> 01:41:02.314
<v Speaker 2>it's better and it's progressing into </v>
<v Speaker 2>this better and better path and I think </v>

1892
01:41:05.341 --> 01:41:09.700
<v Speaker 2>that's probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately it's still fucked and burning</v>

1893
01:41:09.701 --> 01:41:10.534
<v Speaker 2>man offers this alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this unique society of free </v>

1894
01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:19.870
<v Speaker 2>expression and free love and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people having a good time together,</v>

1895
01:41:19.871 --> 01:41:21.820
<v Speaker 2>exploring alternate states of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

1896
01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Well Victor Turner who talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>these lumoid events,</v>

1897
01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:27.093
<v Speaker 2>it would say things like burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also provide an outlet for people </v>

1898
01:41:29.861 --> 01:41:34.730
<v Speaker 2>to self select to leave the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>

1899
01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.040
<v Speaker 2>they're killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1900
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.903
<v Speaker 2>people who just don't fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they die or they express themselves so </v>

1901
01:41:40.871 --> 01:41:41.704
<v Speaker 2>much that they can go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary postal carrier life that they </v>

1902
01:41:45.521 --> 01:41:46.354
<v Speaker 2>had before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because so many cultures have something </v>

1903
01:41:47.981 --> 01:41:52.981
<v Speaker 2>like a Samba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a festival where you go crazy for a week</v>

1904
01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:57.370
<v Speaker 2>and then you go back to your normal life</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting tables.</v>

1905
01:41:57.730 --> 01:42:01.990
<v Speaker 2>So they are in a way an event that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of keeps the status quo in place.</v>

1906
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:08.070
<v Speaker 2>But they do create these kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not aesthetic movements,</v>

1907
01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:09.273
<v Speaker 2>they are the dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our laboratory for sort of coming up </v>

1908
01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:15.190
<v Speaker 2>with some new form of being together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some new social structure,</v>

1909
01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:18.550
<v Speaker 2>new symbols and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1910
01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:21.340
<v Speaker 2>new narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1911
01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.233
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating thing for me because </v>

1912
01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.233
<v Speaker 2>I feel it's trickled off into regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and a lot of ways now I know way </v>

1913
01:42:28.691 --> 01:42:33.070
<v Speaker 2>more people that are microdosing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>silicide been on a daily basis.</v>

1914
01:42:33.370 --> 01:42:34.203
<v Speaker 2>People were more access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially now that marijuana's legal </v>

1915
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:38.583
<v Speaker 2>people are way more accepting of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting high of people just choosing to </v>

1916
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.633
<v Speaker 2>sort of look at the world in a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>way and actively seek these different </v>

1917
01:42:52.061 --> 01:42:54.340
<v Speaker 2>states of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way more common.</v>

1918
01:42:54.341 --> 01:42:55.174
<v Speaker 2>It's way more discussed and that's kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the way it's supposed to be is that </v>

1919
01:42:58.151 --> 01:42:58.984
<v Speaker 2>these things start in the experiments </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the ones that are most successful </v>

1920
01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:04.510
<v Speaker 2>become institutions.</v>

1921
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the new ones start,</v>

1922
01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:09.263
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need know these are the </v>

1923
01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:12.940
<v Speaker 2>laboratories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland kind of used to be that way.</v>

1924
01:43:12.941 --> 01:43:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Portland was such a laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incubator city,</v>

1925
01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.130
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cost of living is,</v>

1926
01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:21.160
<v Speaker 2>is killing that very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become really trendy.</v>

1927
01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:22.593
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1928
01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:25.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a hip place to live.</v>

1929
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:30.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a hip and it's identified with hip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1930
01:43:30.250 --> 01:43:32.920
<v Speaker 2>in a way you kind of get your hip card </v>
<v Speaker 2>just by living there.</v>

1931
01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:36.670
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do anything anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like New York City's to be like,</v>

1932
01:43:36.671 --> 01:43:37.660
<v Speaker 2>you were tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1934

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1935
01:43:40.930 --> 01:43:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1936
01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:43.330

1937
01:43:46.990 --> 01:43:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that where you live?</v>

1938
01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I live outside of Portland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

1939
01:43:53.170 --> 01:43:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I live up in the Columbia Gorge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gorgeous up there,</v>

1940
01:43:55.701 --> 01:43:56.480
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1941

<v Speaker 2>Do you guys have a neon glowing?</v>

1942
01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It rains all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Green in Oregon.</v>

1943
01:44:02.991 --> 01:44:05.330
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't experience here for more than a</v>

1944
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.840
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A year.</v>

1945
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got forest fires right now.</v>

1946
01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:08.360
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1947
01:44:08.361 --> 01:44:10.040
<v Speaker 2>do you where you are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1948
01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:12.350
<v Speaker 2>not so much this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not so close,</v>

1949
01:44:12.351 --> 01:44:15.110
<v Speaker 2>but the air is still much worse than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is here.</v>

1950
01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:17.930
<v Speaker 2>So fucking forest fires are everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1951
01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I've been evacuated a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty terrifying stuff.</v>

1952
01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you like at Georgia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1953
01:44:23.151 --> 01:44:23.841
<v Speaker 2>I live here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1954
01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:24.674
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1955
01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why just say Georgia?</v>

1956
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Somebody told you whisper like no one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>

1957
01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why.</v>

1958
01:44:33.351 --> 01:44:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Have a secret friendship with Jim Goad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's one of the few people who makes me</v>

1959
01:44:36.771 --> 01:44:40.010
<v Speaker 2>really laugh even though you know most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the secret anymore.</v>

1960
01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Most of the world that hates Jim Code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do they hate gym goad?</v>

1961
01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:44.233
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he writes these very </v>

1962
01:44:45.381 --> 01:44:50.381
<v Speaker 2>transgressive in your face pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when he writes about his brother,</v>

1963
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:53.980
<v Speaker 2>he kills me is some of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1964
01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:57.590
<v Speaker 2>touching stuff I've ever read in my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>about his brother's death.</v>

1965
01:44:58.100 --> 01:44:59.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1966
01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:02.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole world I think is so fooled and</v>

1967
01:45:02.811 --> 01:45:04.850
<v Speaker 2>that they think that Jim gold is a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1968
01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:05.893
<v Speaker 2>And they think that maybe I'm a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>person when it's just exactly the </v>

1969
01:45:08.901 --> 01:45:13.550
<v Speaker 2>opposite of how are you a bad person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1970
01:45:13.551 --> 01:45:17.690
<v Speaker 2>let's not even go down that road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already told on Cheryl strayed killing</v>

1971
01:45:17.691 --> 01:45:18.710
<v Speaker 2>that bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

1972
01:45:18.711 --> 01:45:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Do I got to do more?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not being a bad person.</v>

1973
01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.570
<v Speaker 2>That's a person who is appreciative of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark moment.</v>

1974
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:28.970
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make you a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1975
01:45:28.971 --> 01:45:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you really?</v>

1976
01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Give me an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1977
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:36.663
<v Speaker 2>and this is awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is another one of those </v>

1978
01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.740
<v Speaker 2>cognitive</v>

1979
01:45:41.410 --> 01:45:42.243
<v Speaker 2>reframing honesty things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I took care of my mother while she </v>

1980
01:45:46.121 --> 01:45:46.954
<v Speaker 2>was dying of lung cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even while I was taking care of her </v>

1981
01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:54.070
<v Speaker 2>and she was lapsing in and out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in her home,</v>

1982
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:55.833
<v Speaker 2>there was a little part of me that felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>is glee that thought I will never have </v>

1983
01:46:01.251 --> 01:46:05.330
<v Speaker 2>to worry about mom again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will never have to worry about whether</v>

1984
01:46:05.331 --> 01:46:06.164
<v Speaker 2>mom is offended by my work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will never have to worry about mom </v>

1985
01:46:09.681 --> 01:46:11.870
<v Speaker 2>falling down the stairs and breaking her</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg.</v>

1986
01:46:12.590 --> 01:46:16.250
<v Speaker 2>That this enormous concern in my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be resolved.</v>

1987
01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:17.933
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1988
01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:21.220
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be at the cost of </v>
<v Speaker 2>losing someone I love,</v>

1989
01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:23.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

1990
01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:29.580
<v Speaker 2>But the benefit is that this huge burden</v>
<v Speaker 2>of responsibility is going to be lifted.</v>

1991
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:33.970
<v Speaker 2>And so there was this kind of secret </v>
<v Speaker 2>glee thinking,</v>

1992
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:35.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

1993
01:46:35.051 --> 01:46:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have some freedom here that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never imagined.</v>

1994
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:40.123
<v Speaker 4>MMM.</v>

1995
01:46:40.690 --> 01:46:41.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nora Ephron touches on that in her work </v>

1996
01:46:43.811 --> 01:46:47.200
<v Speaker 2>when she talks about her mother's death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's just a,</v>

1997
01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:49.590
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an honest thing,</v>

1998
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a thing that makes you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>

1999
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that makes you a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

2000
01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:56.753
<v Speaker 1>I think that that makes you a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's honest about thoughts that are </v>

2001
01:47:00.421 --> 01:47:01.530
<v Speaker 1>very uncomfortable.</v>

2002
01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2003
01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:04.233
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is just something that people </v>

2004
01:47:05.471 --> 01:47:07.690
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all the time.</v>

2005
01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:08.553
<v Speaker 1>If they're dealing with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely incapacitated and they have </v>

2006
01:47:10.871 --> 01:47:12.340
<v Speaker 1>to care for them 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

2007
01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.690
<v Speaker 1>but they don't express it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2008
01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:19.853
<v Speaker 1>it's just a reality of the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's really sick or really </v>

2009
01:47:25.650 --> 01:47:26.990
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

2010
01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no getting around it.</v>

2011
01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good example.</v>

2012
01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:32.893
<v Speaker 1>I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need an example of why you are a bad </v>

2013
01:47:34.201 --> 01:47:35.034
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just really self critical and </v>

2014
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:41.590
<v Speaker 1>aware of things that other people could </v>
<v Speaker 1>take out of context of the,</v>

2015
01:47:41.591 --> 01:47:43.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the totality of your life.</v>

2016
01:47:43.710 --> 01:47:44.543
<v Speaker 1>And just use it as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put it in quotes and using it as an </v>

2017
01:47:47.401 --> 01:47:49.770
<v Speaker 1>example of you being a bad person.</v>

2018
01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:52.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another thing is I really,</v>

2019
01:47:52.921 --> 01:47:57.170
<v Speaker 2>really conflicted about the nature of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>

2020
01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:58.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea that in journalism school </v>

2021
01:48:00.271 --> 01:48:01.104
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call the theory seduce and betray </v>

2022
01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:04.680
<v Speaker 2>that when you go into an interview </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

2023
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:06.533
<v Speaker 2>your goal is to gain the trust of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and to get them to reveal </v>

2024
01:48:10.651 --> 01:48:11.484
<v Speaker 2>something very intimate that you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to betray by revealing to the </v>

2025
01:48:15.001 --> 01:48:16.710
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2026
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:18.060
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2027
01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:22.860
<v Speaker 2>you're just basically going in there to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to charm them and then to hurt them.</v>

2028
01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.713
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so much of my creative process is </v>

2029
01:48:27.781 --> 01:48:29.700
<v Speaker 2>that way because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2030
01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:34.000
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guts story [inaudible] the,</v>

2031
01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:37.470
<v Speaker 2>the story in which the guy puts the </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrot up his blood,</v>

2032
01:48:38.190 --> 01:48:39.023
<v Speaker 2>that was my best friend at the time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like late twenties and he got </v>

2033
01:48:44.341 --> 01:48:45.174
<v Speaker 2>fantastically drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he told me that carrot story and I </v>

2034
01:48:48.391 --> 01:48:52.950
<v Speaker 2>honestly believe he had never told </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody the carrot story.</v>

2035
01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:54.593
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept that story in my mind for you </v>

2036
01:48:56.441 --> 01:48:57.274
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 15 almost probably 20 years until I </v>

2037
01:49:00.181 --> 01:49:01.014
<v Speaker 2>found a way to put it with three similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories and make a larger piece out of </v>

2038
01:49:04.171 --> 01:49:07.890
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first time I read that story,</v>

2039
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:10.500
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't seen him in maybe a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2040
01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:11.363
<v Speaker 2>This friend and I look across this big </v>
<v Speaker 2>auditorium and there he is and I'm </v>

2041
01:49:16.591 --> 01:49:17.424
<v Speaker 2>telling his carrot story in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds and hundreds of people and the </v>

2042
01:49:21.871 --> 01:49:23.820
<v Speaker 2>look on his face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just stricken</v>

2043
01:49:26.590 --> 01:49:31.590
<v Speaker 1>and he hasn't talked to me sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why even even David,</v>

2044
01:49:34.461 --> 01:49:35.990
<v Speaker 1>did you use his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2045
01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Then fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2046
01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:38.803
<v Speaker 1>But what's wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do people still feel betrayed and get </v>

2047
01:49:41.961 --> 01:49:42.794
<v Speaker 1>over it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to hang out with more </v>

2048
01:49:43.971 --> 01:49:45.380
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Infuse a comic.</v>

2049
01:49:45.381 --> 01:49:46.430
<v Speaker 1>You'd be laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2050
01:49:46.431 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David [inaudible]</v>

2051
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:48.843
<v Speaker 2>has told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said his family is very reluctant to </v>

2052
01:49:51.371 --> 01:49:52.204
<v Speaker 2>share their lives with them anymore </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's kind of made them </v>

2053
01:49:54.970 --> 01:49:55.803
<v Speaker 2>involuntary public figures and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with the fallout from these </v>

2054
01:49:59.341 --> 01:50:00.174
<v Speaker 2>stories about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really only his brother and his </v>

2055
01:50:02.201 --> 01:50:06.100
<v Speaker 2>sister amy have kind of been able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spin this in a good way,</v>

2056
01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:09.340
<v Speaker 2>but it alienates a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2057
01:50:09.341 --> 01:50:10.210
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2058
01:50:10.211 --> 01:50:11.590
<v Speaker 2>especially if you use their actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2059
01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Name or people know the origin of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual story.</v>

2060
01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2061
01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:18.490
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a bad person,</v>

2062
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:19.383
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to break it to you think you're a </v>

2063
01:50:21.521 --> 01:50:23.440
<v Speaker 1>bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are only examples.</v>

2064
01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:26.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2065
01:50:27.170 --> 01:50:28.850
<v Speaker 2>You're not convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2066
01:50:28.851 --> 01:50:29.684
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not revealing the worst stuff </v>

2067
01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:31.323
<v Speaker 2>that of course,</v>

2068
01:50:34.050 --> 01:50:34.883
<v Speaker 1>think that you have to have some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>embracing of these dark thoughts to </v>

2069
01:50:41.131 --> 01:50:43.170
<v Speaker 1>create the way you create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2070
01:50:43.171 --> 01:50:48.171
<v Speaker 1>you're creating these characters that go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down some horrible roads,</v>

2071
01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:51.810
<v Speaker 1>both mentally and in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2072
01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:56.160
<v Speaker 1>in your work and it's amazing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to cultivate that,</v>

2073
01:50:56.161 --> 01:50:56.994
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be kind of in touch with </v>

2074
01:50:58.111 --> 01:51:00.960
<v Speaker 1>those thoughts of your own to kind of in</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch with this?</v>

2075
01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:04.333
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing where you're watching your </v>

2076
01:51:05.061 --> 01:51:08.300
<v Speaker 1>mom dying you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to be relieved of a burden</v>

2077
01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to tell anybody that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of looking forward to that a</v>

2078
01:51:12.831 --> 01:51:14.870
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you love your mom dearly,</v>

2079
01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:15.930
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2080
01:51:15.930 --> 01:51:20.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a natural thing that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to discuss but absolutely exists.</v>

2081
01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:24.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the elephant in the room.</v>

2082
01:51:25.210 --> 01:51:26.520
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of like,</v>

2083
01:51:26.521 --> 01:51:27.354
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how comedy works or anything where </v>

2084
01:51:29.451 --> 01:51:33.260
<v Speaker 2>you're stating this unstated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're creating this enormous relief.</v>

2085
01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2086
01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:40.100
<v Speaker 2>my classic example when I teach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked my students,</v>

2087
01:51:40.101 --> 01:51:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2088
01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:43.610
<v Speaker 2>so what do you call a black man that </v>
<v Speaker 2>flies a plane?</v>

2089
01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.073
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2090
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.170
<v Speaker 2>a pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking racist.</v>

2091
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:53.940
<v Speaker 2>You're creating this tension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2092
01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:54.973
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want you to say what they think </v>

2093
01:51:56.251 --> 01:51:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to hate you.</v>

2094
01:51:59.190 --> 01:52:00.540
<v Speaker 2>They like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2095
01:52:00.570 --> 01:52:03.330
<v Speaker 2>And they don't want you to say something</v>
<v Speaker 2>hateful and awful.</v>

2096
01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you turn it around,</v>

2097
01:52:05.761 --> 01:52:07.920
<v Speaker 2>he put it on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2098
01:52:08.370 --> 01:52:11.130
<v Speaker 2>and so in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2099
01:52:11.131 --> 01:52:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I always think that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the soul of comedy is to create this,</v>

2100
01:52:14.010 --> 01:52:17.580
<v Speaker 2>this tension that you relieve as quickly</v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>

2101
01:52:18.090 --> 01:52:22.680
<v Speaker 2>And the relief occurs as laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having dinner</v>

2102
01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.560
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good friend of mine,</v>

2103
01:52:24.561 --> 01:52:25.394
<v Speaker 1>his wife and a buddy of mine and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend's friend and his wife and fun </v>

2104
01:52:32.301 --> 01:52:35.960
<v Speaker 1>time the whole night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's laughing and joking and,</v>

2105
01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:37.413
<v Speaker 1>or have a dinner and having a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinks and joking around talking about </v>

2106
01:52:41.571 --> 01:52:45.920
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I forget</v>

2107
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:51.040
<v Speaker 3>what led to him saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were talking about,</v>

2108
01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:57.050
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just unfortunate scenarios and you know,</v>

2109
01:52:57.051 --> 01:52:57.884
<v Speaker 3>people that just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their life is not going the way they'd </v>

2110
01:53:01.011 --> 01:53:03.680
<v Speaker 3>like it to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And things going back and out of nowhere</v>

2111
01:53:03.681 --> 01:53:04.940
<v Speaker 3>the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2112
01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:07.373
<v Speaker 3>that's like this.</v>

2113
01:53:10.010 --> 01:53:13.490
<v Speaker 1>My daughter has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a baby with a black man</v>

2114
01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:17.960
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're both like looking at him like,</v>

2115
01:53:17.961 --> 01:53:20.950
<v Speaker 1>where's this going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes and uh,</v>

2116
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's incredibly selfish to </v>

2117
01:53:23.961 --> 01:53:27.530
<v Speaker 1>bring that kid into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this kid doesn't have an identity.</v>

2118
01:53:27.531 --> 01:53:31.550
<v Speaker 1>They're not black and the not white and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

2119
01:53:31.551 --> 01:53:32.960
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to have an identity.</v>

2120
01:53:32.961 --> 01:53:34.640
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to have a group to </v>
<v Speaker 1>belong to.</v>

2121
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:37.970
<v Speaker 1>And my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jaws dropped.</v>

2122
01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:38.893
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the guy had spent on that </v>

2123
01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:40.753
<v Speaker 1>night and my drop and I looked at my </v>
<v Speaker 1>other friend who was with me who didn't </v>

2124
01:53:44.151 --> 01:53:46.310
<v Speaker 1>know any of these other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's like,</v>

2125
01:53:46.311 --> 01:53:50.030
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a couple of us get up and go to</v>

2126
01:53:50.031 --> 01:53:50.864
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I turned to my friend Andrew and I </v>

2127
01:53:52.791 --> 01:53:54.020
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get the fuck out of here.</v>

2128
01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:56.000
<v Speaker 1>And we just laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I texted my friend,</v>

2129
01:53:56.001 --> 01:53:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much racism had to go.</v>

2130
01:53:57.950 --> 01:54:00.350
<v Speaker 1>And we just left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2131
01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:04.640
<v Speaker 1>but it was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this guy was holding into this</v>

2132
01:54:04.641 --> 01:54:05.271
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2133
01:54:05.271 --> 01:54:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I can trust these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's some racist shit.</v>

2134
01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I can trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't work.</v>

2135
01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:10.483
<v Speaker 1>And he knew it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew it went over the world like a </v>

2136
01:54:14.661 --> 01:54:16.280
<v Speaker 1>lead balloon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew it.</v>

2137
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:18.140
<v Speaker 1>He could feel it because everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2138
01:54:18.141 --> 01:54:19.760
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2139
01:54:19.761 --> 01:54:22.970
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your daughter's in love with a man who's</v>

2140
01:54:22.971 --> 01:54:25.790
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a child together and you think</v>

2141
01:54:25.791 --> 01:54:28.310
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly selfish to bring their </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid in the world.</v>

2142
01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could remember what the fuck we</v>

2143
01:54:33.051 --> 01:54:33.884
<v Speaker 1>were talking about before then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we're talking about before </v>

2144
01:54:36.741 --> 01:54:37.574
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like drug addicts or people fuck </v>

2145
01:54:39.051 --> 01:54:39.884
<v Speaker 1>up or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were directed to gambling or </v>

2146
01:54:41.511 --> 01:54:42.344
<v Speaker 1>something and the people whose lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in chaos and then he brings up his </v>

2147
01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:46.873
<v Speaker 1>daughter having a baby with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who was the wrong amount of </v>

2148
01:54:49.701 --> 01:54:53.420
<v Speaker 1>melanin skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose ancestors came from the wrong part</v>

2149
01:54:53.421 --> 01:54:56.510
<v Speaker 1>of the world for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird,</v>

2150
01:54:56.511 --> 01:54:57.350
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2151
01:54:57.351 --> 01:55:00.890
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was weird also to see him recognize.</v>

2152
01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:03.640
<v Speaker 2>I did funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2153
01:55:03.710 --> 01:55:05.510
<v Speaker 2>you throw out a story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I throw out a story.</v>

2154
01:55:06.190 --> 01:55:07.023
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a hired car from Philadelphia to </v>

2155
01:55:08.811 --> 01:55:11.390
<v Speaker 2>New York once on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2156
01:55:11.391 --> 01:55:12.224
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we were going past liberty hall in </v>

2157
01:55:13.131 --> 01:55:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2158
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:17.870
<v Speaker 2>this great guy over the philly accent </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving the car,</v>

2159
01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:22.130
<v Speaker 2>he points at Liberty Hall and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that building has stood for,</v>

2160
01:55:22.190 --> 01:55:23.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 years.</v>

2161
01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:28.600
<v Speaker 2>I bet you can't tell me why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just looked.</v>

2162
01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:29.654
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the bricks are late in Flemish </v>

2163
01:55:31.401 --> 01:55:34.880
<v Speaker 2>bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably it with uh,</v>

2164
01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:35.753
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brick bricks are offset in such a </v>

2165
01:55:36.741 --> 01:55:39.680
<v Speaker 2>way that they bond in the center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called Flemish bond.</v>

2166
01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:45.570
<v Speaker 2>And the guys so silent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's ever answered the question.</v>

2167
01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:48.900
<v Speaker 2>And his father was a bricklayer and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was so proud.</v>

2168
01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:50.310
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2169
01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever said Flemish bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's still stands.</v>

2170
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:57.763
<v Speaker 2>And we were best friends and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking like crazy all the way into </v>

2171
01:56:01.861 --> 01:56:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get into Manhattan,</v>

2172
01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:06.270
<v Speaker 2>there's two guys walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

2173
01:56:06.810 --> 01:56:09.570
<v Speaker 2>The Guy Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Christ,</v>

2174
01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I hate coming to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2175
01:56:11.221 --> 01:56:12.060
<v Speaker 2>the fags.</v>

2176
01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:14.591
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2177
01:56:14.591 --> 01:56:15.424
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm married to a man and Faggot is </v>

2178
01:56:18.461 --> 01:56:19.294
<v Speaker 2>pretty much my middle name now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor guy had to do this whole re </v>

2179
01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:33.510
<v Speaker 2>juggling of everything that the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew Flemish bond was also one of them.</v>

2180
01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was one of those wonderful,</v>

2181
01:56:39.461 --> 01:56:44.461
<v Speaker 2>kind of icky but necessary moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know they're horrible,</v>

2182
01:56:46.991 --> 01:56:49.600
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are better afterwards.</v>

2183
01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:53.380
<v Speaker 2>You must have loved that moment though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2184
01:56:53.381 --> 01:56:54.214
<v Speaker 2>it was a horrible moment because I felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was throwing away any kind of </v>

2185
01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:00.490
<v Speaker 2>chatty conversational relationship I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this guy.</v>

2186
01:57:00.970 --> 01:57:02.650
<v Speaker 2>You seem like just the salt of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

2187
01:57:02.651 --> 01:57:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny guy.</v>

2188
01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:06.640
<v Speaker 2>And it was just kind of going out on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>limb and saying,</v>

2189
01:57:06.641 --> 01:57:08.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2190
01:57:08.291 --> 01:57:10.400
<v Speaker 2>he's going to hate my guts after this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2191
01:57:12.730 --> 01:57:15.790
<v Speaker 1>when I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived in San Francisco from age seven</v>

2192
01:57:15.791 --> 01:57:18.100
<v Speaker 1>to 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then moved to Florida,</v>

2193
01:57:18.190 --> 01:57:20.410
<v Speaker 1>which is the polar opposite of San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>

2194
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:21.783
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2195
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:23.823
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2196
01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:25.033
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'd ever heard someone </v>

2197
01:57:27.341 --> 01:57:29.840
<v Speaker 1>use the word faggot before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd never seen a,</v>

2198
01:57:29.841 --> 01:57:32.260
<v Speaker 1>an adult upset about gay people before </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2199
01:57:32.590 --> 01:57:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2200
01:57:33.310 --> 01:57:37.580
<v Speaker 1>my friend Candy Candido was his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2201
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:39.280
<v Speaker 1>his dad was Cuban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were Cuban.</v>

2202
01:57:39.670 --> 01:57:40.503
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2203
01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:43.660
<v Speaker 1>his dad slams a newspaper on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the table.</v>

2204
01:57:43.661 --> 01:57:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I was 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2205
01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:47.920
<v Speaker 1>can't believe they're letting these fags</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting married.</v>

2206
01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:52.990
<v Speaker 1>He was just so angry and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping and thinking like,</v>

2207
01:57:52.991 --> 01:57:54.890
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a man.</v>

2208
01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:57.340
<v Speaker 1>This guy is a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a grown man.</v>

2209
01:57:57.341 --> 01:57:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a grownup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet he's,</v>

2210
01:58:00.670 --> 01:58:05.670
<v Speaker 1>he's got this infant idea of what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person should be like.</v>

2211
01:58:05.981 --> 01:58:08.140
<v Speaker 1>They got to fall into this category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that category.</v>

2212
01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:10.420
<v Speaker 1>He's got it locked into his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking baby,</v>

2213
01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:13.980
<v Speaker 1>but he's a man and he's my friend's Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy sucks.</v>

2214
01:58:13.981 --> 01:58:16.930
<v Speaker 1>This guy made it to 35 years old or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck he was.</v>

2215
01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:18.633
<v Speaker 1>And this is his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is his operating system that he's </v>

2216
01:58:20.951 --> 01:58:21.784
<v Speaker 1>using to navigate its way through life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it being an important moment </v>

2217
01:58:26.351 --> 01:58:27.184
<v Speaker 1>for me because I realize like just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone is older doesn't mean </v>

2218
01:58:31.181 --> 01:58:33.160
<v Speaker 1>they learned anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2219
01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:36.010
<v Speaker 1>and that people are capable of success </v>
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>

2220
01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:37.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could become married,</v>

2221
01:58:37.631 --> 01:58:39.130
<v Speaker 1>you can have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a house,</v>

2222
01:58:39.131 --> 01:58:39.964
<v Speaker 1>you get good job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you drive a the hold that you got it </v>

2223
01:58:42.551 --> 01:58:44.120
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a checkbook,</v>

2224
01:58:44.130 --> 01:58:45.220
<v Speaker 1>you got fucking you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2225
01:58:45.221 --> 01:58:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're operating,</v>

2226
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:48.430
<v Speaker 1>it's moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're successful,</v>

2227
01:58:48.431 --> 01:58:51.280
<v Speaker 1>it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet you still have these</v>

2228
01:58:51.710 --> 01:58:54.800
<v Speaker 2>stupid ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that the,</v>

2229
01:58:54.801 --> 01:58:55.450
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2230
01:58:55.450 --> 01:58:58.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a benefit to the expression of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stupid idea,</v>

2231
01:58:58.580 --> 01:58:59.413
<v Speaker 2>not that they can be challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that at least when we're aware that </v>

2232
01:59:03.561 --> 01:59:04.760
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2233
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:05.870
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2234
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:07.303
<v Speaker 2>we know that this thing is not just kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of festering and that there's a way of </v>

2235
01:59:10.221 --> 01:59:11.054
<v Speaker 2>kind of not fixing this person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least we know where they're </v>

2236
01:59:14.151 --> 01:59:15.380
<v Speaker 2>coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2237
01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2238
01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:21.110
<v Speaker 2>another shooting myself in the career </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot thing.</v>

2239
01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you've done it once the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole show.</v>

2240
01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>

2241
01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I read the daily stormer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Anglin cracks me up.</v>

2242
01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:38.353
<v Speaker 2>Who is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the completely transgressive guy </v>

2243
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:45.680
<v Speaker 2>who really loves fight club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2244
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.903
<v Speaker 2>writes for the daily stormer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he is the daily stormer and he </v>

2245
01:59:50.271 --> 01:59:54.080
<v Speaker 2>writes the most atrocious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insensitive,</v>

2246
01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:57.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal things,</v>

2247
01:59:58.190 --> 02:00:03.190
<v Speaker 2>but they are there so shocking and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgressive that,</v>

2248
02:00:04.761 --> 02:00:05.594
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sometimes I laugh just out of the </v>

2249
02:00:08.001 --> 02:00:09.050
<v Speaker 2>shock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2250
02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:11.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old classic joke,</v>

2251
02:00:11.541 --> 02:00:14.780
<v Speaker 2>how do you get a nun pregnant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck her?</v>

2252
02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:17.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a shock value there that,</v>

2253
02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:21.740
<v Speaker 2>that just sort of jars me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me laugh.</v>

2254
02:00:21.741 --> 02:00:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes</v>

2255
02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:26.020
<v Speaker 1>that joke would work better if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't told the black pilot choke first.</v>

2256
02:00:26.290 --> 02:00:27.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the problem is like people </v>

2257
02:00:28.331 --> 02:00:28.810
<v Speaker 1>become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2258
02:00:28.810 --> 02:00:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's coming.</v>

2259
02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2260
02:00:32.481 --> 02:00:34.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes,</v>

2261
02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:35.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2262
02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:36.253
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go into a world where people </v>

2263
02:00:39.441 --> 02:00:42.920
<v Speaker 2>are not watching their language so </v>
<v Speaker 2>closely and,</v>

2264
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.510
<v Speaker 2>and I see people kind of a vent the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst of themselves,</v>

2265
02:00:47.810 --> 02:00:50.600
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not kind of endorsing it,</v>

2266
02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:56.380
<v Speaker 2>but I feel a little less reactive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse.</v>

2267
02:00:56.710 --> 02:00:57.543
<v Speaker 2>A scientologist has had this exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>called bull baiting where they take you </v>

2268
02:01:01.371 --> 02:01:05.780
<v Speaker 2>into a room and people surround you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they call you every horrible thing.</v>

2269
02:01:05.781 --> 02:01:07.580
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they nit pick horror.</v>

2270
02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Every aspect of your appearance or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>

2271
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
<v Speaker 2>who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they attack you on every level.</v>

2272
02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:16.850
<v Speaker 2>And they do this for long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long periods of time,</v>

2273
02:01:16.851 --> 02:01:17.684
<v Speaker 2>and they do this day after day until you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are completely not reactionary to that </v>

2274
02:01:21.591 --> 02:01:23.660
<v Speaker 2>kind of verbal abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

2275
02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:25.243
<v Speaker 2>you can put it over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can accept the fact that it's </v>

2276
02:01:27.681 --> 02:01:30.230
<v Speaker 2>somebody else's statements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else's opinion,</v>

2277
02:01:30.290 --> 02:01:31.123
<v Speaker 2>observation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not true and you can be with </v>

2278
02:01:34.101 --> 02:01:35.660
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in a way,</v>

2279
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.823
<v Speaker 2>when I go into these sites that are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>patently offensive and in a </v>

2280
02:01:42.351 --> 02:01:43.640
<v Speaker 2>deliberately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2281
02:01:43.641 --> 02:01:44.474
<v Speaker 2>aggressively offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like in a way there are </v>

2282
02:01:47.391 --> 02:01:49.880
<v Speaker 2>thickening my skin that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2283
02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:55.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quite a such a delicate little </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactive thing afterwards.</v>

2284
02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:56.113
<v Speaker 2>Do you worry about someone looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>through your search results or the far </v>

2285
02:01:59.241 --> 02:02:00.380
<v Speaker 2>worse things than that?</v>

2286
02:02:06.430 --> 02:02:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that in fighting.</v>

2287
02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain people that react really</v>

2288
02:02:13.031 --> 02:02:13.864
<v Speaker 1>poorly to trash talk and there's certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that get excited by it and it </v>

2289
02:02:17.771 --> 02:02:19.450
<v Speaker 1>doesn't bother them at all and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace it.</v>

2290
02:02:19.810 --> 02:02:20.643
<v Speaker 1>And generally it's people who grew up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>abusive households and horrible </v>

2291
02:02:23.771 --> 02:02:26.380
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when the trash dark starts coming,</v>

2292
02:02:26.381 --> 02:02:27.214
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2293
02:02:27.330 --> 02:02:27.791
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2294
02:02:27.791 --> 02:02:28.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what's going to happen?</v>

2295
02:02:28.990 --> 02:02:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

2296
02:02:30.431 --> 02:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>and then you see them get excited by it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you see them like saying,</v>

2297
02:02:35.110 --> 02:02:35.651
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2298
02:02:35.651 --> 02:02:37.960
<v Speaker 1>now you've given me more motivation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you up.</v>

2299
02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Whereas some people genuinely need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get dwarfed by this.</v>

2300
02:02:41.770 --> 02:02:42.603
<v Speaker 1>You think they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get the pressure of not just being </v>

2301
02:02:47.141 --> 02:02:48.280
<v Speaker 1>in conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some person,</v>

2302
02:02:48.281 --> 02:02:49.114
<v Speaker 1>but that person insulting them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal conflict and demeaning them and </v>

2303
02:02:53.021 --> 02:02:55.720
<v Speaker 1>mocking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It haunts them.</v>

2304
02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:58.960
<v Speaker 1>It haunts them and it ruins them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't perform.</v>

2305
02:02:59.170 --> 02:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>They go out and they fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fight terrible.</v>

2306
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>It happens to a lot of fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys who were tough,</v>

2307
02:03:03.701 --> 02:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>tough guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something about the,</v>

2308
02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:06.713
<v Speaker 1>the verbal conflict and the abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an emotional struggle that </v>

2309
02:03:09.731 --> 02:03:10.564
<v Speaker 1>they're not prepared for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They prepared 100% for this physical </v>

2310
02:03:12.911 --> 02:03:13.744
<v Speaker 1>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a certain aspect of someone </v>

2311
02:03:16.030 --> 02:03:16.863
<v Speaker 1>literally hating them as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not thinking of them as a worthy </v>

2312
02:03:20.711 --> 02:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>competitor who they respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they're ready to go to,</v>

2313
02:03:23.081 --> 02:03:23.914
<v Speaker 1>battle with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll shake hands first and </v>

2314
02:03:25.001 --> 02:03:25.834
<v Speaker 1>afterwards we'll go have a beer together</v>
<v Speaker 1>after we beat the shit out of each </v>

2315
02:03:27.851 --> 02:03:29.730
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like you're,</v>

2316
02:03:29.731 --> 02:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>you're a little pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bitch.</v>

2317
02:03:31.211 --> 02:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>You shine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't even be here.</v>

2318
02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>You're weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fall apart,</v>

2319
02:03:34.541 --> 02:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to fall.</v>

2320
02:03:35.861 --> 02:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Put your waiting to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give me a neck.</v>

2321
02:03:38.290 --> 02:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Just give me a neck.</v>

2322
02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll choke you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it nice and easy.</v>

2323
02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:45.750
<v Speaker 1>And you see guys reacting to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these demons inside of them that these,</v>

2324
02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:46.623
<v Speaker 1>these are thoughts that do dance around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of their brain and every day </v>

2325
02:03:49.781 --> 02:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>they're throwing water on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But every day they come back in,</v>

2326
02:03:51.821 --> 02:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>the fucking embers are still smoldering </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2327
02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:54.993
<v Speaker 1>And this guy's just pouring gasoline on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit and it just takes over the </v>

2328
02:03:57.611 --> 02:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see them,</v>

2329
02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:00.490
<v Speaker 1>they can't sleep good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see them,</v>

2330
02:04:00.491 --> 02:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>they look exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the day of the fight,</v>

2331
02:04:03.161 --> 02:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>they look nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look,</v>

2332
02:04:04.690 --> 02:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>they look really worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll look really worried.</v>

2333
02:04:07.691 --> 02:04:08.524
<v Speaker 1>This person's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person is planted these seeds of </v>

2334
02:04:10.781 --> 02:04:11.614
<v Speaker 1>doubt that are these invasive species </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants that are choking out all the </v>

2335
02:04:14.591 --> 02:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wild to see.</v>

2336
02:04:17.050 --> 02:04:17.883
<v Speaker 1>It's wild to see how the same words can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a completely different effect on </v>

2337
02:04:21.611 --> 02:04:22.444
<v Speaker 1>different people.</v>

2338
02:04:24.330 --> 02:04:25.163
<v Speaker 2>So there you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different kind of resistance </v>

2339
02:04:26.641 --> 02:04:27.270
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

2340
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:27.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2341
02:04:27.751 --> 02:04:28.584
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely something to be </v>

2342
02:04:30.781 --> 02:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>around abusive people to being around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2343
02:04:33.871 --> 02:04:36.230
<v Speaker 1>you get accustomed to stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get you,</v>

2344
02:04:36.270 --> 02:04:40.920
<v Speaker 1>people are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very malleable now you can,</v>

2345
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:43.740
<v Speaker 1>you can get accustom to really shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

2346
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not like,</v>

2347
02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>this is what's got to happen when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in war,</v>

2348
02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you get accustomed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get accustomed to violence,</v>

2349
02:04:53.071 --> 02:04:56.460
<v Speaker 1>you get accustomed to all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the more difficult things for</v>

2350
02:04:56.461 --> 02:04:59.810
<v Speaker 1>people postwar is coming back into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2351
02:04:59.930 --> 02:05:01.320
<v Speaker 1>a kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentle,</v>

2352
02:05:01.321 --> 02:05:04.270
<v Speaker 1>boring world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they,</v>

2353
02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:05.671
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2354
02:05:05.671 --> 02:05:06.690
<v Speaker 1>that's hurt locker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2355
02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:09.150
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd appreciate the danger.</v>

2356
02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:12.920
<v Speaker 1>They appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thrill of it all is almost more,</v>

2357
02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:15.810
<v Speaker 1>more appealing than the absolute lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrill,</v>

2358
02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:16.673
<v Speaker 1>the thrill of potential violence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and all the horrors that you'd </v>

2359
02:05:19.701 --> 02:05:22.680
<v Speaker 1>come into contact with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost preferable.</v>

2360
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Did you read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2361
02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Sebastian younger's tribe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2362
02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a new one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2363
02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great book,</v>

2364
02:05:30.910 --> 02:05:34.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the why,</v>

2365
02:05:34.490 --> 02:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in these intense,</v>

2366
02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:39.363
<v Speaker 1>like really dangerous but crackling with</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy environments produce some of the </v>

2367
02:05:47.621 --> 02:05:52.621
<v Speaker 1>happiest moments for these people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and that post post war,</v>

2368
02:05:53.710 --> 02:05:54.543
<v Speaker 1>like they have an incredibly difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>job to sort of reintegrating to normal </v>

2369
02:05:59.530 --> 02:06:01.150
<v Speaker 1>flats is society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
