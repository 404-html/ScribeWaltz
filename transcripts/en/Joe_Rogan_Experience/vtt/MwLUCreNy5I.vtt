00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.811
<v Speaker 1>those chicks,</v>

90
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.141
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

91
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>that's he as they didn't have the internet,</v>

92
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know there'd be endorsed.</v>

93
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>That was natural.</v>

94
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>That's how every girl naturally feels.</v>

95
00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>There's no Instagram,</v>

96
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.391
<v Speaker 1>no Instagram.</v>

97
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:00.991
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>

98
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>So first time you see them in person we have,</v>

99
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>is there a possibility that it was set up?</v>

100
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Is there a possible put the conspiracy we have,</v>

101
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.951
<v Speaker 1>we have a,</v>

102
00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>an idea of what women are based on,</v>

103
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>how women behave around us when they're worried about the way we think about</v>

104
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

105
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>The same way we behave differently when it's all us,</v>

106
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>when there's no women around,</v>

107
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>there's just ways that people behave.</v>

108
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>And if you leave all these women together,</v>

109
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.161
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second,</v>

110
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

111
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>If you leave all of these women together and it's 19 what,</v>

112
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.893
<v Speaker 1>what year was that?</v>

113
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Said?</v>

114
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.551
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

115
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>The sixties late sixties right?</v>

116
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:36.524
<v Speaker 1>Ones</v>

117
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

118
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even barely have books back then.</v>

119
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was the kitchen,</v>

120
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>he a Beatles girl screaming.</v>

121
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.401
<v Speaker 1>Of course they had books.</v>

122
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm joking,</v>

123
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm not joking around about it is that they had no one had ever</v>

124
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:51.970
<v Speaker 1>experienced anything like that before.</v>

125
00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>And if you get all these girls together and they're seeing these guys who</v>

126
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>they're seeing on television and they're seeing on the Ed Sullivan and there's,</v>

127
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>they're seeing him everywhere and they're sitting there in the newspapers and</v>

128
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:07.441
<v Speaker 1>the magazines and they see these guys and the sounds they make are so good in</v>

129
00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>the way they sing and play music together is so magical and it's so</v>

130
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented and it's a new kind of sound and they just special,</v>

131
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>these girls just can't help it.</v>

133
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.103
<v Speaker 1>Like me,</v>

134
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

135
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're a pig,</v>

136

137
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the big applause light with our plots?</v>

138
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>And they make,</v>

139
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.360
<v Speaker 1>is that a real plaza?</v>

140
00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Is that a fake applause?</v>

141
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's fake.</v>

142
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Their conditional.</v>

143
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a different level level to</v>

144
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>listen those uplights they're not a conspiracy.</v>

145
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>They're not a conspiracy,</v>

146
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.280
<v Speaker 1>but they are kind of cheesy dude,</v>

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 1>He is hot,</v>

151
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.481
<v Speaker 1>but I worked.</v>

152
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>So I worked in security for it,</v>

153
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.520
<v Speaker 1>like some of these uh,</v>

154
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>bands and I worked for the hip when Hilary Duff was in her a day,</v>

155
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking bitches passing out from excitement at the,</v>

156
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>grabbed their big asses out of the crowd.</v>

157
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>That's not fake.</v>

158
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:06.994
<v Speaker 1>That's real dude.</v>

159
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking bitches crying.</v>

160
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I have to understand that girls have a completely different reaction.</v>

161
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.281
<v Speaker 1>Not all girls,</v>

162
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:12.851
<v Speaker 1>but some,</v>

163
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>some dude's too,</v>

164
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:14.820
<v Speaker 1>or you brought up.</v>

165
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the reactions?</v>

166
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

167
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of Beatles footage of the audience,</v>

168
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>but there's girls just fucking flipping out,</v>

169
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:23.640
<v Speaker 1>screaming and crying,</v>

170
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>like just going nuts.</v>

171
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>You remember those toe shots?</v>

172
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.500
<v Speaker 1>100% look,</v>

173
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

174
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>do I think that girls would act up to get on camera to make it a bigger deal?</v>

175
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.323
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

176
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Do I think that's what they were all doing?</v>

177
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.160
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

178
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Look at this mayhem dude.</v>

179
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I think they couldn't believe that the Beatles were actually there and there'd</v>

180
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>never been anybody like the Beatles before hock thirsty bro.</v>

181
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I think they were just hypnotized.</v>

182
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.560
<v Speaker 1>There's something singing out in their DNA about that music because look,</v>

183
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>we can listen to the Beales today and it's still great.</v>

184
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I listened to the white album just the other day.</v>

185
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.373
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

186
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 1>How was it?</v>

187
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a different beginning to where sexy though.</v>

188
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 1>They weren't like heart drops their dick had here because don't have to take</v>

189
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.830
<v Speaker 1>basic did don't know.</v>

190
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:08.741
<v Speaker 1>It's the music.</v>

191
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the music.</v>

192
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 1>They're so good.</v>

193
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

194
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>this movie or this book rather.</v>

195
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.210
<v Speaker 1>The Malcolm Gladwell was all about extraordinary performances like what people</v>

196
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>have done that's been completely extraordinary.</v>

197
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>And one of them was talking about how the Beatles got so good because they</v>

198
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:24.964
<v Speaker 1>played,</v>

199
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Berlin was where they play or Homburg one of those.</v>

200
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 1>So they played somewhere where they played all night.</v>

201
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>They played like multiple hours a night and they played every day.</v>

202
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>They played an insane number of shunt of audience in front of audiences.</v>

203
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.760
<v Speaker 1>They just played constantly and he talked about the importance of that,</v>

204
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>that by the time we got to see them,</v>

205
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 1>by the time they were on television,</v>

206
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.470
<v Speaker 1>they had played together so many more times than the average band where we'll do</v>

207
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:57.370
<v Speaker 1>in their entire career.</v>

208
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Like the</v>

209
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.791
<v Speaker 2>sheer numbers.</v>

210
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 2>They were always playing,</v>

211
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 2>always doing these live performances.</v>

212
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I forget where it was,</v>

213
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 2>but the cavern club where,</v>

214
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:05.721
<v Speaker 2>where was it?</v>

215
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Beatles at the cavern club is what it was called,</v>

216
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

217
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Where is the place that they performed early in their career?</v>

218
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's a Homburg.</v>

219
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 2>This says the first of a long series of resident nights during a traditional</v>

220
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:17.001
<v Speaker 2>jazz evening,</v>

221
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 2>they performed an interval as the only rock group during an all night session</v>

222
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 2>including jazz.</v>

223
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it might be one of many things they've done.</v>

224
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I would not think this was before they made it.</v>

225
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 2>This was like as they were like young guys coming up,</v>

226
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.460
<v Speaker 2>just think about the Beatles in Hamburg corner.</v>

227
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Just so many repetitions.</v>

228
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

229
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 2>and he talked about how it,</v>

230
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 2>and then think about that Pete best dude go fuck.</v>

231
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I was in the mix.</v>

232
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.560
<v Speaker 2>What would it do?</v>

233
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.030
<v Speaker 2>What did he end up donating thing?</v>

234
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 2>He start his own band.</v>

235
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.290
<v Speaker 2>How do you recover from that biggest l?</v>

236
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.351
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

237
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 2>there's never been a Beatles before,</v>

238
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 2>so we're looking at the Beatles like we already know.</v>

239
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:53.654
<v Speaker 2>They're awesome.</v>

240
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 2>They're all already a part of pop culture history.</v>

241
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.051
<v Speaker 2>I miss them.</v>

242
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm younger.</v>

243
00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

244
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 2>but if we live back then,</v>

245
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

246
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 2>if it was like 1963 in the Beatles burst in the scene,</v>

247
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 2>you would be like,</v>

248
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.300
<v Speaker 2>why is there anything close to that now?</v>

249
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 2>There were two.</v>

250
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 2>We have too much stimulus.</v>

251
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 2>We see it too much.</v>

252
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Instagram.</v>

253
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 2>We get inside their lives.</v>

254
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

255
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find some huge bank.</v>

256
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 2>There's that Korean ban that's fucking,</v>

257
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

259
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.483
<v Speaker 2>but they're starting to,</v>

260
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.650

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.830

264
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:31.070

<v Speaker 2>They're huge.</v>

266
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 2>But there's like the backstreet boys and new kids.</v>

00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:14.880
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

290
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.200
<v Speaker 2>You know in Korea there you can watch a documentary on the k pop stuff and they,</v>

291
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.281
<v Speaker 2>they don't like,</v>

292
00:08:20.281 --> 00:08:21.780
<v Speaker 2>it's not chemistry where the GIM together,</v>

293
00:08:21.781 --> 00:08:23.730
<v Speaker 2>they forced them together and then they,</v>

294
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.100
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

295
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.380
<v Speaker 2>you're talking 14 hours a day.</v>

296
00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:26.370
<v Speaker 2>They make them rehearse,</v>

297
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:26.941
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>

298
00:08:26.941 --> 00:08:27.870
<v Speaker 2>practice kept.</v>

299
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.220
<v Speaker 2>They can't have girlfriends,</v>

300
00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:31.020
<v Speaker 2>boyfriends to tell him when to eat,</v>

301
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:31.801
<v Speaker 2>where to sleep.</v>

302
00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:34.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a bs fog to that noise.</v>

303
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:35.691
<v Speaker 2>That's why I said I'd like the,</v>

304
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:36.361
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest,</v>

305
00:08:36.361 --> 00:08:36.540

307
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.121
<v Speaker 2>Just couldn't,</v>

308
00:08:39.121 --> 00:08:40.200
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to deal with the,</v>

309
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 2>with the restrictions and the control and sounds like Illuminati cheesy Christ.</v>

316
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.003
<v Speaker 2>You ever hear that?</v>

317
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they used to do that with these two that with bands,</v>

322
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>they do that with a,</v>

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 2>even with movies,</v>

324
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 2>it's signed in the old school studio days.</v>

325
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.280
<v Speaker 2>It's signed on to these long term contracts and they would produce all this</v>

326
00:09:04.281 --> 00:09:08.540
<v Speaker 2>stuff for them and forced them to do things and studios would sign the</v>

327
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.280
<v Speaker 2>contracts.</v>

328

<v Speaker 2>People just trying so hard</v>

350
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.720

<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating time to be a person.</v>

354
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 2>It really is so interesting right now.</v>

355
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:02.963
<v Speaker 2>It's a good time.</v>

356
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:03.871
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

357
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a great time.</v>

358
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Also a rough time.</v>

359
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.681
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

360
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:09.570
<v Speaker 2>It's all the mass shooters and that stuff.</v>

361
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>

362
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Top part,</v>

363
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 2>especially in charge or thousand oaks.</v>

364
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.910
<v Speaker 2>How was a safe ass place?</v>

365
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

366
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 2>How does that number ring?</v>

367
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 2>A former marine who was in the Las Vegas shooting as a survivor was the survivor</v>

368
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:23.450
<v Speaker 2>and the thousand oaks shooting the fucking</v>

369
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.650
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

370
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Think about the odds of that.</v>

371
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.260
<v Speaker 2>That's why I was told when I grow,</v>

372
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:28.790
<v Speaker 2>think about,</v>

373
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.490
<v Speaker 2>well I think there,</v>

374
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:29.851
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

375
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 2>so who was in the Vegas shooting?</v>

376
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:31.921
<v Speaker 2>Who survived that?</v>

377
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Who's at this one that died,</v>

378
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:33.870
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

379
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.410
<v Speaker 2>It was that,</v>

380
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

381
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.391
<v Speaker 2>Either way.</v>

382
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:37.224
<v Speaker 2>It's dark shit.</v>

383
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 2>They don't have no idea what his motive or anything.</v>

384
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

385
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:42.301
<v Speaker 2>The cops,</v>

386
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:43.530
<v Speaker 2>it investigated them.</v>

387
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 2>They investigated them,</v>

388
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

389
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.610
<v Speaker 2>fairly recently because they thought he was unstable or something like that.</v>

390
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 2>I think his mom called the cops,</v>

391
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 2>like some,</v>

392
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.100
<v Speaker 2>somebody called the cops and they investigated him,</v>

393
00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:56.791
<v Speaker 2>talked to him.</v>

394
00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's always tough if you're f guys like what do you want us to do?</v>

395
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Arrest them for being fucking weird.</v>

396
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Like he didn't exactly like what can we do for every one that does this cat</v>

397
00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:05.561
<v Speaker 2>trail,</v>

398
00:11:05.561 --> 00:11:08.070
<v Speaker 2>the guy thousand that don't,</v>

399
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

400
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've got to figure out what the fuck is it that allows people to decide</v>

401
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:14.010
<v Speaker 2>to hit that switch.</v>

402
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know if they understand that,</v>

403
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.083
<v Speaker 2>like the what is,</v>

404
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.130
<v Speaker 2>what's the psychological motivation of that?</v>

405
00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 2>But it's gotta be a sign that there's something wrong with our culture.</v>

406
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.310
<v Speaker 2>If it's kept popping up so often and he's gotta be a sign that something,</v>

407
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.280
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong.</v>

408
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they always chalk it up to mental health and all right.</v>

409
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:32.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

410
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 2>he was 100 percenters.</v>

411
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.510
<v Speaker 2>You know how many people have mental health issues and none of them are going to</v>

412
00:11:36.511 --> 00:11:37.940
<v Speaker 2>blow people up or two people,</v>

413
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.840
<v Speaker 2>different kinds of mental health issues.</v>

414
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.670
<v Speaker 2>But then there's also just bad people.</v>

415
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

416
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you got to chalk it up to that too.</v>

417
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 2>That's true too,</v>

418
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.830
<v Speaker 2>but you know a lot of bad people,</v>

419
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.180
<v Speaker 2>like a giant number.</v>

420
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 2>I've had horrible things happen.</v>

421
00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:50.604
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

422
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets weird because it's like,</v>

423
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:53.261
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

424
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>what made</v>

425
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 1>this guy become who he is and it's,</v>

426
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.720
<v Speaker 1>you definitely should.</v>

427
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 1>You definitely should arrest someone who does evil shit.</v>

428
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

429
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 1>But what makes a person get to a point where they can do evil shit?</v>

430
00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 1>This is a whole series of events probably take place,</v>

431
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 1>including abuse,</v>

432
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 1>physical abuse,</v>

433
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe sexual abuse.</v>

434
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.951
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's not.</v>

435
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you just get a bad apple.</v>

436
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Like with Jeffrey Dahmer,</v>

437
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:18.480
<v Speaker 1>it was like his pants liked it.</v>

438
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

439
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean you definitely need to get into some weird shit with his mom,</v>

440
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

441
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 1>you know how some people are born,</v>

442
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 1>they have problems with their liver?</v>

443
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

444
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.471
<v Speaker 1>Some people are born,</v>

445
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:27.460
<v Speaker 1>they have problems with their brain.</v>

446
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 1>That's just a fact.</v>

447
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Speaker 1>We know that there's problems with the eyesight.</v>

448
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 1>This problems with,</v>

449
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:32.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

450
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 1>people are born deaf.</v>

451
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

452
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 1>There's errors in the human body.</v>

453
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you don't think that someone can be born to just completely squirrely,</v>

454
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 1>wired wrong.</v>

455
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Of course they can.</v>

456
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Sociopathy makes sense.</v>

457
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:45.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor,</v>

458
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 1>obviously a fucking moron,</v>

459
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.960
<v Speaker 1>but I bet a doctor would agree that when you're dealing with mental health</v>

460
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:56.140
<v Speaker 1>issues you probably dealing with this giant spectrum of them.</v>

461
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 1>What if there's something we could check so that like when they're a baby could</v>

462
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:02.560
<v Speaker 1>check and aside DNA called eugenics but in there like this he's going to be a</v>

463
00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:03.161
<v Speaker 1>bad kid.</v>

464
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Do we just do it?</v>

465
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.840
<v Speaker 1>But how you always going to be about and why,</v>

466
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 1>how many people on the cemetery of your face,</v>

467
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:10.641
<v Speaker 1>how could,</v>

468
00:13:10.641 --> 00:13:14.770
<v Speaker 1>how many people want to be a better person and they don't ever get it together</v>

469
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:20.110
<v Speaker 1>and how many people are lacking like some sort of coaching or lacking some</v>

470
00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>inspiration,</v>

471
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:21.851
<v Speaker 1>inspiration,</v>

472
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 1>positive people in their life and then their life spirals further and further</v>

473
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.953
<v Speaker 1>downhill.</v>

474
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 1>How many people are on the border?</v>

475
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.130
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

476
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:28.871
<v Speaker 1>the majority,</v>

477
00:13:28.871 --> 00:13:29.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

478
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.651
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

479
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think people change and I think people improve as they grow older and as</v>

480
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 1>they become wiser and they have more experiences.</v>

481
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.241
<v Speaker 1>But also if you,</v>

482
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the mass shooters,</v>

483
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:41.050
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are quote unquote losers.</v>

484
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 1>They live in their,</v>

485
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>the parents' basement and everything going on.</v>

486
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.790
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them were white look like shit use mode.</v>

487
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.050
<v Speaker 1>They're always white and they,</v>

488
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:48.240
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

489
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.073

490
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 1>low energy,</v>

491
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 1>always white and low energy,</v>

492
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:53.381
<v Speaker 1>low energy.</v>

493
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 1>This guy didn't seem low energy.</v>

494
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.181
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

495
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis made propaganda films.</v>

496
00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

497
00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.691
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

498
00:13:58.691 --> 00:13:59.524
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

499
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

500
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 1>they made people believe that a mentally deranged people were out on the streets</v>

501
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.550
<v Speaker 1>attacking and killing people and they may propaganda film so that they would</v>

502
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.580
<v Speaker 1>okay killing someone who was,</v>

503
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:13.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

504
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.740
<v Speaker 1>mentally deranged.</v>

505
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.000
<v Speaker 1>You always have to be careful of people trying to label someone as someone that</v>

506
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:21.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to consider it a regular human.</v>

507
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Someone who you could disregard.</v>

508
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do with the juice.</v>

509
00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:24.311
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

510
00:14:24.311 --> 00:14:26.110
<v Speaker 1>That's like the rats are stealing from us.</v>

511
00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:26.861
<v Speaker 1>They're monsters.</v>

512
00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:27.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>

513
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 1>People done that throughout history to other people.</v>

514
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.660
<v Speaker 1>There's like a scientific term for it.</v>

515
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it is,</v>

516
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:33.820
<v Speaker 1>but genics damn,</v>

517
00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:34.471
<v Speaker 1>I was telling no,</v>

518
00:14:34.471 --> 00:14:35.304
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I'm saying.</v>

519
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:40.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a scientific term for people that demonize other groups of people and</v>

520
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:40.151
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

521
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:41.840
<v Speaker 1>the way they look at propagandists.</v>

522
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

523
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.180
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

524
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 1>The way you look at people like this is a person and you looked at the enemy,</v>

525
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.780
<v Speaker 1>you would look at them like a subhuman.</v>

526
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.400
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

527
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a psychological,</v>

528
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.020
<v Speaker 1>it is definitely racist.</v>

529
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

530
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 1>But there's like a trait that people like.</v>

531
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:02.530
<v Speaker 1>There's like a pattern that people commonly fall into with that humanize them.</v>

532
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.470
<v Speaker 1>The enemy.</v>

533
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.390
<v Speaker 1>We're all stupid in it.</v>

534
00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.190
<v Speaker 1>We are all stupid,</v>

535
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 1>but dehumanizing the enemy.</v>

536
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural thing that people do.</v>

537
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 1>It just fucking everyone does it.</v>

538
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.170
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

539
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's how people can do gang warfare is how people can do tribal warfare.</v>

540
00:15:16.441 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 1>It's how people can do inter continental w where you had your boy,</v>

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.690
<v Speaker 3>They call me</v>

587
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.180
<v Speaker 3>and then they took it away from him.</v>

599
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.860
<v Speaker 3>and then they call me for calling him like,</v>

600
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:35.370
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:49.101
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

610
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:52.400
<v Speaker 4>I thought I thought it was the judge's decision and they gave it to him based on</v>

611
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.653
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

612
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.200
<v Speaker 1>This is super technical.</v>

614
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.820
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I mentioned I talk about to the call you guys,</v>

<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

617
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Jiu Jitsu is boring but I don't either.</v>

618
00:17:05.281 --> 00:17:06.510
<v Speaker 1>But if you could explain it.</v>

619
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 1>No fucking idea what John Martinez in the house monster Joe is a fantastic tool.</v>

620
00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I tell dude under Eddie Bravo and he's one we referenced many times in the</v>

621
00:17:14.881 --> 00:17:15.630
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

622
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.370
<v Speaker 1>him and his brother Richie boogeyman because both those guys started out as</v>

623
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.300
<v Speaker 1>bboys.</v>

624
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.800
<v Speaker 1>They started out as these Israeli last break dancers and they have incredible</v>

625
00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:26.970
<v Speaker 1>control of their body.</v>

626
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.590
<v Speaker 1>And I remember when they first started training at Eddie's plays.</v>

627
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.391
<v Speaker 1>Eddie was like,</v>

628
00:17:30.391 --> 00:17:30.750

<v Speaker 1>like he had a new form yet.</v>

630
00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:32.281

631
00:17:32.281 --> 00:17:32.880

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.143
<v Speaker 1>practicing.</v>

636
00:17:40.741 --> 00:17:41.550

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

708
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thomson,</v>

00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:13.701
<v Speaker 1>Monster Barboza Ranada just to look us and Joe's bows of an Datta.</v>

710
00:19:13.991 --> 00:19:18.991
<v Speaker 1>Hofeld dos Anjos and Kevin Lee and then Anthony Pettis in a row we can pass.</v>

711
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Those guys does not nearly get nearly get the attention he deserves.</v>

712
00:19:23.941 --> 00:19:24.601
<v Speaker 1>God Man,</v>

713
00:19:24.601 --> 00:19:26.770
<v Speaker 1>he's got a million followers now and he's more,</v>

714
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:27.810
<v Speaker 1>he should,</v>

715
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 1>he should.</v>

716
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.220
<v Speaker 1>He should be.</v>

717
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:30.121
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

718
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:35.121
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he should have been stripped because he got injured one time doing</v>

719
00:19:35.281 --> 00:19:38.190
<v Speaker 1>USC prep and doing something and he tripped over some wires.</v>

720
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a freak accident.</v>

721
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.610
<v Speaker 1>It just something that happened,</v>

722
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

723
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:43.740
<v Speaker 1>to strip them because of that.</v>

724
00:19:43.741 --> 00:19:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

725
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

726
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.421
<v Speaker 1>I think he'd be,</v>

727
00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Pettis has 60% we know already,</v>

728
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:48.360

<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

732
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.380
<v Speaker 1>he's looked better before the injury obviously,</v>

733
00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:56.120
<v Speaker 1>but him coming back that fast doing what he did is it's like even adopt cruise.</v>

734
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:56.311
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

735
00:19:56.311 --> 00:19:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck he's doing this.</v>

736
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.750
<v Speaker 1>So I thought even as good as he looked,</v>

737
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.770
<v Speaker 1>that's not even him at his,</v>

738
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:02.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

739
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.050
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna be even better than this next fight.</v>

740
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:04.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

741
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I think more pet has look really good too.</v>

742
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.360
<v Speaker 1>You got to give credit to Pedis for sure.</v>

743
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Clip Titus,</v>

744
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.380
<v Speaker 1>collect him and he had him hurt,</v>

745
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:12.360
<v Speaker 1>but Tony figured out a way to hold on and survive.</v>

746
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:15.450
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't look like he was missing a beat to me.</v>

747
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.351
<v Speaker 1>He looked,</v>

748
00:20:16.351 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 1>he looked very in tune.</v>

749
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Did I?</v>

750
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I heard something that he didn't spar for this.</v>

751
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:21.654
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

752
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

753
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not too sure what he does with the striking.</v>

754
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm never there when he transferred the striking.</v>

755
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea to tell you the truth.</v>

756
00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.201
<v Speaker 1>You don't stay all can't.</v>

757
00:20:31.201 --> 00:20:34.890
<v Speaker 1>We just deal with the ground now when we do no shit told me.</v>

758
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:36.480
<v Speaker 1>And I've heard that too when he spars,</v>

759
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.440
<v Speaker 1>when we do Jujitsu we uh,</v>

760
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.720
<v Speaker 1>we definitely spark situation situation.</v>

761
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.310
<v Speaker 1>No like straight up striking.</v>

762
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.810
<v Speaker 1>No 16 ounce gloves.</v>

763
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Man Data is such a debate.</v>

764
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.210
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy debate that is.</v>

765
00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:50.383
<v Speaker 1>Does the same thing,</v>

766
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 1>does he know sparring?</v>

767
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's his starting six years might not,</v>

768
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.530
<v Speaker 1>that might not be a bad idea.</v>

769
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler took six years off sparring too.</v>

770
00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.351
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

771
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:03.350
<v Speaker 1>But then he became better when he went to [inaudible] eight t when you went to</v>

772
00:21:03.351 --> 00:21:08.351
<v Speaker 1>ATC and started a training with some serious talent down there and dropped down</v>

773
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:12.130
<v Speaker 1>to one 70.</v>

774
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.023
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know that,</v>

775
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.830
<v Speaker 1>that the period of no sparring,</v>

776
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the 85 period when he was at strike.</v>

777
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Well Chad,</v>

778
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Chad Mendez took a while off too cause obviously he got busted but then he took</v>

779
00:21:20.981 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 1>time off and then he's looking frickin pretty gnarly.</v>

780
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

781
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

782
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

783
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:29.780
<v Speaker 1>and haven't Dale Earnhardt junior on the other day and talking to him about the,</v>

784
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.910
<v Speaker 1>the brain injuries that he sustained from driving his car.</v>

785
00:21:32.911 --> 00:21:33.660
<v Speaker 1>And I haven't heard.</v>

786
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

787
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 1>horrible dude.</v>

788
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:36.910
<v Speaker 1>He got to,</v>

789
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.260
<v Speaker 1>couldn't walk across the room.</v>

790
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.940
<v Speaker 1>He had a hold on the tables and shit.</v>

791
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

792
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 1>as he was walking me.</v>

793
00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Did he say he's head concussion?</v>

794
00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Does he know what's in it?</v>

795
00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Something insane like 12 over a period of four years.</v>

796
00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:47.321
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

797
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:48.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>

798
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was something like 12 concussions over a period of 40 how's he</v>

799
00:21:51.731 --> 00:21:52.390
<v Speaker 1>know?</v>

800
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.223
<v Speaker 1>He's great.</v>

801
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Super Nice Guy.</v>

802
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.571
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

803
00:21:55.571 --> 00:21:56.560
<v Speaker 1>very genuine guy.</v>

804
00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:02.260
<v Speaker 1>He said that the length popping up says at least 20 fuck concussions.</v>

805
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.150
<v Speaker 1>It's more than some fighters.</v>

806
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:04.991
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

807
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

808
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.240
<v Speaker 1>That is so crazy.</v>

809
00:22:07.241 --> 00:22:09.280
<v Speaker 1>But you know he's a lot,</v>

810
00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of like serious problems that he had worked through,</v>

811
00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:14.730
<v Speaker 1>but he found a good doctor that has as good cognitive therapy really.</v>

812
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 1>So he's had some kind of side effects from it.</v>

813
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.610
<v Speaker 1>He had a bunch of side effects,</v>

814
00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:20.860
<v Speaker 1>but they cleared them up through these exercises.</v>

815
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting stuff like,</v>

816
00:22:22.631 --> 00:22:23.500
<v Speaker 1>and he was basically,</v>

817
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I made the analogy that it's like,</v>

818
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:26.470
<v Speaker 1>is it like exercising your mind?</v>

819
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Like is just like exercising your body.</v>

820
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Like there's things you can do that make things grow and make it an yeah and</v>

821
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:32.921
<v Speaker 1>make things strong.</v>

822
00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Hurts CBD oil and fish oil if really the exports that I know who are in that</v>

823
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:41.170
<v Speaker 1>field and with the brain always tell me a tons of Fisher on CBD oil.</v>

824
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Krill oil too.</v>

825
00:22:42.101 --> 00:22:43.090
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's real good.</v>

826
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

827
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

828
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

829
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.401
<v Speaker 1>Stuff.</v>

830
00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Anything that reduces inflammation but um,</v>

831
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.340
<v Speaker 1>that damn Taylor and her thought crazy.</v>

832
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.240
<v Speaker 1>These guys decide that's that.</v>

833
00:22:52.241 --> 00:22:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Some of them decide,</v>

834
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

835
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.200
<v Speaker 1>cowboy was doing that for awhile and probably still is.</v>

836
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.063
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he was doing,</v>

837
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:57.821
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing now.</v>

838
00:22:57.821 --> 00:22:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't talk to him about this.</v>

839
00:22:58.841 --> 00:22:59.920
<v Speaker 1>CanNot sparring heavy.</v>

840
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.150
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't sparring at all.</v>

841
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.430
<v Speaker 1>He's just hitting pads.</v>

842
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Just hitting pads.</v>

843
00:23:04.241 --> 00:23:05.074
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I know.</v>

844
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I ain't the horse idea man.</v>

845
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Boxers beg to differ.</v>

846
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>You talked to any of those boxers and they're like,</v>

847
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:09.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

848
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a Loma Chenko and a while to go.</v>

849
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.220
<v Speaker 1>We like to get a 12 rounds in hard right before the fight,</v>

850
00:23:18.221 --> 00:23:18.911
<v Speaker 1>like two weeks,</v>

851
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:21.280
<v Speaker 1>three weeks out and then we cut it off like three weeks out.</v>

852
00:23:21.281 --> 00:23:21.641
<v Speaker 1>Just make,</v>

853
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:25.750
<v Speaker 1>see where we're at and cutting about boxing though is your hands are wrapped up.</v>

854
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.771
<v Speaker 1>You know your,</v>

855
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:27.940
<v Speaker 1>your gloves are on,</v>

856
00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 1>they've got,</v>

857
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 1>you've got 16 ounce training gloves or maybe even 20 if you're a beast,</v>

858
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

859
00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:37.861
<v Speaker 1>You've got big ass puppy 16 you got big ass puffy gloves and there's no kicking.</v>

860
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 1>The thing about like kicking it,</v>

861
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.620
<v Speaker 1>like to see,</v>

862
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I bought Sam's book,</v>

863
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.790
<v Speaker 1>I'd feel like boxing is more dangerous.</v>

864
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:50.780
<v Speaker 1>It is in a way that all they're doing is head hunting all it's all head and it's</v>

865
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:51.500
<v Speaker 1>just head.</v>

866
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:51.801
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

867
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 1>But especially at that level.</v>

868
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

869
00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting kicked.</v>

870
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.101
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

871
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:56.780
<v Speaker 1>but in in like high level,</v>

872
00:23:56.781 --> 00:24:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Jim's like black house or a t t a k people there,</v>

873
00:24:00.401 --> 00:24:03.110
<v Speaker 1>they're not really going to throw those kicks as hard as they can.</v>

874
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:03.801
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

875
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all the Shit fucking old school shoot box.</v>

876
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:07.490

877
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:07.851
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>

878
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:09.680
<v Speaker 1>they're still going after it like that.</v>

879
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys that will still talk to you about the benefits of going</v>

880
00:24:12.771 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 1>after it.</v>

881
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>

882
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

883
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Out for Rasa.</v>

884
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Hobby was sandy gets guys who try to kill George Saint Pierre.</v>

885
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.640
<v Speaker 1>He give him extra money if you can knock them out just because he's so good.</v>

886
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 1>No doing shit.</v>

887
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.493
<v Speaker 1>He's so good.</v>

888
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.330
<v Speaker 1>They're not doing it to she names nightmare card.</v>

889
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.560
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be in danger for us wants Georgian and danger in legitimate danger.</v>

890
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:35.300
<v Speaker 1>So his in his mind is you put George in legitimate danger all the time in the</v>

891
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:39.740
<v Speaker 1>gym and he figures out a way to get through that and he gets comfortable with</v>

892
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:41.390
<v Speaker 1>that so that when it comes to the fight,</v>

893
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.890
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

894
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 1>That's easy to say if you and George St and I love for us,</v>

895
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 1>but when you have George St Pierre who's the smartest dude to ever run of the</v>

896
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:52.010
<v Speaker 1>full marks guys ever fight and he's so technical,</v>

897
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you whoever you're going to bring in there,</v>

898
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:54.750
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to hit Joe.</v>

899
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.581
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>

900
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:56.720
<v Speaker 1>He's so maybe,</v>

901
00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's benefit and not when you're early going,</v>

902
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 1>when you're learning technique more and you're really learning timing and</v>

903
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:05.270
<v Speaker 1>pacing.</v>

904
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe then is when you should spar,</v>

905
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.790
<v Speaker 1>like way more technical.</v>

906
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.520
<v Speaker 1>But then when you get older and you're better,</v>

907
00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 1>like maybe you need the fear of an actual fight and then then you can just slide</v>

908
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:19.030
<v Speaker 1>right into the fight.</v>

909
00:25:19.031 --> 00:25:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Smart cause you're now also cause your head movements better.</v>

910
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Your mood.</v>

911
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

912
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Smarter,</v>

913
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.810
<v Speaker 1>protect yourself more.</v>

914
00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:26.840
<v Speaker 1>But the danger is still a hundred percent real so that we're aware of all the</v>

915
00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:27.480
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

916
00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

917
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.120
<v Speaker 1>So that way when you're in a fight,</v>

918
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.860
<v Speaker 1>it feels exactly like your training.</v>

919
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:31.723
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad idea.</v>

920
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Useful,</v>

921
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.841
<v Speaker 1>but you're already there.</v>

922
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:34.790
<v Speaker 1>You're already at a high level of proficiency.</v>

923
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.260
<v Speaker 1>You already have the tools.</v>

924
00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Did I really think that there's an a real issue with fighters and this is a</v>

925
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:45.170
<v Speaker 1>impossible to tell after it's over right after the career's over.</v>

926
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:45.801
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

927
00:25:45.801 --> 00:25:47.150
<v Speaker 1>why did they do it this way?</v>

928
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.590
<v Speaker 1>What if they had done it that way?</v>

929
00:25:48.591 --> 00:25:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would've worked better.</v>

930
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:49.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

931

00:29:18.681 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 1>He has smokers.</v>

1067
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody knows Mario Lopez smokers.</v>

1068
00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:29:22.211 --> 00:29:22.501

00:29:22.501 --> 00:29:23.910
<v Speaker 1>He smoker gets a friend of mine.</v>

1071
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I think Frank Gallo it.</v>

1072
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:25.861
<v Speaker 1>Fuck him up.</v>

1073
00:29:25.861 --> 00:29:26.070
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1074
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.780
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>

1075
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Dario.</v>

1076
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I know he punched Acey Slade and I do,</v>

1077
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.510
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

1078
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I've trained with frank man.</v>

1079
00:29:33.721 --> 00:29:35.100
<v Speaker 1>He's feisty one.</v>

1080
00:29:35.101 --> 00:29:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1081
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I believe you.</v>

1082
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:36.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1083
00:29:36.211 --> 00:29:36.960
<v Speaker 1>he looks tough,</v>

1084
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.010
<v Speaker 1>but Lopez can fight.</v>

1085
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1086
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:39.743
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1087
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I think you need is a</v>

1089
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.551
<v Speaker 2>wildcard.</v>

1090
00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:44.590
<v Speaker 2>West for wafer carries himself.</v>

1091
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the reasons why I think he really knows how to box when I'm</v>

1092
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:48.340
<v Speaker 2>around really arrogant way.</v>

1093
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Not really arrogant,</v>

1094
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1095
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.440

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.460
<v Speaker 2>he knows how to fight.</v>

1097
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.230
<v Speaker 2>He's a nice guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Totally lights weren't on there.</v>

1116
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:18.723
<v Speaker 2>What a great.</v>

1117
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.430
<v Speaker 2>And he's also an author and he,</v>

1118
00:30:21.431 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1119
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.640
<v Speaker 2>he runs like crazy marathons and shit now too.</v>

1120
00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't he still dicking girls down?</v>

1121
00:30:26.301 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 2>It was just older,</v>

1122
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

1123
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1124
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.460
<v Speaker 2>he had an amateur fight.</v>

1125
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.570
<v Speaker 2>He used to go to 10th planet.</v>

1126
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.733
<v Speaker 2>Really Nice Guy.</v>

1127
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 2>And he had an amateur fight with Mario Lopez.</v>

1128
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.390
<v Speaker 2>He had one of them smokers.</v>

1129
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you go day?</v>

1130
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Mario dropped him,</v>

1131
00:30:39.401 --> 00:30:44.020
<v Speaker 2>I think ac Slater fuck the most and Mara Matas either stopped him or he won,</v>

1132
00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:44.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1133
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.333
<v Speaker 2>a decision,</v>

1134
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.260
<v Speaker 2>but Tyler dropped him Tarla drop morrow.</v>

1135
00:30:48.261 --> 00:30:49.150
<v Speaker 2>So it was a real fight.</v>

1136
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:49.930
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

1137
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 2>that to me like,</v>

1138
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:52.180
<v Speaker 2>because Tyler was jacked,</v>

1139
00:30:52.181 --> 00:30:53.770
<v Speaker 2>he was like super powerful back then.</v>

1140
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.540
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if he can come back from getting dropped and still win,</v>

1141
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1142
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.180

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:00.871
<v Speaker 2>no shit too.</v>

1144
00:31:00.871 --> 00:31:03.910

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:08.853

1148
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see him do something.</v>

1149
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.390
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen him actually box somebody.</v>

1150
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:13.751

1490
00:40:19.691 --> 00:40:20.524
<v Speaker 1>I knew what it was.</v>

1491
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:20.891

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1496
00:40:25.151 --> 00:40:25.331
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

00:40:25.331 --> 00:40:26.350
<v Speaker 1>you just don't know what it is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>well listen,</v>

1500
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

1501
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Why did a style and aesthetics,</v>

1502
00:40:31.811 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 1>why did that become a homosexual activity only or a female?</v>

1505
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:37.920
<v Speaker 1>this is why.</v>

1506
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Because I bought that shit because sometimes people want to staple a regular</v>

1507
00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:43.570
<v Speaker 1>shirt on the outside of a tee shirt.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pretend it's not.</v>

1509
00:40:44.261 --> 00:40:45.070
<v Speaker 1>We're talking to you.</v>

1510
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 1>That's not fashion.</v>

1511
00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.141
<v Speaker 1>How many times,</v>

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:11.563
<v Speaker 1>It's up there.</v>

1530
00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:15.040
<v Speaker 1>There's two things you can't do ever again.</v>

1531
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:16.450
<v Speaker 1>After tropic thunder.</v>

1532
00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:19.650
<v Speaker 1>You can't be a white guy wearing blackface pretty cheap.</v>

1533
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 1>You can't say retard.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1538
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.140
<v Speaker 1>But remember you never go full retard.</v>

1539
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was one of the big lines in the movie.</v>

1540
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.280
<v Speaker 1>You literally do that today.</v>

1541
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't play,</v>

1542
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:37.580
<v Speaker 1>you can't make fun of playing a real person,</v>

1543
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.100
<v Speaker 1>like four people that had done blackface since this,</v>

1544
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean a deal from Saturday night live.</v>

1545
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1546
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.113
<v Speaker 1>there's a list of them.</v>

1547
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1548
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:45.680
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

1549
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.330
<v Speaker 1>I just a major motion picture.</v>

1550
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Not a major motion picture,</v>

1551
00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:49.650
<v Speaker 1>but Saturday night live.</v>

1552
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Even if I'm wrong,</v>

1553
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:52.850
<v Speaker 1>like exactly.</v>

1554
00:41:52.851 --> 00:41:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone did it afterwards and culturally like that is the last big moment.</v>

1555
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.170
<v Speaker 1>You might be right that other people have done it since then.</v>

1556
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It's find out what was the last time someone black face in the movie?</v>

1557
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Did you know what Dave Chappelle,</v>

1558
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Dave Chappelle does white face that doesn't care Mexican aisle.</v>

1559
00:42:08.991 --> 00:42:09.860
<v Speaker 1>That was years ago.</v>

1560
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:14.210
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't extra time out on the Chappelle show 10 years ago and he's also</v>

1561
00:42:14.211 --> 00:42:15.044
<v Speaker 1>doesn't count.</v>

1562
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:17.930
<v Speaker 1>White faced is not the same as black face.</v>

1563
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Black face existed back in the Al Jolson days.</v>

1564
00:42:20.901 --> 00:42:21.734
<v Speaker 1>He ever see that shit.</v>

00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Like when the minstrel quite guys on black dudes,</v>

1567
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.140

1568
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:27.620
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1569
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1570
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:29.631
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Doug does.</v>

1579
00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 1>So racer and he would have to have white lips.</v>

1580
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Is that this?</v>

1581
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Does that make it official?</v>

1582
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he looks just like a regular black.</v>

1583
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 1>They just made it to hit lips look bigger.</v>

1584
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:45.493
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the,</v>

1585
00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:47.750
<v Speaker 1>that's what the white does.</v>

1586
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.340
<v Speaker 1>100% yeah,</v>

1587
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.561
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1588
00:42:49.561 --> 00:42:53.720
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to make him have exaggerated looking lips because in contrast to</v>

1589
00:42:53.721 --> 00:42:54.554
<v Speaker 1>the black,</v>

1590
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.490
<v Speaker 1>it looks like lips.</v>

1591
00:42:55.491 --> 00:42:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Just like when a girl puts lipstick and she outlines it outside of her lips,</v>

1592
00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:00.320
<v Speaker 1>makes her lips look bigger.</v>

1593
00:43:00.321 --> 00:43:01.790
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what these people are doing.</v>

1594
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 1>So this is what they did and they wouldn't let black people in the movies.</v>

1595
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Black people couldn't be like the star of a movie.</v>

1596
00:43:07.191 --> 00:43:10.730
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have to be a white guy playing a black guy in black face.</v>

1597
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Did you see Sean White dress up as simple jacking?</v>

1598
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Got Roasted for it?</v>

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:15.350

1600
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1601
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Shaun white is the Olympic snowboarder.</v>

1602
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Monster gold medalists.</v>

1607
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.470
<v Speaker 1>But the gender thing isn't there like 60 some genders.</v>

1608
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:35.250
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to be a bunch of different gender Telmo now like six,</v>

1609
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:35.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1611
00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.040
<v Speaker 1>but they don't,</v>

1612
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.290
<v Speaker 1>they're not saying is 60 genders,</v>

1613
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.440
<v Speaker 1>but what they are saying is they should have the right to dictate what pronoun</v>

1614
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:48.680
<v Speaker 1>that that you use instead of him or her.</v>

1615
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.390
<v Speaker 1>If they want like Xer orZ ,</v>

1616
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.820
<v Speaker 1>they make up a bunch of these wacky,</v>

1618
00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:55.250
<v Speaker 1>There's man,</v>

1619
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.113
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

1620
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:57.223
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1621
00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:57.861
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1622
00:43:57.861 --> 00:43:58.700
<v Speaker 1>born as man,</v>

1623
00:43:58.701 --> 00:44:01.220
<v Speaker 1>but it woman inside woman,</v>

1624
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:02.120
<v Speaker 1>born woman,</v>

1625
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:03.210
<v Speaker 1>but man inside.</v>

1626
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:09.010
<v Speaker 1>And then the fifth one might be a man who feels like he's man and woman and</v>

1627
00:44:09.831 --> 00:44:11.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're six or seven.</v>

1628
00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:12.003
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

1629
00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.380
<v Speaker 1>how many associate with that though?</v>

1630
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Some of them say they don't associate with them.</v>

1631
00:44:17.091 --> 00:44:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Then there's asexual that seven,</v>

1632
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.040
<v Speaker 1>like one hand sexual guy who doesn't think he's a guy or a girl.</v>

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Fridays,</v>

1642
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.161
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night.</v>

00:44:35.161 --> 00:44:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking chick.</v>

1644
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:36.241
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1645
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:37.074
<v Speaker 1>Gender fluid.</v>

1646
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:37.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1647
00:44:37.861 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 1>they go back and forth.</v>

1648
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why there was a whole radio on the weekend.</v>

1649
00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:46.950
<v Speaker 1>There was a whole radio lab podcasts about it and I was laughing my ass off when</v>

1650
00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:47.401
<v Speaker 1>I was listening.</v>

1651
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:48.210
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

1652
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:51.470
<v Speaker 1>there's parts of it that it was so preposterous because it was a guy who would</v>

1653
00:44:51.471 --> 00:44:55.440
<v Speaker 1>just decide while he's talking and he's a girl and because this is like a super</v>

1654
00:44:55.441 --> 00:44:58.830
<v Speaker 1>progressive show cause radio lab is this like really well made,</v>

1655
00:44:58.831 --> 00:44:59.664
<v Speaker 1>really high,</v>

1656
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.160
<v Speaker 1>fucking super well edited.</v>

1657
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:03.400
<v Speaker 1>They connect.</v>

1658
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:08.410
<v Speaker 1>They literally can't say this guy might have some problems with his perception</v>

1659
00:45:08.531 --> 00:45:09.121
<v Speaker 1>to reality.</v>

1660
00:45:09.121 --> 00:45:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1661
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.340
<v Speaker 1>This might not just be a gender thing or maybe it is a gender thing or is it</v>

1662
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:13.243
<v Speaker 1>split?</v>

1663
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1664
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:15.960
<v Speaker 1>but you have to have both options on the table.</v>

1665
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy might be fucking crazy and he,</v>

1666
00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:19.111
<v Speaker 1>the guy was a man.</v>

1667
00:45:19.111 --> 00:45:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Then you just go,</v>

1668
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.693
<v Speaker 1>oh I just flipped.</v>

1669
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.421
<v Speaker 1>I just flipped him.</v>

1670
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:21.751
<v Speaker 1>The woman,</v>

1671
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:23.010
<v Speaker 1>now it's this size.</v>

1672
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:24.451
<v Speaker 1>He goes back,</v>

1673
00:45:24.451 --> 00:45:25.284
<v Speaker 1>he's the man again,</v>

1674
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.690
<v Speaker 1>but you can't,</v>

1675
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.980
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to gender,</v>

1676
00:45:28.981 --> 00:45:29.501
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

1677
00:45:29.501 --> 00:45:30.420
<v Speaker 1>because he get mad.</v>

1678
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.790
<v Speaker 1>You can't have these thoughts.</v>

1679
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:34.020
<v Speaker 1>You can't question.</v>

1680
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.090
<v Speaker 1>You can't cause I don't know.</v>

1681
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.953
<v Speaker 1>I'm not him.</v>

1682
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:37.883
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1683
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's a thing.</v>

1684
00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you do just flip back and forth from feeling like you're a guy or feeling</v>

1685
00:45:42.061 --> 00:45:42.894
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>

1686
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.000
<v Speaker 1>or maybe that's crazy.</v>

1687
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.700
<v Speaker 1>That's possible to be fucking crazy.</v>

1688
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Then it might be some kind of delusion that's involved in this.</v>

1689
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:51.091
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1690
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:51.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe or,</v>

1691
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:52.501
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>

1692
00:45:52.501 --> 00:45:53.250
<v Speaker 1>if he wants to do that,</v>

1693
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a flying shit,</v>

1694
00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:57.070
<v Speaker 1>but don't get mad at me if I don't call you the right prone.</v>

1695
00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.050
<v Speaker 1>If I don't call him right now,</v>

1696
00:45:59.160 --> 00:45:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1697
00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.500
<v Speaker 1>We don't know if he did get mad or she got mad depending on who she was.</v>

1698
00:46:02.501 --> 00:46:07.501
<v Speaker 1>And what percentage is there a high rate of suicide for people?</v>

1699
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.610
<v Speaker 1>For dudes that chop their dicks off transgender.</v>

1700
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1701
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.270
<v Speaker 1>50% think whether or not they go through the operation.</v>

1702
00:46:15.271 --> 00:46:17.130
<v Speaker 1>There's still a very high rate of suicide,</v>

1703
00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:17.610
<v Speaker 1>but trash.</v>

1704
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1705
00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:18.420
<v Speaker 1>transgenders,</v>

1706
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.420
<v Speaker 1>50% so here's the,</v>

1707
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:20.910
<v Speaker 1>you cut off your Dick.</v>

1708
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.910
<v Speaker 1>You should be on suicide watch,</v>

1709
00:46:23.911 --> 00:46:24.450

1710
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's huge.</v>

1711
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1712
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:26.911
<v Speaker 1>it's huge,</v>

1713
00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:30.660
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's affected them that they regret come their dicks off.</v>

1714
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Put the no the hormones.</v>

1715
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.280

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1770
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.340
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about chicks with dicks and the</v>

1771
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.520
<v Speaker 2>cut it off.</v>

1772
00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:53.880

<v Speaker 2>keep it.</v>

1774
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Keep the fun.</v>

1775
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1776
00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I mix it up.</v>

1777
00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.630
<v Speaker 2>It's plenty of dudes will suck it.</v>

1778
00:47:58.660 --> 00:47:59.493
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1779
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.131
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

1780
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1781
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:01.780
<v Speaker 2>That's probably a big number.</v>

1782
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:02.643
<v Speaker 2>Go to Germany.</v>

1783
00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:04.531
<v Speaker 2>You go to Germany,</v>

1784
00:48:04.531 --> 00:48:05.590
<v Speaker 2>he west Hollywood up the street.</v>

1785
00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 2>But the question is like,</v>

1786
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:10.420
<v Speaker 2>do they get suicidal because they're not accepted early in life?</v>

1787
00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I think the real question,</v>

1788
00:48:11.531 --> 00:48:13.690
<v Speaker 2>because this is what a lot of the thought is,</v>

1789
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:17.830
<v Speaker 2>is that they develop their self esteem when they're very young and went there,</v>

1790
00:48:17.831 --> 00:48:21.820
<v Speaker 2>you very young and they're a boy and they wish they were a girl and then they</v>

1791
00:48:21.821 --> 00:48:24.700
<v Speaker 2>get picked on for that or they get fucked with for that.</v>

1792
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.890
<v Speaker 2>That becomes like this very,</v>

1793
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:27.763
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1794
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:32.910
<v Speaker 2>very awful connection with this terrible memory in this terrible feeling that</v>

1795
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:34.860
<v Speaker 2>you feel around people who,</v>

1796
00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:39.250
<v Speaker 2>who hate you just because you're different and then you are as an adult.</v>

1797
00:48:39.251 --> 00:48:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1798
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And then who knows what else comes into play there.</v>

1799
00:48:42.071 --> 00:48:42.904
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1800
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:43.450

<v Speaker 2>Like you get it when you grow up in the hood.</v>

1853
00:50:08.441 --> 00:50:13.280
<v Speaker 2>A lot of violence around a lot of [inaudible] with a different perspective when</v>

1854
00:50:13.281 --> 00:50:14.001
<v Speaker 2>you grow up,</v>

1855
00:50:14.001 --> 00:50:17.510
<v Speaker 2>a little shell shocked and um,</v>

1856
00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.383
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

1857
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:24.480
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy way to develop,</v>

1858
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:24.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1859
00:50:24.931 --> 00:50:25.764

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Well thank God for these pills that you could take.</v>

1861
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1862
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:32.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if those are the answer or there aren't they,</v>

1863
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 2>but are they the answer for some people sometime I think.</v>

1864
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1865
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1866
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:36.201
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

1867
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:36.391
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1868
00:50:36.391 --> 00:50:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Some people were on hanging on by a thread there hanging out on by a thread and</v>

1869
00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:45.390
<v Speaker 2>someone comes along and they offer them chemical escape from the,</v>

1870
00:50:45.391 --> 00:50:48.650
<v Speaker 2>the just the fucking sheer misery of being alive.</v>

1871
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 2>And then it puts them in a place where they can think about things,</v>

1872
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.400
<v Speaker 2>does it,</v>

1873
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 2>where they can think about it.</v>

1874
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Cause when you hear like a Neil Brennan or,</v>

1875
00:50:55.881 --> 00:50:59.450

<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1886
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.983
<v Speaker 2>he's going through it.</v>

1891
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't feel anything.</v>

1892
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:21.710
<v Speaker 2>They don't feel anything man.</v>

1893
00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:22.941
<v Speaker 2>That's terrible,</v>

1894
00:51:22.941 --> 00:51:23.690
<v Speaker 2>weird way to go.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well do you know depression again?</v>

1896
00:51:25.251 --> 00:51:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1897
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 2>like what we were talking about earlier,</v>

1898
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:27.770
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1899
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:28.730
<v Speaker 2>it's on a spectrum,</v>

1900
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.110
<v Speaker 2>just like mental illness,</v>

1901
00:51:30.111 --> 00:51:33.740
<v Speaker 2>just like all kinds of other different things that occur in people because</v>

1902
00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:35.030
<v Speaker 2>everyone deals with depression.</v>

1903
00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:36.240
<v Speaker 2>We've all been little Preston,</v>

1904
00:51:36.241 --> 00:51:38.820
<v Speaker 2>but some people it sticks like you can't get out of it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And Anti conspiracy theory pill when you get take a blue,</v>

1906
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.880
<v Speaker 2>the blue pill,</v>

1907
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.990
<v Speaker 2>like on the weekends you don't want to hit up out false flags or nothing.</v>

1908
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.990
<v Speaker 2>He does go out and just have fun and dude,</v>

1909
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Arusha footjoy the marsh fee are used.</v>

1910
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.130
<v Speaker 2>This is why I have its opinion on this.</v>

1911
00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.370
<v Speaker 2>You should fear used antidepressants correctly.</v>

1912
00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.690
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1913
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:00.071
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1914
00:52:00.071 --> 00:52:03.500
<v Speaker 2>he had to try a couple of different kinds and figure out which one really worked</v>

1915
00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:04.310
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>

1916
00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:06.170
<v Speaker 2>But once he did it helped him.</v>

1917
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.030
<v Speaker 2>I saw it help and he's a happy guy.</v>

1918
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 2>He turned his life around.</v>

1919
00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:10.830
<v Speaker 2>He see,</v>

1920
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:13.380
<v Speaker 2>he got on the antidepressants and knees.</v>

1921
00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:14.660
<v Speaker 2>He talks about this openly.</v>

1922
00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Never share too though.</v>

1923
00:52:16.071 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1924
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:17.370
<v Speaker 2>He got successful.</v>

1925
00:52:17.371 --> 00:52:18.500
<v Speaker 2>It helps as well.</v>

1926
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:19.070
<v Speaker 2>He's still on him.</v>

1927
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.330
<v Speaker 2>But who knows what came first?</v>

1928
00:52:20.331 --> 00:52:21.200
<v Speaker 2>The chicken or the egg?</v>

1929
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:21.561
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1930
00:52:21.561 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 2>he weaned himself off of them.</v>

1931
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.790
<v Speaker 2>But he got on them and they helped him.</v>

1932
00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:28.400
<v Speaker 2>And why did he have to wean himself off as the health?</v>

1933
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Because he didn't think that he needed him anymore.</v>

1934
00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:35.060
<v Speaker 2>He thought that he was leaning on them as a crutch and he would kind of reset</v>

1935
00:52:35.061 --> 00:52:37.520
<v Speaker 2>his mind and change your way of thinking.</v>

1936
00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1937
00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:38.721
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

1938
00:52:38.721 --> 00:52:38.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1939
00:52:38.901 --> 00:52:39.060
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1940
00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.400
<v Speaker 2>he and I talked about it and I'm,</v>

1941
00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:40.681
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1942
00:52:40.681 --> 00:52:41.514
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1943
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember exactly how he put it,</v>

1944
00:52:44.931 --> 00:52:46.550
<v Speaker 2>but essentially it was what he was saying.</v>

1945
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I got another one to be some limit that the Olympia,</v>

1946
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:48.960
<v Speaker 2>you gotta taste.</v>

1947
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1948
00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Olympia Shit.</v>

1949
00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.100
<v Speaker 2>It's delicious.</v>

1950
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.280
<v Speaker 2>Just something about beer in a can.</v>

1951
00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.001
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

1952
00:52:56.001 --> 00:52:56.151
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

1953
00:52:56.151 --> 00:53:00.680
<v Speaker 2>my mouth was watering like a crack head beer in a can.</v>

1954
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1955
00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:02.591
<v Speaker 2>But with art,</v>

1956
00:53:02.591 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like success to make you happy.</v>

1957
00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:04.601
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1958
00:53:04.601 --> 00:53:05.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1959
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.430
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1960
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:06.010
<v Speaker 2>That man,</v>

1961
00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:06.920
<v Speaker 2>he's killing it.</v>

1962
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:07.521
<v Speaker 2>He's killing it.</v>

1963
00:53:07.521 --> 00:53:09.290
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure that had something to do with it.</v>

1964
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:11.910
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you get on it discounted.</v>

1965
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.300
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's a lot of things going on.</v>

1966
00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:15.243
<v Speaker 2>The depression,</v>

1967
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.580
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the things you can't,</v>

1968
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:21.790
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to narrow things down plus or minus and thinking that it's one thing</v>

1969
00:53:22.131 --> 00:53:25.380
<v Speaker 2>that's causing you to be happy or one thing that's caused db to be sad.</v>

1970
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

1971
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 4>very likely there's a bunch of different shit going on.</v>

1972
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:29.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1973
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:30.000
<v Speaker 4>you gotta,</v>

1974
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.750
<v Speaker 4>you gotta remind yourself every day of how lucky you are.</v>

1975
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:33.901
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1976
00:53:33.901 --> 00:53:34.450
<v Speaker 4>It's tough.</v>

1977
00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:35.100
<v Speaker 4>That's tough.</v>

1978
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.930
<v Speaker 4>Fucking Thomas on realistic.</v>

1979
00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

1980
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:38.851
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

1981
00:53:38.851 --> 00:53:39.684
<v Speaker 4>You could do it.</v>

1982
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.940
<v Speaker 4>It's just like working out.</v>

1983
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:42.720
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1984
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.441
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

1985
00:53:43.441 --> 00:53:45.630
<v Speaker 4>You could put yourself an hour,</v>

1986
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:46.770
<v Speaker 4>hour and a half thinking one way.</v>

1987
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:47.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to work out.</v>

1988
00:53:47.611 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>

1989
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:50.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fucking focus on,</v>

1990
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:52.110
<v Speaker 4>on getting stronger today.</v>

1991
00:53:52.111 --> 00:53:54.510
<v Speaker 4>Focus on the reps and all the sets and my routine.</v>

1992
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:56.940
<v Speaker 4>You'll apply that to,</v>

1993
00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:57.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1994

1995
00:53:58.231 --> 00:54:00.960
<v Speaker 4>Just think about all the shit you've accomplished.</v>

1996
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:02.010
<v Speaker 4>Think about the money.</v>

1997
00:54:02.011 --> 00:54:06.870
<v Speaker 4>Have think about how lucky you are that you don't live in fucking Liberia or</v>

1998
00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:08.610
<v Speaker 4>Guatemala or some shit.</v>

1999
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:11.580
<v Speaker 4>You could be in that caravan right now with the backpack throwing rocks.</v>

2000
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.330
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2001
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:13.021
<v Speaker 4>So if you,</v>

2002
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:13.681

<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>

2004

<v Speaker 4>that's the real shit though.</v>

2005
00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:16.950
<v Speaker 4>That's not an illusion.</v>

2006
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.920
<v Speaker 4>The real shit is that you should be thankful.</v>

2007
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.560
<v Speaker 4>The fake shit is not being thankful.</v>

2008
00:54:22.561 --> 00:54:23.394
<v Speaker 4>That's the fake shit.</v>

2009
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.090
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2010
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:25.190
<v Speaker 4>that's the illusion.</v>

2011
00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.410
<v Speaker 4>It's not because you're so caught up in like your daily life,</v>

2012
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:28.951
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that.</v>

2017
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:41.160
<v Speaker 4>I had a little bit of a scare with my son and it was like nothing else mattered.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

2025
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:46.201
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Importunate would it be want man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>just make him make it.</v>

2028
00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:49.621
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2029
00:54:49.621 --> 00:54:51.030
<v Speaker 4>maybe you have a verbal portion for real.</v>

2030
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:51.721
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2032
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a shit.</v>

2033
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2034
00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:55.470
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

2035
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:59.250
<v Speaker 4>That's course like if you found out you had five minutes to leave to live,</v>

2036
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:01.620
<v Speaker 4>all you would think about is your kid.</v>

2037
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:03.540
<v Speaker 4>That's all you would think about it.</v>

2038
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:04.830
<v Speaker 4>Well I just got evacuated,</v>

2039
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:08.520
<v Speaker 4>evacuated from my house cause the fires fires,</v>

2040
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:10.410
<v Speaker 4>they're everywhere.</v>

2041
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:12.833
<v Speaker 4>They're everywhere.</v>

2042
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:13.710
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

2043
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:14.461
<v Speaker 4>they're in.</v>

2044
00:55:14.461 --> 00:55:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2045
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:19.560
<v Speaker 4>they ended evacuated like thousand oaks and they evacuated places in Westlake</v>

2046
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 4>and cigarettes out.</v>

2047
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:25.200
<v Speaker 4>Apparently this fire that we have here is nothing in comparison to the fire</v>

2048
00:55:25.201 --> 00:55:26.190
<v Speaker 4>that's in upstate.</v>

2049
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.260
<v Speaker 4>What further up northern?</v>

2050
00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:31.080
<v Speaker 4>The northern California fires supposed to be even more severe.</v>

2051
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.840
<v Speaker 4>They were saying that northern California fire was moving it.</v>

2052
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.970
<v Speaker 4>What was the number of something insane?</v>

2053
00:55:35.971 --> 00:55:37.890
<v Speaker 4>Like 80 football fields a minute.</v>

2054
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:39.780
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't that what every label it?</v>

2055
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:41.460
<v Speaker 4>The biggest fire California ever.</v>

2056
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:44.460
<v Speaker 4>The biggest fire going on right now in northern California to northern</v>

2057
00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:45.060
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>

2058
00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:50.010
<v Speaker 4>It's craziest as a how damaged cars are getting there.</v>

2059
00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:52.630
<v Speaker 4>Like melt at cars are melted.</v>

2060
00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.890
<v Speaker 4>This bus,</v>

2061
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:57.030
<v Speaker 4>this bus that looked like it was bombed.</v>

2062
00:55:57.031 --> 00:55:57.864
<v Speaker 4>Like how was,</v>

2063
00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.120
<v Speaker 4>how were fired?</v>

2064
00:55:59.121 --> 00:56:00.270
<v Speaker 4>We know how it's done in that.</v>

2065
00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:00.851
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2066
00:56:00.851 --> 00:56:03.960
<v Speaker 4>It's always the worst when it's like some fucking asshole started it.</v>

2067
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:04.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2068
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:05.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they know.</v>

2069
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:06.510
<v Speaker 4>Crikey.</v>

2070
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:08.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they know direct energy weapons.</v>

2071
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:12.210
<v Speaker 4>It happened right outside of a rocket dyne.</v>

2072
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:14.490
<v Speaker 4>That's where it happened,</v>

2073
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:15.743
<v Speaker 4>which is a,</v>

2074
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:17.010
<v Speaker 4>it's like a rocket.</v>

2075
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.620
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen those pictures of the cars with their,</v>

2076
00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:21.570
<v Speaker 4>the rims are melting.</v>

2077
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 4>How hot do forest fires get?</v>

2078
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.180
<v Speaker 1>They get hot as fuck.</v>

2079
00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:29.050
<v Speaker 1>How is steel mill out of aluminum?</v>

2080
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of aluminum wheels.</v>

2081
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.990
<v Speaker 1>The frame doesn't show just so goddamn blurb.</v>

2082
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:34.781
<v Speaker 1>Aluminum wheels,</v>

2083
00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:35.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2084
00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2085
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Halloween.</v>

2086
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Regular fire melts aluminum.</v>

2087
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a regular fire will melt.</v>

2088
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Your tires are going to let you know me,</v>

2089
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:44.501
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2090
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:45.334
<v Speaker 1>You're asking me.</v>

2091
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:49.030
<v Speaker 1>You're asking me do I think about who you're talking to right now?</v>

2092
00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.650
<v Speaker 1>You got a couple of factors here that I would just take into account.</v>

2093
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Not being a fire expert,</v>

2094
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.120
<v Speaker 1>but one of them want to think it would be.</v>

2095
00:56:55.121 --> 00:56:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Tires.</v>

2096
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Tires are super flammable.</v>

2097
00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Once your tires catch fire,</v>

2098
00:56:58.781 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 1>they're all made out of rubber and all kinds of other plastics and shit.</v>

2099
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking Flambeau.</v>

2100
00:57:06.401 --> 00:57:08.320
<v Speaker 1>They go black smoke.</v>

2101
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:09.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy smoke.</v>

2102
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:12.250
<v Speaker 1>That's why the cartel used and when they kill people that put them into the</v>

2103
00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.273
<v Speaker 1>fucking</v>

2104
00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:14.491
<v Speaker 1>Dow.</v>

2105
00:57:14.491 --> 00:57:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Some with like lighter fluid and I don't know.</v>

2106
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:21.550
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I was going to say is gasoline cars are fueled by gasoline.</v>

2107
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Gasoline there you got fire,</v>

2108
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 1>you got insane heat.</v>

2109
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.600
<v Speaker 1>The whole car gets in golf,</v>

2110
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.050
<v Speaker 1>the gas tank erupts.</v>

2111
00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:32.020
<v Speaker 1>You got fucking temperatures that are like,</v>

2112
00:57:32.021 --> 00:57:34.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like basically having an inferno right there.</v>

2113
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:35.284
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

2114
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:40.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not a fire like oh a fucking phone book caught on fire and it melted a</v>

2115
00:57:40.211 --> 00:57:40.750
<v Speaker 1>wheel.</v>

2116
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:41.081
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2117
00:57:41.081 --> 00:57:46.081
<v Speaker 1>it's like a giant combustion engine that works on gasoline and has these rubber</v>

2118
00:57:48.281 --> 00:57:52.960
<v Speaker 1>stopper flammable tires and it's covered by a plastic paint that's probably</v>

2119
00:57:52.961 --> 00:57:53.870
<v Speaker 1>slammed Hobos,</v>

2120
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:56.860
<v Speaker 1>flammable and this shit all gets hit.</v>

2121
00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Insides of leather with fire that's coming from 50 mile an hour wind and fire</v>

2122
00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:02.741
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>

2123
00:58:02.741 --> 00:58:05.020
<v Speaker 1>And then about like the the registration.</v>

2124
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.730
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

2125
00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm just trying to be funny.</v>

2126
00:58:10.201 --> 00:58:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh I'm sorry.</v>

2127
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:12.063
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were serious.</v>

2128
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Look at these cars.</v>

2129
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 1>These cars got murked.</v>

2130
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:20.280
<v Speaker 1>This is like what happened when I met Loki on the Avengers.</v>

2131
00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.210
<v Speaker 1>They fucking destroyed Eddie.</v>

2132
00:58:25.211 --> 00:58:26.830
<v Speaker 1>That the heat makes them shatter.</v>

2133
00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 1>They fall apart.</v>

2134
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.550
<v Speaker 1>If you ever get a glass too hot,</v>

2135
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.000
<v Speaker 1>you ever have a glass get too hot?</v>

2136
00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:32.830
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2137
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:35.110
<v Speaker 1>If you pour tea in a regular glass,</v>

2138
00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:35.944
<v Speaker 1>they crack.</v>

2139
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:41.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's not even that hot cause it team makes them expand the,</v>

2140
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:42.201
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2141
00:58:42.201 --> 00:58:43.270
<v Speaker 1>the heat from the T.</v>

2142
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.440
<v Speaker 1>You're not buying it Hoodie.</v>

2143
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno man.</v>

2144
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Well it was fires aware.</v>

2145
00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:47.820
<v Speaker 1>This is what I would suggest.</v>

2146
00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't look into it.</v>

2147
00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Try Shit.</v>

2148
00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:54.760
<v Speaker 1>You know me affected by the fires.</v>

2149
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:55.653
<v Speaker 1>Fires.</v>

2150
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:56.381
<v Speaker 1>If CNN,</v>

2151
00:58:56.381 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 1>if the headline says anything,</v>

2152
00:58:59.080 --> 00:58:59.711
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>

2153
00:58:59.711 --> 00:58:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Any,</v>

2154
00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:00.763
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2155
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:02.560
<v Speaker 1>That's true Eddie.</v>

2156
00:59:02.561 --> 00:59:03.250
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2157
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Here's the beautiful thing about this fire.</v>

2158
00:59:04.811 --> 00:59:05.800
<v Speaker 1>You can fucking see it.</v>

2159
00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to one on another fire.</v>

2160
00:59:08.081 --> 00:59:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying like how it started.</v>

2161
00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:10.600
<v Speaker 1>This is what we're talking about.</v>

2162
00:59:10.601 --> 00:59:11.620
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about this fire.</v>

2163
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a fire for sure.</v>

2164
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Giant by the smoke.</v>

2165
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:16.690
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

2166
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.690
<v Speaker 1>There's some crazy people out there saying that um,</v>

2167
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.260
<v Speaker 1>being started by some fucking direct energy weapons.</v>

2168
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:24.891
<v Speaker 1>Adol no,</v>

2169
00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:26.420
<v Speaker 1>that's what the crazy people are saying.</v>

2170
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2171
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 1>fires happen all the time though.</v>

2172
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a natural,</v>

2173
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:33.110
<v Speaker 1>what's more likely that fires are happening.</v>

2174
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Like they always fucking happen from electric boxes going out or wires going</v>

2175
00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 1>down or people being assholes with cigarettes.</v>

2176
00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 1>That's how firefight before there was Illuminati,</v>

2177
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:47.000
<v Speaker 1>before there was anything,</v>

2178
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.260
<v Speaker 1>there was forest fires.</v>

2179
00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:49.340
<v Speaker 1>They had been around forever.</v>

2180
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.720
<v Speaker 1>This is not like a new occurrence.</v>

2181
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they using this secret energy weapon to do some shit that's never</v>

2182
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 1>been done before.</v>

2183
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:57.170
<v Speaker 1>How done when they're super energy weapon,</v>

2184
00:59:57.171 --> 00:59:58.250
<v Speaker 1>if they use it to start fires,</v>

2185
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.050
<v Speaker 1>there's just a lot of weird shit out there like that.</v>

2186
01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Houses like you can see house,</v>

2187
01:00:01.671 --> 01:00:02.001
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

2188
01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:02.540
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

2189
01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.570
<v Speaker 1>completely level all the trees around them.</v>

2190
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with the trees at all.</v>

2191
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>

2192
01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Just weird shit like that.</v>

2193
01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Well it's proud of knowing what these are here for the fire to make fucking</v>

2194
01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:17.450
<v Speaker 1>houses go up in flames because it's all dry old shit.</v>

2195
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.550
<v Speaker 1>So dry wood hood,</v>

2196
01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>you got dry old shit on the tile,</v>

2197
01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:22.850
<v Speaker 1>your tiles.</v>

2198
01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times these people have these um,</v>

2199
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:28.160
<v Speaker 1>these roofing tiles in the embers get in between there.</v>

2200
01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>It goes right into the tar.</v>

2201
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:30.284
<v Speaker 1>It burns it,</v>

2202
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>it goes right through my next door neighbor is his roof was on fire.</v>

2203
01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2204
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>done well.</v>

2205
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2206
01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:37.851
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2207
01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>they um,</v>

2208
01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:38.870
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2209
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:40.310
<v Speaker 1>they got to it in time.</v>

2210
01:00:40.311 --> 01:00:41.630
<v Speaker 1>The firefighters caught it.</v>

2211
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Actually my friend bud caught it,</v>

2212
01:00:43.221 --> 01:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>told the firefighters to bud.</v>

2213
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Bud Brotzmann.</v>

2214
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2215
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:47.200
<v Speaker 1>His house.</v>

2216
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:47.351
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2217
01:00:47.351 --> 01:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2218
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2219
01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:48.403
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't his house,</v>

2220
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>but it was my neighbor's house.</v>

2221
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.380
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

2222
01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>when this was all going down,</v>

2223
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.860
<v Speaker 1>this is happening all throughout,</v>

2224
01:00:54.861 --> 01:00:55.671
<v Speaker 1>not just here,</v>

2225
01:00:55.671 --> 01:01:00.671
<v Speaker 1>but all throughout Topanga now and Malibu and these embers fall from the sky and</v>

2226
01:01:00.981 --> 01:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>then they blew the light.</v>

2227
01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Everything up in flames because everywhere you look,</v>

2228
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.910
<v Speaker 1>everything is dry as fuck.</v>

2229
01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

2230
01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.920
<v Speaker 1>we haven't had any rain in a long ass time.</v>

2231
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:11.780
<v Speaker 1>If you go running in the trails,</v>

2232
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 1>it's just dust.</v>

2233
01:01:12.831 --> 01:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>You're kicking up dust,</v>

2234
01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>you start calling and you got the wins breads,</v>

2235
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

2236
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Everything's Brown and dried entity.</v>

2237
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>And when these embers fall from the sky and hit this shit,</v>

2238
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>it just starts up.</v>

2239
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.060
<v Speaker 1>We're just lucky.</v>

2240
01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:27.080
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen more often.</v>

2241
01:01:27.081 --> 01:01:27.914
<v Speaker 1>In fact though,</v>

2242
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.750
<v Speaker 1>it happened this time last year around here because we had a deal,</v>

2243
01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:35.600
<v Speaker 1>we had ash out in the gym area.</v>

2244
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>We had a sweep the ash out cause he had actually come in through cracks like</v>

2245
01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>little tiny cracks.</v>

2246
01:01:41.041 --> 01:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm bash,</v>

2247
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.660
<v Speaker 1>although my house from his fire all the way where I'm at,</v>

2248
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure,</v>

2249
01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's no joke.</v>

2250
01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Dude was two shifts IV.</v>

2251
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think it's an energy wave.</v>

2252
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>But I do think it's fucking super dangerous to live in a climate where there's</v>

2253
01:01:56.031 --> 01:01:59.330
<v Speaker 1>this much vegetation and not enough moisture.</v>

2254
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Like how come we can't figure out how to get that fucking water out of the ocean</v>

2255
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>and start spraying it all over so much water and you know,</v>

2256
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just so much.</v>

2257
01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>There's salt in it.</v>

2258
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>We can't fuck with it.</v>

2259
01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>The can't fuck with us all.</v>

2260
01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Feel like they can take the salt down until the can't fuck with the salt.</v>

2261
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.391
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2262
01:02:17.391 --> 01:02:17.451
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2263
01:02:17.451 --> 01:02:17.601
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2264
01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>They have desalination.</v>

2265
01:02:18.681 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Plants are just too expensive.</v>

2266
01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:20.911
<v Speaker 1>That's too expensive.</v>

2267
01:02:20.911 --> 01:02:21.741
<v Speaker 1>We can't afford that.</v>

2268
01:02:21.741 --> 01:02:23.210
<v Speaker 1>They say this Guy Holman.</v>

2269
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:24.031
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2270
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>if we only had more money we'd be able to do that.</v>

2271
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>But it's too expensive.</v>

2272
01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>The plants off the ocean water now they use all our water.</v>

2273
01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>If you got rid of almonds in California will be straight.</v>

2274
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.333
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2275
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>The almonds bro.</v>

2276
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Vegans consumed more almonds and then they were there.</v>

2277
01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>The reason why,</v>

2278
01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:40.840
<v Speaker 1>the reason why the word.</v>

2279
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how ironic that would be is there as almonds that we're doing this in</v>

2280
01:02:44.341 --> 01:02:45.174
<v Speaker 1>the whole time,</v>

2281
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>not cattle raising.</v>

2282
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Is fucking almond country rich enough to filter the salt out of water and use</v>

2283
01:02:53.431 --> 01:02:56.530
<v Speaker 1>the water for their country or is it just too expensive to buy?</v>

2284
01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I could do that shit.</v>

2285
01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2286
01:02:58.490 --> 01:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that much money</v>

2287
01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:02.730
<v Speaker 1>in a hotel.</v>

2288
01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.310
<v Speaker 1>They would roll out a carpet,</v>

2289
01:03:05.311 --> 01:03:09.320
<v Speaker 1>made a goal to do it slide and a gold surfboard in that fucking song.</v>

2290
01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:10.933
<v Speaker 1>Builders,</v>

2291
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.810
<v Speaker 1>like for the navy there's like a survivor filter that you could drink the</v>

2292
01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:17.600
<v Speaker 1>seawater and you could like suck and it's like this filter,</v>

2293
01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:18.600
<v Speaker 1>the survival thing.</v>

2294
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

2295
01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I know they have been drink piss,</v>

2296
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.790
<v Speaker 1>so they have those things for ponds,</v>

2297
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:25.790
<v Speaker 1>they have these things they're called steri pants.</v>

2298
01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Just can't figure out that seawater and this cannot go that out.</v>

2299
01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:30.830
<v Speaker 1>What's a high salt content?</v>

2300
01:03:30.831 --> 01:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>You too expensive.</v>

2301
01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Can't have that much salt content.</v>

2302
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.793
<v Speaker 1>What if?</v>

2303
01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:37.770
<v Speaker 1>What if we have a water tax?</v>

2304
01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.461
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2305
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:39.660
<v Speaker 1>We're running out of water.</v>

2306
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:43.470
<v Speaker 1>We got to figure out how to take the salt out of the seawater.</v>

2307
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is a,</v>

2308
01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:45.870
<v Speaker 1>we have a task.</v>

2309
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of fresh water though.</v>

2310
01:03:47.311 --> 01:03:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is a conspiracy.</v>

2311
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.081
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2312
01:03:49.081 --> 01:03:49.914
<v Speaker 1>You just said,</v>

2313
01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:53.580
<v Speaker 1>you just said how come we can't just take the fucking ocean water and I was just</v>

2314
01:03:53.581 --> 01:03:54.414
<v Speaker 1>being funny.</v>

2315
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why they can't.</v>

2316
01:03:55.591 --> 01:03:56.970
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking super expensive.</v>

2317
01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:57.361
<v Speaker 1>It's too,</v>

2318
01:03:57.361 --> 01:03:58.770
<v Speaker 1>it's just be a transplant.</v>

2319
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2320
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Well kind of much money to change the water and to do it all the time for all</v>

2321
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:07.083
<v Speaker 1>the people.</v>

2322
01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Just pull that water out and then who owns it?</v>

2323
01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if we bring some coke and from Central America and generate income that</v>

2324
01:04:14.641 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2325
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if we started sucking all the stuff out of the ocean.</v>

2326
01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:20.970
<v Speaker 1>The ocean started pushing back and then people started building houses in front</v>

2327
01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 1>of the people's houses in Malibu.</v>

2328
01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And at first they would,</v>

2329
01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:25.320
<v Speaker 1>at first they would go,</v>

2330
01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:26.070
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2331
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:26.910
<v Speaker 1>We have the beach.</v>

2332
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:27.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2333
01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:27.371
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2334
01:04:27.371 --> 01:04:27.541
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2335
01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:28.710
<v Speaker 1>But it's not the beach anymore.</v>

2336
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.120
<v Speaker 1>So basically just got an acre</v>

2337
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:33.600
<v Speaker 1>because I've read a book a mile,</v>

2338
01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:35.040
<v Speaker 1>just keep sucking water out.</v>

2339
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Imagine this like a mile to the beach now.</v>

2340
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.561
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2341
01:04:37.561 --> 01:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2342
01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:38.910
<v Speaker 1>all these Malveaux people,</v>

2343
01:04:38.911 --> 01:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>they show up at the fucking county board meetings,</v>

2344
01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.990
<v Speaker 1>pulling the water out of the ocean.</v>

2345
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>He turned around behind him.</v>

2346
01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a goddamn tropical jungle.</v>

2347
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>We got monkeys in La and parents and shit.</v>

2348
01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.113
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2349
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:54.030
<v Speaker 1>We turned it into the tropics when make it moist and delicious,</v>

2350
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:58.020
<v Speaker 1>that that would happen is a piece I'm gonna do a fight.</v>

2351
01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2357
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.000
<v Speaker 1>fallen on hard times a little bit.</v>

2358
01:05:03.001 --> 01:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>He was ranked fucking high for a while.</v>

2359
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:05.910
<v Speaker 1>He's a very good fighter.</v>

01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

2447
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:53.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2448
01:06:53.231 --> 01:06:53.891
<v Speaker 1>this guy over here,</v>

2449
01:06:53.891 --> 01:06:54.631
<v Speaker 1>he's 200 pounds with,</v>

2450
01:06:54.631 --> 01:06:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2451
01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I was one 92 last two,</v>

2452
01:06:57.281 --> 01:06:57.881
<v Speaker 1>my bad.</v>

2453
01:06:57.881 --> 01:06:58.690
<v Speaker 1>He'll get upset.</v>

2454
01:06:58.690 --> 01:06:59.523
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

2455
01:06:59.560 --> 01:06:59.951
<v Speaker 1>He'll give you,</v>

2456
01:06:59.951 --> 01:07:02.830
<v Speaker 1>try to gain an extra eight or 10 pounds on him.</v>

2457
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:04.270
<v Speaker 1>He's just a big lightweight.</v>

2458
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:04.990
<v Speaker 1>He's a big boy.</v>

2459
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:07.450
<v Speaker 1>He's a powerhouse in thinking about it.</v>

2460
01:07:07.451 --> 01:07:08.920
<v Speaker 1>That was my Perry's last fight.</v>

2461
01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Last when my Perry can outclassed him.</v>

2462
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:11.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2463
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:12.400
<v Speaker 1>what happened was,</v>

2464
01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.293
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2465
01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.950
<v Speaker 1>he bounced his forearm off of Mike Perez head early on in the fight and he's</v>

2466
01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:22.360
<v Speaker 1>spinning back fist at him and hit him with this part of the forearm right in the</v>

2467
01:07:22.361 --> 01:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>forehead and snapped his arm and half his arm.</v>

2468
01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.580
<v Speaker 1>So he's fighting with one arm and fought like that for three rounds,</v>

2469
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.720
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't wrestle.</v>

2470
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:29.261
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2471
01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:30.160
<v Speaker 1>So he couldn't shoot,</v>

2472
01:07:30.161 --> 01:07:31.930
<v Speaker 1>take downs or do anything with his right arm.</v>

2473
01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.820
<v Speaker 1>He punched him with it a bunch of times,</v>

2474
01:07:33.821 --> 01:07:35.050
<v Speaker 1>even though it's still broken.</v>

2475
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.130
<v Speaker 1>And he was trying,</v>

2476
01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:38.260
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to punch with his leg was in fucking agony.</v>

2477
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:39.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not just about power,</v>

2478
01:07:39.521 --> 01:07:39.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2479
01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:43.150
<v Speaker 1>It's about knowing that this shit doesn't work anymore and you're going to try</v>

2480
01:07:43.151 --> 01:07:43.984
<v Speaker 1>to grab her hand.</v>

2481
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>And he got a guy tried to rip your head off.</v>

2482
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.413
<v Speaker 1>And Mike Perry,</v>

2483
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.770
<v Speaker 1>super strong,</v>

2484
01:07:47.771 --> 01:07:48.401
<v Speaker 1>one 70.</v>

2485
01:07:48.401 --> 01:07:49.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a beast.</v>

2486
01:07:49.271 --> 01:07:50.500
<v Speaker 1>He's super aggressive.</v>

2487
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.270
<v Speaker 1>He comes at you real hard.</v>

2488
01:07:52.271 --> 01:07:54.400
<v Speaker 1>He takes a tremendous shot.</v>

2489
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:58.480
<v Speaker 1>He's got a fucking Iron Chin and horrifying knockout power.</v>

2490
01:07:58.481 --> 01:08:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Tough matchup for Jake Kellenberger Elbow,</v>

2491
01:08:00.491 --> 01:08:01.031
<v Speaker 1>that elbow.</v>

2492
01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Kayla lucky like Jesus,</v>

2493
01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.880
<v Speaker 1>he's got real power but then you know the guillotine.</v>

2494
01:08:06.881 --> 01:08:10.600
<v Speaker 1>But Paul Filter was kind of Mike Page first wind where he's technical and stayed</v>

2495
01:08:10.601 --> 01:08:12.310
<v Speaker 1>on the outside hanging on that neck.</v>

2496
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2497
01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:14.200
<v Speaker 1>And then before that though,</v>

2498
01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>like Alan Jobe and beat him was super technical.</v>

2499
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I think the move to Jackson's has,</v>

2500
01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:22.760
<v Speaker 1>it had a giant impact on him because what I saw in his last fight,</v>

2501
01:08:22.761 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I saw him manage distance much better and pace.</v>

2502
01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.660
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't just like a marauding psycho going after her own fate.</v>

2503
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:30.511
<v Speaker 1>He's mixing it up.</v>

2504
01:08:30.511 --> 01:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>You ain't go sit it up.</v>

2505
01:08:31.701 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>It was like very good footwork as well.</v>

2506
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 1>It was very technical.</v>

2507
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>So I think he's adding a lot more technique and strategy to what he already had.</v>

2508
01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 1>The Tower series,</v>

2509
01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:41.680
<v Speaker 1>power series,</v>

2510
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:42.800
<v Speaker 1>aggression can,</v>

2511
01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>he had skills already.</v>

2512
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:45.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you couldn't punch,</v>

2513
01:08:45.471 --> 01:08:46.304
<v Speaker 1>it's not like he couldn't,</v>

2514
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:46.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2515
01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:48.530
<v Speaker 1>but he was kind of one dimensional a little bit.</v>

2516
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.760
<v Speaker 1>We'll just so wild,</v>

2517
01:08:49.761 --> 01:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>so reckless and so,</v>

2518
01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>so hungry to fuck you.</v>

2519
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:55.400
<v Speaker 1>What will beat a lot of guys to get a certain level,</v>

2520
01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.450
<v Speaker 1>then they can deal with it.</v>

2521
01:08:56.450 --> 01:09:00.590
<v Speaker 1>But Kudos to him for recognizing Brilla and then making some adjustments.</v>

2522
01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:03.200
<v Speaker 1>And I think he definitely did make an adjustment in that Felder fight.</v>

2523
01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:04.011
<v Speaker 1>He looked amazing.</v>

2524
01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:05.450
<v Speaker 1>So it was on him.</v>

2525
01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:06.530
<v Speaker 1>He made the adjustment.</v>

2526
01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2527
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.650
<v Speaker 1>and he obviously put in the work and look great.</v>

2528
01:09:09.651 --> 01:09:14.090
<v Speaker 1>And it was also on Felder breaking his arm or pretty early on the fine arm.</v>

2529
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.800
<v Speaker 1>But even before he broke his arm,</v>

2530
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Perry was getting the better of the exchanges.</v>

2531
01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:18.051
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

2532
01:09:18.051 --> 01:09:19.310
<v Speaker 1>he was more dangerous.</v>

2533
01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.153
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2534
01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:21.740
<v Speaker 1>there was more consequences.</v>

2535
01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2536
01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.220
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

2537
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:27.220
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking scary knockout artists stylistic wise for cowboy hits a tough</v>

2538
01:09:27.411 --> 01:09:28.244
<v Speaker 1>five days.</v>

2539
01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2540
01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.760
<v Speaker 1>we both think that cowboys at his best when he doesn't have to,</v>

2541
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.980
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have to fight guys that are that much bigger than him.</v>

2542
01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:37.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2543
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I would rather see some guy's tough cowboy.</v>

2544
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather see him at one 55 then see him fight Darren till again.</v>

2545
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:48.200
<v Speaker 1>There was something about seeing him with Darren till we see how big Darren is</v>

2546
01:09:48.201 --> 01:09:48.981
<v Speaker 1>at one 70.</v>

2547
01:09:48.981 --> 01:09:50.480
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking big man.</v>

2548
01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.531
<v Speaker 1>He's big.</v>

2549
01:09:51.531 --> 01:09:53.520
<v Speaker 1>He even talked about going to 85 and he,</v>

2550
01:09:53.610 --> 01:09:54.620
<v Speaker 1>he's going 85 now.</v>

2551
01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:57.990
<v Speaker 1>And you look at him [inaudible] he changed his mind again.</v>

2552
01:09:57.991 --> 01:09:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2553
01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>he's like a thing.</v>

2554
01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:00.140
<v Speaker 1>It would collect 70 cause he was gonna fight.</v>

2555
01:10:00.141 --> 01:10:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Ask Her in at 70 them they gave African Robbie Lawler.</v>

2556
01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.393
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2557
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:04.941
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2558
01:10:04.941 --> 01:10:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Both fights I love.</v>

2559
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.270
<v Speaker 1>But you know that guy's just so,</v>

2560
01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:09.980
<v Speaker 1>he was so much bigger than cowboy.</v>

2561
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:11.420
<v Speaker 1>He was so much bigger.</v>

2562
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Way bigger when you looked at him in there.</v>

2563
01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:15.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean he looked like he was two weight classes bigger.</v>

2564
01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:16.340
<v Speaker 1>At least one weight class.</v>

2565
01:10:16.341 --> 01:10:17.174
<v Speaker 1>Bigger look at ease.</v>

2566
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:19.220
<v Speaker 1>At least on the upper end of the next weight class.</v>

2567
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Lawler makes sense.</v>

2568
01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:21.014
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

2569
01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

2570
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:22.880
<v Speaker 1>the reasons to not make sense.</v>

2571
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:23.960
<v Speaker 1>It may make sense.</v>

2572
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.381
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2573
01:10:24.381 --> 01:10:27.570
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get to be hard to take down and he's fucking vicious with this.</v>

2574
01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.650
<v Speaker 1>So none on the night of the fight.</v>

2575
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:31.513
<v Speaker 1>I dig it.</v>

2576
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:34.790
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that makes Ben aspirins special to is his,</v>

2577
01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:35.690
<v Speaker 1>you know his mouth,</v>

2578
01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:36.291
<v Speaker 1>his mind came.</v>

2579
01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:38.060
<v Speaker 1>So rob not going to play that game.</v>

2580
01:10:38.061 --> 01:10:39.170
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a dance partner.</v>

2581
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2582
01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes it great is that he can't,</v>

2583
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.621
<v Speaker 1>he can't.</v>

2584
01:10:42.621 --> 01:10:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2585
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:43.161
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a word that seems right.</v>

2623
01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:34.951
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:38.220
<v Speaker 1>This is no easy for Ben.</v>

2627
01:11:38.221 --> 01:11:39.360
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a hard</v>

2628
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:42.390
<v Speaker 1>fight is easy for him.</v>

2629
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.700
<v Speaker 1>He just grabs everybody.</v>

2630
01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Manhattan.</v>

2631
01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm Sam for the Russian guys.</v>

2632
01:11:46.701 --> 01:11:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Same to take full advantage of what Ben Asker and brings to the table.</v>

2633
01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler is not the matchup I would give them off the bat.</v>

2634
01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:53.501
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

2635
01:11:53.501 --> 01:11:56.970
<v Speaker 1>He gave him a Darren till or Colby come into in something like that who will</v>

2636
01:11:56.971 --> 01:11:57.960
<v Speaker 1>verbally go back.</v>

2637
01:11:57.961 --> 01:12:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Got To build up to that has been in the game too long.</v>

2638
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I understand what the night of the fight.</v>

2639
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Amazing fight.</v>

2640
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

2641
01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I think you just want to see the fight.</v>

2642
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should ever make decisions based on shit.</v>

2643
01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:11.461
<v Speaker 1>Talking Shit,</v>

2644
01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:13.110
<v Speaker 1>talking and encouraging shit talking.</v>

2645
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I think what's interesting about Ben asked her in his bed,</v>

2646
01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:15.810
<v Speaker 1>aspirin,</v>

2647
01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what the fuck he can do to a real former world champion.</v>

2648
01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:22.020
<v Speaker 1>We're hardcore who's fought at the highest level.</v>

2649
01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.093
<v Speaker 1>That's a great,</v>

2650
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:24.930
<v Speaker 1>great match with you guys.</v>

2651
01:12:24.931 --> 01:12:25.610
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>

2652
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I love Robbie lines.</v>

2653
01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I think Robbie allows the legend whether he talks back,</v>

2654
01:12:29.341 --> 01:12:30.330
<v Speaker 1>no one's gonna give a shit.</v>

2655
01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2656
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.261
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

2657
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:32.220
<v Speaker 1>ask him when he was at.</v>

2658
01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:33.300
<v Speaker 1>That's not the world we live in.</v>

2659
01:12:33.301 --> 01:12:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2660
01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:33.901
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

2661
01:12:33.901 --> 01:12:35.040
<v Speaker 1>ask him when he was at the UFC,</v>

2662
01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:37.290
<v Speaker 1>they put a camera on him and the crowd went nuts.</v>

2663
01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:39.000
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't even fought in the UFC yet.</v>

2664
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows about him from the Internet.</v>

2665
01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:45.150
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people know about him from you and me and a lot of people know about</v>

2666
01:12:45.151 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 1>him from Bela Tarr fans and one fc fans.</v>

2667
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I think people didn't realize how fucking popular he is and how people want to</v>

2668
01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:54.810
<v Speaker 1>see what an undefeated,</v>

2669
01:12:55.020 --> 01:13:00.020
<v Speaker 1>undefeated wrestler who dominated guys like Lima and Koresh carve and Bella tour</v>

2670
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:01.710
<v Speaker 1>still hasn't dominated.</v>

2671
01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:02.100

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Pete,</v>

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:20.940
<v Speaker 1>he's had multiple like periods in his career.</v>

2684
01:13:21.090 --> 01:13:22.650
<v Speaker 1>He had the strike force period.</v>

2685
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:22.951
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2686

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:26.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2689
01:13:26.041 --> 01:13:29.280
<v Speaker 1>he had his younger wild days and why he's fallen on some hard times.</v>

2690
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.050
<v Speaker 1>He's not the greatest.</v>

2691
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler is not the greatest wrestler of all time.</v>

2692
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:39.170
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking wrestle growing up and what the equalizer are.</v>

2693
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:40.560
<v Speaker 1>His fucking hands,</v>

2694
01:13:40.561 --> 01:13:41.010
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2695
01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:41.580
<v Speaker 1>his kicks,</v>

2696
01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Russell was everything you could say.</v>

2697
01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:43.411
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2698
01:13:43.411 --> 01:13:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2699
01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:44.860
<v Speaker 1>he's like right in there,</v>

2700
01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:45.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2701
01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.710
<v Speaker 1>a decent wrestler,</v>

2702
01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking hands.</v>

2703
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Aspirin takes down and is anybody in the UFC he made maybe pet he might finding</v>

2704
01:13:53.551 --> 01:13:56.980
<v Speaker 1>out he was going to be as entertaining as fuck dude.</v>

2705
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2706
01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it's coming at me like I don't think he's a great fight.</v>

2707
01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:00.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd love the fight.</v>

2708
01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.113
<v Speaker 1>I just went,</v>

2709
01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:02.761
<v Speaker 1>ah man,</v>

2710
01:14:02.761 --> 01:14:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get him Colby Covington.</v>

2711
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I would have gave him,</v>

2712
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:05.580
<v Speaker 1>that's coming.</v>

2713
01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.413
<v Speaker 1>That's coming.</v>

2714
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:09.540
<v Speaker 1>This is after the first time world champ.</v>

2715
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:10.410
<v Speaker 1>But or,</v>

2716
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:13.780
<v Speaker 1>or Robbie Lawler gets Cubby Colby Covington if he wins.</v>

2717
01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:14.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2718
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:15.370
<v Speaker 1>that's a great way to,</v>

2719
01:14:15.371 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 1>for Robbie to get back into the mix.</v>

2720
01:14:16.781 --> 01:14:20.540
<v Speaker 1>And plus you don't want to make it easy on Ben Ashman cause everyone's goal.</v>

2721
01:14:20.541 --> 01:14:20.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2722
01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:21.580

01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:25.961
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what he's made of.</v>

2726
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler is a tough fucking tests.</v>

2727
01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Good take down defense.</v>

2728
01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:29.500
<v Speaker 1>But how can artists,</v>

2729
01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 1>it gives roc nation an opportunity to reset to if Robbie can beat him.</v>

2730
01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:34.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2731
01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Robbie didn't have a good fight with Rafael dos Anjos,</v>

2732
01:14:37.091 --> 01:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>but he did have a good fight with cowboy.</v>

2733
01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:39.251
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2734
01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Those were the last two fights he had,</v>

2735
01:14:40.661 --> 01:14:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

2736
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Am I right about that?</v>

2737
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.440
<v Speaker 1>He lost dose on Jolson Cowboy.</v>

2738
01:14:44.650 --> 01:14:46.180
<v Speaker 1>He lost the Dos Anjos right?</v>

2739
01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Last raining.</v>

2740
01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:48.550
<v Speaker 1>It's cowboy.</v>

2741
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Has Aspirin fought anybody at Lawler's level?</v>

2742
01:14:51.610 --> 01:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2743
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.420
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2744
01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2745
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:53.520
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2746
01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Lima.</v>

2747
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Lema.</v>

2748
01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.960
<v Speaker 1>But also younger Lima didn't wrestle growing up.</v>

2749
01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:00.190
<v Speaker 1>It was a younger Lima.</v>

2750
01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:02.680
<v Speaker 1>So I met the same cops.</v>

2751
01:15:02.681 --> 01:15:03.550
<v Speaker 1>A fucking monster.</v>

2752
01:15:03.551 --> 01:15:04.240
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>

2753
01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.260
<v Speaker 1>but both those guys,</v>

2754
01:15:05.261 --> 01:15:06.220
<v Speaker 1>he dominated them.</v>

2755
01:15:06.221 --> 01:15:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So they were young.</v>

2756
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Lala brings in wrestling and ferocious striking.</v>

2757
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Also can't competition at the highest levels.</v>

2758
01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Great champion in the UFC.</v>

2759
01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:17.711

<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in shit times canny can't add.</v>

2766
01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:30.880

2767
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.870

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a few guys you can't talk shit about.</v>

2771
01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:37.210
<v Speaker 1>It's fricking Robbie Lawlor,</v>

2772
01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson,</v>

2776
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Before Tyron Woodley beat him,</v>

2777
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:46.090
<v Speaker 1>people thought he was the boogie man who Robby Lauer.</v>

2786
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:01.061

2788
01:16:01.931 --> 01:16:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler's ferocious.</v>

01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:06.700
<v Speaker 1>He's a wrestler who's just knocking everybody out on the local level.</v>

2790
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:08.590
<v Speaker 1>You're going to hear a lot about Robbie Lawler.</v>

2791
01:16:08.591 --> 01:16:10.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget that.</v>

2792
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.510
<v Speaker 1>2001 2002 something like that.</v>

2793
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Talking about a hall of Famer,</v>

2794
01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Legit Hall of Famer.</v>

2795
01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2796
01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:19.270
<v Speaker 1>so for sure it's the toughest opponent of Ben aspirins career or,</v>

2797
01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:20.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2798
01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's the toughest,</v>

2799
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.230
<v Speaker 1>but for sure it's a tough validates.</v>

2800
01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:23.501
<v Speaker 1>Ben.</v>

2801
01:16:23.501 --> 01:16:24.250
<v Speaker 1>If he beats them.</v>

2802
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I have to be totally honest.</v>

2803
01:16:25.361 --> 01:16:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

2804
01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I never watched his fights in one FC.</v>

2805
01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:29.810
<v Speaker 1>I'd never figured out Ben's with you get it off</v>

2806
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:32.490
<v Speaker 1>with the Russian wrestler.</v>

2807
01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:33.760
<v Speaker 1>He does one guy.</v>

2808
01:16:33.761 --> 01:16:34.594
<v Speaker 1>He's the best way.</v>

2809
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just saw,</v>

2810
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I just saw highlights.</v>

2811
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I saw highlights too.</v>

2812
01:16:37.730 --> 01:16:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch one FC either</v>

2813
01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:41.710
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2814
01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:43.780
<v Speaker 1>As soon as he puts his hands,</v>

2815
01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.510

01:16:49.781 --> 01:16:50.500
<v Speaker 1>hands on,</v>

01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Dana blocked him on Twitter.</v>

2877
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:44.703
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2878

2879
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I got ahold of Dana and I said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's a fun guy.</v>

2883
01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:53.650
<v Speaker 1>He's talking it.</v>

2884
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:54.493
<v Speaker 1>They ended up partying,</v>

2885
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:57.250
<v Speaker 1>especially with Ben becomes changed shit,</v>

2886

<v Speaker 1>Shitload of money to this and they're going to be happy.</v>

2887
01:19:01.221 --> 01:19:02.430
<v Speaker 1>They made this decision as Ben.</v>

2888
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.770
<v Speaker 1>He's not that old.</v>

2889
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:05.660
<v Speaker 1>He's already probably thirties early thirties</v>

2890
01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:10.160
<v Speaker 1>34 he's still fun to do it for a hot minute,</v>

2891
01:19:10.161 --> 01:19:11.280
<v Speaker 1>but he still fuck people up.</v>

2892
01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Zero damage.</v>

2893
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:15.080
<v Speaker 1>He didn't take a punch in his last two fights.</v>

2894
01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:18.800
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't taken a punch in for like you looked at the month it's been,</v>

2895
01:19:18.801 --> 01:19:19.910
<v Speaker 1>has ever cracked.</v>

2896
01:19:19.911 --> 01:19:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Solid.</v>

2897
01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2898
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:21.643
<v Speaker 1>he's been here.</v>

2899
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:25.070
<v Speaker 1>He's been hit pretty hard here on this list decision.</v>

2900
01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

2901
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 1>I remember the something up he was telling me about,</v>

2902
01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to speak out of school,</v>

2903
01:19:29.481 --> 01:19:30.314
<v Speaker 1>so I won't even say what he said.</v>

2904
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what he said,</v>

2905
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but there was an issue in his camp.</v>

2906
01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:33.860
<v Speaker 1>But this one was,</v>

2907
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.750
<v Speaker 1>she was also striking a lot and he's like,</v>

2908
01:19:35.751 --> 01:19:37.400
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

2909
01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:39.830
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to go in there and do this and then change.</v>

2910
01:19:39.831 --> 01:19:40.880
<v Speaker 1>His whole demeanor was just like,</v>

2911
01:19:40.881 --> 01:19:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing everybody down.</v>

2912
01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:43.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get hit.</v>

2913
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:43.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2914
01:19:43.611 --> 01:19:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather here on,</v>

2915
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:45.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2916
01:19:45.710 --> 01:19:46.160
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>

2917
01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.990
<v Speaker 1>he's got real talent.</v>

2918
01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:48.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2919
01:19:48.531 --> 01:19:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Jay heroin lost to some really good guys like George Saint Pierre and Tyron</v>

2920
01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Woodley.</v>

2921
01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.990
<v Speaker 1>But Jay heroin's a tough fighter and he's got a good mix of wrestling and</v>

2922
01:19:56.991 --> 01:19:58.610
<v Speaker 1>grappling and it was a,</v>

2923
01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.470
<v Speaker 1>or a wrestling and striking rather.</v>

2924
01:20:00.471 --> 01:20:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And it was enough wrestling to get back up when he was stuck on the bottom or</v>

2925
01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.770
<v Speaker 1>prevent takedowns or fight him off.</v>

2926
01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.960
<v Speaker 1>And they were looking at this man here,</v>

2927
01:20:09.961 --> 01:20:11.460
<v Speaker 1>this nice little squeaky reversal.</v>

2928
01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:11.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2929
01:20:11.671 --> 01:20:13.280
<v Speaker 1>So he can actually wrestle a bit too.</v>

2930
01:20:13.281 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 1>And he hit it with a nice punch there.</v>

2931
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:18.810
<v Speaker 1>So Jay here on good terms with a spinning back kick.</v>

2932
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:19.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2933
01:20:19.351 --> 01:20:22.020
<v Speaker 1>So Jay heroin is a tough guy,</v>

2934
01:20:22.021 --> 01:20:22.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2935
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.981
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2936
01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:25.440
<v Speaker 1>really Jay here on restless all yeah.</v>

2937
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:25.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2938
01:20:25.711 --> 01:20:27.110
<v Speaker 1>He's a real wrestler and,</v>

2939
01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.840
<v Speaker 1>and he's also got a lot of experience and had a lot of experience striking.</v>

2940
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:32.760
<v Speaker 1>That was after he fought George Saint Pierre,</v>

2941
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.073
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2942
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2943
01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I believe so for sure.</v>

2944
01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 1>That you have to check to see if that's correct.</v>

2945
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:37.733
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

2946
01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know Jay w w that's after we've fought.</v>

2947
01:20:40.541 --> 01:20:42.360
<v Speaker 1>They fought after he got released from the UFC.</v>

2948
01:20:42.361 --> 01:20:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Is that what happened?</v>

2949
01:20:43.170 --> 01:20:44.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2950
01:20:44.190 --> 01:20:44.970
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2951
01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:47.250
<v Speaker 1>that was like the toughest test of his UFC career.</v>

2952
01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:50.940
<v Speaker 1>But apparently there was another fight that he had in one FC.</v>

2953
01:20:51.330 --> 01:20:51.871
<v Speaker 1>Now this is,</v>

2954
01:20:51.871 --> 01:20:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting this completely second hand and I apologize,</v>

2955
01:20:54.241 --> 01:20:54.990
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just,</v>

2956
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think we're going to talk about this.</v>

2957
01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't prepare this or anything like that,</v>

2958
01:20:58.561 --> 01:21:02.160
<v Speaker 1>but I think someone was telling me that he fought some dude and the fight got</v>

2959
01:21:02.161 --> 01:21:03.390
<v Speaker 1>stopped by an eye poke,</v>

2960
01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.950
<v Speaker 1>but that it was a tough fight.</v>

2961
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.903
<v Speaker 1>The Russian cat,</v>

2962
01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.250
<v Speaker 1>it might've been the Russian cat.</v>

2963
01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

2964
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Look at this fight.</v>

2965
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Damn it dear.</v>

2966
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:11.420
<v Speaker 1>You should feel that.</v>

2967
01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Who's got that body triangle?</v>

2968
01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2969
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:14.191
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2970
01:21:14.191 --> 01:21:14.860
<v Speaker 1>That's tight.</v>

2971
01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2972
01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:18.893
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

2973
01:21:19.410 --> 01:21:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

2974
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:21.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if this is true.</v>

2975
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.840
<v Speaker 4>This is just my guests and I think the first person to utilize that body</v>

2976
01:21:27.151 --> 01:21:27.990
<v Speaker 4>triangle.</v>

2977
01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:33.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm authentically at a high level and competition was John Jacques Machado.</v>

2978
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:35.380
<v Speaker 4>Abu Dhabi.</v>

2979
01:21:35.381 --> 01:21:35.730
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2980
01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:36.990
<v Speaker 4>He was the first one.</v>

2981
01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:40.530
<v Speaker 4>I know there's old pictures of catch wrestling with guys and body triangles from</v>

2982
01:21:40.531 --> 01:21:41.160
<v Speaker 4>the back,</v>

2983
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:46.160
<v Speaker 4>but in high level competition recorded historical high level competition.</v>

2984
01:21:46.531 --> 01:21:47.364
<v Speaker 4>Abu Dhabi,</v>

2985
01:21:47.490 --> 01:21:52.200
<v Speaker 4>John Jacques Machado fucking ran through guys putting that body triangle on the</v>

2986
01:21:52.201 --> 01:21:52.380
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

2987
01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:55.260
<v Speaker 4>I remember asking him when he got back from Abu Dhabi,</v>

2988
01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:59.280
<v Speaker 4>why were you putting the figure four lock?</v>

2989
01:21:59.370 --> 01:21:59.671
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2990
01:21:59.671 --> 01:22:00.504
<v Speaker 4>while you're on the back,</v>

2991
01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:02.400
<v Speaker 4>why not just use the regular leg hooks?</v>

2992
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:03.623
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

2993
01:22:03.810 --> 01:22:04.351
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2994
01:22:04.351 --> 01:22:04.881
<v Speaker 4>when you're gone,</v>

2995
01:22:04.881 --> 01:22:07.370
<v Speaker 4>no [inaudible] is so slippery unit.</v>

2996
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:08.041
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

2997
01:22:08.041 --> 01:22:09.270
<v Speaker 4>you got to lock in the hips.</v>

2998
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:11.730
<v Speaker 4>And from that point on that changed my game.</v>

2999
01:22:11.731 --> 01:22:12.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3000
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:12.331
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3001
01:22:12.331 --> 01:22:15.650
<v Speaker 4>I guess when I get the back that's going to be my main focus is putting a,</v>

3002
01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.550
<v Speaker 4>a triangle body triangle on.</v>

3003
01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:21.240
<v Speaker 4>And that was 1998 99 in that area.</v>

3004
01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Well a lot of people don't know how much,</v>

3005
01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.510
<v Speaker 1>well everybody knows you're a John Jack Black belt,</v>

3006
01:22:25.511 --> 01:22:30.010
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people don't know how much John Shock style of Nogi is.</v>

3007
01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:34.990
<v Speaker 1>What influenced you to come up with a lot of the positions in moves from 10th</v>

3008
01:22:34.991 --> 01:22:35.430
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

3009
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:36.420
<v Speaker 4>Not only me,</v>

3010
01:22:36.421 --> 01:22:37.830
<v Speaker 4>but Marcello Garcia.</v>

3011
01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:42.900
<v Speaker 4>John John Machado was the first Marcella Garcia of the Abu Dhabi.</v>

3012
01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:47.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3016
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.091
<v Speaker 4>he was the first one.</v>

3017
01:22:48.091 --> 01:22:52.020
<v Speaker 4>Because when you look at Marcella Garcia and no doubt Marcella Garcia,</v>

3018
01:22:52.021 --> 01:22:55.170
<v Speaker 4>when you're talking about the greatest grappler of all time,</v>

3019
01:22:55.260 --> 01:23:00.080
<v Speaker 4>Pete Marcella Garcia as right there in the conversation can easily be number one</v>

3020
01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:00.781
<v Speaker 4>to say number one,</v>

3021
01:23:00.781 --> 01:23:04.470
<v Speaker 4>would it be Hixon I'm going to say Marcella Garcia,</v>

3022
01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.150
<v Speaker 4>Jacques Hixon number one,</v>

3023
01:23:07.151 --> 01:23:07.751
<v Speaker 4>Roger,</v>

3024
01:23:07.751 --> 01:23:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Gracie,</v>

3025
01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3026
01:23:09.670 --> 01:23:10.930
<v Speaker 4>half a Mendez,</v>

3027
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:12.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3028
01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.300
<v Speaker 4>you know that level.</v>

3029
01:23:13.301 --> 01:23:17.080
<v Speaker 4>But the first one in Abu Dhabi was John Jock.</v>

3030
01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:18.550
<v Speaker 4>When you look at what he did,</v>

3031
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 4>he was using x guard and he was getting the back,</v>

3032
01:23:21.671 --> 01:23:23.890
<v Speaker 4>putting the body triangle is on the back,</v>

3033
01:23:23.891 --> 01:23:28.210
<v Speaker 4>was his shit and then Marcello came and he was using x car to,</v>

3034
01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:28.781
<v Speaker 4>not that,</v>

3035
01:23:28.781 --> 01:23:28.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3036
01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:30.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm not taking anything away from Marcella Garcia.</v>

3037
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:31.510
<v Speaker 4>Everybody,</v>

3038
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:35.440
<v Speaker 4>anybody that knows me knows that I've given Marcella Garcia more props and</v>

3039
01:23:35.441 --> 01:23:36.640
<v Speaker 4>fucking anybody living.</v>

3040
01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:37.753
<v Speaker 4>I'd uh,</v>

3041
01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:38.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3042
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.610
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to explain that,</v>

3043
01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:40.211
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm,</v>

3044
01:23:40.211 --> 01:23:41.044
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying,</v>

3045
01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:43.690
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying right now is one of the greatest of all time.</v>

3046
01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3047
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:44.853
<v Speaker 4>And so is John.</v>

3048
01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:45.110
<v Speaker 4>Jack,</v>

3049
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:46.870
<v Speaker 4>they're both two of the greatest of all times.</v>

3050
01:23:46.871 --> 01:23:47.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of that group.</v>

3051
01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:52.000
<v Speaker 4>John [inaudible] was the first Abu Dhabi legend as far as finishing goes when</v>

3052
01:23:52.001 --> 01:23:53.290
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about the submissions,</v>

3053
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:58.540
<v Speaker 4>because in those early Abu Dhabi's you had a bunch of wrestlers who are masters</v>

3054
01:23:58.541 --> 01:24:01.270
<v Speaker 4>at controlling human beings without clothing,</v>

3055
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:04.000
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't know how to pass and they didn't want to finish.</v>

3056
01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:08.500
<v Speaker 4>And then on the flip side you had Brazilians who are masters of passing the</v>

3057
01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:10.780
<v Speaker 4>guard and finishing their opponents,</v>

3058
01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.960
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't really know how to do it as well without the gooey.</v>

3059
01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:21.100
<v Speaker 4>So he had a lot of stalemate and going on and a lot of bickering and bantering</v>

3060
01:24:21.101 --> 01:24:23.200
<v Speaker 4>back and forth about the rule set and all that.</v>

3061
01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:24.860
<v Speaker 4>After the first couple of years,</v>

3062
01:24:24.861 --> 01:24:25.391
<v Speaker 4>it's like people,</v>

3063
01:24:25.391 --> 01:24:25.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3064
01:24:25.571 --> 01:24:26.550
<v Speaker 4>you had the Jujitsu,</v>

3065
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:27.430
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu guys,</v>

3066
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:31.030
<v Speaker 4>a stale mating with the wrestlers and there's all this grease and all this sweat</v>

3067
01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:31.864
<v Speaker 4>flying everywhere.</v>

3068
01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:35.200
<v Speaker 4>And then enters John Jacques and his first,</v>

3069
01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:37.300
<v Speaker 4>his first year in Abu Dhabi,</v>

3070
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:40.240
<v Speaker 4>he submits everybody and gets the gold medal.</v>

3071
01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:42.040
<v Speaker 4>So at that point people were like,</v>

3072
01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:43.330
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

3073
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:45.700
<v Speaker 4>This guy doesn't even have fingers on his left hand.</v>

3074
01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.040
<v Speaker 4>How did it come in to Abu Dhabi?</v>

3075
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:51.040
<v Speaker 4>And tap everybody and win the gold medal.</v>

3076
01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:54.010
<v Speaker 4>What is [inaudible] big like really big.</v>

3077
01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3078
01:24:55.001 --> 01:24:59.030
<v Speaker 4>We just had the trials two weeks ago and it was the biggest trials of all time.</v>

3080
01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.590
<v Speaker 4>there's like 60 70 people in each division.</v>

3081
01:25:02.591 --> 01:25:03.050

<v Speaker 4>He had like the high level Nsx back in the day.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I actually lied and I didn't know he did.</v>

3354
01:32:56.231 --> 01:33:00.230
<v Speaker 4>I knew all my first car was a Ford Pinto snake stick in a while.</v>

3355
01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:03.870
<v Speaker 4>I remember those little tiny sports cars,</v>

3356
01:33:03.871 --> 01:33:05.620
<v Speaker 4>two seater Fiat's I had one of those.</v>

3357
01:33:05.621 --> 01:33:08.050
<v Speaker 4>Those are the styles dude.</v>

3358
01:33:08.051 --> 01:33:13.050
<v Speaker 4>For a month I was driving around at 19 with the little two seater yellow Fiat</v>

3359
01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:13.270
<v Speaker 4>Kahn.</v>

3360
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:17.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm the fucking man until it broke down like all Fiat's do and I,</v>

3361
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:18.640
<v Speaker 4>I drove for a month.</v>

3362
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:21.870
<v Speaker 4>We could never figure out how to fix that motherfucker</v>

3363
01:33:23.970 --> 01:33:24.980
<v Speaker 4>fee out repair man.</v>

3364
01:33:25.630 --> 01:33:27.790
<v Speaker 4>And it was a mid engine dude.</v>

3365
01:33:27.791 --> 01:33:31.630
<v Speaker 4>That thing was so like it was a fix it again Tony.</v>

3366
01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.950
<v Speaker 4>That's what the outstanding for dude.</v>

3367
01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:37.930
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

3368
01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:38.231
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3369
01:33:38.231 --> 01:33:42.610
<v Speaker 4>there was one day when that car broke down I realized who my friends really</v>

3370
01:33:42.611 --> 01:33:43.150
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>

3371
01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:45.510
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wanted to come pick me up for parties.</v>

3372
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.550
<v Speaker 4>I one night I started crying</v>

3373
01:33:50.690 --> 01:33:52.870
<v Speaker 4>like I don't really have any real friends.</v>

3374
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:54.940
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was partying,</v>

3375
01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:56.100
<v Speaker 4>everyone was going out.</v>

3376
01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.273
<v Speaker 4>Cause I lived,</v>

3377
01:33:57.490 --> 01:34:02.490
<v Speaker 4>I lived in like kind of far how far and I was the one picking 2025 minutes.</v>

3378
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:07.240
<v Speaker 4>Tell you that's why I was crying.</v>

3379
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:08.290
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think I was crying?</v>

3380
01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:09.071
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3381
01:34:09.071 --> 01:34:10.180
<v Speaker 4>I love the friends.</v>

3382
01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:10.931
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3383
01:34:10.931 --> 01:34:11.441
<v Speaker 4>you're cool.</v>

3384
01:34:11.441 --> 01:34:14.530
<v Speaker 4>But 25 minutes is a long way trying to fuck this girl.</v>

3385
01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 4>I realized how important cars were.</v>

3386
01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Never forget when my with up on blocks in my garage and nobody could figure it</v>

3387
01:34:23.351 --> 01:34:23.860
<v Speaker 4>out on.</v>

3388
01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:24.730
<v Speaker 4>Nobody could figure it out.</v>

3389
01:34:24.731 --> 01:34:24.910
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

3390
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:25.631
<v Speaker 4>how great is this?</v>

3391
01:34:25.631 --> 01:34:26.690
<v Speaker 4>They're doing this throwback.</v>

3392
01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:28.960
<v Speaker 4>This is like the throwback logos.</v>

3393
01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:30.870
<v Speaker 4>Dope anniversary.</v>

3394
01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:33.060
<v Speaker 4>This is the first time Jermaine Deronn to me is fun.</v>

3395
01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:35.770
<v Speaker 4>How crazy is that?</v>

3396
01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:36.120
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3397
01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.430
<v Speaker 4>and then there's Raquel Pennington who is just a beast to high breakouts.</v>

3398
01:34:39.570 --> 01:34:39.791
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3399
01:34:39.791 --> 01:34:40.624
<v Speaker 4>check this out.</v>

3400
01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:43.150
<v Speaker 4>How sexist is the UFC?</v>

3401
01:34:43.151 --> 01:34:43.984
<v Speaker 4>Think about this</v>

3402
01:34:45.810 --> 01:34:46.730
<v Speaker 4>in a joking way.</v>

3403
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:47.663
<v Speaker 4>There's a joking way.</v>

3404
01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.660
<v Speaker 4>But when,</v>

3405
01:34:49.730 --> 01:34:52.420
<v Speaker 4>when Raquel Pennington five Amanda Nunez,</v>

3406
01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:56.800
<v Speaker 4>the one thing they had in common was they both had girlfriends that were UFC</v>

3407
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:57.590
<v Speaker 4>fighters.</v>

3408
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:58.311
<v Speaker 4>They don't touch on.</v>

3409
01:34:58.311 --> 01:34:59.240
<v Speaker 4>Everything was fine.</v>

3410
01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:00.830
<v Speaker 4>Everything was going and it should be cool.</v>

3411
01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:05.980
<v Speaker 4>But can you imagine if there was two male fighters fighting for the belt and</v>

3412
01:35:07.071 --> 01:35:08.240
<v Speaker 4>they both had boyfriends,</v>

3413
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:12.230
<v Speaker 4>they were all so UFC fighters to him.</v>

3414
01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 4>How crazy is that?</v>

3415
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:14.151
<v Speaker 4>We don't,</v>

3416
01:35:14.151 --> 01:35:17.480
<v Speaker 4>we don't get that sexist though because we don't let guys do that.</v>

3417
01:35:17.481 --> 01:35:18.570
<v Speaker 4>We're okay with girls though.</v>

3418
01:35:18.571 --> 01:35:21.860
<v Speaker 4>When he made the UFC want to give a fuck if DC and Jon were gay,</v>

3419
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:22.800
<v Speaker 4>they come up there.</v>

3420
01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.101
<v Speaker 4>You don't think,</v>

3421
01:35:24.101 --> 01:35:24.620
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

3422
01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:27.780
<v Speaker 4>you think they would be okay with that hundred percent as long as they were</v>

3423
01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:28.311
<v Speaker 4>winning fights,</v>

3424
01:35:28.311 --> 01:35:28.730
<v Speaker 4>they don't care.</v>

3425
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 4>But here's what you have to take into consideration.</v>

3426
01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:36.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's been any suppression of a gay fighters and promotions.</v>

3427
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:38.570
<v Speaker 4>There hasn't been enough promotion.</v>

3428
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:44.290
<v Speaker 4>It's probably super hard for some gay guys to get acceptance in gyms.</v>

3429
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:45.253
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3430
01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:46.173
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3431
01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.740
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be a gay gym,</v>

3432
01:35:47.741 --> 01:35:48.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3433
01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:49.003
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be a gate.</v>

3434
01:35:49.330 --> 01:35:52.100
<v Speaker 4>Someone who runs a gym is super open.</v>

3435
01:35:52.101 --> 01:35:54.280
<v Speaker 4>Miners got gotta be gang kickboxing,</v>

3436
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:54.820
<v Speaker 4>gay.</v>

3437
01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:55.700
<v Speaker 4>You can be a guy,</v>

3438
01:35:55.701 --> 01:35:56.534
<v Speaker 4>that'd be easier.</v>

3439
01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.340
<v Speaker 4>But check this out.</v>

3440
01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:58.173
<v Speaker 4>Check this out.</v>

3441
01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.140
<v Speaker 4>Because the problem is fight cultures,</v>

3442
01:36:00.141 --> 01:36:04.850
<v Speaker 4>old culture and that old old culture from the boxing days and a lot of the</v>

3443
01:36:04.851 --> 01:36:05.750
<v Speaker 4>wrestling days,</v>

3444
01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:07.880
<v Speaker 4>like there's this thought of,</v>

3445
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:08.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3446
01:36:08.241 --> 01:36:10.640
<v Speaker 4>it's not the most progressive concept that,</v>

3447
01:36:10.641 --> 01:36:10.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3448
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:11.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3449
01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.440
<v Speaker 4>gay guys,</v>

3450
01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

3451
01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:13.873
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

3452
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.823
<v Speaker 4>Celt Pennington,</v>

3453
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:17.330
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3454
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:18.920
<v Speaker 4>there's not a sense of the quality.</v>

3455
01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:20.450
<v Speaker 4>Check this out,</v>

3456
01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:20.850
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

3457
01:36:20.850 --> 01:36:21.683
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

3458
01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:22.820
<v Speaker 4>This is my theory,</v>

3459
01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.460
<v Speaker 4>my theory that show there's a,</v>

3460
01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:29.480
<v Speaker 4>there's a disproportionate amount of female lesbian fighters,</v>

3461
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:30.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3462
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:31.910
<v Speaker 4>having success in the UFC,</v>

3463
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.630
<v Speaker 4>and this is my,</v>

3464
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:33.370
<v Speaker 4>this is my theory.</v>

3465
01:36:33.370 --> 01:36:33.921
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

3466
01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:34.490
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

3467
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:35.450
<v Speaker 4>You know why this is,</v>

3468
01:36:35.451 --> 01:36:39.020
<v Speaker 4>my theory is their training camps are not disruptive.</v>

3469
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:40.730
<v Speaker 4>If they were heterosexual,</v>

3470
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.950
<v Speaker 4>everybody would be making moves on him.</v>

3471
01:36:42.951 --> 01:36:43.850
<v Speaker 4>Their Dietitian.</v>

3472
01:36:44.630 --> 01:36:47.450
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly kick boxing trainer.</v>

3473
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:50.810
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's going to be trying to make moves on them when they're lesbian.</v>

3474
01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Everybody just treats them like a guy</v>

3475
01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.193
<v Speaker 4>thinking this,</v>

3476
01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:57.680
<v Speaker 4>this is real.</v>

3477
01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:58.940
<v Speaker 4>This is really a factor,</v>

3478
01:36:58.941 --> 01:37:00.220
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that's awesome.</v>

3479
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:01.490
<v Speaker 4>I think Holly Holm,</v>

3480
01:37:01.670 --> 01:37:05.690
<v Speaker 4>I think there's just some women like to fight and maybe more lesbians like to</v>

3481
01:37:05.691 --> 01:37:05.961
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

3482
01:37:05.961 --> 01:37:06.291
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

3483
01:37:06.291 --> 01:37:07.260
<v Speaker 4>More draw to it.</v>

3484
01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:08.930
<v Speaker 4>Straight women like to fight too.</v>

3485
01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:12.260
<v Speaker 4>I think their camps or less disruptive because you take a girl,</v>

3486
01:37:12.261 --> 01:37:12.500
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3487
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.180
<v Speaker 4>let's just take a girl probably like facts.</v>

3488
01:37:14.181 --> 01:37:15.590
<v Speaker 4>Like let's take a small thing.</v>

3489
01:37:17.210 --> 01:37:20.570
<v Speaker 4>The second UFC fighter that looks as good as Paige vanzant.</v>

3490
01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:21.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3491
01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:21.853
<v Speaker 4>she's just like that.</v>

3492
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:26.950
<v Speaker 4>Imagine all the Dick that's going to be thrown at her every day.</v>

3493
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:29.800
<v Speaker 4>The dye houses.</v>

3494
01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:31.250
<v Speaker 4>You want a chiropractor.</v>

3495
01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:32.140
<v Speaker 4>If she was single,</v>

3496
01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:33.060
<v Speaker 4>boxing was</v>

3497
01:37:34.930 --> 01:37:35.763
<v Speaker 4>even if she's,</v>

3498
01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.070
<v Speaker 4>if she's actually,</v>

3499
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:39.530
<v Speaker 4>especially if she's single,</v>

3500
01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.990
<v Speaker 4>can you imagine the drama involved?</v>

3501
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.591
<v Speaker 4>Trust me,</v>

3502
01:37:42.591 --> 01:37:45.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the fucking fight game the girls are getting,</v>

3503
01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.280
<v Speaker 4>if you're a heterosexual girl and you're in the,</v>

3504
01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:51.050
<v Speaker 4>you're in a Jujitsu being a hot moraine.</v>

3505
01:37:51.051 --> 01:37:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3506
01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:55.430
<v Speaker 4>But if you're lesbian and you're hardcore guys still trying to forward,</v>

3507
01:37:55.431 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 4>but you're not,</v>

3508
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:56.910
<v Speaker 4>dude aren't going to go for it.</v>

3509
01:37:57.030 --> 01:38:00.480
<v Speaker 4>They're going to treat you like a dude and you're going to have a drama free</v>

3510
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:02.810
<v Speaker 4>training camp and a school and you're going to,</v>

3511
01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:04.260
<v Speaker 4>you're going to this small,</v>

3512
01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:05.850
<v Speaker 4>you're going to stick with the school lung.</v>

3513
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:07.170
<v Speaker 4>Look at all the lesbian fighters.</v>

3514
01:38:07.171 --> 01:38:07.501
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

3515
01:38:07.501 --> 01:38:09.790
<v Speaker 4>we'll stick with the trainers because they stick the best ones.</v>

3516
01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:10.360
<v Speaker 4>The history.</v>

3517
01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:11.193
<v Speaker 4>There's no drama,</v>

3518
01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:11.970
<v Speaker 4>no drama.</v>

3519
01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:14.220
<v Speaker 4>But this is what I think is what you're saying is true.</v>

3520
01:38:18.150 --> 01:38:19.170
<v Speaker 4>What you're saying is correct,</v>

3521
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.600
<v Speaker 4>but this is just a factor.</v>

3522
01:38:21.630 --> 01:38:22.680
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of fallacies.</v>

3523
01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful rose.</v>

3524
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3525
01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:27.140
<v Speaker 4>she's beautiful and raw,</v>

3526
01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:27.840
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

3527
01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.673
<v Speaker 4>no rose.</v>

3528
01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.090
<v Speaker 4>All the top fighters are lesbian.</v>

3529
01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:37.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying there's a disproportionate amount of top fighters that are</v>

3530
01:38:37.141 --> 01:38:40.590
<v Speaker 4>lesbian and I think that's because you know when you'll feel like we're all on</v>

3531
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:44.790
<v Speaker 4>the June rose Dama Junis got a gigantic gorilla boyfriend that will fucking</v>

3532
01:38:44.791 --> 01:38:45.750
<v Speaker 4>stomp on there.</v>

3533
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:46.673
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3534
01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:47.843
<v Speaker 4>That's different.</v>

3535
01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine a Rose Rose normal Junius was single.</v>

3536
01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.700
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine all the Dick,</v>

3537
01:38:53.701 --> 01:38:57.240
<v Speaker 4>they would be flying at her like she'd be doctoring shit like the Matrix.</v>

3538
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.901
<v Speaker 4>Respectfully.</v>

3539
01:38:57.901 --> 01:38:58.260
<v Speaker 4>You're right,</v>

3540
01:38:58.260 --> 01:38:58.740
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3541
01:38:58.740 --> 01:38:59.401
<v Speaker 4>Hundred percent.</v>

3542
01:38:59.401 --> 01:39:01.020
<v Speaker 4>There's less drama dude.</v>

3543
01:39:01.021 --> 01:39:02.040
<v Speaker 4>Cause in Jujitsu,</v>

3544
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:04.950
<v Speaker 4>not even striking a restaurant just in Jujitsu,</v>

3545
01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.480
<v Speaker 4>heterosexual girls.</v>

3546
01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:09.570
<v Speaker 4>But that's Thomas comments field though.</v>

3547
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.080
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

3548
01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:10.860
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3549
01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:11.491
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3550
01:39:11.491 --> 01:39:12.330
<v Speaker 4>Even women are,</v>

3551
01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:18.560
<v Speaker 4>that's proving my 0.0 at an MMA gym does the way more contact with a guy and a</v>

3552
01:39:19.891 --> 01:39:20.724
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>

3553
01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.213
<v Speaker 4>Two girls,</v>

3554
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:23.910
<v Speaker 4>two girls are,</v>

3555
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:24.210
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

3556
01:39:24.210 --> 01:39:24.550
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

3557
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:25.910
<v Speaker 4>are uh,</v>

3558
01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.300
<v Speaker 4>are more prone to switch Jujitsu schools.</v>

3559
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:32.150
<v Speaker 4>Then she got a postcard would die,</v>

3560
01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:32.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3561
01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Cause they start dating a guy from another school and they go,</v>

3562
01:39:34.741 --> 01:39:35.510
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

3563
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:37.290
<v Speaker 4>let me go train at that school on Saturdays,</v>

3564
01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:39.840
<v Speaker 4>they started training on the school on Saturdays and then the guys that their</v>

3565
01:39:39.841 --> 01:39:40.291
<v Speaker 4>schools are like,</v>

3566
01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:41.220
<v Speaker 4>what are you trying to go over there?</v>

3567
01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:41.940
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3568
01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:43.140
<v Speaker 4>but dudes don't do that.</v>

3569
01:39:43.141 --> 01:39:45.460
<v Speaker 4>But the girls do that because you know,</v>

3570
01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.830
<v Speaker 4>because they're heterosexual.</v>

3571
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:48.440
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's a ledge.</v>

3572
01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:50.100
<v Speaker 4>There's a little bit,</v>

3573
01:39:50.101 --> 01:39:52.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it's the be all end all.</v>

3574
01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:52.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to sound,</v>

3575
01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:54.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't think chicken bones.</v>

3576
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:57.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't think UFC highlights Amanda Nunez enough being lesbian.</v>

3577
01:39:57.631 --> 01:40:00.390
<v Speaker 4>She should be on fucking every poster in West Hollywood.</v>

3578
01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:02.040
<v Speaker 4>Now check this out.</v>

3579
01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:03.533
<v Speaker 4>Check this out.</v>

3580
01:40:04.230 --> 01:40:06.680
<v Speaker 4>We don't fuck out of Raquel Pennington who,</v>

3581
01:40:06.681 --> 01:40:07.514
<v Speaker 4>who's a beast.</v>

3582
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:08.640
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

3583
01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.151
<v Speaker 4>Think about,</v>

3584
01:40:09.151 --> 01:40:11.640
<v Speaker 4>think about onstar music marketable.</v>

3585
01:40:11.641 --> 01:40:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Then think about the music.</v>

3586
01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:14.940
<v Speaker 4>There's a disproportionate amount of,</v>

3587
01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:16.890
<v Speaker 4>of of all,</v>

3588
01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:20.670
<v Speaker 4>I would say 90% of my favorite singers are gay.</v>

3589
01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:23.820
<v Speaker 4>I love this singer's singer Peter fucking,</v>

3590
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:24.360
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3591
01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even going to say his name.</v>

3592
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:27.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to bust anybody out.</v>

3593
01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:28.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to say,</v>

3594
01:40:28.410 --> 01:40:29.243
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3595
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.440
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3596
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.060
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3597
01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:30.870
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

3598
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.961
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3599
01:40:30.961 --> 01:40:31.621
<v Speaker 4>Freddie Mercury,</v>

3600
01:40:31.621 --> 01:40:32.250
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3601
01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:37.250
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying is there's a disproportionate amount of gay vocalists out</v>

3602
01:40:37.591 --> 01:40:37.800
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

3603
01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.400
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3604
01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:42.170
<v Speaker 4>Think about currently and gay Broadway can drive.</v>

3605
01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:44.280
<v Speaker 4>You would think of people that perform on Broadway.</v>

3606
01:40:44.281 --> 01:40:47.070
<v Speaker 4>You think that these to a healthy percentage,</v>

3607
01:40:47.071 --> 01:40:47.904
<v Speaker 4>and think about this,</v>

3608
01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.280
<v Speaker 4>we all know this,</v>

3609
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:52.650
<v Speaker 4>we all know this in the music industry,</v>

3610
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot</v>

3611
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:58.750
<v Speaker 1>of gay music producers and music executives,</v>

3612
01:40:58.751 --> 01:40:59.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3613
01:40:59.170 --> 01:41:00.040
<v Speaker 1>And they do creepy shit,</v>

3614
01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:00.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3615
01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Not because they're gay,</v>

3616
01:41:01.751 --> 01:41:04.010
<v Speaker 1>just because the guys that you guys happened.</v>

3617
01:41:04.011 --> 01:41:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Cause the dyes guys do creepy shit and you're going to do creepy shit with</v>

3618
01:41:07.451 --> 01:41:08.110
<v Speaker 1>girls.</v>

3619
01:41:08.110 --> 01:41:08.711
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're gay,</v>

3620
01:41:08.711 --> 01:41:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do creepy shit with guys,</v>

3621
01:41:10.290 --> 01:41:11.260
<v Speaker 1>girls in district court.</v>

3622
01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:14.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a disproportionate amount of gay singers out there.</v>

3623
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:20.070
<v Speaker 1>And how was that heterosexual singer going to compete with the gay singer when</v>

3624
01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:23.380
<v Speaker 1>they're ready to suck dick at the drop of a fucking hat?</v>

3625
01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:24.580
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3626
01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:24.701
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3627
01:41:24.701 --> 01:41:25.361
<v Speaker 1>how bad you want to be.</v>

3628
01:41:25.361 --> 01:41:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Batman references jungle with a lot of guys.</v>

3629
01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying anything.</v>

3630
01:41:30.881 --> 01:41:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying there's a lot of gay singers and there's a lot of gay and I love</v>

3631
01:41:34.361 --> 01:41:35.290
<v Speaker 1>gay singers.</v>

3632
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Most of my favorite singers or gallons arguing,</v>

3633
01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:38.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

3634
01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:41.620
<v Speaker 1>let me phrase it this way.</v>

3635
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying that the same way that like have a gal was trying to get into the</v>

3636
01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:47.140
<v Speaker 1>music business,</v>

3637
01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:51.430
<v Speaker 1>she could potentially run into some own scrupulous males in the business who</v>

3638
01:41:51.431 --> 01:41:53.770
<v Speaker 1>prey on young girls trying to enter it to the business?</v>

3639
01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the same.</v>

3640
01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3641
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:58.600
<v Speaker 1>For young guys with gay guys,</v>

3642
01:41:58.630 --> 01:41:59.171
<v Speaker 1>if they're gay,</v>

3643
01:41:59.171 --> 01:42:01.330
<v Speaker 1>they're willing to suck that producers Dick.</v>

3644
01:42:01.331 --> 01:42:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And if they're not,</v>

3645
01:42:02.261 --> 01:42:02.981
<v Speaker 1>if they're straight,</v>

3646
01:42:02.981 --> 01:42:03.814
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be hard.</v>

3647
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.903
<v Speaker 1>There's some</v>

3648
01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:09.270
<v Speaker 1>dudes in bands like bass players and drummers are like,</v>

3649
01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.720
<v Speaker 1>do we need a gay singer to get a deal up in [inaudible]?</v>

3650
01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:13.660
<v Speaker 1>So they look for gay singers.</v>

3651
01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the music industry.</v>

3652
01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:17.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

3653
01:42:17.171 --> 01:42:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Look at that Germain de Randamie one too.</v>

3654
01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:19.890
<v Speaker 1>That was nasty.</v>

3655
01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:20.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3656
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:22.240
<v Speaker 1>one of the worst champions of all time,</v>

3657
01:42:22.241 --> 01:42:24.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking skilled man.</v>

3658
01:42:24.170 --> 01:42:24.461
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

3659
01:42:24.461 --> 01:42:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Really high level stand standup,</v>

3660
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:27.970
<v Speaker 1>14 time world champion,</v>

3661
01:42:27.971 --> 01:42:28.720
<v Speaker 1>some shit like that.</v>

3662
01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.051
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

3663
01:42:29.051 --> 01:42:32.830
<v Speaker 1>very good striking but did not want nothing to do with Cyborg.</v>

3664
01:42:32.831 --> 01:42:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that fascinating?</v>

3665
01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:34.901
<v Speaker 1>Literally it was like,</v>

3666
01:42:34.901 --> 01:42:35.130
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

3667
01:42:35.130 --> 01:42:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I have to hand her town.</v>

3668
01:42:37.730 --> 01:42:39.880
<v Speaker 1>She beat Holly should be here.</v>

3669
01:42:40.090 --> 01:42:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3670
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:41.680
<v Speaker 1>here's why I agree with you.</v>

3671
01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Holly clanged her with a question mark kick and dropped her.</v>

3672
01:42:45.130 --> 01:42:48.040
<v Speaker 1>She had her stunned with that and then she dropped her with a straight left</v>

3673
01:42:48.041 --> 01:42:48.640
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

3674
01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Those are two hugely significant moments.</v>

3675
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.750
<v Speaker 1>He only significant moments really?</v>

3676
01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Well there was Jermaine hit her after the bell twice,</v>

3677
01:42:56.350 --> 01:43:00.250
<v Speaker 1>twice and I think the second time you should have taken a point away because it</v>

3678
01:43:00.251 --> 01:43:00.640
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

3679
01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.120
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3680
01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.230
<v Speaker 1>they were hurting her.</v>

3681
01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Did the last one she landed after the bell.</v>

3682
01:43:04.451 --> 01:43:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

3683
01:43:05.170 --> 01:43:06.220
<v Speaker 1>was it the second round?</v>

3684
01:43:06.250 --> 01:43:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

01:44:00.850 --> 01:44:01.400
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

3725
01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:02.233
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

3726
01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to misquote.</v>

3727
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:05.271
<v Speaker 1>Scared was like,</v>

3728
01:44:05.271 --> 01:44:05.531

3730
01:44:06.351 --> 01:44:07.250

3731
01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go back paraphrase.</v>

3732
01:44:09.110 --> 01:44:13.670
<v Speaker 1>She essentially was saying that Cyborg has cheated and that she's used steroids.</v>

3733
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what [inaudible] is.</v>

3734
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:17.930
<v Speaker 1>And she said because of that she didn't want to fight her.</v>

3735
01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:19.700
<v Speaker 1>The first set her hand hurt.</v>

3736
01:44:19.701 --> 01:44:20.091
<v Speaker 1>Then she was like,</v>

3737
01:44:20.091 --> 01:44:20.331
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

3738
01:44:20.331 --> 01:44:21.164
<v Speaker 1>fuck national on this.</v>

3739
01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.690
<v Speaker 1>She said she needed thumb surgery and she didn't.</v>

3740
01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3741
01:44:24.230 --> 01:44:27.380
<v Speaker 1>she brought that up like immediately when I asked her about fighting Cyborg.</v>

3742
01:44:27.710 --> 01:44:29.990
<v Speaker 1>But I think sideboards the Bogie woman to these people.</v>

3743
01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:30.853
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

3744
01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I think she's so much bigger than everybody else.</v>

3745
01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's cutting down from one 75 one 80 or beat the shit.</v>

3746
01:44:37.181 --> 01:44:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Even she is not sure she'd get up to shake it up,</v>

3747
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:42.920
<v Speaker 1>shake it up there bro.</v>

3748

01:47:57.151 --> 01:47:58.530
<v Speaker 2>plastic bags hanging off them,</v>

3866
01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:02.970
<v Speaker 2>they're probably most likely mentally ill batshit crazy where I'll probably be</v>

3867
01:48:02.971 --> 01:48:03.320
<v Speaker 2>able to,</v>

3868
01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:06.630
<v Speaker 2>it's probably mk ultra throwaways.</v>

3869
01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:09.790
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a tag trafficking throws his way to that.</v>

3870
01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3871
01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:11.753
<v Speaker 2>it might be.</v>

3872
01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:12.793
<v Speaker 2>It might be.</v>

3873
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I think some of them have to be some throw away cause we all know a trafficking</v>

3874
01:48:19.401 --> 01:48:21.460
<v Speaker 2>is going on and I'm like what happens to these people?</v>

3875
01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:22.830
<v Speaker 2>We know a lot of them are veterans.</v>

3876
01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:24.110
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets real scary.</v>

3877
01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:25.141
<v Speaker 2>Super.</v>

3878
01:48:25.141 --> 01:48:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Dot of them are veterans.</v>

3879
01:48:26.370 --> 01:48:29.790
<v Speaker 2>A lot of a lot of veterans come home and they don't know what the fuck to do and</v>

3880
01:48:29.791 --> 01:48:30.624
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3884
01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:35.963

3896
01:48:55.410 --> 01:48:57.100
<v Speaker 2>the back seat stays in the back seat.</v>

01:48:57.931 --> 01:48:58.830
<v Speaker 2>you got to get up here.</v>

3900
01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this dude.</v>

3901
01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Jam Germane to Rhonda.</v>

3902
01:49:04.981 --> 01:49:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Me Looks Spooky.</v>

3903
01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.540
<v Speaker 2>She is so dangerous because she doesn't do anything wrong.</v>

3904
01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:10.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3905
01:49:10.230 --> 01:49:11.130
<v Speaker 2>show calculating.</v>

3906
01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:15.330
<v Speaker 2>It's super like super technical with her movements too.</v>

3907
01:49:15.331 --> 01:49:16.770
<v Speaker 2>And she's basically playing like a,</v>

3908
01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:18.180
<v Speaker 2>a rhythm dance.</v>

3909
01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:20.430
<v Speaker 2>She's forcing Raquel into movements,</v>

3910
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:23.940
<v Speaker 2>but she has the solutions to those movements like several steps ahead.</v>

3911
01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:24.691
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>

3912
01:49:24.691 --> 01:49:24.871
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

3913
01:49:24.871 --> 01:49:29.871
<v Speaker 2>think about how many more fights Dramamine it's been in that Kal,</v>

3914
01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I [inaudible] cold remotely.</v>

3915
01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:34.920
<v Speaker 2>Well not just bands factor at a high level.</v>

3916
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Pennington would have to really struggle to take her down.</v>

3917
01:49:37.501 --> 01:49:40.830
<v Speaker 2>She's a one 45 or in Pennington has been fighting at one 35,</v>

3918
01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:41.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3919
01:49:41.681 --> 01:49:44.340
<v Speaker 2>and Jermaine dropped down to 35 for this fight,</v>

3920
01:49:44.341 --> 01:49:44.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3921
01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Is this the 35 or 45?</v>

3922
01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:47.020
<v Speaker 2>35.</v>

3923
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 2>So Jermaine dropped</v>

3924
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.280
<v Speaker 1>back down to 35 after that 145 pound fight.</v>

3925
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

3926
01:49:51.971 --> 01:49:52.804
<v Speaker 1>Head kick.</v>

3927
01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3928
01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:58.740
<v Speaker 1>so she's super strong for the weight class and it didn't [inaudible] tough</v>

3929
01:49:59.231 --> 01:50:01.870
<v Speaker 1>record to the salty six and five or some,</v>

3930
01:50:01.871 --> 01:50:02.770
<v Speaker 1>she's type shit.</v>

3931
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:04.030
<v Speaker 1>She's as tough as they come.</v>

3932
01:50:04.031 --> 01:50:04.301
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3933
01:50:04.301 --> 01:50:07.300
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite finishes ever was her versus Ashley,</v>

3934
01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:07.841
<v Speaker 1>Evan Smith,</v>

3935
01:50:07.841 --> 01:50:10.730
<v Speaker 1>because he was just this wild fucking fall.</v>

3936
01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And then she catches her in a bulldog choke and puts her unconscious for like a</v>

3937
01:50:14.591 --> 01:50:16.510
<v Speaker 1>second to the last fight.</v>

3938
01:50:16.511 --> 01:50:17.650
<v Speaker 1>And Deborah to was,</v>

3939
01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:20.890
<v Speaker 1>she's from Colorado Springs so they usually put on the Denver cards.</v>

3940
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:22.990
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm a fan.</v>

3941
01:50:23.110 --> 01:50:23.771
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan too.</v>

3942
01:50:23.771 --> 01:50:25.480
<v Speaker 1>She's just so damn tough man.</v>

3943
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:26.440
<v Speaker 1>But Duran me,</v>

3944
01:50:26.441 --> 01:50:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3945
01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I hate this matchup for after fucking Amanda Nunez.</v>

3946
01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a scary matchup cause she's ranked number foods that uppercut goddamn.</v>

3947
01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:38.060
<v Speaker 1>It's scary because it's,</v>

3948
01:50:38.061 --> 01:50:40.210
<v Speaker 1>it's real similar and maybe,</v>

3949
01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3950
01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Duran to me is even more a more lethal with all the different things.</v>

3951
01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hating on all,</v>

3952
01:50:47.321 --> 01:50:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but trend me looks identical to the gang.</v>

3953
01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Kickbox kickboxer that beats the fuck out of junk club.</v>

3954
01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:52.473
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] friend,</v>

3955
01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:55.840
<v Speaker 1>the scary dude who's kicking the walls.</v>

3956
01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:01.560
<v Speaker 1>The thing about Duran to me that makes her just see for sure Amanda Nunez has</v>

3957
01:51:02.111 --> 01:51:06.430
<v Speaker 1>more power and she'll assault you and she's more aggressive and reckless.</v>

3958
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Like she comes after you,</v>

3959
01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:08.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3960
01:51:08.090 --> 01:51:08.923
<v Speaker 1>Nunez.</v>

3961
01:51:09.010 --> 01:51:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3962
01:51:09.670 --> 01:51:10.520
<v Speaker 1>And she's a murderer.</v>

3963
01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Power and more power at her hands are just stuttering speed.</v>

3964
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.790
<v Speaker 1>And then she's not so black belt on the ground.</v>

3965
01:51:15.791 --> 01:51:16.750
<v Speaker 1>She's a bit of a beast,</v>

3966
01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:18.370
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's the power is the difference.</v>

3967
01:51:18.371 --> 01:51:21.520
<v Speaker 1>But Duran to me has the full arsenal,</v>

3968
01:51:21.610 --> 01:51:22.121
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3969
01:51:22.121 --> 01:51:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Like as far as her tech,</v>

3970
01:51:23.231 --> 01:51:24.070
<v Speaker 1>she's a surgeon.</v>

3971
01:51:24.370 --> 01:51:24.761
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3972
01:51:24.761 --> 01:51:25.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to put it.</v>

3973
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Everything she,</v>

3974
01:51:26.410 --> 01:51:29.680
<v Speaker 1>all of her striking is dumped so efforts effortlessly.</v>

3975
01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:31.600
<v Speaker 1>It's all efficiently and smooth.</v>

3976
01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.460
<v Speaker 1>And there's no like weird,</v>

3977
01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:35.950
<v Speaker 1>like moments where hands are down.</v>

3978
01:51:35.951 --> 01:51:38.910
<v Speaker 1>She's lunging or footwear Ballance never.</v>

3979
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:39.940
<v Speaker 1>The only time she,</v>

3980
01:51:39.941 --> 01:51:40.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3981
01:51:40.630 --> 01:51:42.100
<v Speaker 1>struggled severely.</v>

3982
01:51:42.101 --> 01:51:42.940
<v Speaker 1>It was against Holly Holm,</v>

3983
01:51:42.941 --> 01:51:47.170
<v Speaker 1>who's also a worldclass boxer and tricky because Holly is different than</v>

3984
01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:49.120
<v Speaker 1>probably a lot of the strikers that she faced.</v>

3985
01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:50.051
<v Speaker 1>He's a big boy.</v>

3986
01:51:50.051 --> 01:51:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Thai people.</v>

3987
01:51:50.710 --> 01:51:51.401
<v Speaker 1>Yes she is.</v>

3988
01:51:51.401 --> 01:51:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Because she's very strong.</v>

3989
01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Athletic.</v>

3990
01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:53.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3991
01:51:53.441 --> 01:51:56.110
<v Speaker 1>And she also has got sneaky shit that she does.</v>

3992
01:51:56.290 --> 01:51:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Like that question mark kick,</v>

3993
01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:58.361
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3994
01:51:58.361 --> 01:52:00.190
<v Speaker 1>She claimed her right off the head with that one.</v>

3995
01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:00.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3996
01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:04.540
<v Speaker 1>that was a big moment because Duran to me was in the beginning of the fight was</v>

3997
01:52:04.541 --> 01:52:06.340
<v Speaker 1>kind of controlling the page and controlling the rhythm.</v>

3998
01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:08.380
<v Speaker 1>And Holly had a finder spots and,</v>

3999
01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:10.600
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people thought she could have won that decision.</v>

4000
01:52:10.630 --> 01:52:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

4001
01:52:10.930 --> 01:52:11.770
<v Speaker 1>it was real close.</v>

4002
01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:14.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough spot for [inaudible] me where they go and now you're fighting</v>

4003
01:52:14.231 --> 01:52:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg.</v>

4004
01:52:14.710 --> 01:52:15.071
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

4005
01:52:15.071 --> 01:52:16.300
<v Speaker 1>fuck that man.</v>

4006
01:52:16.330 --> 01:52:18.340
<v Speaker 1>So then you know she had stripped of the title.</v>

4007
01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:19.510
<v Speaker 1>We all shit on her,</v>

4008
01:52:19.511 --> 01:52:20.800
<v Speaker 1>but it must have been a tough position.</v>

4009
01:52:21.250 --> 01:52:21.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4010
01:52:21.641 --> 01:52:24.030
<v Speaker 1>if she has real feelings about this and she really,</v>

4011
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.221
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4012
01:52:24.221 --> 01:52:25.054
<v Speaker 1>something happened.</v>

4013
01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:26.771
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

4014
01:52:26.771 --> 01:52:27.604
<v Speaker 1>Grabbing the shorts.</v>

4015
01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:28.091
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4016
01:52:28.091 --> 01:52:28.924
<v Speaker 1>Something happened.</v>

4017
01:52:29.630 --> 01:52:30.463
<v Speaker 1>Hit her in the titty.</v>

4018
01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Did she go low?</v>

4019
01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:34.053
<v Speaker 1>Did they take,</v>

4020
01:52:34.450 --> 01:52:36.400
<v Speaker 1>did they take a cooler shot?</v>

4021
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:37.391
<v Speaker 1>Do you pause?</v>

4022
01:52:37.391 --> 01:52:38.224
<v Speaker 1>So I took it.</v>

4023
01:52:38.650 --> 01:52:39.970
<v Speaker 1>What happened Jamie?</v>

4024
01:52:39.971 --> 01:52:40.450
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

4025
01:52:40.450 --> 01:52:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I poke the pussy shot.</v>

4026
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>

4027
01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

4028
01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:44.653
<v Speaker 1>Was it,</v>

4029
01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it was either shorter fence grabbing.</v>

4030
01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:48.290
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a hard part.</v>

4031
01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:51.800
<v Speaker 1>It might be a sense grabbing fence or it seems like the given her a chance to</v>

4032
01:52:51.801 --> 01:52:52.634
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>

4033
01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:53.481
<v Speaker 1>God it,</v>

4034
01:52:53.481 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I wish we were paying attention.</v>

4035
01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 1>It's something happened.</v>

4036
01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Can we rewind a bit?</v>

4037
01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4038
01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:58.393
<v Speaker 1>but then we'll fuck everybody.</v>

4039
01:52:58.410 --> 01:52:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4040
01:52:58.860 --> 01:52:59.693
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a nightmare.</v>

4041
01:52:59.770 --> 01:53:00.800
<v Speaker 1>She dragged me.</v>

4042
01:53:00.801 --> 01:53:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Just apologize.</v>

4043
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it was.</v>

4044
01:53:03.230 --> 01:53:05.030
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a f a Pho strong.</v>

4045
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:06.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm strong J oh,</v>

4046
01:53:06.201 --> 01:53:06.471
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

4047
01:53:06.471 --> 01:53:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Neat fuck but not,</v>

4048
01:53:08.451 --> 01:53:11.480
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't go net lateral notice straight back.</v>

4049
01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4050
01:53:12.090 --> 01:53:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Still good takedown defense,</v>

4051
01:53:14.271 --> 01:53:17.960
<v Speaker 1>but accepting the fact that clinch is definitely going to happen as opposed to</v>

4052
01:53:17.961 --> 01:53:19.580
<v Speaker 1>like almost wants to clinch.</v>

4053
01:53:19.670 --> 01:53:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Well almost maybe a fire.</v>

4054
01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:24.740
<v Speaker 1>It's also the end of the third and she's been winning all the rounds,</v>

4055
01:53:24.741 --> 01:53:25.101
<v Speaker 1>so she's like,</v>

4056
01:53:25.101 --> 01:53:25.341
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

4057
01:53:25.341 --> 01:53:25.801
<v Speaker 1>cool man.</v>

4058
01:53:25.801 --> 01:53:26.634
<v Speaker 1>Let's say for me.</v>

4059
01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4060
01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll just knocked down to myself.</v>

4061
01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Let me catch my breath and then get you off me and finished around strong,</v>

4062
01:53:32.871 --> 01:53:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but she's going to have a hard time getting her off.</v>

4063
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.551
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

4064
01:53:34.551 --> 01:53:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm nervous for these next two fights.</v>

4065
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:40.270
<v Speaker 1>The Korean Zombie one's interesting because yeah,</v>

4066
01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:41.990
<v Speaker 1>there's been out for a hot fucking minute.</v>

4067
01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:42.421
<v Speaker 1>Mary,</v>

4068
01:53:42.421 --> 01:53:42.741
<v Speaker 1>he's base.</v>

4069
01:53:42.741 --> 01:53:44.270
<v Speaker 1>He signed with Bellator,</v>

4070
01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:48.380
<v Speaker 1>like he was going through that whole thing where he turned down as a beat fight.</v>

4071
01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Then they go,</v>

4072
01:53:49.170 --> 01:53:49.341
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

4073
01:53:49.341 --> 01:53:50.240
<v Speaker 1>if you're not fighting to beat,</v>

4074
01:53:50.241 --> 01:53:51.170
<v Speaker 1>we're going to cut you.</v>

4075
01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.153
<v Speaker 1>Then he's a guy</v>

4076
01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:54.381
<v Speaker 1>and then they're like,</v>

4077
01:53:54.381 --> 01:53:54.980
<v Speaker 1>write your findings.</v>

4078
01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:55.371
<v Speaker 1>A beat.</v>

4079
01:53:55.371 --> 01:53:56.204
<v Speaker 1>There's a beat.</v>

4080
01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Pulls out two d step.</v>

4081
01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful one right hand,</v>

4082
01:53:59.901 --> 01:54:00.440
<v Speaker 1>left hook,</v>

4083
01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:01.310
<v Speaker 1>right leg kick.</v>

4084
01:54:01.690 --> 01:54:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

4085
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:03.020
<v Speaker 1>She's fun to watch,</v>

4086
01:54:03.021 --> 01:54:03.261
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4087
01:54:03.261 --> 01:54:04.490
<v Speaker 1>She got a bad rap because the,</v>

4088
01:54:04.491 --> 01:54:04.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4089
01:54:04.731 --> 01:54:06.080
<v Speaker 1>some on the Cyborg stuff.</v>

4090
01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4091
01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:08.240
<v Speaker 1>you know what man,</v>

4092
01:54:09.690 --> 01:54:10.420
<v Speaker 1>it is what,</v>

4093
01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:11.270
<v Speaker 1>that is what it is.</v>

4094
01:54:11.271 --> 01:54:12.710
<v Speaker 1>We've said so much about that.</v>

4095
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:15.310
<v Speaker 1>There's really no reason to continue to talk about it now.</v>

4096
01:54:15.490 --> 01:54:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Just want to look at the reality of who they are today.</v>

4097
01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg is just waste carrier than any of those girls.</v>

4098
01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:23.570
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that makes Amanda Nunez,</v>

4099
01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:24.111
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4100
01:54:24.111 --> 01:54:27.020
<v Speaker 1>interesting as an opponent for Cyborg is first of all,</v>

4101
01:54:27.021 --> 01:54:28.580
<v Speaker 1>her last fight with Raquel Pennington,</v>

4102
01:54:28.581 --> 01:54:29.690
<v Speaker 1>she showed a lot of movement.</v>

4103
01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I think she needs a shitload of movement in this fight.</v>

4104
01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:33.180
<v Speaker 1>She would need all the moves.</v>

4105
01:54:33.210 --> 01:54:35.390
<v Speaker 1>She needs to be in fucking shape.</v>

4106
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:39.110
<v Speaker 1>She needs to be in serious shape and she needs to be strong rounds.</v>

4107
01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:41.660
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the things that Amanda noon that said at the press</v>

4108
01:54:41.661 --> 01:54:42.494
<v Speaker 1>conference,</v>

4109
01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:43.611
<v Speaker 1>the press conference,</v>

4110
01:54:43.611 --> 01:54:46.880
<v Speaker 1>press conferences is interesting because Cyborg was accusing her of,</v>

4111
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:47.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4112
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I think not fighting or at a previous time.</v>

4113
01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:52.850
<v Speaker 1>And she said she needed more time.</v>

4114
01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:55.610
<v Speaker 1>I think they wanted to try to do those too.</v>

4115
01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:56.151
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

4116
01:54:56.151 --> 01:54:59.540
<v Speaker 1>They'd be trying from Madison Square Garden while Amanda Nunez goes,</v>

4117
01:54:59.541 --> 01:55:00.261
<v Speaker 1>I need more time,</v>

4118
01:55:00.261 --> 01:55:01.370
<v Speaker 1>which I actually liked that.</v>

4119
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I liked that too because she's the smaller woman coming up as 135 pound</v>

4120
01:55:05.691 --> 01:55:06.380
<v Speaker 1>champion,</v>

4121
01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:08.240
<v Speaker 1>challenging the hundred 45 pound champion.</v>

4122
01:55:08.241 --> 01:55:10.340
<v Speaker 1>She's going to have to put some weight on to want to keep it on and be</v>

4123
01:55:10.341 --> 01:55:13.670
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with it on and hopefully get above one 45 so she can cut a little</v>

4124
01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:17.240
<v Speaker 1>because the reality of Cyborg is she's way bigger.</v>

4125
01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.070
<v Speaker 1>She's probably walking around.</v>

4126
01:55:19.130 --> 01:55:19.580
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

4127
01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:21.590
<v Speaker 1>how many pounds bigger would you guess then Amanda?</v>

4128
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Just naturally,</v>

4129
01:55:22.761 --> 01:55:24.770
<v Speaker 1>just naturally 25 30 probably.</v>

4130
01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:25.610
<v Speaker 1>What did you think?</v>

4131
01:55:25.610 --> 01:55:27.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a number I would like to play with.</v>

4132
01:55:27.551 --> 01:55:28.970
<v Speaker 1>That number is at least 20 [inaudible].</v>

4133
01:55:28.971 --> 01:55:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Say It would be 2020 to be fair.</v>

4134
01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:31.011
<v Speaker 1>20 pounds.</v>

4135
01:55:31.011 --> 01:55:32.210
<v Speaker 1>That's entirely possible.</v>

4136
01:55:32.211 --> 01:55:37.211
<v Speaker 1>It would be 20 so if Amanda Nunez is the hundred and 35 pound women's champion,</v>

4137
01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:41.180
<v Speaker 1>what does she actually way we're saying if you,</v>

4138
01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:42.380
<v Speaker 1>if you think the Cyborg is,</v>

4139
01:55:42.381 --> 01:55:42.791
<v Speaker 1>let's give her,</v>

4140
01:55:42.791 --> 01:55:45.270
<v Speaker 1>it was be generous and say it's in the one seventies yes.</v>

4141
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:48.150
<v Speaker 1>And then she cuts down to one 45 and we don't know by the way,</v>

4142
01:55:48.151 --> 01:55:49.530
<v Speaker 1>we just have red things.</v>

4143
01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:53.850
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know like let's see if Cyborg has ever commented on what she</v>

4144
01:55:53.851 --> 01:55:55.290
<v Speaker 1>weighs before she starts her weight.</v>

4145
01:55:55.291 --> 01:55:56.124
<v Speaker 1>Cut.</v>

4146
01:55:57.110 --> 01:55:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Lock,</v>

4147
01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:58.410
<v Speaker 1>high sixties right?</v>

4148
01:55:58.620 --> 01:55:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Maybe let's,</v>

4149
01:55:59.461 --> 01:56:04.050
<v Speaker 1>let's get crazy and say it's one 60 even one 60 would be a lot of weight.</v>

4150
01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Bigger than a man of Nunez,</v>

4151
01:56:05.161 --> 01:56:05.994
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you think?</v>

4152
01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:11.060
<v Speaker 1>100% what does Amanda Nunez way 50 you think she weighs one 50 when she walks</v>

4153
01:56:11.581 --> 01:56:15.270
<v Speaker 1>around normally and cuts down to one 35 [inaudible] she's very strong.</v>

4154
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Rock stuck,</v>

4155
01:56:17.130 --> 01:56:17.850
<v Speaker 1>jacked.</v>

4156
01:56:17.850 --> 01:56:19.860
<v Speaker 1>She's got all that back power man,</v>

4157
01:56:19.861 --> 01:56:20.700
<v Speaker 1>when she punches,</v>

4158
01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:24.560
<v Speaker 1>she fucking has the longest punches like you my favorites.</v>

4159
01:56:24.561 --> 01:56:25.140
<v Speaker 1>But she's,</v>

4160
01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:26.700
<v Speaker 1>she punches so long.</v>

4161
01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:30.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like she's hitting you with science team and she's hitting you way at the</v>

4162
01:56:30.691 --> 01:56:31.440
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

4163
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.450
<v Speaker 1>And she's fucking aggressive as shit.</v>

4164
01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:34.471
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

4165
01:56:34.471 --> 01:56:39.471
<v Speaker 1>so maybe let's say she weighs one 45 one 50 at the most,</v>

4166
01:56:40.230 --> 01:56:41.340
<v Speaker 1>let's say 50 at the most.</v>

4167
01:56:41.490 --> 01:56:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Cyber could be one 70 she could be bigger than one.</v>

4168
01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.860
<v Speaker 1>She's rolling around sixties you think she's in her sixties?</v>

4169
01:56:47.861 --> 01:56:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4170
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:50.250
<v Speaker 1>She thinks she's in his sixties now.</v>

4171
01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Or you think she's in the 60s all the time.</v>

4172
01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you think she gets bigger than that and then fleeing from talking with her</v>

4173
01:56:57.391 --> 01:56:57.990
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4174
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.621
<v Speaker 1>her manager,</v>

4175
01:56:58.621 --> 01:56:59.454
<v Speaker 1>her boyfriend,</v>

4176
01:56:59.550 --> 01:57:02.250
<v Speaker 1>she walks around at one 85 Jesus used to,</v>

4177
01:57:02.251 --> 01:57:03.084
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

4178
01:57:03.390 --> 01:57:03.930
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

4179
01:57:03.930 --> 01:57:04.630
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

4180
01:57:04.630 --> 01:57:05.170
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4181
01:57:05.170 --> 01:57:05.791
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>

4182
01:57:05.791 --> 01:57:10.791
<v Speaker 1>she's approaching UFC two 19 which already happened at one 70 is down here.</v>

4183
01:57:14.221 --> 01:57:16.740
<v Speaker 1>They were talking what year is this?</v>

4184
01:57:16.741 --> 01:57:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Is this is at the end of last year.</v>

4185
01:57:18.330 --> 01:57:19.163
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

4186
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Now know before I used to walk around at one 80 or 85 and now I'm walking around</v>

4187
01:57:25.771 --> 01:57:28.710
<v Speaker 1>at one 70 and it's very different than it.</v>

4188
01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4189
01:57:29.130 --> 01:57:29.963
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

4190
01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Then before when I was heavy,</v>

4191
01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting to work more and more that.</v>

4192
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4193
01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:36.203
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

4194
01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Once 70 he said,</v>

4195
01:57:37.641 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting to work more and more.</v>

4196
01:57:39.481 --> 01:57:40.141
<v Speaker 1>Getting light,</v>

4197
01:57:40.141 --> 01:57:42.120
<v Speaker 1>but I really have to be on top of my weight now.</v>

4198
01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:45.450
<v Speaker 1>So she's decided to stay on top of her weight so she doesn't have to go through</v>

4199
01:57:45.451 --> 01:57:46.500
<v Speaker 1>so much of a brutal cut,</v>

4200
01:57:46.530 --> 01:57:47.730
<v Speaker 1>which I think is very wise.</v>

4201
01:57:48.150 --> 01:57:50.010
<v Speaker 1>One 70 is still a lot of weight.</v>

4202
01:57:50.011 --> 01:57:51.390
<v Speaker 1>That's 25 pounds.</v>

4203
01:57:51.391 --> 01:57:54.510
<v Speaker 1>She fights at one 45 she's the 145 pound champion,</v>

4204
01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:58.620
<v Speaker 1>which means even right now she's saying she doesn't cut as much,</v>

4205
01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:01.110
<v Speaker 1>but she cuts 25 pounds.</v>

4206
01:58:01.110 --> 01:58:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

4207
01:58:01.770 --> 01:58:02.490
<v Speaker 1>That's how,</v>

4208
01:58:02.490 --> 01:58:03.870
<v Speaker 1>how big she is for the division.</v>

4209
01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:05.820
<v Speaker 1>And I did Lockhart tips.</v>

4210
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was dolce is one of those,</v>

4211
01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:07.981
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

4212
01:58:07.981 --> 01:58:08.430
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>

4213
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Which we're saying that it's tougher for females that the weight cut gets</v>

4214
01:58:12.601 --> 01:58:15.330
<v Speaker 1>tougher and tougher because the adipose tissue and stuff like that and their</v>

4215
01:58:15.331 --> 01:58:16.000
<v Speaker 1>hormones.</v>

4216
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4217
01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that was Lockhart.</v>

4218
01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4219
01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:18.431
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

4220
01:58:18.431 --> 01:58:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I just be bro Science right now we are pro science and all that,</v>

4221
01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:22.111
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

4222
01:58:22.111 --> 01:58:24.450
<v Speaker 1>one of us know Jack Shit about fat content thing,</v>

4223
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:26.010
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to women.</v>

4224
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:27.480
<v Speaker 1>But I do think that,</v>

4225
01:58:27.481 --> 01:58:27.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4226
01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:28.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4227
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:32.130
<v Speaker 1>there's also unique struggles with women when it's different times of the month.</v>

4228
01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:32.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4229
01:58:32.791 --> 01:58:33.750
<v Speaker 1>women get bloated,</v>

4230
01:58:33.751 --> 01:58:34.920
<v Speaker 1>they retained water,</v>

4231
01:58:34.921 --> 01:58:37.020
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it's hard to get that water out.</v>

4232
01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I have also talked to some women I've dated in the past when and who do those</v>

4233
01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 1>who cut</v>

4234
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.690
<v Speaker 2>weight to not for fighting,</v>

4235
01:58:43.691 --> 01:58:45.820
<v Speaker 2>but for like bodybuilding where they do bikini,</v>

4236
01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:46.091
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4237
01:58:46.091 --> 01:58:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Her thyroids are fucked up so then their body cut down,</v>

4238
01:58:50.921 --> 01:58:51.371
<v Speaker 2>but then it goes,</v>

4239
01:58:51.371 --> 01:58:51.701
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>

4240
01:58:51.701 --> 01:58:52.570
<v Speaker 2>we don't do that again.</v>

4241
01:58:52.571 --> 01:58:55.150
<v Speaker 2>So it blows up and it's trying to protect stuff.</v>

4242
01:58:55.151 --> 01:58:56.800
<v Speaker 2>So weight cutting for women,</v>

4243
01:58:56.890 --> 01:58:58.630
<v Speaker 2>the high Maffra time gets tougher and tougher.</v>

4244
01:58:59.230 --> 01:59:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Row Science Hashtag Bro Science ProSites bad for everybody,</v>

4245
01:59:04.181 --> 01:59:04.570
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4246

<v Speaker 2>It's not good for anybody.</v>

4247
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:09.640
<v Speaker 2>That's why cowboy at 70 I like is 55 or so drawn out.</v>

4248
01:59:09.641 --> 01:59:13.480
<v Speaker 2>But then there's guys like fucking till till you know,</v>

4254
01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing that scares me about this fight with cowboy cal.</v>

4255
01:59:27.251 --> 01:59:27.821
<v Speaker 2>We needs this,</v>

01:59:27.821 --> 01:59:28.001
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4257
01:59:28.001 --> 01:59:30.250
<v Speaker 2>He's a bit of a fork in the road for first career.</v>

4258
01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:33.250
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting a guy and Mike Perry who's trained with his camp,</v>

4259
01:59:33.251 --> 01:59:35.680
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows cowboy better watch cab.</v>

4260
01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:38.200
<v Speaker 2>We sparred more than people at Jackson's.</v>

4261
01:59:38.230 --> 01:59:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4262
01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:41.500
<v Speaker 2>And can we needs this then there's the whole thing with Mike [inaudible] and</v>

4263
01:59:41.501 --> 01:59:44.310
<v Speaker 2>John who's corner and Perry against cowboy.</v>

4264
01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Just a shit situation man.</v>

4265
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:48.080
<v Speaker 2>But it is for everybody.</v>

4266
01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Just highly charged.</v>

4267
01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:50.650
<v Speaker 2>It's highly charged.</v>

4268
01:59:50.651 --> 01:59:51.370
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>

4269
01:59:51.370 --> 01:59:53.010
<v Speaker 2>both guys are there.</v>

4270
01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:53.830
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

4271
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:55.750
<v Speaker 2>it's a matchup that people want to say.</v>

4272
01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:56.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4273
01:59:56.021 --> 01:59:56.180
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4274
01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:57.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a real crossroads match off.</v>

4275
01:59:57.541 --> 01:59:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I love the fight.</v>

4276
01:59:58.930 --> 02:00:03.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a crossroads match up because if a pirate Perry can't get past Robin or</v>

4277
02:00:03.190 --> 02:00:06.700
<v Speaker 2>can't get past a Donald's Roney and it puts him in this position where,</v>

4278
02:00:06.730 --> 02:00:07.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4279
02:00:07.061 --> 02:00:07.451
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

4280
02:00:07.451 --> 02:00:08.284
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4281
02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:09.513
<v Speaker 2>he's learning,</v>

4282
02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:10.720
<v Speaker 2>he's certainly getting better,</v>

4283
02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:12.730
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to world class competition,</v>

4284
02:00:12.731 --> 02:00:15.040
<v Speaker 2>who's the most world class guy he's faced,</v>

4285
02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:18.400
<v Speaker 2>but before it's Felder and fell just really a 155 pounds daughters is best.</v>

4286
02:00:18.401 --> 02:00:21.100
<v Speaker 2>When he mentioned he was hurt before that Potts,</v>

4287
02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:22.473
<v Speaker 2>he lost.</v>

4288
02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:23.171
<v Speaker 2>He lost that.</v>

4289
02:00:23.171 --> 02:00:24.430
<v Speaker 2>That's an old Jake Ellenberger.</v>

4290
02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:26.831
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

4291
02:00:26.831 --> 02:00:29.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's still fucking stunning the way he knocked him out.</v>

4292
02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:32.140
<v Speaker 2>You realize that that kind of older Jake Ellenberger for sure,</v>

4293
02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:35.590
<v Speaker 2>but that elbow on the break was legit as fuck dude.</v>

4294
02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Cause then when you look at the guys,</v>

4295
02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Alan Jobe and beat him,</v>

4296
02:00:37.781 --> 02:00:38.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4297
02:00:38.230 --> 02:00:39.260
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

4298
02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:41.440
<v Speaker 2>it should be by if this is by far the toughest fight.</v>

4299
02:00:41.470 --> 02:00:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I think this is his toughest fight,</v>

4300
02:00:42.971 --> 02:00:44.680
<v Speaker 2>but also they know each other.</v>

4301
02:00:44.710 --> 02:00:47.010
<v Speaker 2>They've sparred together and um,</v>

4302
02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:47.920
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

4303
02:00:47.921 --> 02:00:48.341
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

4304
02:00:48.341 --> 02:00:49.490
<v Speaker 2>I liked those.</v>

4305
02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:50.141
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

4306
02:00:50.141 --> 02:00:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I think Donald thinks he knows his tendencies and he knows what he can do with</v>

4307
02:00:53.891 --> 02:00:54.550
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

4308
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:55.383
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

4309
02:00:55.690 --> 02:00:56.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4310
02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:58.600
<v Speaker 2>I think Donald has some good times with them.</v>

4311
02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:01.640
<v Speaker 2>They say when they grappled Donald tuned him up.</v>

4312
02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:03.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think Matt.</v>

4313
02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that Mike Perry sad is that Donald's probably going</v>

4314
02:01:06.641 --> 02:01:08.440
<v Speaker 2>to try to grab a hold of me and put me on my back.</v>

4315
02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding me down.</v>

4316
02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:11.193
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4317
02:01:11.250 --> 02:01:11.590
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4318
02:01:11.590 --> 02:01:12.250
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

4319
02:01:12.250 --> 02:01:13.630
<v Speaker 2>you can't discount this dude.</v>

4320
02:01:13.631 --> 02:01:13.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4321
02:01:13.781 --> 02:01:14.980
<v Speaker 2>he knocked out Matt Brown.</v>

4322
02:01:14.981 --> 02:01:15.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4323
02:01:15.191 --> 02:01:19.210
<v Speaker 2>this fucking combination that he did to Rick story was preposterous to</v>

4324
02:01:19.211 --> 02:01:19.650
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>

4325
02:01:19.650 --> 02:01:21.550
<v Speaker 2>One of the great that he's just been doing it for a long,</v>

4326
02:01:21.551 --> 02:01:22.830
<v Speaker 2>long fucking time.</v>

4327
02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.460
<v Speaker 2>And the way he did that Rick story went,</v>

4328
02:01:24.461 --> 02:01:24.641
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

4329
02:01:24.641 --> 02:01:25.750
<v Speaker 2>he's just touching him up.</v>

4330
02:01:25.751 --> 02:01:27.490
<v Speaker 2>He's a touch scary thing about Donald's.</v>

4331
02:01:27.491 --> 02:01:28.870
<v Speaker 2>When Donald can be the bully,</v>

4332
02:01:28.871 --> 02:01:30.340
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna fuck you up.</v>

4333
02:01:30.341 --> 02:01:33.850
<v Speaker 2>But when someone draws a line in the sand and starts going forward on Donald,</v>

4334
02:01:33.851 --> 02:01:34.810
<v Speaker 2>he struggles a little bit.</v>

4335
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:36.310
<v Speaker 2>Ideas fight.</v>

4336
02:01:36.490 --> 02:01:36.851
<v Speaker 2>You know there,</v>

4337
02:01:36.851 --> 02:01:37.684
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>

4338
02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:39.320
<v Speaker 2>the guys who don't play his games,</v>

4339
02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Matt Brown,</v>

4340
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.030
<v Speaker 1>that was a tough fight for him.</v>

4341
02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:42.200
<v Speaker 1>So he knocked him out.</v>

4342
02:01:42.201 --> 02:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>That was a tough fucking fight.</v>

4343
02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:43.501
<v Speaker 1>What was it,</v>

4344
02:01:43.501 --> 02:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Matt Brown's tough fight for anybody.</v>

4345
02:01:44.631 --> 02:01:45.051
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

4346
02:01:45.051 --> 02:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

4347
02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Here's that elbow boom son.</v>

4348
02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:48.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4349
02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>he's got some fucking power,</v>

4350
02:01:50.571 --> 02:01:51.404
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4351
02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

4352
02:01:52.670 --> 02:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>he looked great against filter.</v>

4353
02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:54.820
<v Speaker 1>He really did.</v>

4354
02:01:54.820 --> 02:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

4355
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>He didn't just look great because fell to hurt his arm.</v>

4356
02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>He looked great because he looked great,</v>

4357
02:01:59.210 --> 02:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>but felt he did hurt his arm.</v>

4358
02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:01.700
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

4359
02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:03.590
<v Speaker 1>he took his arm off Mike Perry's head,</v>

4360
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:06.500
<v Speaker 1>that spinning back fist leads to so many broken arms.</v>

4361
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

4362
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:08.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of God.</v>

4363
02:02:08.301 --> 02:02:08.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4364
02:02:08.571 --> 02:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>you hit that forehead and Felder and I were talking about it like he was like,</v>

4365
02:02:12.321 --> 02:02:15.020
<v Speaker 1>he's tries to kind of smash it with a,</v>

4366
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>like a hammer fist.</v>

4367
02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:17.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4368
02:02:17.121 --> 02:02:19.520
<v Speaker 1>you try to catch a guy like right at the end of it,</v>

4369
02:02:19.521 --> 02:02:20.750
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes,</v>

4370
02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:21.693
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

4371
02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:24.230
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you hit that fucking forehead.</v>

4372
02:02:24.231 --> 02:02:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Foreheads are so hard,</v>

4373
02:02:25.791 --> 02:02:26.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4374
02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.</v>

4375
02:02:27.231 --> 02:02:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause Felder's a great commentator so do that and quick and punch in the face.</v>

4376
02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4377
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:32.560
<v Speaker 1>he is a great commentator.</v>

02:02:32.561 --> 02:02:33.021
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>

4379

<v Speaker 1>very good spin together,</v>

4380
02:02:34.881 --> 02:02:35.300
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:35.691
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4382
02:02:35.691 --> 02:02:35.931
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

4383

4384
02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>He loves the sport.</v>

4385
02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>He really does love the sport.</v>

4386
02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:41.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4387
02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>he's an acting major.</v>

4388
02:02:42.741 --> 02:02:43.231
<v Speaker 1>Theater majors.</v>

4389
02:02:43.231 --> 02:02:43.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4390
02:02:43.341 --> 02:02:44.390
<v Speaker 1>he was a theater major,</v>

4391
02:02:44.970 --> 02:02:45.771
<v Speaker 1>a smart guy.</v>

4392
02:02:45.771 --> 02:02:47.000
<v Speaker 1>He's very good at it.</v>

4393
02:02:47.150 --> 02:02:47.871
<v Speaker 1>But do it for the two.</v>

4394
02:02:47.871 --> 02:02:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Your fucking,</v>

4395
02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:49.460
<v Speaker 1>he likes fighting.</v>

4396
02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Of course he likes it.</v>

4397
02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.940
<v Speaker 1>He's finding James Vick next,</v>

4398
02:02:52.941 --> 02:02:53.421
<v Speaker 1>which is a thing.</v>

4399
02:02:53.421 --> 02:02:54.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good fight.</v>

4400
02:02:54.291 --> 02:02:54.951
<v Speaker 1>James Vick is,</v>

4401
02:02:54.951 --> 02:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking big guy.</v>

4402
02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:57.251
<v Speaker 1>His last one,</v>

4403
02:02:57.251 --> 02:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>like his first big step up for James Vick lost that.</v>

4404
02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:02.060
<v Speaker 1>But James Vick and Paul Felder's a great fight.</v>

4405
02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:04.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a great fight to crazy fight.</v>

4406
02:03:04.341 --> 02:03:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4407
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it pretty crazy fight.</v>

4408
02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4409
02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean the big fight for James Vick,</v>

4410
02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:13.040
<v Speaker 1>but well it's a big fight for both guys fell this just coming off a loss and the</v>

4411
02:03:13.041 --> 02:03:15.380
<v Speaker 1>loss was like a last minute fight.</v>

4412
02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4413
02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:16.911
<v Speaker 1>I that's right.</v>

4414
02:03:16.911 --> 02:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I think you only got like a couple of weeks they switched it on.</v>

4415
02:03:19.330 --> 02:03:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4416
02:03:19.650 --> 02:03:20.271
<v Speaker 1>Less than that.</v>

4417
02:03:20.271 --> 02:03:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4418
02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:24.710
<v Speaker 1>And he moved up to one 70 for that fight instead of fighting at one 55 which,</v>

4419
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:25.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4420
02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:25.901
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4421
02:03:25.901 --> 02:03:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're going to fight a weight class above yours and you know,</v>

4422
02:03:29.751 --> 02:03:31.970
<v Speaker 1>you feel like it's the time and you made the decision,</v>

4423
02:03:32.210 --> 02:03:32.781
<v Speaker 1>that's great,</v>

4424
02:03:32.781 --> 02:03:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you should do that.</v>

4425
02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:35.270
<v Speaker 1>But if you're not doing that,</v>

4426
02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:39.950
<v Speaker 1>if you plan to keep fighting at one 55 to take a fight in a larger way,</v>

4427
02:03:39.951 --> 02:03:41.210
<v Speaker 1>class is a big risk.</v>

4428
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:43.160
<v Speaker 1>And it take a fight against apple up.</v>

4429
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4430
02:03:43.461 --> 02:03:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Against a real killer.</v>

4431
02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Like Perry,</v>

4432
02:03:45.351 --> 02:03:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it's super dangerous.</v>

4433
02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.070
<v Speaker 1>He's dangerous because he hits like a seven year.</v>

4434
02:03:49.071 --> 02:03:51.260
<v Speaker 1>There's guys who were to take hates it,</v>

4435
02:03:51.261 --> 02:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't hit like a fucking middleweight.</v>

4436
02:03:53.090 --> 02:03:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Even.</v>

4437
02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>He hits fucking hard to real problems and he takes it and you got to remember</v>

4438
02:03:59.210 --> 02:04:01.460
<v Speaker 1>cowboy has fought everybody.</v>

4439
02:04:01.461 --> 02:04:01.881
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

4440
02:04:01.881 --> 02:04:03.980
<v Speaker 1>He's fought so many fucking people,</v>

4441
02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:04.911
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

4442
02:04:04.911 --> 02:04:06.270
<v Speaker 1>And this is named MMA fighter.</v>

4443
02:04:06.300 --> 02:04:07.133
<v Speaker 1>He's probably fine,</v>

4444
02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:07.700
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4445
02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Ever met.</v>

4446
02:04:08.210 --> 02:04:10.220
<v Speaker 1>And this is deep into his career.</v>

4447
02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:10.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4448
02:04:10.671 --> 02:04:11.750
<v Speaker 1>this is a real,</v>

4449
02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:13.880
<v Speaker 1>like Darren till is a young,</v>

4450
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:17.020
<v Speaker 1>enormous welterweight and cowboy lost to him.</v>

4451
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.571
<v Speaker 1>It's like damn,</v>

4452
02:04:17.571 --> 02:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>how good is Darren till Kelby lost Edwards too.</v>

4453
02:04:19.781 --> 02:04:22.940
<v Speaker 1>But if k to Leon Leon Edwards,</v>

4454
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:23.630
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

4455
02:04:23.630 --> 02:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>He lost a decision decision.</v>

4456
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:25.421
<v Speaker 1>That was the one we,</v>

4457
02:04:25.421 --> 02:04:26.630
<v Speaker 1>he was sick as fuck though.</v>

4458
02:04:26.631 --> 02:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>And he almost pulled out of the fight.</v>

4459
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Still true.</v>

4460
02:04:29.150 --> 02:04:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

4461
02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:30.441
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>

4462
02:04:30.441 --> 02:04:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

4463
02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:31.671
<v Speaker 1>no one's saying,</v>

4464
02:04:31.671 --> 02:04:33.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that this isn't a monster.</v>

4465
02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:34.640
<v Speaker 1>No one's saying cowboys,</v>

4466
02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:37.290
<v Speaker 1>a 20 year old guy who's at the beginning of his career,</v>

4467
02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>he's been fighting a long time.</v>

4468
02:04:38.971 --> 02:04:42.480
<v Speaker 1>But I think you get a look at a person from their last fight.</v>

4469
02:04:42.481 --> 02:04:42.780
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

4470
02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:43.441
<v Speaker 1>ah man,</v>

4471
02:04:43.441 --> 02:04:44.191
<v Speaker 1>he slept and like,</v>

4472
02:04:44.191 --> 02:04:45.024
<v Speaker 1>are you sure?</v>

4473
02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:45.661
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>

4474
02:04:45.661 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Because he,</v>

4475
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:50.820
<v Speaker 1>he might just be unmotivated or a lack having a lack of discipline for this camp</v>

4476
02:04:50.821 --> 02:04:52.650
<v Speaker 1>or just find a really fucking good guy.</v>

4477
02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>And Edward at 10 Darren till yes.</v>

4478
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:55.201
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>

4479
02:04:55.201 --> 02:04:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Matchups farm until his win was against the other cowboy,</v>

4480
02:04:58.570 --> 02:04:59.450
<v Speaker 1>the Brazilian Calloway,</v>

4481
02:04:59.490 --> 02:04:59.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4482
02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4483
02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:02.400
<v Speaker 1>And Darrin tells such if he asks him and Daryl,</v>

4484
02:05:02.401 --> 02:05:02.671
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

4485
02:05:02.671 --> 02:05:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Yancey materials,</v>

4486
02:05:03.450 --> 02:05:06.510
<v Speaker 1>you can't keep him off you if you can't clip him and keep you up to you.</v>

4487
02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:07.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4488
02:05:07.410 --> 02:05:08.243
<v Speaker 1>He's a nightmare.</v>

4489
02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Fat Best One of the best in the world.</v>

4490
02:05:10.290 --> 02:05:14.910
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the things that highlights how underrated Woodley strikings</v>

4491
02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:17.730
<v Speaker 1>become because Woodley knocked down both till,</v>

4492
02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:20.880
<v Speaker 1>who started to be one of the best strikers in the division and long and awkward</v>

4493
02:05:20.930 --> 02:05:23.330
<v Speaker 1>and Wonderboy knocked dumb luck,</v>

4494
02:05:23.331 --> 02:05:24.164
<v Speaker 1>choked him out,</v>

4495
02:05:24.670 --> 02:05:29.190
<v Speaker 1>but not down Wonderboy in bolts of their fights and had them all fucked up.</v>

4496
02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Whereas neither one of those guys hurt him.</v>

4497
02:05:31.230 --> 02:05:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Neither one of those guys hit him.</v>

4498
02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:34.950
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of crazy impressive too.</v>

4499
02:05:34.951 --> 02:05:36.570
<v Speaker 1>And doing rap albums and shit,</v>

4500
02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hurt.</v>

4501
02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Here's rap.</v>

4502
02:05:38.090 --> 02:05:38.570
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

4503
02:05:38.570 --> 02:05:39.140
<v Speaker 1>was it good?</v>

4504
02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:39.930

02:05:41.041 --> 02:05:41.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4512
02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:44.633
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4513
02:05:44.650 --> 02:05:45.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad.</v>

4514
02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:46.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4515
02:05:46.530 --> 02:05:50.970
<v Speaker 1>he got upset that we were talking about cm punk and I was saying that,</v>

4516
02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:51.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4517
02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:52.433
<v Speaker 1>that cm,</v>

4518
02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:52.890
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4519
02:05:52.890 --> 02:05:54.360
<v Speaker 1>that what does that Logan,</v>

4520
02:05:54.361 --> 02:05:54.991
<v Speaker 1>Paul Logan,</v>

4521
02:05:54.991 --> 02:05:55.824
<v Speaker 1>Paul character,</v>

4522
02:05:55.860 --> 02:05:56.693
<v Speaker 1>the guy.</v>

4523
02:05:57.420 --> 02:05:58.380
<v Speaker 1>You're right about that.</v>

4524
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:59.221
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you said?</v>

4525
02:05:59.221 --> 02:05:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4526
02:05:59.730 --> 02:06:00.563
<v Speaker 1>I said</v>

4527
02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:02.280
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

4528
02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Because Logan Paul wrestling high school cm punk did not also,</v>

4529
02:06:05.911 --> 02:06:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at his boxing match.</v>

4530
02:06:07.441 --> 02:06:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I was looking the way chains punches together.</v>

4531
02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:09.810
<v Speaker 1>He can,</v>

4532
02:06:09.810 --> 02:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>he's athletic.</v>

4533
02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:10.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4534
02:06:10.841 --> 02:06:11.371
<v Speaker 1>he could punch.</v>

4535
02:06:11.371 --> 02:06:12.510
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in allow cm punk,</v>

4536
02:06:12.511 --> 02:06:13.530
<v Speaker 1>the fight in the UFC,</v>

4537
02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:14.670
<v Speaker 1>that was on my own.</v>

4538
02:06:14.670 --> 02:06:17.370
<v Speaker 1>That was all my point was my point wasn't the cm punk is bad.</v>

4539
02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:20.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think that cm punk is actually a very brave guy.</v>

4540
02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>

4541
02:06:21.210 --> 02:06:22.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a powerful thing to do,</v>

4542
02:06:22.501 --> 02:06:23.151
<v Speaker 1>to take a chance.</v>

4543
02:06:23.151 --> 02:06:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I can publicly,</v>

4544
02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:25.293
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4545
02:06:25.530 --> 02:06:26.363
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>

4546
02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:30.150
<v Speaker 1>But I mean anyone's brain talking shit about him,</v>

4547
02:06:30.151 --> 02:06:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but I'm most certainly not.</v>

4548
02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:31.351
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4549
02:06:31.351 --> 02:06:32.280
<v Speaker 1>he's a teammate.</v>

4550
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:33.000
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

4551
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:33.601
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he has a little brother too.</v>

4574
02:06:59.781 --> 02:07:01.020
<v Speaker 1>He's calling out like Dell,</v>

4575
02:07:01.050 --> 02:07:01.801
<v Speaker 1>Dylan Dannis,</v>

4576
02:07:01.801 --> 02:07:02.580

4579
02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:04.141
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

4580
02:07:04.141 --> 02:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes out when people go,</v>

4581
02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:06.040
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

4582
02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:06.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4583
02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Dylan's a worldclass just the guy goes,</v>

4584
02:07:07.950 --> 02:07:08.111

02:07:08.241 --> 02:07:08.311
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4588
02:07:08.311 --> 02:07:09.144
<v Speaker 1>not Jujitsu.</v>

4589
02:07:09.170 --> 02:07:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Just box it.</v>

4590
02:07:10.210 --> 02:07:11.020
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

4591
02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4592
02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:12.660
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't know.</v>

4593
02:07:12.690 --> 02:07:13.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

4594
02:07:13.081 --> 02:07:13.950
<v Speaker 1>It's about to go down,</v>

4595
02:07:13.951 --> 02:07:14.220
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

4596
02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Mike Perry is in the cage and cowboys walking that boy,</v>

4597
02:07:16.791 --> 02:07:19.320
<v Speaker 1>you always look so nervous when he fights in Denver.</v>

4598
02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:21.330
<v Speaker 1>He was 86 kilograms flat,</v>

4599
02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.193
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>

4600
02:07:22.770 --> 02:07:24.180
<v Speaker 1>86 kilograms.</v>

4601
02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:25.223
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

4602
02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Is that a hundred that's 160 something,</v>

4603
02:07:26.971 --> 02:07:27.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4604
02:07:27.690 --> 02:07:28.523
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4605
02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I a twice one 89.5 so he's way bigger than cm punk will see you playing cause</v>

4606
02:07:34.531 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 1>pilot 70 cut weight.</v>

4607
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Those guys didn't cut.</v>

4608
02:07:37.580 --> 02:07:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Well he might be cm park might be in the one eight nine range.</v>

4609
02:07:41.170 --> 02:07:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Logan Paul definitely is.</v>

4610
02:07:42.430 --> 02:07:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Why the ground?</v>

4611
02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Paul is a fighter and 70 yeah.</v>

4612
02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:46.780
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong saying that.</v>

4613
02:07:46.810 --> 02:07:50.110
<v Speaker 1>He probably weighs like probably one 80 or something because Santa one seven if</v>

4614
02:07:50.111 --> 02:07:50.740
<v Speaker 1>you had a guest,</v>

4615
02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:51.890
<v Speaker 1>cm punk Adh.</v>

4616
02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.580
<v Speaker 1>What is 91 92 I believe that.</v>

4617
02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:56.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's WWE.</v>

4618
02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:57.340
<v Speaker 1>It's 20 pounds.</v>

4619
02:07:57.710 --> 02:07:58.421
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

4620
02:07:58.421 --> 02:08:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Probably actually now it's probably UFC information.</v>

4621
02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:01.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4622
02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:02.920
<v Speaker 1>What are your fights out?</v>

4623
02:08:02.921 --> 02:08:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4624
02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:04.150
<v Speaker 1>does he competes?</v>

4625
02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:07.210
<v Speaker 1>He might be cutting weight from one 90 which is not outrageous.</v>

4626
02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:09.010
<v Speaker 1>So Logan Paul's way younger,</v>

4627
02:08:09.130 --> 02:08:10.300
<v Speaker 1>little lot younger.</v>

4628
02:08:10.301 --> 02:08:11.134
<v Speaker 1>Vibrant.</v>

4629
02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:11.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4630
02:08:11.681 --> 02:08:12.514
<v Speaker 1>it's more,</v>

4631
02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:13.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4632
02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:18.150
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing if it was Melvin Manhoef fit 36 you know a guy.</v>

4633
02:08:18.190 --> 02:08:18.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4634
02:08:18.401 --> 02:08:19.150
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

4635
02:08:19.150 --> 02:08:22.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not just being 36 it's learning later in life.</v>

4636
02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:27.610
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a thing about striking if you're not an explosive person and</v>

4637
02:08:27.611 --> 02:08:29.260
<v Speaker 1>you learned later in life,</v>

4638
02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:29.770
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4639
02:08:29.770 --> 02:08:31.480
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's really difficult.</v>

4640
02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:35.020
<v Speaker 1>The people that seem to pick it up or people had a little bit of it when they</v>

4641
02:08:35.021 --> 02:08:35.854
<v Speaker 1>were younger,</v>

4642
02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:36.970
<v Speaker 1>like a little bit of karate,</v>

4643
02:08:36.971 --> 02:08:37.840
<v Speaker 1>little bit of boxing,</v>

4644
02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:41.230
<v Speaker 1>and they kind of kept the understanding of their head and then as they retire</v>

4645
02:08:41.231 --> 02:08:42.040
<v Speaker 1>from other sports,</v>

4646
02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:43.120
<v Speaker 1>then they start to do it.</v>

4647
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Was that the case with you?</v>

4648
02:08:44.530 --> 02:08:45.180
<v Speaker 1>A little bit?</v>

4649
02:08:45.180 --> 02:08:45.611
<v Speaker 1>A little bit.</v>

4650
02:08:45.611 --> 02:08:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

4651
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:50.320
<v Speaker 1>were you doing any amateur boxing matches or anything like that while you were</v>

4652
02:08:50.321 --> 02:08:52.210
<v Speaker 1>doing football before you're doing football?</v>

4653
02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I was doing some Jujitsu.</v>

4654
02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:54.363
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

4655
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:56.530
<v Speaker 1>When did you like get heavily into striking?</v>

4656
02:08:58.270 --> 02:08:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

4657
02:09:00.010 --> 02:09:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I would do it to stay in shape during the football season was before the</v>

4658
02:09:03.521 --> 02:09:04.810
<v Speaker 1>ultimate final for the ultimate.</v>

4659
02:09:04.811 --> 02:09:05.440
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>

4660
02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:06.730
<v Speaker 1>how much striking had you done?</v>

4661
02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:08.470
<v Speaker 1>A just a golden gloves,</v>

4662
02:09:08.471 --> 02:09:09.790
<v Speaker 1>but I had six months of training.</v>

4663
02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:10.601
<v Speaker 1>Six months.</v>

4664
02:09:10.601 --> 02:09:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Six months of bucks and yeah,</v>

4665
02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:14.860

4686
02:09:36.670 --> 02:09:37.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>cow.</v>

4689

4693
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:48.850

02:10:00.821 --> 02:10:01.481
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at it.</v>

4704
02:10:01.481 --> 02:10:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a little crazy.</v>

4705
02:10:03.971 --> 02:10:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Shaved on the sides.</v>

4706

4713
02:10:14.681 --> 02:10:16.840
<v Speaker 1>You better look savage to match the savage.</v>

4714
02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

4715

4719
02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm a terrible bite to make me nervous.</v>

02:10:25.091 --> 02:10:25.810
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

4723
02:10:25.810 --> 02:10:28.300
<v Speaker 1>You think cowboy flips off a Winkeljohn three wins.</v>

4724
02:10:28.570 --> 02:10:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he does.</v>

4725
02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's say hey had kicked kv.</v>

4726
02:10:32.050 --> 02:10:32.741
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there might be.</v>

4727
02:10:32.741 --> 02:10:34.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's cowboy dude or something.</v>

4728
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Since I've known cowboys hate Winkeljohn and that'd be something to it.</v>

4729
02:10:37.911 --> 02:10:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what happens here.</v>

4730
02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:39.801
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

4731
02:10:39.801 --> 02:10:40.760
<v Speaker 1>He looks disciplined.</v>

4732
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Look at Mike Perez striking hands up.</v>

4733
02:10:43.221 --> 02:10:44.780
<v Speaker 1>High light on the fool.</v>

4734
02:10:44.781 --> 02:10:45.141

<v Speaker 1>He trying to knock them out big right hand you the cowboys.</v>

4736
02:10:49.371 --> 02:10:50.181
<v Speaker 1>A slow starter.</v>

4737
02:10:50.181 --> 02:10:50.760
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

4738
02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:52.100
<v Speaker 1>if I'm Mike Paris coach,</v>

4739
02:10:52.101 --> 02:10:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I know Greg to the elbow off the brake cowboy.</v>

4740
02:10:55.031 --> 02:10:56.360
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking good in the clinch Dell.</v>

4741
02:10:57.860 --> 02:10:58.401
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

4742
02:10:58.401 --> 02:10:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Let's see here.</v>

4743
02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing about cowboy,</v>

4744
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:01.880
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly good wrestling.</v>

4745
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:02.770
<v Speaker 1>He fucks people up.</v>

4746
02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:03.321
<v Speaker 1>The Dude,</v>

4747
02:11:03.321 --> 02:11:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I've seen him fucking amazing forgetful and they forget because he's got picked</v>

4748
02:11:06.911 --> 02:11:07.670
<v Speaker 1>that he does here.</v>

4749
02:11:07.670 --> 02:11:08.481
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

4750
02:11:08.481 --> 02:11:10.940
<v Speaker 1>He lifts his left arm and me picks dudes all the time.</v>

4751
02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:11.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4752
02:11:11.691 --> 02:11:12.620
<v Speaker 1>he also like,</v>

4753
02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:13.431
<v Speaker 1>he's been,</v>

4754
02:11:13.431 --> 02:11:14.660
<v Speaker 1>that does a nice knee to the body.</v>

4755
02:11:14.661 --> 02:11:15.494
<v Speaker 1>That shit was sharp.</v>

4756
02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll cowboy sit trade with you all day.</v>

4757
02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:18.831
<v Speaker 1>But Paris,</v>

4758
02:11:18.831 --> 02:11:20.090
<v Speaker 1>and he was very good as well though.</v>

4759
02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:21.553
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

4760
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:24.740
<v Speaker 1>see the thing about cowboy is he's like a,</v>

4761
02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:26.900
<v Speaker 1>he seems like a fun guy,</v>

4762
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:27.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4763
02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:31.700
<v Speaker 1>He's always partying in and driving around in his jet skiing,</v>

4764
02:11:31.730 --> 02:11:34.370
<v Speaker 1>getting wild and jumped on a plane and all that stuff.</v>

4765
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:35.540
<v Speaker 1>So people think,</v>

4766
02:11:35.541 --> 02:11:35.691
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4767
02:11:35.691 --> 02:11:36.650
<v Speaker 1>this guy is just wild.</v>

4768
02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:39.380
<v Speaker 1>He's also a seriously skilled fighter.</v>

4769
02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:40.200
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

4770
02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:41.910
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that is a little bit of a smokescreen.</v>

4771
02:11:41.911 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

4772
02:11:42.230 --> 02:11:44.390
<v Speaker 1>he's an absolutely an adrenaline junkie,</v>

4773
02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:46.130
<v Speaker 1>but he's a very skilled fighter.</v>

4774
02:11:46.131 --> 02:11:47.900
<v Speaker 1>It looks unprofessional inside leg kick.</v>

4775
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Just lit up that enzyme.</v>

4776
02:11:49.410 --> 02:11:50.590
<v Speaker 1>And you do it from all angles.</v>

4777
02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4778
02:11:51.050 --> 02:11:51.590
<v Speaker 1>And he'll look.</v>

4779
02:11:51.590 --> 02:11:51.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4780
02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Has he had some rough fights?</v>

4781
02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4782
02:11:53.690 --> 02:11:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Against the best in the world though.</v>

4783
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:58.970
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get that this is a crazy ass fucking sport he's doing.</v>

4784
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.040
<v Speaker 1>It also has over 45 exactly.</v>

4785
02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:03.860
<v Speaker 1>And you're throwing bones at each other at a high velocity.</v>

4786
02:12:03.861 --> 02:12:05.240
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get some knockouts.</v>

4787
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:06.170
<v Speaker 1>You're going to give some,</v>

4788
02:12:06.171 --> 02:12:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get some,</v>

4789
02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:08.480
<v Speaker 1>it's just part of the program.</v>

4790
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:12.320
<v Speaker 1>But cowboy look at that good head room with their cowboys still here.</v>

4791
02:12:12.410 --> 02:12:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel African?</v>

4792
02:12:13.730 --> 02:12:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Because callow Tim,</v>

4793
02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:19.820
<v Speaker 1>he's biting his mouthpiece and just going forward cause cowboys fucking tall.</v>

4794
02:12:19.821 --> 02:12:21.590
<v Speaker 1>I thought Perry was a lot shorter compared.</v>

4795
02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:23.090
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking bitch.</v>

4796
02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I think he's six feet tall.</v>

4797
02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Jesus tank too,</v>

4798
02:12:25.911 --> 02:12:26.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4799
02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:27.013
<v Speaker 1>He's a tank.</v>

4800
02:12:27.650 --> 02:12:28.880
<v Speaker 1>He's a real thick dude man.</v>

4801
02:12:28.881 --> 02:12:31.280
<v Speaker 1>When you stub his girl in his corner and he lost,</v>

4802
02:12:31.281 --> 02:12:31.491
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

4803
02:12:31.491 --> 02:12:31.791
<v Speaker 1>you don't what?</v>

4804
02:12:31.791 --> 02:12:32.391
<v Speaker 1>Pregnant anymore,</v>

4805
02:12:32.391 --> 02:12:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

4806
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Well you know he was on campus hat off.</v>

4807
02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:38.690
<v Speaker 1>He can't make 55 fuck cal cal cowboy,</v>

4808
02:12:38.691 --> 02:12:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Ken.</v>

4809
02:12:39.230 --> 02:12:39.561
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

4810
02:12:39.561 --> 02:12:41.210
<v Speaker 1>it's stuff on Kelly as he gets older too.</v>

4811
02:12:41.230 --> 02:12:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4812
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:44.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe Perry can make 55 maybe I'm wrong.</v>

4813
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can kill himself and get to like rumble Johnson used to do.</v>

4814
02:12:47.330 --> 02:12:50.440
<v Speaker 1>He looks great at 70 dam that will help her get up,</v>

4815
02:12:50.450 --> 02:12:51.530
<v Speaker 1>get the fucking scared.</v>

4816
02:12:51.531 --> 02:12:51.921
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

4817
02:12:51.921 --> 02:12:54.650
<v Speaker 1>But he's doing it on the outside and Donald's slipping away from it now.</v>

4818
02:12:54.651 --> 02:12:55.580
<v Speaker 1>They sparred a lot,</v>

4819
02:12:55.581 --> 02:12:59.090
<v Speaker 1>a lot before they did a lot of sparring with walking kind of fucked up.</v>

4820
02:12:59.091 --> 02:12:59.191
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4821
02:12:59.191 --> 02:13:02.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like when I filed a hundred Laski we sparked a bunch together.</v>

4822
02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:06.440
<v Speaker 1>So when we fought you're super tender cause you knew what the guy was good at so</v>

4823
02:13:06.441 --> 02:13:08.150
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't throw your normal shit.</v>

4824
02:13:08.410 --> 02:13:09.890
<v Speaker 1>So it makes for a more boring fight.</v>

4825
02:13:09.891 --> 02:13:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes in cowboys side though,</v>

4826
02:13:12.410 --> 02:13:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I think psychologically it probably helps him cause he's already fought this guy</v>

4827
02:13:16.341 --> 02:13:18.980
<v Speaker 1>before and if he did get the better of him been training,</v>

4828
02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:21.110
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean you're dealing with the same Mike Perry.</v>

4829
02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure Mike Perry is way better now.</v>

4830
02:13:23.090 --> 02:13:26.900
<v Speaker 1>But if they did train together and cowboy did get the best of them,</v>

4831
02:13:26.930 --> 02:13:30.080
<v Speaker 1>then that shit's probably on both of their minds right now.</v>

4832
02:13:30.110 --> 02:13:31.380
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way it's not.</v>

4833
02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:34.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's a psychological edge that cowboy would like.</v>

4834
02:13:34.021 --> 02:13:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

4835
02:13:34.290 --> 02:13:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh side can travel is nasty off his past.</v>

4836
02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:41.880
<v Speaker 1>He reminds me a lot of Anthony Pettis off his back where they're so explosive.</v>

4837
02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Even if you know what triangles come in,</v>

4838
02:13:43.401 --> 02:13:44.940
<v Speaker 1>there's fucking the really,</v>

4839
02:13:44.941 --> 02:13:45.810
<v Speaker 1>really sneaky man.</v>

4840
02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:45.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4841
02:13:45.991 --> 02:13:46.501
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

4842
02:13:46.501 --> 02:13:47.910
<v Speaker 1>because I can see those can be tough to do anything.</v>

4843
02:13:47.911 --> 02:13:49.680
<v Speaker 1>This is not somewhere he wants to be.</v>

4844
02:13:49.890 --> 02:13:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how he gets out of this stuff is,</v>

4845
02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:55.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it will take this all day.</v>

4846
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4847
02:13:56.490 --> 02:13:57.720
<v Speaker 1>that was beautiful.</v>

4848
02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4849
02:13:57.930 --> 02:13:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I encourage the tape.</v>

4850
02:13:58.740 --> 02:13:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4851
02:13:59.761 --> 02:14:00.750
<v Speaker 1>That was beautiful.</v>

4852
02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:01.613
<v Speaker 1>That was beautiful.</v>

4853
02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:03.031
<v Speaker 1>Smash him.</v>

4854
02:14:03.031 --> 02:14:03.900
<v Speaker 1>He can go to mount though.</v>

4855
02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:07.200
<v Speaker 1>But this is the thing that Mike Perry was saying that he would do that to him in</v>

4856
02:14:07.201 --> 02:14:09.510
<v Speaker 1>the gym and cowboys doing it to him right now.</v>

4857
02:14:09.710 --> 02:14:11.460

<v Speaker 2>look at where his arm is though is it's almost like he's doing it.</v>

5005

5008
02:17:09.701 --> 02:17:11.940
<v Speaker 2>It looked like he wasn't getting it like this straightened out my grade.</v>

5009
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.771
<v Speaker 2>Like to the side.</v>

5010
02:17:12.771 --> 02:17:14.140
<v Speaker 2>It looked like it was almost like this.</v>

5011
02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:15.490
<v Speaker 2>That will rip your shit apart,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this nothing I liked Mike Perry has nothing to do with like I do.</v>

5017
02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I just know taboos career,</v>

5018
02:17:24.731 --> 02:17:25.564
<v Speaker 2>what he's been through.</v>

5019
02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:26.770
<v Speaker 2>He had a baby,</v>

5020
02:17:26.890 --> 02:17:28.540
<v Speaker 2>he gets kid kicked out of his gym,</v>

5021
02:17:28.541 --> 02:17:29.590
<v Speaker 2>his back's against the wall,</v>

5022

<v Speaker 2>he loses this one.</v>

5023
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's telling him to retire like it's fucking Donald Cerrone,</v>

5024
02:17:33.911 --> 02:17:34.270
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>God damn good too.</v>

5027
02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:38.860
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that he came to them and said,</v>

5028
02:17:38.890 --> 02:17:39.560
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

5029
02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:41.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's fair that you guys train this guy,</v>

5030
02:17:42.010 --> 02:17:42.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5031
02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:43.480
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't make any sense.</v>

5032
02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:44.000
<v Speaker 2>We've been,</v>

5033
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.160
<v Speaker 2>we've been together forever.</v>

5034
02:17:45.430 --> 02:17:46.150
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

5035
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.541
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5036

5037
02:17:48.371 --> 02:17:49.510
<v Speaker 2>And then they come back after the meeting.</v>

5038
02:17:49.511 --> 02:17:50.344
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

5039
02:17:50.370 --> 02:17:51.071
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to train him.</v>

5040
02:17:51.071 --> 02:17:52.030
<v Speaker 2>You can't come here anymore.</v>

5041
02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:53.470
<v Speaker 2>So fucked up.</v>

5042
02:17:53.940 --> 02:17:54.280
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

5043
02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:56.460
<v Speaker 2>but also would have him win the,</v>

5044
02:17:56.550 --> 02:17:58.450
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing too is,</v>

5045
02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:01.930
<v Speaker 2>you know cowboy Daigo is Greg Jackson and according to next week he goes,</v>

5052
02:18:08.010 --> 02:18:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Seeing tons of people talk about it today.</v>

5053
02:18:09.311 --> 02:18:09.491
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:14.120
<v Speaker 2>a video game right now.</v>

5059
02:18:14.130 --> 02:18:14.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it hasn't.</v>

5060
02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:15.521
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

5061
02:18:15.521 --> 02:18:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

5062
02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:17.133
<v Speaker 2>Am I crazy?</v>

5063
02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of Wolfenstein definitely could have been a video game.</v>

5064
02:18:20.530 --> 02:18:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>

5065
02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:21.840
<v Speaker 2>it might be a bit of good.</v>

5066
02:18:21.850 --> 02:18:22.683
<v Speaker 2>I'm still,</v>

5067
02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:23.621
<v Speaker 2>if it's not,</v>

5068
02:18:23.621 --> 02:18:24.281
<v Speaker 2>they fucked up.</v>

5069
02:18:24.281 --> 02:18:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I remember that time.</v>

5070
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Make it a video game with the release.</v>

5071
02:18:27.010 --> 02:18:29.020
<v Speaker 2>I know people would play the shit out of that.</v>

5072
02:18:29.710 --> 02:18:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I was balls deep in Wolfenstein.</v>

5073
02:18:31.121 --> 02:18:31.521
<v Speaker 2>As a kid,</v>

5074
02:18:31.521 --> 02:18:34.390
<v Speaker 2>imagine what has to come into place to make a video game.</v>

5075
02:18:34.630 --> 02:18:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Like imagine if you have a movie and you go,</v>

5076
02:18:36.491 --> 02:18:36.701
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5077
02:18:36.701 --> 02:18:38.380
<v Speaker 2>we've got to make a video game to get this movie.</v>

5078
02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Like to come out with it.</v>

5079
02:18:39.791 --> 02:18:40.930
<v Speaker 2>It'd be the perfect video game.</v>

5080
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.680
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

5081
02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Overlord film review.</v>

5082
02:18:42.731 --> 02:18:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Great video game movie that's not based on a video game.</v>

5083
02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:49.840
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>

5084
02:18:51.010 --> 02:18:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I figured it was the video game.</v>

5085
02:18:52.331 --> 02:18:53.200
<v Speaker 2>The name overlord.</v>

5086
02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:57.130
<v Speaker 2>The poster looks like two fucking Wolfenstein so ridiculously fun.</v>

5087
02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:57.700
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>

5088
02:18:57.700 --> 02:18:58.660
<v Speaker 2>That's so funny.</v>

5089
02:18:58.750 --> 02:18:59.351
<v Speaker 2>That's so funny.</v>

5090
02:18:59.351 --> 02:19:00.340
<v Speaker 2>It hurts my feelings.</v>

5091
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5092
02:19:01.991 --> 02:19:02.171
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5093
02:19:02.171 --> 02:19:02.950
<v Speaker 2>That's what it seemed like.</v>

5094
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:03.970
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like a video game.</v>

5095
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:05.350
<v Speaker 2>A hundred percent dude,</v>

5096
02:19:05.351 --> 02:19:06.490
<v Speaker 2>look at cowboy.</v>

5098
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:09.460
<v Speaker 2>How can you not be your son's?</v>

5099
02:19:09.461 --> 02:19:12.490
<v Speaker 2>They're chewing on monster can shout out the monster.</v>

5100
02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Don't let the sun actually get that monster system.</v>

5101
02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5102
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Now that would not be a match and that he gets a hold of that and that's open</v>

5171
02:20:37.370 --> 02:20:38.410
<v Speaker 2>pasture board,</v>

5172
02:20:38.450 --> 02:20:39.170
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5173
02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:40.050
<v Speaker 2>He has so much shit.</v>

5174
02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:44.300
<v Speaker 2>You don't shut a movies healing up and he's thinking about it.</v>

5175
02:20:44.350 --> 02:20:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5176
02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:45.191
<v Speaker 2>that's about it.</v>

5177
02:20:45.191 --> 02:20:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5178
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:46.670
<v Speaker 2>How about the ditch?</v>

5179
02:20:46.671 --> 02:20:47.480
<v Speaker 2>The fly?</v>

5180
02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:49.100
<v Speaker 2>This is super impressive man.</v>

5181
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:51.920
<v Speaker 2>But cowboy did super impressive that he never let it go.</v>

5182
02:20:52.060 --> 02:20:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Like that was tight as shit.</v>

5183
02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Dude slamming it's old school,</v>

5184
02:20:55.031 --> 02:20:55.360
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

5185
02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5186
02:20:55.540 --> 02:20:58.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's the way in the transitions are sure to stay on it.</v>

5187
02:20:58.730 --> 02:20:58.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5188
02:20:58.941 --> 02:21:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Because even when Mike was doing the right thing by passing over the top,</v>

5189
02:21:02.271 --> 02:21:03.530
<v Speaker 2>it looked like he was almost out.</v>

5190
02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:07.250
<v Speaker 2>But the risk control that he had the cowboy hat and it keeping it in the</v>

5191
02:21:07.251 --> 02:21:08.450
<v Speaker 2>position where he wanted it,</v>

5192
02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:09.873
<v Speaker 2>the squeeze.</v>

5193
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:10.783
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a,</v>

5194
02:21:10.820 --> 02:21:11.571
<v Speaker 2>like again,</v>

5195
02:21:11.571 --> 02:21:14.520
<v Speaker 2>him and Anthony Pettis are guys when it goes to the ground because people think</v>

5196
02:21:14.521 --> 02:21:15.980
<v Speaker 2>of a miss knockout artist,</v>

5197
02:21:15.981 --> 02:21:17.350
<v Speaker 2>which they are and the great standing.</v>

5198
02:21:17.380 --> 02:21:21.320
<v Speaker 2>But Anthony Pettis and him on the ground are fucking tricky man from their back.</v>

5199
02:21:21.890 --> 02:21:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Most people aren't from their back,</v>

5200
02:21:23.031 --> 02:21:24.980
<v Speaker 2>but Petterson him from their back is nasty.</v>

5201
02:21:24.981 --> 02:21:25.520
<v Speaker 2>They both,</v>

5202
02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:27.620
<v Speaker 2>they both dive on shit real quick too.</v>

5203
02:21:27.780 --> 02:21:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Explosive Man.</v>

5204
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:29.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5205
02:21:29.601 --> 02:21:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Well they basic stuff,</v>

5206
02:21:30.531 --> 02:21:31.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's explosive.</v>

5207
02:21:31.490 --> 02:21:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Cowboys started off with Moy.</v>

5208
02:21:33.301 --> 02:21:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Tai.</v>

5209
02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:34.131
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

5210
02:21:34.131 --> 02:21:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he had a tap like you were saying.</v>

5226
02:21:50.770 --> 02:21:53.750
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough loss for Mike Perry because you want to see where he's at.</v>

5227
02:21:53.751 --> 02:21:53.991
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

02:21:54.250 --> 02:21:55.400
<v Speaker 2>the guys that he's beat,</v>

5230
02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:56.870
<v Speaker 2>you do see where he's at though?</v>

5231
02:21:56.900 --> 02:21:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Donald's a step ahead of him.</v>

5232
02:21:58.400 --> 02:21:59.210
<v Speaker 2>At least.</v>

5233
02:21:59.210 --> 02:22:00.043
<v Speaker 2>At least a step.</v>

5234
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:01.063
<v Speaker 2>Maybe more.</v>

5235
02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5236
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:02.450
<v Speaker 2>You know Mike,</v>

5237
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:06.230
<v Speaker 2>but Mike Perry looked better than he's ever looked before and he's just fighting</v>

5238
02:22:06.231 --> 02:22:08.060
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was the best guys ever fought before.</v>

5239
02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:08.541
<v Speaker 2>And when he,</v>

5240
02:22:08.541 --> 02:22:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Mike Perry moves in,</v>

5241
02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:11.330
<v Speaker 2>he moves in with his hands up high.</v>

5242
02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:13.910
<v Speaker 2>His Chin's talk his techniques on point.</v>

5243
02:22:13.930 --> 02:22:14.180
<v Speaker 2>He look,</v>

5244
02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:15.080
<v Speaker 2>he's not done.</v>

5245
02:22:15.350 --> 02:22:16.970
<v Speaker 2>He's not done.</v>

5246
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:18.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't even mean in his career.</v>

5247
02:22:18.290 --> 02:22:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's progress is going to get,</v>

5248
02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:24.350
<v Speaker 2>he just got to Jackson already from a beating.</v>

5249
02:22:24.351 --> 02:22:25.184
<v Speaker 2>Paul Felder.</v>

5250
02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Keeman looked better in a,</v>

5251
02:22:26.650 --> 02:22:28.560
<v Speaker 2>in as a fighter against cowboy.</v>

5252
02:22:28.750 --> 02:22:29.700
<v Speaker 2>So the next one,</v>

5253
02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:30.751
<v Speaker 2>maybe you just don't give them,</v>

5254
02:22:30.751 --> 02:22:31.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5255
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:32.630
<v Speaker 2>the caliber of cowboy.</v>

5256
02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:33.630
<v Speaker 2>He's not there yet.</v>

5257
02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5258
02:22:33.940 --> 02:22:34.711
<v Speaker 2>can you get there though?</v>

5259
02:22:34.711 --> 02:22:35.790

02:22:35.791 --> 02:22:36.151
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5261
02:22:36.151 --> 02:22:36.984
<v Speaker 2>They forget.</v>

5262
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:38.730
<v Speaker 2>They think for some reason he's done,</v>

5263
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:43.080
<v Speaker 2>but just because he got knocked out by Darren till and then lost Leon Roberts.</v>

5264
02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Leon Roberts is a really good fighter.</v>

5265
02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:46.950
<v Speaker 2>And he was a Roberts or Edwards.</v>

5266
02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Did I say Edwards or Robert?</v>

5267
02:22:48.450 --> 02:22:48.991
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5268
02:22:48.991 --> 02:22:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm getting to weed.</v>

5269
02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:50.611
<v Speaker 2>It is Edwards,</v>

5270
02:22:50.611 --> 02:22:51.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5271
02:22:51.330 --> 02:22:51.871
<v Speaker 2>It's Edwards.</v>

5272
02:22:51.871 --> 02:22:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

02:22:52.470 --> 02:22:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Leon Roberts or Edwards had fought cowboy cowboys last fight.</v>

5274
02:22:55.230 --> 02:22:56.063
<v Speaker 2>Edwards.</v>

5275
02:22:56.250 --> 02:22:56.581

02:23:32.860 --> 02:23:34.200
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to get rid of these loads.</v>

5305
02:23:36.730 --> 02:23:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5306
02:23:37.330 --> 02:23:38.041
<v Speaker 2>Less loads.</v>

5307
02:23:38.041 --> 02:23:38.790
<v Speaker 2>December.</v>

5308
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:40.710
<v Speaker 2>I remember hearing about tantric sex.</v>

5309
02:23:41.570 --> 02:23:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Tantric sex makes sex better and oh,</v>

5310
02:23:43.831 --> 02:23:46.290
<v Speaker 2>what is this crazy commercial people to drive it wrapped or though,</v>

5311
02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:47.580
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

5312
02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Forrest Griffin still doing the damn thing,</v>

5313
02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:51.361
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

5314
02:23:51.361 --> 02:23:52.110
<v Speaker 2>How bout uh,</v>

5315
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:52.890
<v Speaker 2>TJ verse.</v>

5316
02:23:52.890 --> 02:23:57.890
<v Speaker 2>So Hutto but at 25 foot doesn't make sense that it's going to be at 25 is really</v>

5317
02:23:58.750 --> 02:24:00.740
<v Speaker 2>going to get rid of the flyweight division there.</v>

5318
02:24:00.750 --> 02:24:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>

5319
02:24:01.410 --> 02:24:02.400
<v Speaker 2>That seems strange.</v>

5320
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Why do it?</v>

5321
02:24:03.180 --> 02:24:03.661
<v Speaker 2>I know why.</v>

5322
02:24:03.661 --> 02:24:04.620
<v Speaker 2>When sue who don't come up,</v>

5323
02:24:04.770 --> 02:24:06.410
<v Speaker 2>because I guess Tj wants to be a double champion.</v>

5324
02:24:06.411 --> 02:24:07.350
<v Speaker 2>That's the last fight.</v>

5325
02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:10.620
<v Speaker 2>But it's a for a belt that's for divisions not around anymore.</v>

5326
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5327
02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:13.920
<v Speaker 2>maybe they decided to do it because the historical implications,</v>

5328
02:24:13.921 --> 02:24:16.590
<v Speaker 2>because if Tj can drop down and beat him,</v>

5329
02:24:16.860 --> 02:24:19.080
<v Speaker 2>he's the last champ champ.</v>

5330
02:24:19.081 --> 02:24:21.090
<v Speaker 2>And he wins the title in two divisions.</v>

5331
02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Unless he wants to go up to 45 you know?</v>

5332
02:24:24.270 --> 02:24:25.830
<v Speaker 2>And then if he does,</v>

5333
02:24:26.190 --> 02:24:29.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe he builds up after a while and goes up to 45 for a few fights,</v>

5334
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.830
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5335
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:32.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5336
02:24:32.161 --> 02:24:32.994
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

5337
02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:33.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5338
02:24:33.541 --> 02:24:34.770
<v Speaker 2>you've got a whole lot for him.</v>

5339
02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5340
02:24:35.310 --> 02:24:35.521
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5341
02:24:35.521 --> 02:24:36.480
<v Speaker 2>there's some good fights for it.</v>

5342
02:24:36.481 --> 02:24:37.890
<v Speaker 2>45 for sure.</v>

5343
02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Not 45 45 seat may a tough one for him.</v>

5344
02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:41.130
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be tough.</v>

5345
02:24:41.130 --> 02:24:42.780
<v Speaker 2>35 there's still some fights.</v>

02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Eat some of the best guys in the world.</v>

5439
02:26:56.531 --> 02:26:57.970
<v Speaker 2>He started them.</v>

5440
02:26:58.030 --> 02:26:58.811
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

5441
02:26:58.811 --> 02:27:00.580
<v Speaker 2>That is such a nasty hook,</v>

5442
02:27:00.581 --> 02:27:01.414
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5443
02:27:01.430 --> 02:27:05.770
<v Speaker 2>It's so perfectly placed under the right arm.</v>

5444
02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Look at that dude.</v>

5445
02:27:06.971 --> 02:27:07.804
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>

5446
02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:08.933
<v Speaker 2>That was my time.</v>

5447
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:10.300
<v Speaker 2>That from the beginning,</v>

5448
02:27:10.930 --> 02:27:11.681
<v Speaker 2>the cows slick.</v>

5449
02:27:11.681 --> 02:27:12.640
<v Speaker 2>This is like this.</v>

5450
02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:14.620
<v Speaker 2>He sees the righthand comment,</v>

5451
02:27:14.621 --> 02:27:19.210
<v Speaker 2>any hooks under it and right on the Chin and there's slides and we're doing</v>

5452
02:27:19.211 --> 02:27:21.700
<v Speaker 2>right by him because they're not throwing them to the wolves right away.</v>

5453
02:27:21.790 --> 02:27:22.110
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

5454
02:27:22.110 --> 02:27:22.781
<v Speaker 2>if he's in the UFC,</v>

5455
02:27:22.781 --> 02:27:25.630
<v Speaker 2>he'd be fighting fucking top 10 guys right away.</v>

5456
02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Look at that nasty left hook to the fucking liver right there.</v>

5457
02:27:29.350 --> 02:27:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Two guys out to the body now.</v>

5458
02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:32.081
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

5459
02:27:32.081 --> 02:27:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Liver shots are horrific.</v>

5460
02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Nothing really might be worse than him knocked out.</v>

5461
02:27:36.310 --> 02:27:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5462
02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:37.870
<v Speaker 2>There's literally nothing you can do.</v>

5463
02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Kids at tank too and it's super high level wrestler,</v>

5464
02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:43.030
<v Speaker 2>wrestler and boxer.</v>

5465
02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5466
02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Some list.</v>

5467
02:27:44.110 --> 02:27:45.070
<v Speaker 2>As long he's been wrestling,</v>

5468
02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:45.933
<v Speaker 2>he can do it all.</v>

5469
02:27:46.270 --> 02:27:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about this Freddy Roach,</v>

5470
02:27:47.981 --> 02:27:49.540
<v Speaker 2>his corner to MMA fighters,</v>

5471
02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:51.820
<v Speaker 2>him and GSP.</v>

5472
02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.750
<v Speaker 2>So there must be something special about that fucking kid dam.</v>

5473
02:27:55.180 --> 02:27:56.220
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

5474
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5475
02:27:56.531 --> 02:27:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I'd like the story that he lost his first fight.</v>

5476
02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:02.470
<v Speaker 2>I liked that I was hyping up so much on I working with flight,</v>

5477
02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:03.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's a,</v>

5478
02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:06.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a a cold hard reminder.</v>

5479
02:28:06.540 --> 02:28:06.970
<v Speaker 2>We'll ask.</v>

5480
02:28:06.970 --> 02:28:07.411
<v Speaker 2>Got Coke.</v>

5481
02:28:07.411 --> 02:28:07.721
<v Speaker 2>Can I go?</v>

5482
02:28:07.721 --> 02:28:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Why would you give them that big fucking duty goes Brennan.</v>

5483
02:28:10.570 --> 02:28:11.860
<v Speaker 2>We asked guys,</v>

5484
02:28:11.861 --> 02:28:13.900
<v Speaker 2>you would know vets and they would not fight him.</v>

5485
02:28:14.370 --> 02:28:14.681
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

5486
02:28:14.681 --> 02:28:17.950
<v Speaker 2>there's like this mythical fucking or about this kid.</v>

5487
02:28:17.951 --> 02:28:18.820
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to fund this.</v>

5488
02:28:18.821 --> 02:28:20.290
<v Speaker 2>The only guy we get fine.</v>

5489
02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5490
02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Was a terrible match for me.</v>

5491
02:28:22.221 --> 02:28:23.660
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking seven and eight.</v>

5492
02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh big or bigger guy.</v>

5493
02:28:25.281 --> 02:28:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Two weight classes up is a bad idea.</v>

5494
02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:31.590
<v Speaker 2>Not so picos never fought before and fight that mass square garden.</v>

5495
02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:32.480
<v Speaker 2>His first fight,</v>

5496
02:28:32.780 --> 02:28:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know the main car.</v>

5497
02:28:33.711 --> 02:28:34.461
<v Speaker 2>How much bigger than him.</v>

5498
02:28:34.461 --> 02:28:36.470
<v Speaker 2>I just thought the guy just caught him with a shot.</v>

5499
02:28:36.471 --> 02:28:37.304
<v Speaker 2>He's a lot bigger.</v>

5500
02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:39.050
<v Speaker 2>A lot bigger dude.</v>

5501
02:28:39.770 --> 02:28:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Bad idea.</v>

5502
02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:40.790
<v Speaker 2>What did,</v>

5503
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:42.050
<v Speaker 2>what did the guy weigh in at?</v>

5504
02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean they weighed in the same,</v>

5505
02:28:44.541 --> 02:28:44.970
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

5506
02:28:44.970 --> 02:28:45.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5507
02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:45.530
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

5508
02:28:45.530 --> 02:28:47.480
<v Speaker 2>his original weight classes higher up.</v>

5509
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5510
02:28:48.170 --> 02:28:49.130
<v Speaker 2>he's a bigger fighter,</v>

5511
02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:51.360
<v Speaker 2>but they just thought anyone was so special.</v>

5512
02:28:51.361 --> 02:28:52.340
<v Speaker 2>He'd fucking starch him.</v>

5513
02:28:52.530 --> 02:28:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5514
02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:53.431
<v Speaker 2>it didn't.</v>

5515
02:28:53.431 --> 02:28:55.670
<v Speaker 2>The dude have a marginal record.</v>

5516
02:28:55.671 --> 02:28:55.791
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

5517
02:28:55.791 --> 02:28:57.630
<v Speaker 2>he'd only fought them to know once.</v>

5518
02:28:57.640 --> 02:28:59.600
<v Speaker 2>He really pretty sure it's seven to no damn.</v>

5519
02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5520
02:29:00.290 --> 02:29:01.790
<v Speaker 2>he goes o and L.</v>

5521
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:02.151
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5522
02:29:02.151 --> 02:29:02.901
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

5523
02:29:02.901 --> 02:29:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5524
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:04.010
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5525
02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:04.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5526
02:29:04.161 --> 02:29:04.491
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5527
02:29:04.491 --> 02:29:05.510
<v Speaker 2>cause I asked coker,</v>

5528
02:29:05.511 --> 02:29:06.111
<v Speaker 2>you know who's great?</v>

5529
02:29:06.111 --> 02:29:06.351
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

5530
02:29:06.351 --> 02:29:06.990
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck would you,</v>

5531
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I guess Brennan's only guy who would take this fight.</v>

5532
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5533
02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:11.870
<v Speaker 2>I guess he knew something.</v>

5534
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:12.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5535
02:29:12.621 --> 02:29:13.160
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

5536
02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:14.090
<v Speaker 2>What's homeboy's name?</v>

5537
02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Who he lost to?</v>

5538
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:16.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5539
02:29:16.251 --> 02:29:17.084
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>

5540
02:29:17.330 --> 02:29:18.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's crazy.</v>

5541
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.530
<v Speaker 2>What's that,</v>

5542
02:29:18.530 --> 02:29:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Zach?</v>

5543
02:29:19.350 --> 02:29:19.941
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

5544
02:29:19.941 --> 02:29:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

5545
02:29:20.330 --> 02:29:21.041
<v Speaker 2>He's seven to know,</v>

5546
02:29:21.041 --> 02:29:21.874
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5547
02:29:21.890 --> 02:29:22.581
<v Speaker 2>It's probably eight.</v>

5548
02:29:22.581 --> 02:29:22.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5549
02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:23.693
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5550
02:29:25.090 --> 02:29:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Unless he lost one since then.</v>

5551
02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:27.520
<v Speaker 2>That was a while ago.</v>

5552
02:29:30.820 --> 02:29:31.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5553
02:29:31.010 --> 02:29:32.150
<v Speaker 2>he's nine and three now.</v>

5554
02:29:32.180 --> 02:29:32.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5555
02:29:32.331 --> 02:29:33.164
<v Speaker 2>he's lost.</v>

5556
02:29:33.810 --> 02:29:34.643
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5557
02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Pull up the map the thing so we could see it.</v>

5558
02:29:37.901 --> 02:29:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Two losses before he fought on Pico.</v>

5559
02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:40.510
<v Speaker 2>So what was his record?</v>

5560
02:29:40.511 --> 02:29:41.344
<v Speaker 2>We fought Pico.</v>

5561
02:29:41.380 --> 02:29:41.471
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5562
02:29:41.471 --> 02:29:41.950
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

5563
02:29:41.950 --> 02:29:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I must have been eight and two.</v>

5564
02:29:43.210 --> 02:29:46.420
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of evidence to the a wad.</v>

5565
02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:48.790
<v Speaker 2>That guy's fucking good.</v>

5566
02:29:48.791 --> 02:29:52.960
<v Speaker 2>But still when he fought Piquillo seven and two so nine fights.</v>

5567
02:29:53.740 --> 02:29:55.320
<v Speaker 2>That's a shitload for guys.</v>

5568
02:29:55.321 --> 02:29:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Zero to get sky was,</v>

5569

5575
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:08.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal.</v>

5576
02:30:08.711 --> 02:30:10.690
<v Speaker 2>And you're young pressure on TV.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I get sad that I wasn't back then hanging out with them.</v>

5626
02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:32.460
<v Speaker 1>They looked like they were just doing steroids.</v>

02:31:32.610 --> 02:31:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Fucking girls.</v>

02:31:35.071 --> 02:31:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Jack wasn't all the bums are one.</v>

5630
02:31:38.071 --> 02:31:39.120
<v Speaker 1>They're just lifting every day.</v>

5631
02:31:39.121 --> 02:31:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking gold.</v>

02:31:42.931 --> 02:31:43.770
<v Speaker 1>that's all he cared about.</v>

5635
02:31:43.771 --> 02:31:48.771
<v Speaker 1>Jackson pages and probably like at a level that nobody had done before.</v>

5636
02:31:48.871 --> 02:31:53.640
<v Speaker 1>The steroids right along and all of a sudden the party got started.</v>

02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Like you look at it free when they're hanging out with,</v>

5639
02:31:57.540 --> 02:31:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's weird.</v>

5640
02:31:58.890 --> 02:32:00.450
<v Speaker 1>If you look at Arnold right there,</v>

5641
02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:01.710
<v Speaker 1>he was Mister Olympia.</v>

5642
02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Obviously jacked as fuck but beautiful.</v>

5643
02:32:05.690 --> 02:32:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere near as he Coleman is.</v>

5644
02:32:09.301 --> 02:32:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Any of the big guys that you see today we're talking about different steroids.</v>

5645
02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:13.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5646
02:32:13.471 --> 02:32:13.910
<v Speaker 1>it's nice.</v>

5647
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:18.910
<v Speaker 1>See h came along and steroids and it's not just that it's they just want to</v>

5648
02:32:19.261 --> 02:32:20.790
<v Speaker 1>continue to get bigger,</v>

5649
02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:25.620
<v Speaker 1>like there should really be a time and it's hard to figure out when that time is</v>

5650
02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:27.840
<v Speaker 1>where you really don't want to get any bigger.</v>

5651
02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:32.400
<v Speaker 1>He just want to get more sculpted and more ripped and more dif.</v>

5652
02:32:32.430 --> 02:32:34.020
<v Speaker 1>You want to get more proportionate.</v>

5653
02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Well so that everything looks right,</v>

5654
02:32:35.221 --> 02:32:38.350
<v Speaker 1>whether it's your calves or your like [inaudible] shit.</v>

5655
02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:40.670
<v Speaker 1>That's why the same Ronnie Coleman kind of fucked exam.</v>

5656
02:32:40.970 --> 02:32:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Frank.</v>

5657
02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:41.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5658
02:32:41.581 --> 02:32:44.730
<v Speaker 1>They used to love Frank Zane even though he was smaller than those guys.</v>

5659
02:32:44.740 --> 02:32:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Wheeler.</v>

5660
02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5661
02:32:45.820 --> 02:32:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable symmetry.</v>

5662
02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:49.020
<v Speaker 1>They said Ronnie Coleman came along and was like,</v>

5663
02:32:49.021 --> 02:32:49.171
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5664
02:32:49.171 --> 02:32:53.700
<v Speaker 1>cool story and just was like cash and they said he's just fucked everything up</v>

5665
02:32:53.701 --> 02:32:54.700
<v Speaker 1>because he's so massive.</v>

5666
02:32:54.810 --> 02:32:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Even before him,</v>

5667
02:32:56.460 --> 02:32:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Dorian Yates,</v>

5668
02:32:57.780 --> 02:33:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Dorian Yates was a Dji aunt.</v>

5669
02:33:00.430 --> 02:33:02.640
<v Speaker 1>The mother fucker was hugely tall.</v>

5670
02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:03.960
<v Speaker 1>No shorter.</v>

5671
02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:04.291
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

5672
02:33:04.291 --> 02:33:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Ronnie was tall.</v>

5673
02:33:05.220 --> 02:33:05.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5674
02:33:05.461 --> 02:33:05.940
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

5675
02:33:05.940 --> 02:33:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Color for a bodybuilder.</v>

5676
02:33:07.430 --> 02:33:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I want to say he's taller than me.</v>

5677
02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Dorian's taller than me,</v>

5678
02:33:10.111 --> 02:33:11.660
<v Speaker 1>but I don't pick the peas.</v>

5679
02:33:11.730 --> 02:33:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's six feet tall,</v>

5680
02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:14.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe six feet tall.</v>

5681
02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:15.413
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do you think he said Ronnie did.</v>

5897
02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:51.770
<v Speaker 2>If when you ask the doctor like they have everyone who compete against even Jay</v>

5898
02:38:51.770 --> 02:38:51.771
<v Speaker 2>Cutler,</v>

5902
02:38:53.150 --> 02:38:56.510
<v Speaker 2>we were trained with Ronnie sometimes and no one wanted to train with him cause</v>

5903
02:38:56.660 --> 02:38:59.420
<v Speaker 2>he would just do things we wouldn't do like what?</v>

5904
02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Like 800 pounds squat all the fucking time.</v>

02:39:10.220 --> 02:39:12.980
<v Speaker 2>the amount of work you do inside that weight room was insane.</v>

5912
02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:14.810
<v Speaker 2>The crazy thing was when he was a cop,</v>

02:41:29.740 --> 02:41:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

6014
02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:32.050
<v Speaker 2>He might be African American,</v>

6015
02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:33.190
<v Speaker 2>but he kind of,</v>

6016
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:33.441
<v Speaker 2>Tina,</v>

6017
02:41:33.441 --> 02:41:34.520
<v Speaker 2>we should probably pay attention.</v>

6018
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:35.631
<v Speaker 2>What do you think he is?</v>

6019
02:41:35.631 --> 02:41:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Jamie was his nationality.</v>

6020
02:41:37.130 --> 02:41:38.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about that guy.</v>

6021
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:38.983
<v Speaker 2>That's the same guy.</v>

6022
02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:40.100
<v Speaker 2>The guy with the black abs.</v>

6023
02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:40.491
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6024
02:41:40.491 --> 02:41:41.001
<v Speaker 2>that's not him.</v>

6025
02:41:41.001 --> 02:41:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

6026
02:41:41.330 --> 02:41:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6027
02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:42.321
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6028
02:41:42.321 --> 02:41:42.710
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

6029
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:43.411
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

6030
02:41:43.411 --> 02:41:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm black.</v>

6031
02:41:44.210 --> 02:41:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6032
02:41:45.020 --> 02:41:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Or if he has,</v>

6033
02:41:45.770 --> 02:41:46.251
<v Speaker 2>he's very light.</v>

6034
02:41:46.251 --> 02:41:50.000
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying is they are allowed to wear that stuff that makes your skin</v>

6035
02:41:50.001 --> 02:41:50.834
<v Speaker 2>look dark.</v>

6036
02:41:50.900 --> 02:41:51.651
<v Speaker 2>So as you can see,</v>

6037
02:41:51.651 --> 02:41:52.330
<v Speaker 2>the muscles better.</v>

6038
02:41:52.330 --> 02:41:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6039
02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:54.590
<v Speaker 2>But they get to a point where it's literally,</v>

6040
02:41:54.591 --> 02:41:55.330
<v Speaker 2>it's blackface.</v>

6041
02:41:55.330 --> 02:41:56.240
<v Speaker 2>It's black body.</v>

6042
02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I also faced this from Egypt.</v>

6043
02:41:59.180 --> 02:41:59.491
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6044
02:41:59.491 --> 02:42:00.324
<v Speaker 2>so he's,</v>

6045
02:42:01.370 --> 02:42:03.170
<v Speaker 2>but he's much lighter,</v>

6046
02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:04.730
<v Speaker 2>more images,</v>

6047
02:42:04.731 --> 02:42:06.620
<v Speaker 2>more Maha Maha.</v>

6048
02:42:07.490 --> 02:42:11.060
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense if that one of them has an accurate,</v>

6049
02:42:11.061 --> 02:42:12.230
<v Speaker 2>the one that most Moscow with it,</v>

6050
02:42:12.231 --> 02:42:12.830
<v Speaker 2>you just put up,</v>

6051
02:42:12.830 --> 02:42:14.510
<v Speaker 2>if that's an accurate skin tone car.</v>

6052
02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:15.231
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

6053
02:42:15.231 --> 02:42:17.070

02:44:32.191 --> 02:44:32.570
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

6160
02:44:32.570 --> 02:44:35.300
<v Speaker 2>He was a really progressive bodybuilder and he couldn't go blackface.</v>

6161
02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:37.570
<v Speaker 2>He went though and then go back to that picture.</v>

6162
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:39.010
<v Speaker 2>He went chocolate body,</v>

6163
02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:42.010
<v Speaker 2>but his face didn't touch it.</v>

6164
02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:43.600
<v Speaker 2>You can't give him that much.</v>

6165
02:44:43.601 --> 02:44:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Did a little okay.</v>

6166
02:44:44.370 --> 02:44:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Give him like he pretended he rolled around in the dirt.</v>

6167
02:44:48.430 --> 02:44:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Can't give him a metal bro.</v>

6168
02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:50.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6169
02:44:50.351 --> 02:44:50.501
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6170
02:44:50.501 --> 02:44:52.720
<v Speaker 2>He's going to win because he went only chocolate body,</v>

6171
02:44:52.721 --> 02:44:54.340
<v Speaker 2>which is totally socially acceptable.</v>

6172
02:44:54.610 --> 02:44:58.420
<v Speaker 2>He totally didn't go chocolate face to chocolate body.</v>

6173
02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:02.590
<v Speaker 2>They're literally spray tanning this people exactly what they're deer and</v>

6174
02:45:02.591 --> 02:45:04.240
<v Speaker 2>turning that guy black.</v>

6175
02:45:04.330 --> 02:45:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Go back.</v>

6176
02:45:04.750 --> 02:45:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

6177
02:45:06.670 --> 02:45:07.900
<v Speaker 2>But he keeps the face.</v>

6178
02:45:08.530 --> 02:45:09.363
<v Speaker 2>Is this real?</v>

6179
02:45:10.030 --> 02:45:12.720
<v Speaker 2>That's before he went out as cannot be released before he went out.</v>

6180
02:45:12.730 --> 02:45:13.241
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>

6181
02:45:13.241 --> 02:45:13.631
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

6182
02:45:13.631 --> 02:45:16.940
<v Speaker 2>you mother fuckers are not taking a picture of me with black face on within</v>

6183
02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:17.710
<v Speaker 2>probably like Michelle,</v>

6184
02:45:17.710 --> 02:45:18.311
<v Speaker 2>how ridiculous.</v>

6185
02:45:18.311 --> 02:45:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Let's just call it chocolate face.</v>

6186
02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Let's all call,</v>

6187
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:21.340
<v Speaker 2>but that's just going on</v>

6188
02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:26.453
<v Speaker 2>pure chocolate.</v>

6189
02:45:26.620 --> 02:45:26.951
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6190
02:45:26.951 --> 02:45:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I know he doesn't want to be racist and I'm not saying that there's no intent</v>

6191
02:45:30.071 --> 02:45:31.150
<v Speaker 2>there to be raising chin.</v>

6192
02:45:31.270 --> 02:45:32.103
<v Speaker 2>Imagine.</v>

6193
02:45:32.110 --> 02:45:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if from this conversation,</v>

6194
02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:35.710
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that guy doing?</v>

6195
02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:37.000
<v Speaker 2>That's Brian [inaudible].</v>

6196
02:45:37.060 --> 02:45:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

6197
02:45:37.390 --> 02:45:41.170
<v Speaker 2>he's gets his body bronze up to up to the neck and then he leaves it alone.</v>

6198
02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:43.390
<v Speaker 2>What does hats right before I went at him.</v>

6199
02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6200
02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6201
02:45:45.070 --> 02:45:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Imagine.</v>

6202
02:45:45.790 --> 02:45:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Just imagine if because of this conversation we put blue,</v>

6203
02:45:49.770 --> 02:45:52.210
<v Speaker 2>we bring awareness to chocolate face,</v>

6204
02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:56.680
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially a socially acceptable version of blackface.</v>

6205
02:45:57.280 --> 02:45:58.710
<v Speaker 2>We're basically to look at this guy,</v>

6206
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:01.390
<v Speaker 2>you need to go to jail,</v>

6207
02:46:01.391 --> 02:46:02.224
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

6208
02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:07.793
<v Speaker 2>Please</v>

6209
02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:10.060
<v Speaker 2>don't tell</v>

6210
02:46:10.090 --> 02:46:10.750
<v Speaker 1>me sir.</v>

6211
02:46:10.750 --> 02:46:12.530
<v Speaker 1>We give a guy no listen,</v>

6212
02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:14.300
<v Speaker 1>but even forget all that.</v>

6213
02:46:14.330 --> 02:46:16.580
<v Speaker 1>You don't look better when you do that.</v>

6214
02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:19.360
<v Speaker 1>You just look insane like you.</v>

6215
02:46:19.361 --> 02:46:22.700
<v Speaker 1>You have a black man's skin color and you have blonde,</v>

6216
02:46:22.701 --> 02:46:23.810
<v Speaker 1>spiky hair.</v>

6217
02:46:24.170 --> 02:46:25.420
<v Speaker 1>This is insanity.</v>

6218
02:46:25.430 --> 02:46:26.270
<v Speaker 1>What am I looking at?</v>

6219
02:46:26.271 --> 02:46:27.980
<v Speaker 1>How hard he worked this way,</v>

6220
02:46:27.981 --> 02:46:28.251
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

6221
02:46:28.251 --> 02:46:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at a puzzle.</v>

6222
02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

6223
02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:32.000
<v Speaker 1>what is that a hot math?</v>

6224
02:46:32.001 --> 02:46:32.241
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

6225
02:46:32.241 --> 02:46:33.080
<v Speaker 1>what is that puzzle?</v>

6226
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck here with a nice head kick.</v>

6227
02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should pay attention to this.</v>

6228
02:46:37.250 --> 02:46:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Awesome fight through that white guy.</v>

6229
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:39.543
<v Speaker 1>Like schooling,</v>

6230
02:46:39.570 --> 02:46:41.240
<v Speaker 1>different of chocolate body.</v>

6231
02:46:41.300 --> 02:46:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Same Guy.</v>

6232
02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:42.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6233
02:46:42.431 --> 02:46:42.551
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6234
02:46:42.551 --> 02:46:42.680
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6235
02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:43.440
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

6236
02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:45.000
<v Speaker 1>that's one guy dolled up and the other,</v>

6237
02:46:45.010 --> 02:46:46.040
<v Speaker 1>just an actual say,</v>

6238
02:46:46.050 --> 02:46:46.760
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

6239
02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:47.593
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

6240
02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Black guys look better.</v>

6241
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:51.110
<v Speaker 1>You just going to have to deal with you see the muscle fiber.</v>

6242
02:46:51.111 --> 02:46:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I agreed to just be white chocolate body</v>

6243
02:46:59.950 --> 02:47:00.783
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

6244
02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll read the first one.</v>

6245
02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Staffer say this.</v>

6246
02:47:06.290 --> 02:47:07.011
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6247
02:47:07.011 --> 02:47:07.844
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

6248
02:47:09.230 --> 02:47:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I think we might be the first to call it chocolate body and I think that shit is</v>

6249
02:47:11.930 --> 02:47:12.560
<v Speaker 1>going to stick.</v>

6250
02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:13.393
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6251
02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:15.310
<v Speaker 1>baffled spending Yeovil by yeah.</v>

6252
02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:16.710
<v Speaker 1>You look at it.</v>

6253
02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:16.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6254
02:47:16.941 --> 02:47:18.020
<v Speaker 1>You're looking for the sweet.</v>

6255
02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:19.690
<v Speaker 1>But think about fighters Tan.</v>

6256
02:47:20.860 --> 02:47:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Try to get real tan.</v>

6257
02:47:22.340 --> 02:47:22.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6258
02:47:22.521 --> 02:47:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Here keeps the chocolate hip toss.</v>

6259
02:47:25.850 --> 02:47:26.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6260
02:47:26.151 --> 02:47:26.691
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

6261
02:47:26.691 --> 02:47:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Fighters get tanned,</v>

6262
02:47:27.651 --> 02:47:28.970
<v Speaker 1>but George Saint Pierre did.</v>

6263
02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:29.871
<v Speaker 1>But you know there's a,</v>

6264
02:47:29.871 --> 02:47:31.370
<v Speaker 1>there's actually what you got yellow.</v>

6265
02:47:31.460 --> 02:47:32.151
<v Speaker 1>It was actually,</v>

6266
02:47:32.151 --> 02:47:32.511
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

6267
02:47:32.511 --> 02:47:35.810
<v Speaker 1>there's an actual benefit like in terms of your performance,</v>

6268
02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:38.840
<v Speaker 1>the increased vitamin D from getting Tan.</v>

6269
02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:39.531
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

6270
02:47:39.531 --> 02:47:39.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6271
02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I think Steve Maxwell told me about this,</v>

6272
02:47:42.140 --> 02:47:43.430
<v Speaker 1>that they did some studies,</v>

6273
02:47:43.431 --> 02:47:44.900
<v Speaker 1>so get this last position.</v>

6274
02:47:44.901 --> 02:47:45.800
<v Speaker 1>These boys are scrapped.</v>

6275
02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6276
02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I believe Steve Maxwell told me that there's a,</v>

6277
02:47:49.191 --> 02:47:52.200
<v Speaker 1>there's physical benefits to uh,</v>

6278
02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:54.890
<v Speaker 1>getting Tan being out in the sun.</v>

6279
02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:55.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6280
02:47:55.101 --> 02:47:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Well not just that,</v>

6281
02:47:56.560 --> 02:48:01.560
<v Speaker 1>while you were Tan and your body's jacked up on vitamin D from the exposure to</v>

6282
02:48:02.001 --> 02:48:02.450
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>

6283
02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:05.270
<v Speaker 1>even I think probably not as good,</v>

6284
02:48:05.271 --> 02:48:06.650
<v Speaker 1>but better than nothing.</v>

6285
02:48:06.651 --> 02:48:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Exposure to a tanning bed.</v>

6286
02:48:07.850 --> 02:48:08.480
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

6287
02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:10.550
<v Speaker 1>It actually can benefit you.</v>

6288
02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:13.580
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy that your body makes up vitamin.</v>

6289
02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I know it's the only way you can stuff getting sun rays.</v>

6290
02:48:16.550 --> 02:48:16.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6291
02:48:16.791 --> 02:48:18.770
<v Speaker 1>there's other ways to get it dietarily but you know,</v>

6292
02:48:18.771 --> 02:48:23.210
<v Speaker 1>most of the way you get it staring at the sun or being in the sun.</v>

6293
02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:24.063
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy.</v>

6294
02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:25.093
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

6295
02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:26.840
<v Speaker 1>How bizarre is that?</v>

6296
02:48:27.890 --> 02:48:28.161
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

6297
02:48:28.161 --> 02:48:29.990
<v Speaker 1>I wish one of these two wind chocolate body.</v>

6298
02:48:30.170 --> 02:48:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6299
02:48:30.910 --> 02:48:31.131
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

6300
02:48:31.131 --> 02:48:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if a guy fought in the UFC chocolate body and he's like,</v>

6301
02:48:33.891 --> 02:48:34.161
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

6302
02:48:34.161 --> 02:48:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I got to get contracts.</v>

6303
02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I want to look ripped.</v>

6304
02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:37.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6305
02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:38.150
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't say anything.</v>

6306
02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I see how guys who are fortunate enough to have more melanin in their skin,</v>

6307
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.801
<v Speaker 1>they look better.</v>

6308
02:48:42.801 --> 02:48:43.970
<v Speaker 1>They get more contracts.</v>

6309
02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:44.833
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

6310
02:48:45.130 --> 02:48:46.640
<v Speaker 1>He can't hold that shit back from me.</v>

6311
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you remember when Chuck Ladell used to paint his toenails and then</v>

6312
02:48:49.281 --> 02:48:51.440
<v Speaker 1>everybody wanted to paint their toenails black?</v>

6313
02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:53.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about black toes.</v>

6314
02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

6315
02:48:53.570 --> 02:48:58.570
<v Speaker 1>All we need is one dude to go chocolate body and everybody goes nuts and he gets</v>

6316
02:48:59.451 --> 02:49:00.740
<v Speaker 1>a big endorsement contract.</v>

6317
02:49:01.010 --> 02:49:05.180
<v Speaker 1>We need North Carolina triggers with the fucking beautiful kicks.</v>

6318
02:49:05.650 --> 02:49:06.610
<v Speaker 1>But grins Ahmond,</v>

6319
02:49:06.611 --> 02:49:07.980
<v Speaker 1>don't give a fuck about your</v>

6320
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:08.813
<v Speaker 2>kicks.</v>

6321
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:10.950
<v Speaker 2>He's such a little monster.</v>

6322
02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Good defense there by area,</v>

6323
02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:16.130
<v Speaker 2>but were Koreans.</v>

6324
02:49:16.130 --> 02:49:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6325
02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:17.190
<v Speaker 2>try it again.</v>

6326
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Try it again.</v>

6327
02:49:17.730 --> 02:49:19.710
<v Speaker 2>But at the very least it's allowing him to escape.</v>

6328
02:49:19.740 --> 02:49:19.981
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6329
02:49:19.981 --> 02:49:20.940
<v Speaker 2>step in elbow.</v>

6330
02:49:20.941 --> 02:49:22.440
<v Speaker 2>Look at that as a creative dude.</v>

6331
02:49:22.470 --> 02:49:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Oo.</v>

6332
02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:23.121
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6333
02:49:23.121 --> 02:49:24.210
<v Speaker 2>you can clip though.</v>

6334
02:49:24.211 --> 02:49:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Temple.</v>

6335
02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:26.330
<v Speaker 2>That right hand without the Zombie Dude.</v>

6336
02:49:26.331 --> 02:49:28.140
<v Speaker 2>He like you're flashy shit.</v>

6337
02:49:28.141 --> 02:49:29.070
<v Speaker 2>And just come forward.</v>

6338
02:49:29.250 --> 02:49:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Well in a lot of ways this is a real good test for him after the Frankie fight.</v>

6339
02:49:33.380 --> 02:49:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Good test for both of them,</v>

6340
02:49:34.471 --> 02:49:34.671
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6341
02:49:34.671 --> 02:49:35.504
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6342
02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:36.353
<v Speaker 2>What's matter?</v>

6343
02:49:38.010 --> 02:49:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Logo fighters definitely can't do that.</v>

6344
02:49:40.090 --> 02:49:41.580
<v Speaker 2>And fake 10 UFC fighter.</v>

6345
02:49:41.850 --> 02:49:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh Sam Albi did.</v>

6346
02:49:43.381 --> 02:49:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Why did he do that?</v>

6347
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:47.160
<v Speaker 2>2015 wow.</v>

6348
02:49:47.190 --> 02:49:52.190
<v Speaker 2>You know the UFC had to make in a policy about putting those fake tattoos on</v>

6349
02:49:53.221 --> 02:49:54.900
<v Speaker 2>your back that said like,</v>

6350
02:49:54.901 --> 02:49:55.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6351
02:49:55.260 --> 02:49:55.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6352
02:49:55.561 --> 02:49:58.170
<v Speaker 2>casino something.com and remember this,</v>

6353
02:49:58.171 --> 02:49:58.591
<v Speaker 2>we're doing it.</v>

6354
02:49:58.591 --> 02:49:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6355
02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:01.410
<v Speaker 2>I think Bernard Hopkins was the first guy to do that.</v>

6356
02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:02.550
<v Speaker 2>There's some guys who did that.</v>

6357
02:50:02.551 --> 02:50:02.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6358
02:50:02.701 --> 02:50:03.451
<v Speaker 2>UFC can't do it.</v>

6359
02:50:03.451 --> 02:50:04.500
<v Speaker 2>You can't get tattoos,</v>

6360
02:50:04.501 --> 02:50:04.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6361
02:50:04.651 --> 02:50:05.461
<v Speaker 2>that's in your contract.</v>

6362
02:50:05.461 --> 02:50:06.900
<v Speaker 2>No tattoos of logos.</v>

6363
02:50:07.170 --> 02:50:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

6364
02:50:07.710 --> 02:50:08.543
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

6365
02:50:08.580 --> 02:50:10.470
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] the air it on television.</v>

6366
02:50:10.471 --> 02:50:11.281
<v Speaker 2>No basketball too.</v>

6367
02:50:11.281 --> 02:50:12.360
<v Speaker 2>Like Jared Smith got like,</v>

6368
02:50:12.361 --> 02:50:17.361
<v Speaker 2>I think a supreme tattoo and that they had to cover it up a large big ass</v>

6369
02:50:17.761 --> 02:50:18.570
<v Speaker 2>supreme debt.</v>

6370
02:50:18.570 --> 02:50:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Unless you have ownership in that business.</v>

6371
02:50:20.551 --> 02:50:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

6372
02:50:21.570 --> 02:50:21.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6373
02:50:21.781 --> 02:50:22.620
<v Speaker 2>What is that about?</v>

6374
02:50:22.621 --> 02:50:23.454
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6375
02:50:23.670 --> 02:50:24.580
<v Speaker 2>He has so many tattoos.</v>

6376
02:50:24.581 --> 02:50:24.991
<v Speaker 2>He's probably like,</v>

6377
02:50:24.991 --> 02:50:25.710
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

6378
02:50:25.710 --> 02:50:26.041
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

6379
02:50:26.041 --> 02:50:26.874
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

6380
02:50:27.330 --> 02:50:28.163
<v Speaker 2>give me a free shit.</v>

6381
02:50:28.260 --> 02:50:29.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what he's doing.</v>

6382
02:50:29.070 --> 02:50:29.701
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

6383
02:50:29.701 --> 02:50:30.181
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6384
02:50:30.181 --> 02:50:32.550
<v Speaker 2>He's got a right off the back of the sick though.</v>

6385
02:50:34.110 --> 02:50:34.681
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6386
02:50:34.681 --> 02:50:35.041
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

6387
02:50:35.041 --> 02:50:35.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6388
02:50:35.251 --> 02:50:36.180
<v Speaker 2>you're spinning elbow.</v>

6389
02:50:36.181 --> 02:50:37.200
<v Speaker 2>That shit was nasty.</v>

6390
02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that replay?</v>

6391
02:50:39.300 --> 02:50:42.030
<v Speaker 2>We should pay attention to as far we've been talking about chocolate bodies.</v>

6392
02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6393
02:50:42.510 --> 02:50:43.710
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a point though,</v>

6394
02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:44.280
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

6395
02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're the first ones really call it out.</v>

6396
02:50:46.830 --> 02:50:47.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6397
02:50:47.341 --> 02:50:49.780
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard before Jamie.</v>

6398
02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6399
02:50:52.170 --> 02:50:55.240
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a reason why there was a bunch of them tagged together on a</v>

6400
02:50:55.241 --> 02:50:55.880
<v Speaker 2>website.</v>

6401
02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:56.713
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

6402
02:50:56.810 --> 02:50:57.250
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

6403
02:50:57.250 --> 02:50:59.910
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's hilarious when you see the dudes who don't have chocolate</v>

6404
02:50:59.911 --> 02:51:00.290
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>

6405
02:51:00.290 --> 02:51:01.290
<v Speaker 2>they chocolate body.</v>

6406
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:03.120
<v Speaker 2>That's so weird looking.</v>

6407
02:51:03.180 --> 02:51:06.690
<v Speaker 2>It's just like you like your face is just a normal color,</v>

6408
02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:07.740
<v Speaker 2>but I get it.</v>

6409
02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:08.281
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

6410
02:51:08.281 --> 02:51:10.380
<v Speaker 2>It does make you look more defined yet does.</v>

6411
02:51:10.410 --> 02:51:12.810
<v Speaker 2>When you're Tan you'd definitely look more shredded.</v>

6412
02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:14.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh Damn.</v>

6413
02:51:14.951 --> 02:51:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6414
02:51:15.130 --> 02:51:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>

6415
02:51:15.510 --> 02:51:17.370
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about it is like tanning,</v>

6416
02:51:18.150 --> 02:51:19.200
<v Speaker 2>there's not really good for you.</v>

6417
02:51:19.201 --> 02:51:19.560
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6418
02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Like get that dark.</v>

6419
02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:21.211
<v Speaker 2>Not all the time.</v>

6420
02:51:21.211 --> 02:51:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6421
02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:23.150
<v Speaker 2>If you've got that dark fuck,</v>

6422
02:51:23.230 --> 02:51:23.881
<v Speaker 2>they can't do it.</v>

6423
02:51:23.881 --> 02:51:25.050
<v Speaker 2>That's why they have to spray paint.</v>

6424
02:51:26.220 --> 02:51:29.790
<v Speaker 2>And also I would think that I wouldn't be mad if Korean Zombie had somewhat of a</v>

6425
02:51:29.791 --> 02:51:30.061
<v Speaker 2>Tan,</v>

6426
02:51:30.061 --> 02:51:30.870
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

6427
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:30.991
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

02:51:38.440 --> 02:51:39.570
<v Speaker 2>It's good head movement too.</v>

6433
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:40.200
<v Speaker 2>He looks,</v>

6434
02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:40.711

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6439
02:51:46.201 --> 02:51:47.310
<v Speaker 2>That would have been really good fight.</v>

6440
02:51:47.610 --> 02:51:51.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that fight for as a beat or uh oh man.</v>

6441
02:51:51.450 --> 02:51:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Nice right hand by the Korean Zombie.</v>

02:52:55.581 --> 02:52:55.690
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

6488
02:52:55.690 --> 02:52:57.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a woman who's um,</v>

6489
02:52:59.020 --> 02:53:04.020
<v Speaker 2>how shall we put this in a lot of muscle that was not a woman and the titties</v>

6490
02:53:05.501 --> 02:53:06.160
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

6491
02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Those are implants.</v>

6492
02:53:07.390 --> 02:53:07.601
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6493
02:53:07.601 --> 02:53:08.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a woman that's hooked up.</v>

6494
02:53:08.910 --> 02:53:10.630
<v Speaker 2>They did the titties or implants.</v>

6495
02:53:10.660 --> 02:53:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6496
02:53:11.170 --> 02:53:12.280
<v Speaker 2>But my point is like,</v>

6497
02:53:12.281 --> 02:53:13.660
<v Speaker 2>that looks like,</v>

6498
02:53:14.170 --> 02:53:19.170
<v Speaker 2>like her body and her proportions look like that's a man like up</v>

6499
02:53:22.810 --> 02:53:24.640
<v Speaker 2>like a different kind of thing.</v>

6500
02:53:25.120 --> 02:53:27.160
<v Speaker 2>If that came up to you as a lady boy and telling him like,</v>

6501
02:53:27.161 --> 02:53:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the fuck Outta here do better,</v>

6503
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:30.700
<v Speaker 2>but this is what I'm thinking.</v>

6504
02:53:31.270 --> 02:53:33.910
<v Speaker 2>She looks like she can be piecing them up.</v>

6505
02:53:34.060 --> 02:53:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Is She,</v>

02:53:34.810 --> 02:53:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

02:53:35.060 --> 02:53:36.040
<v Speaker 2>dad's going after him.</v>

6509
02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6510
02:53:36.490 --> 02:53:38.970
<v Speaker 2>She looks like she could be like uh,</v>

6511
02:53:39.370 --> 02:53:41.950
<v Speaker 2>a type of human that evolved on a nearby star.</v>

6512
02:53:42.700 --> 02:53:44.470
<v Speaker 2>She looks like Steve Nash with tits.</v>

6513
02:53:44.471 --> 02:53:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Am I right?</v>

6514
02:53:45.100 --> 02:53:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Like a type of human and evolved in a nearby galaxy that's super similar to us.</v>

6515
02:53:49.630 --> 02:53:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know Bro.</v>

6516
02:53:50.710 --> 02:53:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully not while the,</v>

6517
02:53:52.150 --> 02:53:53.350
<v Speaker 2>the implant,</v>

6518
02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:53.890
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

6519
02:53:53.890 --> 02:53:55.180
<v Speaker 2>If that wasn't an implant,</v>

6520
02:53:55.210 --> 02:53:56.650
<v Speaker 2>if that's just what the breasts look like,</v>

6521
02:53:57.130 --> 02:53:58.660
<v Speaker 2>just super muscular on top.</v>

6522
02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Just like a guy super jacked.</v>

6523
02:54:00.671 --> 02:54:01.840
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a rugby player.</v>

6524
02:54:02.230 --> 02:54:05.080
<v Speaker 2>And then you get to the titties and these weird sort of um,</v>

6525
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:07.720
<v Speaker 2>bulbous bags.</v>

6526
02:54:07.721 --> 02:54:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Maybe their horns or something.</v>

6527
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Hard rocks that they use for chess,</v>

6528
02:54:12.380 --> 02:54:13.420
<v Speaker 2>Bang and battle.</v>

6529
02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:15.161

6535
02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:22.690

6737
02:59:37.440 --> 02:59:38.273
<v Speaker 2>I think he's got,</v>

6738
02:59:38.290 --> 02:59:40.620
<v Speaker 2>he's got some issues going on with that upper lip man.</v>

6739
02:59:41.160 --> 02:59:41.980
<v Speaker 2>We've seen that before.</v>

6740
02:59:41.980 --> 02:59:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Were lip splits.</v>

6744
02:59:49.251 --> 02:59:49.770
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

6745
02:59:49.770 --> 02:59:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Close to four years.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She missed four years.</v>

6748
02:59:52.981 --> 02:59:54.040
<v Speaker 2>I think he served too,</v>

6749
02:59:54.480 --> 02:59:55.710
<v Speaker 2>but he missed four years in the AFC.</v>

6750
02:59:55.711 --> 02:59:57.340

<v Speaker 2>He's yelling something.</v>

6755
03:00:04.260 --> 03:00:05.520
<v Speaker 2>He's saying he's doing something.</v>

6756
03:00:05.740 --> 03:00:06.630
<v Speaker 2>He's holding his glove.</v>

6757
03:00:07.060 --> 03:00:09.980
<v Speaker 2>He said something through did it wobble yet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Rick on the fucking water buffaloes to kick off and it has a sense of material.</v>

6818
03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:32.650

6819
03:01:32.680 --> 03:01:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Like God damn it.</v>

6820
03:01:34.150 --> 03:01:38.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like a zebra got his fucking air starched off by a fucking eagle or</v>

6821
03:01:38.681 --> 03:01:39.130
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

6822
03:01:39.130 --> 03:01:44.130
<v Speaker 2>James Vick posted something on Instagram cause you know James Vick has been a</v>

6823
03:01:44.350 --> 03:01:45.310
<v Speaker 2>pig hunting lately.</v>

6824
03:01:45.770 --> 03:01:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6825
03:01:46.210 --> 03:01:46.720
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

6826
03:01:46.720 --> 03:01:51.720
<v Speaker 2>he posted this video of a pig eating a deer and you watch it like a boar wild</v>

6827
03:01:52.871 --> 03:01:53.460
<v Speaker 2>pig.</v>

6828
03:01:53.460 --> 03:01:54.880
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't necessarily have to be a board,</v>

6829
03:01:54.881 --> 03:01:55.400
<v Speaker 2>eat a deer.</v>

6830
03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:56.680
<v Speaker 2>It could be a wild female.</v>

6831
03:01:56.830 --> 03:01:58.060
<v Speaker 2>So when you think of wild boar,</v>

6832
03:01:58.061 --> 03:01:59.680
<v Speaker 2>people think of like a different thing.</v>

6833
03:02:00.580 --> 03:02:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6834
03:02:00.940 --> 03:02:01.990
<v Speaker 2>that's just a male.</v>

6835
03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:02.913
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

6836
03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:03.670
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

6837
03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:04.503
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

6838
03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:07.390
<v Speaker 2>but a bore isn't the same as the pig that we eat.</v>

6839
03:02:07.391 --> 03:02:08.310
<v Speaker 2>The pink piggies.</v>

6840
03:02:08.340 --> 03:02:11.350
<v Speaker 2>They're like dads where it gets strange because they're actually all the same</v>

6841
03:02:11.351 --> 03:02:12.184
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

6842
03:02:12.370 --> 03:02:12.941
<v Speaker 2>Oh Damn.</v>

6843
03:02:12.941 --> 03:02:13.680
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that.</v>

6844
03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:17.110
<v Speaker 2>They do looks different here for noses.</v>

6845
03:02:17.111 --> 03:02:17.860
<v Speaker 2>They're gnarly.</v>

6846
03:02:17.860 --> 03:02:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

6847
03:02:18.310 --> 03:02:20.390
<v Speaker 2>They're different in where they come from to be rocks.</v>

6848
03:02:20.920 --> 03:02:22.030
<v Speaker 2>If they're in like Russia,</v>

6849
03:02:22.031 --> 03:02:27.031
<v Speaker 2>like Russian bores and the bigger are all considered among the same genus,</v>

6850
03:02:27.370 --> 03:02:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I think they call it.</v>

6851
03:02:28.331 --> 03:02:29.081
<v Speaker 2>They say genus.</v>

6852
03:02:29.081 --> 03:02:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you said,</v>

6853
03:02:29.590 --> 03:02:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Janice or Gina's?</v>

6854
03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:31.333
<v Speaker 2>How do you say that?</v>

6855
03:02:32.310 --> 03:02:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Steve or Noah told me all this.</v>

6856
03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:38.760
<v Speaker 2>It's an animal species called [inaudible] and that's what pigs are the same</v>

6857
03:02:40.820 --> 03:02:42.890
<v Speaker 2>ladies that you're saying the eagles different.</v>

6858
03:02:43.260 --> 03:02:43.781
<v Speaker 2>Very different.</v>

6859
03:02:43.781 --> 03:02:44.261
<v Speaker 2>Very different.</v>

6860
03:02:44.261 --> 03:02:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Because when you leave pigs out in the wild,</v>

6861
03:02:46.930 --> 03:02:47.111
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

6862
03:02:47.111 --> 03:02:47.944
<v Speaker 2>there it is right there.</v>

6863
03:02:48.070 --> 03:02:49.010
<v Speaker 2>What are the differences in the border?</v>

6864
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Willdabeast while the pigs called the bore underrated man.</v>

6865
03:02:52.450 --> 03:02:53.283
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

6866
03:02:53.670 --> 03:02:53.971
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6867
03:02:53.971 --> 03:02:54.551
<v Speaker 2>it says it right here.</v>

6868
03:02:54.551 --> 03:02:55.720
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't talk about the other piece of that.</v>

6869
03:02:56.650 --> 03:02:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6870
03:02:57.640 --> 03:02:58.473
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

6871
03:02:58.920 --> 03:02:59.530
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>

6872
03:02:59.530 --> 03:03:01.110
<v Speaker 2>A wild pig could be called the board,</v>

6873
03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:02.230
<v Speaker 2>but that's just the name of it.</v>

6874
03:03:02.740 --> 03:03:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Pig.</v>

6875
03:03:03.010 --> 03:03:04.300
<v Speaker 2>European wild boar.</v>

6876
03:03:04.660 --> 03:03:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6877
03:03:05.170 --> 03:03:06.003
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6878
03:03:06.220 --> 03:03:07.000
<v Speaker 2>but what are the,</v>

6879
03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:07.570
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

6880
03:03:07.570 --> 03:03:08.800
<v Speaker 2>this is what the question is,</v>

6881
03:03:08.801 --> 03:03:09.634
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6882
03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:13.510
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between wild pigs and domesticated pigs?</v>

6883
03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Pig pig in the w in the more think a pig is the same family.</v>

6884
03:03:17.831 --> 03:03:18.730
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>

6885
03:03:18.970 --> 03:03:19.061
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6886
03:03:19.061 --> 03:03:20.240
<v Speaker 2>there it is a boy.</v>

6887
03:03:20.290 --> 03:03:20.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6888
03:03:20.561 --> 03:03:21.460
<v Speaker 2>An castrated male.</v>

6889
03:03:21.461 --> 03:03:22.294
<v Speaker 2>Domestic pig.</v>

6890
03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:24.730
<v Speaker 2>That's just the term war.</v>

6891
03:03:24.780 --> 03:03:25.613
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6892
03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:28.270
<v Speaker 2>wild boar when I'm asking is,</v>

6893
03:03:28.900 --> 03:03:31.540
<v Speaker 2>is a pig in a wild pig,</v>

6894
03:03:31.630 --> 03:03:33.070
<v Speaker 2>a domesticated pig in a wild pig?</v>

6895
03:03:33.071 --> 03:03:34.210
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between them?</v>

6896
03:03:34.390 --> 03:03:35.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there really is.</v>

6897
03:03:36.070 --> 03:03:37.120
<v Speaker 2>I think they're the same thing.</v>

6898
03:03:37.121 --> 03:03:41.410
<v Speaker 2>It's just they bred one and turned it into this like real soft sort of thing.</v>

6899
03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>But when they get wild,</v>

6900
03:03:43.810 --> 03:03:45.430
<v Speaker 2>their body actually morphs the,</v>

6901
03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:45.701
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6902
03:03:45.701 --> 03:03:46.780
<v Speaker 2>they're not pink in the wild.</v>

6903
03:03:46.781 --> 03:03:48.490
<v Speaker 2>They get fucked up right now.</v>

6904
03:03:48.491 --> 03:03:48.701
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

6905
03:03:48.701 --> 03:03:51.400
<v Speaker 2>they literally have changes to their anatomy.</v>

6906
03:03:51.430 --> 03:03:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Their nose grows,</v>

6907
03:03:52.870 --> 03:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>their mouth lengthens,</v>

6908
03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:55.700
<v Speaker 2>their teeth grow out there,</v>

6909
03:03:55.710 --> 03:03:59.780
<v Speaker 2>their hair gets thicker and it happens just after a few months.</v>

6910
03:04:02.320 --> 03:04:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6911
03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:03.633
<v Speaker 2>I know what the,</v>

6912
03:04:03.730 --> 03:04:04.640
<v Speaker 2>the girls,</v>

6913
03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:09.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a wild pig is just both wants to Twila and then a regular razor back is,</v>

6914
03:04:09.740 --> 03:04:10.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6915
03:04:10.820 --> 03:04:12.040
<v Speaker 2>it's not the answer to my question.</v>

6916
03:04:12.041 --> 03:04:12.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6917
03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:15.940
<v Speaker 2>they call it the question is what is the difference between a wild pig and a</v>

6918
03:04:15.941 --> 03:04:17.290
<v Speaker 2>domesticated pig?</v>

6919
03:04:18.370 --> 03:04:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Did they have that on there?</v>

6920
03:04:20.620 --> 03:04:21.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6921
03:04:21.460 --> 03:04:21.971
<v Speaker 2>Google,</v>

6922
03:04:21.971 --> 03:04:25.330
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference between a wild pig versus domesticated pig?</v>

6923
03:04:28.050 --> 03:04:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6924
03:04:28.530 --> 03:04:30.870
<v Speaker 2>let's see what their piggy,</v>

6925
03:04:30.990 --> 03:04:31.141
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6926
03:04:31.141 --> 03:04:34.860
<v Speaker 2>we go a pig hog and board essentially describe the same animal,</v>

6927
03:04:35.100 --> 03:04:36.330
<v Speaker 2>but there are some distinctions,</v>

6928
03:04:36.590 --> 03:04:38.910
<v Speaker 2>a bores and uncast treated male domestic pig.</v>

6929
03:04:38.911 --> 03:04:40.950
<v Speaker 2>But it also means a wild pig of any gender.</v>

6930
03:04:40.951 --> 03:04:41.900
<v Speaker 2>A hog off means.</v>

6931
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.983
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6932
03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:44.730
<v Speaker 2>If we go deeper into it,</v>

6933
03:04:44.731 --> 03:04:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that it says that they're a part of something called Sue</v>

6934
03:04:48.350 --> 03:04:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Scrofani.</v>

6935
03:04:49.160 --> 03:04:50.790
<v Speaker 2>And Sue's Crawford is the,</v>

6936
03:04:50.791 --> 03:04:51.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6937
03:04:51.450 --> 03:04:53.910
<v Speaker 2>the group that includes wild pigs,</v>

6938
03:04:53.911 --> 03:04:55.020
<v Speaker 2>domesticated pigs,</v>

6939
03:04:55.410 --> 03:04:56.430
<v Speaker 2>all those different animals.</v>

6940
03:04:58.380 --> 03:04:59.520
<v Speaker 2>But when you let them go wild,</v>

6941
03:05:00.390 --> 03:05:00.751
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

6942
03:05:00.751 --> 03:05:01.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6943
03:05:01.050 --> 03:05:02.610
<v Speaker 2>they literally change where they are.</v>

6944
03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:03.980
<v Speaker 2>So sue scruff up.</v>

6945
03:05:03.990 --> 03:05:04.823
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

6946
03:05:04.950 --> 03:05:06.390
<v Speaker 2>So it is kind of the same thing.</v>

6947
03:05:06.391 --> 03:05:08.730
<v Speaker 2>It's just they look different in different places,</v>

6948
03:05:09.180 --> 03:05:10.200
<v Speaker 2>but they're the same thing.</v>

6949
03:05:10.270 --> 03:05:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

6950
03:05:10.490 --> 03:05:12.540
<v Speaker 2>My son was playing with two baby pigs.</v>

6951
03:05:12.690 --> 03:05:13.740
<v Speaker 2>They're eight weeks old.</v>

6952
03:05:13.741 --> 03:05:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Got Dan.</v>

6953
03:05:14.210 --> 03:05:15.480
<v Speaker 2>They were cute or adorable.</v>

6954
03:05:15.540 --> 03:05:15.871
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

6955
03:05:15.871 --> 03:05:17.550
<v Speaker 2>they're cute when you see them in the wild,</v>

6956
03:05:17.551 --> 03:05:18.384
<v Speaker 2>they're so different.</v>

6957
03:05:18.480 --> 03:05:20.790
<v Speaker 2>It's such a ruthlessly aggressive little thing.</v>

6958
03:05:20.840 --> 03:05:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

6959
03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:22.380
<v Speaker 2>So you want to kill him?</v>

6960
03:05:22.530 --> 03:05:22.741
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6961
03:05:22.741 --> 03:05:23.451
<v Speaker 2>they're creepy.</v>

6962
03:05:23.451 --> 03:05:23.820
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

6963
03:05:23.820 --> 03:05:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first time I ever hunted them,</v>

6964
03:05:26.430 --> 03:05:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I was with Rinella and we were walking past this field and the grass was the</v>

6965
03:05:30.361 --> 03:05:30.840
<v Speaker 2>brush.</v>

6966
03:05:30.840 --> 03:05:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Everything was very thick and it was really high.</v>

6967
03:05:33.091 --> 03:05:36.720
<v Speaker 2>It was like a much taller than their backs.</v>

6968
03:05:37.410 --> 03:05:38.250
<v Speaker 2>So if a pig is,</v>

6969
03:05:38.460 --> 03:05:38.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6970
03:05:38.651 --> 03:05:39.451
<v Speaker 2>like a couple feet tall,</v>

6971
03:05:39.451 --> 03:05:40.650
<v Speaker 2>the grass was probably like five,</v>

6972
03:05:40.651 --> 03:05:42.420
<v Speaker 2>six feet tall because she couldn't see where they were.</v>

6973
03:05:42.660 --> 03:05:43.590
<v Speaker 2>But you hear him in there</v>

6974
03:05:47.130 --> 03:05:48.510
<v Speaker 2>going at it with each other and it's,</v>

6975
03:05:48.640 --> 03:05:48.890
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

6976
03:05:48.890 --> 03:05:51.450
<v Speaker 2>it sounded like there was little demons in there trying to kill each other.</v>

6977
03:05:51.530 --> 03:05:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Then what did you guys just go in there and mark among this?</v>

6978
03:05:53.730 --> 03:05:54.563
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

6979
03:05:54.600 --> 03:05:55.433
<v Speaker 2>they're about to throw down.</v>

6980
03:05:55.440 --> 03:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Look at this like this.</v>

6981
03:05:56.840 --> 03:05:57.810
<v Speaker 2>It put their hands up.</v>

6982
03:05:58.080 --> 03:05:58.913
<v Speaker 2>What is going on?</v>

6983
03:05:59.220 --> 03:06:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Why are they all flat?</v>

6984
03:06:00.360 --> 03:06:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Korean Zombie just looked up at the screen.</v>

6985
03:06:01.920 --> 03:06:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6986
03:06:02.130 --> 03:06:03.900
<v Speaker 2>He said let's meet right in the center and throw it out.</v>

6987
03:06:03.920 --> 03:06:05.760
<v Speaker 2>I think that's bombies down.</v>

6988
03:06:06.780 --> 03:06:07.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened there.</v>

6989
03:06:08.250 --> 03:06:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Zombie looked around like we're talking about wild pigs.</v>

6990
03:06:10.440 --> 03:06:13.930
<v Speaker 2>People like this fucking fight is amazing and these two assholes,</v>

6993
03:06:17.580 --> 03:06:18.450
<v Speaker 2>chocolate face,</v>

6994
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.903

6995
03:06:20.380 --> 03:06:21.630
<v Speaker 2>chocolate body's totally okay.</v>

6996
03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:23.850
<v Speaker 2>So when you go upstairs with the face you're,</v>

6997
03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:27.430
<v Speaker 2>you're better off going full white face chocolate body and say,</v>

6998
03:06:27.431 --> 03:06:27.721

6999
03:06:27.721 --> 03:06:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I'll never do black faces disrespectful,</v>

7000
03:06:29.810 --> 03:06:33.330
<v Speaker 2>but you have chocolate feet straight left hand by the Zombie.</v>

7001
03:06:33.331 --> 03:06:34.440
<v Speaker 2>That was nice.</v>

7002
03:06:34.610 --> 03:06:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Zombies trying to get in the fucking shootout.</v>

7003
03:06:37.350 --> 03:06:39.000
<v Speaker 2>That was a serious straight left.</v>

7004
03:06:39.180 --> 03:06:42.960
<v Speaker 2>He's been switching stances and as he switches stances he pops out left hand in</v>

7005
03:06:42.961 --> 03:06:43.794
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

7006
03:06:43.900 --> 03:06:44.210

7011
03:06:49.471 --> 03:06:50.304
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

03:14:22.890 --> 03:14:23.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7317
03:14:25.140 --> 03:14:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7318
03:14:25.890 --> 03:14:27.150
<v Speaker 2>If you really want that fight,</v>

7319
03:14:27.151 --> 03:14:29.640
<v Speaker 2>you got to ask for data and they put it in their brain.</v>

7320
03:14:29.641 --> 03:14:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they can give you what they think's best.</v>

7321
03:14:33.480 --> 03:14:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting fight though for what we did get to see of it and that elbow</v>

7322
03:14:37.051 --> 03:14:38.400
<v Speaker 2>was fucking fantastic.</v>

7323
03:14:38.430 --> 03:14:39.021
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to,</v>

7324
03:14:39.021 --> 03:14:39.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

7325
03:14:39.330 --> 03:14:40.890
<v Speaker 2>that's such a really good,</v>

7326
03:14:40.891 --> 03:14:45.891
<v Speaker 2>important point about the difference between recklessly charging in and you know</v>

7327
03:14:47.360 --> 03:14:50.730
<v Speaker 2>what the Korean zombies doing that turning into a Zombie war like he does every</v>

7328
03:14:50.731 --> 03:14:51.200
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

7329
03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:52.560
<v Speaker 2>It was a work and I feel as,</v>

7330
03:14:52.561 --> 03:14:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you'd probably be up on the scorecards look like it was working and</v>

7331
03:14:55.430 --> 03:14:57.450
<v Speaker 2>then now we'll find out.</v>

7332
03:14:57.780 --> 03:14:58.780
<v Speaker 2>We'll find out later what,</v>

7333
03:14:58.781 --> 03:15:02.280
<v Speaker 2>what the people that were watching think even at the scorecards,</v>

7334
03:15:02.310 --> 03:15:05.430
<v Speaker 2>one person I've read said he was down three one going into that round for the</v>

7335
03:15:05.431 --> 03:15:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Zombie three rounds to one Zombie was up from what I saw does not mean the</v>

7336
03:15:10.230 --> 03:15:11.580
<v Speaker 2>exchanges looked like it.</v>

7337
03:15:11.610 --> 03:15:13.770
<v Speaker 2>He was definitely coming after him moving forward,</v>

7338
03:15:13.771 --> 03:15:16.740
<v Speaker 2>but it looks like GI or was getting some shots and happy then good for him,</v>

7339
03:15:16.741 --> 03:15:17.310
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

7340
03:15:17.310 --> 03:15:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Look if you take the drama too,</v>

7341
03:15:18.481 --> 03:15:21.110
<v Speaker 2>there's this family got blood on your mom.</v>

7342
03:15:21.900 --> 03:15:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Do we have this again?</v>

7343
03:15:23.370 --> 03:15:24.330
<v Speaker 2>This is so sick,</v>

7344
03:15:24.640 --> 03:15:25.640
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

7345
03:15:26.460 --> 03:15:28.310
<v Speaker 2>That's m n one shit.</v>

7346
03:15:28.410 --> 03:15:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

7347
03:15:29.190 --> 03:15:30.870
<v Speaker 2>he just delivered that.</v>

7348
03:15:30.871 --> 03:15:31.704
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

7349
03:15:33.520 --> 03:15:34.510
<v Speaker 2>That's radiate.</v>

7350
03:15:34.560 --> 03:15:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

7351
03:15:35.970 --> 03:15:40.970
<v Speaker 2>One of the best elbow chaos of all AV or of all times of all time and perfect</v>

7352
03:15:41.881 --> 03:15:42.960
<v Speaker 2>time to use that technique.</v>

7353
03:15:42.961 --> 03:15:46.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's the number 10 guy in the world and in the Korean Zombie,</v>

7354
03:15:46.440 --> 03:15:46.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7355
03:15:46.831 --> 03:15:47.140
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

7356
03:15:47.140 --> 03:15:50.700
<v Speaker 2>it's a fight where according to at least one judge he was losing.</v>

7357
03:15:51.420 --> 03:15:52.330
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

7358
03:15:52.331 --> 03:15:54.730
<v Speaker 2>And he lands that and it's just not how the coach,</v>

7359
03:15:54.820 --> 03:15:59.100
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line in and it uses the momentum of his attacker.</v>

7360
03:15:59.130 --> 03:16:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a beautiful lesson in martial arts for people to watch like a,</v>

7361
03:16:03.720 --> 03:16:06.600
<v Speaker 2>when a strike like that lands and it lands so perfectly,</v>

7362
03:16:06.690 --> 03:16:09.390
<v Speaker 2>that opens up that strike for a lot of people.</v>

7363
03:16:09.430 --> 03:16:10.590
<v Speaker 2>100% right.</v>

7364
03:16:10.650 --> 03:16:13.800
<v Speaker 2>You remember John Jones started the one where he touched inside leg and did the</v>

7365
03:16:13.810 --> 03:16:15.620
<v Speaker 2>spending and then everyone started to do it.</v>

7366
03:16:15.990 --> 03:16:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7367
03:16:16.530 --> 03:16:16.861
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

7368
03:16:16.861 --> 03:16:18.070
<v Speaker 2>John One guy does it.</v>

7369
03:16:18.840 --> 03:16:19.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7370
03:16:19.720 --> 03:16:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see a gas Tom Bolano spinning elbow and Beltre.</v>

7371
03:16:23.730 --> 03:16:26.580
<v Speaker 2>No Sun dope son.</v>

7372
03:16:26.630 --> 03:16:27.463
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

7373
03:16:27.480 --> 03:16:30.450
<v Speaker 2>You want to see someone look like they got shot with a laser beam?</v>

7374
03:16:30.810 --> 03:16:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Moon really just hits me the head.</v>

7375
03:16:32.970 --> 03:16:33.803
<v Speaker 2>That shit.</v>

7376
03:16:34.230 --> 03:16:37.170
<v Speaker 2>This dude got hit so hard gas.</v>

7377
03:16:37.260 --> 03:16:38.041
<v Speaker 2>Dawn is a,</v>

7378
03:16:38.041 --> 03:16:40.260
<v Speaker 2>you know he's a real worldclass Moy Thai fighter.</v>

7379
03:16:40.261 --> 03:16:41.094
<v Speaker 2>Look left.</v>

7380
03:16:41.220 --> 03:16:44.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck dude.</v>

7381
03:16:45.780 --> 03:16:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Watch this one more time.</v>

7382
03:16:46.861 --> 03:16:47.694
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>

7383
03:16:48.180 --> 03:16:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

7384
03:16:49.801 --> 03:16:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Come on site of them.</v>

7385
03:16:51.661 --> 03:16:53.400
<v Speaker 2>But it's the way it lands too.</v>

7386
03:16:53.401 --> 03:16:54.840
<v Speaker 2>It's just so perfect.</v>

7387
03:16:55.140 --> 03:16:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

7388
03:16:56.340 --> 03:16:59.280

7389
03:16:59.310 --> 03:16:59.860
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

7390
03:16:59.860 --> 03:17:00.990
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Land knocked it down.</v>

7395

<v Speaker 2>That one's pretty cool.</v>

7396
03:17:09.220 --> 03:17:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Let's watch it one more time.</v>

7397
03:17:10.370 --> 03:17:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Time.</v>

7398
03:17:10.770 --> 03:17:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Never seen a guy.</v>

7399
03:17:11.641 --> 03:17:12.061

<v Speaker 2>but I don't think I have either watched it though.</v>

7403
03:17:16.290 --> 03:17:17.100
<v Speaker 2>That's real time.</v>

7404
03:17:17.100 --> 03:17:17.551
<v Speaker 2>One more time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>One more time.</v>

7407
03:17:18.340 --> 03:17:18.691
<v Speaker 2>More time.</v>

7408
03:17:18.691 --> 03:17:19.231
<v Speaker 2>Real time.</v>

7409
03:17:19.231 --> 03:17:20.064
<v Speaker 2>Real time.</v>

7410
03:17:20.100 --> 03:17:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Give it to you in real time.</v>

7411
03:17:22.430 --> 03:17:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Look at this song that,</v>

7412
03:17:24.701 --> 03:17:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7413
03:17:25.440 --> 03:17:26.490
<v Speaker 2>that is insane.</v>

7414
03:17:26.520 --> 03:17:27.353
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

7415
03:17:27.900 --> 03:17:29.250
<v Speaker 2>that's the restart.</v>

7416
03:17:29.251 --> 03:17:29.881
<v Speaker 2>That's control.</v>

7417
03:17:29.881 --> 03:17:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Alt,</v>

7418
03:17:30.120 --> 03:17:30.953
<v Speaker 2>delete.</v>

7419
03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Right to the whole thing goes dark and comes back up.</v>

7420
03:17:34.410 --> 03:17:34.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7421
03:17:34.651 --> 03:17:39.240
<v Speaker 2>But Korean Zombie is a guy who first of all was deep in that fight.</v>

7422
03:17:39.241 --> 03:17:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even winning that fight,</v>

7423
03:17:40.501 --> 03:17:45.501
<v Speaker 2>at least according to one judge known for being a Zombie known for being able to</v>

7424
03:17:45.751 --> 03:17:46.920
<v Speaker 2>take a tremendous shot,</v>

7425
03:17:46.980 --> 03:17:47.610
<v Speaker 2>flatline,</v>

7426
03:17:47.610 --> 03:17:48.630
<v Speaker 2>toughest shit.</v>

7427
03:17:49.140 --> 03:17:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Flatlined flatline and fight.</v>

7428
03:17:51.421 --> 03:17:53.370
<v Speaker 2>He might've been winning and powerful.</v>

7429
03:17:53.490 --> 03:17:54.241
<v Speaker 2>Rashad here,</v>

7430
03:17:54.241 --> 03:17:55.020
<v Speaker 2>shod looking,</v>

7431
03:17:55.020 --> 03:17:56.370
<v Speaker 2>suave.</v>

7432
03:17:56.520 --> 03:17:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I like your shape to everything.</v>

7433
03:17:57.800 --> 03:17:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

7434
03:17:58.440 --> 03:17:58.951
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

7435
03:17:58.951 --> 03:17:59.910
<v Speaker 2>What he's doing his hair.</v>

7436
03:17:59.911 --> 03:18:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I liked this purple psychedelic Paisley tie.</v>

7437
03:18:02.760 --> 03:18:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Not Mad at the beard.</v>

7438
03:18:04.140 --> 03:18:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I liked the whole look.</v>

7439
03:18:06.330 --> 03:18:07.163
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Smith.</v>

7440
03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:09.330
<v Speaker 2>What's that pin?</v>

7441

<v Speaker 2>We think that Penn is so Porsche pen and I just went to Dick.</v>

7442
03:18:12.090 --> 03:18:12.361
<v Speaker 2>You'd be,</v>

7443
03:18:12.361 --> 03:18:13.650
<v Speaker 2>if you had like a Ferrari pin.</v>

7444
03:18:13.680 --> 03:18:14.550
<v Speaker 2>That's some shit I would do.</v>

7459
03:18:41.130 --> 03:18:41.910
<v Speaker 2>We don't really care.</v>

7460
03:18:41.910 --> 03:18:42.091
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7461
03:18:42.091 --> 03:18:42.570
<v Speaker 2>keep doing it.</v>

7462
03:18:42.570 --> 03:18:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Chocolate bodies.</v>

7463
03:18:43.310 --> 03:18:46.830
<v Speaker 2>We actually don't judge it because it's hilarious and it makes you look better.</v>

7464
03:18:46.890 --> 03:18:47.723
<v Speaker 2>You're right dude.</v>

7465
03:18:47.770 --> 03:18:48.730
<v Speaker 2>It's an advantage.</v>

7466
03:18:48.760 --> 03:18:49.840
<v Speaker 2>Chalk it up bro.</v>

7467
03:18:49.870 --> 03:18:50.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7468
03:18:50.081 --> 03:18:50.710
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

7469
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

7470
03:18:51.280 --> 03:18:51.650
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

7471
03:18:51.650 --> 03:18:53.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you shouldn't be able to do it,</v>

7472
03:18:53.770 --> 03:18:55.570
<v Speaker 2>but I do think all of it's crazy.</v>

7473
03:18:57.690 --> 03:18:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Now I look at it more.</v>

7474
03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it's racist.</v>

7475
03:19:00.850 --> 03:19:02.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it's racist.</v>

7476
03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just trying to look like they're like a black guy.</v>

7477
03:19:06.051 --> 03:19:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Shredded like a black guy,</v>

7478
03:19:07.940 --> 03:19:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Dario.</v>

7479
03:19:08.590 --> 03:19:09.910
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what they're doing.</v>

7480
03:19:09.940 --> 03:19:10.720
<v Speaker 2>And listen,</v>

7481
03:19:10.720 --> 03:19:11.710
<v Speaker 2>it's working for him.</v>

7482
03:19:11.711 --> 03:19:14.770
<v Speaker 2>And John Libby's the new thing highlights credible.</v>

7483
03:19:15.430 --> 03:19:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Well definitely has an impact man.</v>

7484
03:19:16.901 --> 03:19:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're white like paper and try and look jacked on TV and you're</v>

7485
03:19:21.101 --> 03:19:23.800
<v Speaker 2>standing next to a duty when chocolate face and chocolate Bonnie,</v>

7486
03:19:24.070 --> 03:19:25.270
<v Speaker 2>that guy's going to look way darker.</v>

7487
03:19:25.271 --> 03:19:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Who wants to be more chocolate?</v>

7488
03:19:26.281 --> 03:19:29.470
<v Speaker 2>And the only reason why you should go chocolate face is because otherwise it's</v>

7489
03:19:29.471 --> 03:19:30.700
<v Speaker 2>super distracting.</v>

7490
03:19:31.930 --> 03:19:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Cause now you've got to go all now I don't think you're Tan.</v>

7491
03:19:34.361 --> 03:19:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I think you're crazy what's going on.</v>

7492
03:19:36.941 --> 03:19:40.510
<v Speaker 2>But do you have like a suit on like you know,</v>

7493
03:19:40.511 --> 03:19:41.710
<v Speaker 2>like a match it,</v>

7494
03:19:41.740 --> 03:19:45.460
<v Speaker 2>there's some girls who are particularly sexually adventurous and they will,</v>

7495
03:19:45.510 --> 03:19:45.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7496
03:19:45.760 --> 03:19:48.190
<v Speaker 2>even for Halloween parties we'll just paint their tits.</v>

7497
03:19:48.220 --> 03:19:48.661
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

7498
03:19:48.661 --> 03:19:50.230
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing that was going on for a while.</v>

7499
03:19:50.260 --> 03:19:51.790
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy like crazy.</v>

7500
03:19:51.791 --> 03:19:52.520
<v Speaker 2>It was like a loop.</v>

7501
03:19:52.520 --> 03:19:53.353
<v Speaker 2>Crazy hot,</v>

7502
03:19:53.620 --> 03:19:54.310
<v Speaker 2>crazy hot.</v>

7503
03:19:54.310 --> 03:19:57.880
<v Speaker 2>But it was like a loophole where girls could basically be topless at parties</v>

7504
03:19:57.881 --> 03:19:59.050
<v Speaker 2>with paint on her tits.</v>

7505
03:19:59.430 --> 03:20:00.880
<v Speaker 2>You could see their full nipple,</v>

7506
03:20:00.910 --> 03:20:03.100
<v Speaker 2>but it was all heated stars over there.</v>

7507
03:20:03.101 --> 03:20:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Areolas are you watching twitch these days while it's still going on?</v>

7508
03:20:07.960 --> 03:20:08.500
<v Speaker 2>What's twitch?</v>

7509
03:20:08.500 --> 03:20:09.160

7510
03:20:09.160 --> 03:20:10.240
<v Speaker 2>What's going on in twitch?</v>

7511
03:20:10.270 --> 03:20:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what day they changed the rules,</v>

7512
03:20:11.891 --> 03:20:13.540
<v Speaker 2>but the rules got changed sometime.</v>

7513
03:20:13.840 --> 03:20:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Why they changed the rules?</v>

7514
03:20:14.930 --> 03:20:15.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7515
03:20:15.340 --> 03:20:17.500
<v Speaker 2>the other way to let them paint their tits.</v>

7516
03:20:17.740 --> 03:20:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Why not listen?</v>

7517
03:20:18.760 --> 03:20:23.760
<v Speaker 2>If you can wear like some shear skin tight shirt that shows your nipples and I'm</v>

7519
03:20:24.910 --> 03:20:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Why can't a girl painter tits and make some money?</v>

7520
03:20:27.670 --> 03:20:30.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to work at Denny's motherfucker to guy pain his dick and make</v>

7521
03:20:30.761 --> 03:20:31.420
<v Speaker 2>some money?</v>

7522
03:20:31.420 --> 03:20:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The point is they're allowed to do it.</v>

7550
03:20:59.170 --> 03:21:00.700
<v Speaker 2>She's got barbs through those nipples.</v>

7602
03:22:06.020 --> 03:22:06.561
<v Speaker 2>Myself,</v>

7603
03:22:06.561 --> 03:22:07.490
<v Speaker 2>but I play video games,</v>

7604
03:22:07.491 --> 03:22:09.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's expanded over the last,</v>

7605
03:22:09.230 --> 03:22:09.561
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

7606
03:22:09.561 --> 03:22:11.870
<v Speaker 2>a year to two more than video games.</v>

7607
03:22:11.900 --> 03:22:13.040
<v Speaker 2>There's podcast sections,</v>

7608
03:22:13.041 --> 03:22:14.150
<v Speaker 2>there's music sections.</v>

7609
03:22:14.480 --> 03:22:15.950
<v Speaker 2>They tried to do like a comedy section.</v>

7610
03:22:15.951 --> 03:22:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Even they're trying to entice people to do stand up comedy on there.</v>

7611
03:22:19.210 --> 03:22:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7612
03:22:19.370 --> 03:22:20.151
<v Speaker 2>it's a terrible idea,</v>

7613
03:22:20.151 --> 03:22:21.230
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't work.</v>

7614
03:22:22.260 --> 03:22:22.850
<v Speaker 2>But there's tons,</v>

7615
03:22:22.850 --> 03:22:25.190
<v Speaker 2>there's tons more than just video games on there.</v>

7616
03:22:25.191 --> 03:22:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

7617
03:22:25.520 --> 03:22:26.930
<v Speaker 2>When people first started doing podcasts.</v>

7618
03:22:26.931 --> 03:22:30.260
<v Speaker 2>One guy asked me to do as podcasts and then asked me to do stand up.</v>

7619
03:22:30.800 --> 03:22:34.100
<v Speaker 2>They do it the live podcasts he wanted me to do stand up on the podcast.</v>

7620
03:22:34.460 --> 03:22:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

7621
03:22:34.970 --> 03:22:36.110
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

7622
03:22:36.200 --> 03:22:36.441
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

7623
03:22:36.441 --> 03:22:38.420
<v Speaker 2>do you want me to do my act on your show to,</v>

7624
03:22:39.200 --> 03:22:40.790
<v Speaker 2>and then it just gets released on the Internet.</v>

7625
03:22:40.820 --> 03:22:41.653
<v Speaker 2>I just do it that way.</v>

7626
03:22:42.080 --> 03:22:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Instead of just getting paid for comedy central,</v>

7627
03:22:44.660 --> 03:22:45.321
<v Speaker 2>Netflix special,</v>

7628
03:22:45.321 --> 03:22:46.370
<v Speaker 2>like what are you talking about it?</v>

7629
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Why would they do that?</v>

7630
03:22:48.580 --> 03:22:49.311
<v Speaker 2>And you just,</v>

7631
03:22:49.311 --> 03:22:50.240
<v Speaker 2>and you're just going to sell it.</v>

7632
03:22:50.241 --> 03:22:50.840
<v Speaker 2>No idea.</v>

7633
03:22:50.840 --> 03:22:52.630
<v Speaker 2>He just going to sell this podcast to put it out and well,</v>

7634
03:22:52.650 --> 03:22:53.660
<v Speaker 2>how much do I get out of this?</v>

7635
03:22:53.661 --> 03:22:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

7636
03:22:54.170 --> 03:22:54.471
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7637
03:22:54.471 --> 03:22:55.300
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like a good deal.</v>

7638
03:22:55.300 --> 03:22:56.420
<v Speaker 2>My materials out there,</v>

7639
03:22:58.520 --> 03:23:00.590
<v Speaker 2>but that was early days of podcasting.</v>

7640
03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:02.750
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to figure out what the hell it was like,</v>

7641
03:23:02.751 --> 03:23:03.471
<v Speaker 2>what is this thing?</v>

7642
03:23:03.471 --> 03:23:04.280
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

7643
03:23:04.280 --> 03:23:04.361
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

7644
03:23:04.361 --> 03:23:05.300
<v Speaker 2>it's just a joke.</v>

7645
03:23:05.350 --> 03:23:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Is Anybody paying attention?</v>

7646
03:23:06.530 --> 03:23:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Who's watching?</v>

7647
03:23:07.290 --> 03:23:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Little did they know?</v>

7648
03:23:08.260 --> 03:23:08.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7649
03:23:08.401 --> 03:23:08.901
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

7650
03:23:08.901 --> 03:23:09.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7651
03:23:09.140 --> 03:23:12.800
<v Speaker 2>I remember Kevin Smith was one of the first guys who take it seriously because</v>

7652
03:23:12.801 --> 03:23:13.790
<v Speaker 2>he rented a theater.</v>

7653
03:23:13.791 --> 03:23:15.350
<v Speaker 2>He had a theater on Melrose.</v>

7654
03:23:15.890 --> 03:23:16.521
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

7655
03:23:16.521 --> 03:23:17.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

7656
03:23:17.030 --> 03:23:19.640
<v Speaker 2>the smog cast theater and uh,</v>

7657
03:23:19.641 --> 03:23:20.810
<v Speaker 2>we used it once.</v>

7658
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:21.920
<v Speaker 2>I used it once,</v>

7659
03:23:21.921 --> 03:23:23.060
<v Speaker 2>the interview</v>

7660
03:23:24.980 --> 03:23:26.780
<v Speaker 2>was it Tom Green and Jim Norton,</v>

7661
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I think I did two podcasts there.</v>

7662
03:23:29.960 --> 03:23:31.940
<v Speaker 2>I did one with Tom Green and one with Jim Norton.</v>

7663
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.451
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7664
03:23:32.451 --> 03:23:33.200
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting.</v>

7665
03:23:33.200 --> 03:23:33.770
<v Speaker 2>It was cool.</v>

7666
03:23:33.770 --> 03:23:34.603
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

7667
03:23:34.850 --> 03:23:35.511
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting,</v>

7668
03:23:35.511 --> 03:23:36.141
<v Speaker 2>but it's different.</v>

7669
03:23:36.141 --> 03:23:36.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7670
03:23:36.351 --> 03:23:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Doing it live in front of an audience is different.</v>

7671
03:23:38.840 --> 03:23:39.673
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

7672
03:23:40.100 --> 03:23:42.770
<v Speaker 2>do you guys still do live fighter and the kid shows we don't,</v>

7673
03:23:42.980 --> 03:23:43.850
<v Speaker 2>he don't know.</v>

7674
03:23:43.880 --> 03:23:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Too busy with both of your standup.</v>

7675
03:23:45.291 --> 03:23:45.771
<v Speaker 2>Too busy.</v>

7676
03:23:45.771 --> 03:23:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7677
03:23:46.320 --> 03:23:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7678
03:23:46.940 --> 03:23:47.481
<v Speaker 2>Rare.</v>

7679
03:23:47.481 --> 03:23:47.781
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

7680
03:23:47.781 --> 03:23:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I get together live show.</v>

7681
03:23:49.971 --> 03:23:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's good because it means you're both busy.</v>

7682
03:23:52.281 --> 03:23:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's exactly the same thing that happened like me and Joey and uh,</v>

7683
03:23:55.810 --> 03:23:58.280
<v Speaker 2>and even me when me and Ari and me and Dunkin,</v>

7684
03:23:58.281 --> 03:24:00.560
<v Speaker 2>it's like everybody else just got too big.</v>

7685
03:24:00.830 --> 03:24:01.251
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

7686
03:24:01.251 --> 03:24:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Ari's just headline these giant ass places.</v>

7687
03:24:03.681 --> 03:24:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Now when Joey's headline and giant ass places and you know [inaudible] selling</v>

7688
03:24:08.571 --> 03:24:10.910
<v Speaker 2>out everything all across the country.</v>

7689
03:24:11.480 --> 03:24:12.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7690
03:24:12.590 --> 03:24:13.760
<v Speaker 2>It's just how it goes.</v>

7691
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:14.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

7692
03:24:14.360 --> 03:24:15.140
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

7693
03:24:15.140 --> 03:24:16.580
<v Speaker 2>you're doing stuff with people,</v>

7694
03:24:16.581 --> 03:24:20.120
<v Speaker 2>eventually they wind up doing something else and you know,</v>

7695
03:24:20.630 --> 03:24:21.291
<v Speaker 2>I know you,</v>

7696
03:24:21.291 --> 03:24:23.540
<v Speaker 2>you are doing really well with your standup comedy.</v>

7697
03:24:23.780 --> 03:24:24.680
<v Speaker 2>It's probably hard to do.</v>

7698
03:24:24.681 --> 03:24:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Those shows still shows her a different thing.</v>

7699
03:24:26.751 --> 03:24:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7700
03:24:27.200 --> 03:24:29.510
<v Speaker 2>It takes away from what I'm doing,</v>

7701
03:24:29.630 --> 03:24:29.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7702
03:24:29.931 --> 03:24:30.830
<v Speaker 2>like the original goal,</v>

7703
03:24:30.831 --> 03:24:33.590
<v Speaker 2>like if I'm going to dedicate time and stage,</v>

7704
03:24:33.620 --> 03:24:35.330
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be to my right.</v>

7705
03:24:35.600 --> 03:24:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Especially because you kind of have to,</v>

7706
03:24:37.370 --> 03:24:38.330
<v Speaker 2>if you want a headline,</v>

7707
03:24:38.331 --> 03:24:42.810
<v Speaker 2>places keep pumping out new shit and you want to do a special,</v>

7708
03:24:43.190 --> 03:24:45.060
<v Speaker 2>as much as fun as that have with the lifeline,</v>

7709
03:24:45.090 --> 03:24:45.541
<v Speaker 2>the kids,</v>

7710
03:24:45.541 --> 03:24:46.740
<v Speaker 2>it was the exact opposite.</v>

7711
03:24:46.741 --> 03:24:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

7712
03:24:46.970 --> 03:24:47.180
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

7713
03:24:47.180 --> 03:24:50.860
<v Speaker 2>it was just improv and me and Brian Dicken Ram was the time we can,</v>

7714
03:24:50.861 --> 03:24:53.190
<v Speaker 2>I can better than anything at the time with your buddy,</v>

7715
03:24:53.250 --> 03:24:53.461
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7716
03:24:53.461 --> 03:24:54.190
<v Speaker 2>You're not making your,</v>

7717
03:24:54.190 --> 03:24:55.140
<v Speaker 2>your act stronger.</v>

7718
03:24:55.560 --> 03:24:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Piecing up your materials.</v>

7719
03:24:56.700 --> 03:24:57.451
<v Speaker 2>I read the last one.</v>

7720
03:24:57.451 --> 03:25:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I told Brian this what me and him did one at the comedy store.</v>

7721
03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:00.511
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

7722
03:25:00.511 --> 03:25:01.950
<v Speaker 2>like a year at least ago.</v>

7723
03:25:01.951 --> 03:25:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Year and a half maybe we got done.</v>

7724
03:25:03.601 --> 03:25:03.841
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

7725
03:25:03.841 --> 03:25:04.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm done with these dude.</v>

7726
03:25:04.920 --> 03:25:05.753
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

7727
03:25:06.210 --> 03:25:06.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

7728
03:25:06.301 --> 03:25:07.350
<v Speaker 2>you had a weird one,</v>

7729
03:25:07.351 --> 03:25:07.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7730
03:25:07.650 --> 03:25:09.620
<v Speaker 2>It was one of them that came out weird at the comedy store.</v>

7731
03:25:09.621 --> 03:25:11.180
<v Speaker 2>It's just wasn't weird bookie.</v>

7732
03:25:11.280 --> 03:25:12.061
<v Speaker 2>He was clunky.</v>

7733
03:25:12.061 --> 03:25:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7734
03:25:12.320 --> 03:25:12.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7735
03:25:12.541 --> 03:25:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Cause we haven't been together a while and we did that.</v>

7736
03:25:14.461 --> 03:25:14.701
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

7737
03:25:14.701 --> 03:25:15.210
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

7738
03:25:15.210 --> 03:25:17.310
<v Speaker 2>this isn't the best product for you or me.</v>

7739
03:25:17.350 --> 03:25:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7740
03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:18.670
<v Speaker 2>It makes us look bad.</v>

7741
03:25:18.830 --> 03:25:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I can write.</v>

7742
03:25:20.791 --> 03:25:22.800
<v Speaker 2>I think you got to respect what that is.</v>

7743
03:25:22.801 --> 03:25:24.810
<v Speaker 2>If we're going to do like a two man show,</v>

7744
03:25:25.130 --> 03:25:27.720
<v Speaker 2>he got to coordinate the shit out of that requires a lot of work.</v>

7745
03:25:27.730 --> 03:25:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Can't wing it.</v>

7746
03:25:28.740 --> 03:25:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Especially from people going from pain to see you do stand up.</v>

7747
03:25:31.981 --> 03:25:33.000
<v Speaker 2>They see your standard back,</v>

7748
03:25:33.001 --> 03:25:33.690
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

7749
03:25:33.690 --> 03:25:34.740
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is.</v>

7750
03:25:34.741 --> 03:25:36.300
<v Speaker 2>They go from seeing that to that.</v>

7751
03:25:36.480 --> 03:25:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it was hurting the brand or anything.</v>

7752
03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:40.193
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

7753
03:25:40.620 --> 03:25:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7754
03:25:41.240 --> 03:25:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I think Brian agreed to and that,</v>

7755
03:25:42.610 --> 03:25:42.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7756
03:25:42.990 --> 03:25:45.780
<v Speaker 2>but like we did a show together with Ari and big J and that,</v>

7757
03:25:45.781 --> 03:25:46.440
<v Speaker 2>that was fun.</v>

7758
03:25:46.440 --> 03:25:47.273
<v Speaker 2>That was fine.</v>

7759
03:25:48.450 --> 03:25:49.320

7815
03:27:06.661 --> 03:27:09.900
<v Speaker 2>he say that Louis C K he used to treat it like it was a fight.</v>

7816
03:27:09.940 --> 03:27:13.320
<v Speaker 2>You'd go running and get in shape and run like five miles a day.</v>

7817
03:27:13.500 --> 03:27:17.890
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like ramp up like actual physical training to prepare for comedy special</v>

7818
03:27:17.891 --> 03:27:18.691
<v Speaker 2>10 my Diet's,</v>

03:27:18.691 --> 03:27:19.401
<v Speaker 2>I'm sweating now,</v>

7820
03:27:19.401 --> 03:27:20.940
<v Speaker 2>my diet and my workouts.</v>

7821
03:27:21.330 --> 03:27:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7822
03:27:21.690 --> 03:27:23.730
<v Speaker 2>what I learned from this sober October,</v>

7823
03:27:23.790 --> 03:27:25.090
<v Speaker 2>a workout challenge,</v>

7824
03:27:25.140 --> 03:27:30.030
<v Speaker 2>fitness challenges that Ari and Tom and Burt and I did was that when you work</v>

7825
03:27:30.031 --> 03:27:31.230
<v Speaker 2>out a lot like that,</v>

7826
03:27:31.260 --> 03:27:32.820
<v Speaker 2>you do a shit ton of cardio.</v>

7827
03:27:32.880 --> 03:27:34.170
<v Speaker 2>You don't give a fuck.</v>

7828
03:27:34.200 --> 03:27:36.270
<v Speaker 2>You're anxiety is severely,</v>

7829
03:27:36.480 --> 03:27:37.950
<v Speaker 2>severely diminished.</v>

7830
03:27:38.340 --> 03:27:39.570
<v Speaker 2>You feel so good.</v>

7831
03:27:39.750 --> 03:27:41.860
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy when you do a lot cardio</v>

7832
03:27:42.130 --> 03:27:46.750
<v Speaker 1>like I was doing on a normal day at any average day,</v>

7833
03:27:46.751 --> 03:27:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I might be working out three and a half hour too much.</v>

7834
03:27:48.820 --> 03:27:49.480
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

7835
03:27:49.480 --> 03:27:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Crazy too much,</v>

7836
03:27:50.770 --> 03:27:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but it was just for a month,</v>

7837
03:27:52.210 --> 03:27:53.680
<v Speaker 1>but the point was that,</v>

7838
03:27:53.860 --> 03:27:55.500
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think you need to do three and a half hours,</v>

7839
03:27:55.501 --> 03:27:56.800
<v Speaker 1>but you might need to do an hour.</v>

7840
03:27:57.010 --> 03:27:58.660
<v Speaker 1>If you can do an hour of hard cardio,</v>

7841
03:27:58.661 --> 03:28:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't give a fuck.</v>

7842
03:28:00.970 --> 03:28:01.803
<v Speaker 1>That's what I tried to do.</v>

7843
03:28:01.850 --> 03:28:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Shell 60 minutes of hard where I'm burning.</v>

7844
03:28:04.811 --> 03:28:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7845
03:28:05.260 --> 03:28:06.520
<v Speaker 1>800,000 calories.</v>

7846
03:28:06.550 --> 03:28:07.390
<v Speaker 1>That's all you have to do.</v>

7847
03:28:07.450 --> 03:28:07.960
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

7848
03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7849
03:28:08.380 --> 03:28:08.711
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

7850
03:28:08.711 --> 03:28:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I fee.</v>

7851
03:28:09.190 --> 03:28:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I feel really good when I work out like that.</v>

7852
03:28:11.860 --> 03:28:12.551
<v Speaker 1>If I don't,</v>

7853
03:28:12.551 --> 03:28:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I feel like my demeanor,</v>

7854
03:28:13.841 --> 03:28:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as fun.</v>

7855
03:28:14.771 --> 03:28:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm now creative,</v>

7856
03:28:17.140 --> 03:28:18.880
<v Speaker 1>like I don't feel great too though,</v>

7857
03:28:18.881 --> 03:28:20.080
<v Speaker 1>saying that if it was a pill,</v>

7858
03:28:20.320 --> 03:28:24.050
<v Speaker 1>if you give someone a pill and that pill could make me feel like I feel after I</v>

7859
03:28:24.060 --> 03:28:26.050
<v Speaker 1>work out for three and a half hours addicted to it,</v>

7860
03:28:26.100 --> 03:28:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I would take that pill every day.</v>

7861
03:28:27.520 --> 03:28:27.970
<v Speaker 1>That's some,</v>

7862
03:28:27.970 --> 03:28:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck juice called Oxycontin Joe.</v>

7863
03:28:30.251 --> 03:28:30.750
<v Speaker 1>But what it,</v>

7864
03:28:30.750 --> 03:28:31.583
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7865
03:28:31.820 --> 03:28:33.070
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't change who you are.</v>

7866
03:28:33.520 --> 03:28:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get a spelling bee,</v>

7867
03:28:35.231 --> 03:28:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I fuck up the same words account the same.</v>

7868
03:28:38.920 --> 03:28:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And that was the thing was interesting.</v>

7869
03:28:40.421 --> 03:28:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I was worried it was going to negatively affect my podcast because I was</v>

7870
03:28:43.571 --> 03:28:44.800
<v Speaker 1>worried that I'd be too tired.</v>

7871
03:28:45.070 --> 03:28:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I come in here,</v>

7872
03:28:45.640 --> 03:28:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd just be ragdoll and beaten down,</v>

7873
03:28:47.440 --> 03:28:48.273
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't,</v>

7874
03:28:48.420 --> 03:28:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you shed more than energy.</v>

7875
03:28:49.541 --> 03:28:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7876
03:28:49.770 --> 03:28:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of energy.</v>

7877
03:28:50.621 --> 03:28:51.071
<v Speaker 1>Like Jamie,</v>

7878
03:28:51.071 --> 03:28:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't seem like any slower or anything,</v>

7879
03:28:52.841 --> 03:28:53.674
<v Speaker 1>did I?</v>

7880
03:28:54.400 --> 03:28:54.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7881
03:28:54.731 --> 03:28:56.740
<v Speaker 1>it fucks me up and we've talked about this before.</v>

7882
03:28:56.770 --> 03:28:57.220
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

7883
03:28:57.220 --> 03:28:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Fucking yoga classes too.</v>

7884
03:28:59.171 --> 03:29:01.450
<v Speaker 1>And I do a 90 minute yoga class and I come in here,</v>

7885
03:29:01.480 --> 03:29:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I am way more fucked up.</v>

7886
03:29:03.251 --> 03:29:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

7887
03:29:03.820 --> 03:29:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Because that mental energy with that,</v>

7888
03:29:05.680 --> 03:29:06.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that,</v>

7889
03:29:06.731 --> 03:29:07.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like what you're,</v>

7890
03:29:08.080 --> 03:29:12.310
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing to elevate your heart rate is so much more exhausting to your</v>

7891
03:29:12.311 --> 03:29:17.311
<v Speaker 1>muscles than say running for cause you can't hold the yoga path.</v>

7892
03:29:18.360 --> 03:29:21.010
<v Speaker 1>A yoga pose for as long as you can run,</v>

7893
03:29:21.340 --> 03:29:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you can run like for hours and you've been,</v>

7894
03:29:24.641 --> 03:29:25.031
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

7895
03:29:25.031 --> 03:29:27.880
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing and you're going left,</v>

7896
03:29:27.881 --> 03:29:28.241
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

7897
03:29:28.241 --> 03:29:28.541
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

7898
03:29:28.541 --> 03:29:28.900
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7899
03:29:28.900 --> 03:29:31.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just like this steady push,</v>

7900
03:29:31.150 --> 03:29:31.990
<v Speaker 1>relax,</v>

7901
03:29:31.991 --> 03:29:32.400
<v Speaker 1>push,</v>

7902
03:29:32.400 --> 03:29:32.981
<v Speaker 1>relaxing your,</v>

7903
03:29:32.981 --> 03:29:33.520
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

7904
03:29:33.520 --> 03:29:36.280
<v Speaker 1>your legs have like a half a second to recover with each step.</v>

7905
03:29:36.490 --> 03:29:37.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on.</v>

7906
03:29:37.481 --> 03:29:39.280
<v Speaker 1>But it's different because yoga,</v>

7907
03:29:39.281 --> 03:29:40.120
<v Speaker 1>you could never do that.</v>

7908
03:29:40.121 --> 03:29:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're in a yoga pose,</v>

7909
03:29:41.471 --> 03:29:42.071
<v Speaker 1>like you're in,</v>

7910
03:29:42.071 --> 03:29:42.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7911
03:29:42.720 --> 03:29:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7912
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:44.500
<v Speaker 1>triangle pose or something like that.</v>

7913
03:29:44.920 --> 03:29:46.810
<v Speaker 1>How long can you hold that Hoodie?</v>

7914
03:29:46.840 --> 03:29:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Keep Ahold of it minute.</v>

7915
03:29:47.800 --> 03:29:48.251
<v Speaker 1>Can you hold it?</v>

7916
03:29:48.251 --> 03:29:49.084
<v Speaker 1>Five minutes.</v>

7917
03:29:49.210 --> 03:29:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're in fucking tremendous shape and you could do the bow pose where you</v>

7918
03:29:53.411 --> 03:29:56.080
<v Speaker 1>hold your foot and you put it over behind you and you have,</v>

7919
03:29:56.440 --> 03:30:00.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could do that for five minutes if you were in fucking Chad.</v>

7920
03:30:00.510 --> 03:30:01.331
<v Speaker 1>Tremendous,</v>

7921
03:30:01.331 --> 03:30:02.350
<v Speaker 1>tremendous shape.</v>

7922
03:30:02.770 --> 03:30:03.251
<v Speaker 1>But damn,</v>

7923
03:30:03.251 --> 03:30:04.630
<v Speaker 1>that is hard to do.</v>

7924
03:30:04.990 --> 03:30:06.160
<v Speaker 1>What does that Jamie scorecards,</v>

7925
03:30:06.250 --> 03:30:07.750
<v Speaker 1>everyone had Korean Zombie up.</v>

7926
03:30:08.670 --> 03:30:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7927
03:30:09.310 --> 03:30:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Set for one gut sit for one judge or one judge had even going in.</v>

7928
03:30:14.380 --> 03:30:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Other judges had green on every card.</v>

7929
03:30:18.190 --> 03:30:19.023
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

7930
03:30:19.150 --> 03:30:20.010
<v Speaker 1>So someone at two,</v>

7931
03:30:20.020 --> 03:30:21.100
<v Speaker 1>two others at three.</v>

7932
03:30:21.101 --> 03:30:21.881
<v Speaker 1>One three,</v>

7933
03:30:21.881 --> 03:30:22.241
<v Speaker 1>one three,</v>

7934
03:30:22.241 --> 03:30:22.421
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

7935
03:30:22.421 --> 03:30:22.571
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

7936
03:30:22.571 --> 03:30:23.230
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

7937
03:30:23.230 --> 03:30:24.063
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

7938
03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:24.903
<v Speaker 1>What a KL.</v>

7939
03:30:25.090 --> 03:30:26.370
<v Speaker 1>What Amazing Cook Kale.</v>

7940
03:30:26.570 --> 03:30:27.130
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

7941
03:30:27.130 --> 03:30:27.461
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

7942
03:30:27.461 --> 03:30:28.420
<v Speaker 1>let's wrap this bitch up.</v>

7943
03:30:28.450 --> 03:30:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Everybody out there being affected by the fires.</v>

7944
03:30:30.311 --> 03:30:33.190
<v Speaker 1>We genuinely and sincerely hope you and your family are safe.</v>

7945
03:30:33.310 --> 03:30:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7946
03:30:33.880 --> 03:30:34.121
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

7947
03:30:34.121 --> 03:30:36.130
<v Speaker 1>it sucks if you lose your place,</v>

7948
03:30:36.131 --> 03:30:36.821
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

7949
03:30:36.821 --> 03:30:38.380
<v Speaker 1>it's way worse if you're dead.</v>

7950
03:30:39.110 --> 03:30:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7951
03:30:39.500 --> 03:30:42.470
<v Speaker 1>what's positive is your friends and your family and your loved ones.</v>

7952
03:30:42.471 --> 03:30:43.760
<v Speaker 1>And that means a lot to me right now.</v>

7953
03:30:43.761 --> 03:30:46.610
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking about it even though I'm evacuated and uh,</v>

7954
03:30:46.611 --> 03:30:47.121
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure,</v>

7955
03:30:47.121 --> 03:30:47.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7956
03:30:47.870 --> 03:30:48.261
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

7957
03:30:48.261 --> 03:30:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I already know people that for sure have lost their houses,</v>

7958
03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:52.160
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

7959
03:30:52.190 --> 03:30:53.420
<v Speaker 1>we'd feel a whole lot worse.</v>

7960
03:30:53.420 --> 03:30:54.253
<v Speaker 1>We lost them,</v>

7961
03:30:54.410 --> 03:30:54.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7962
03:30:54.651 --> 03:30:55.550
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to deal with.</v>

7963
03:30:55.580 --> 03:30:56.300
<v Speaker 1>It's rough.</v>

7964
03:30:56.300 --> 03:30:57.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing,</v>

7965
03:30:57.440 --> 03:31:01.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a humbling reminder of where we are and that nature is a thing to</v>

7966
03:31:01.941 --> 03:31:03.530
<v Speaker 1>be respected and feared.</v>

7967
03:31:03.920 --> 03:31:05.300
<v Speaker 1>And when fire gets out of hand,</v>

7968
03:31:05.570 --> 03:31:08.510
<v Speaker 1>there's some serious fucking consequences and I don't know what solutions there</v>

7969
03:31:08.511 --> 03:31:10.520
<v Speaker 1>are to fixing something like this,</v>

7970
03:31:10.760 --> 03:31:15.760
<v Speaker 1>but I think if there was a an invading army that came here and did the kind of</v>

7971
03:31:16.251 --> 03:31:18.890
<v Speaker 1>damage and devastation that these forest fires have done,</v>

7972
03:31:18.920 --> 03:31:22.430
<v Speaker 1>there would be some serious steps to protect us against that army.</v>

7973
03:31:22.730 --> 03:31:27.260
<v Speaker 1>If there is a profit to be made and figuring out how to protect people from this</v>

7974
03:31:27.261 --> 03:31:31.280
<v Speaker 1>kind of fucking horrendous fire like well I don't know what it would be.</v>

7975
03:31:31.281 --> 03:31:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what would be hiring way more firefighters or putting way more</v>

7976
03:31:35.391 --> 03:31:37.280
<v Speaker 1>precautions in place or,</v>

7977
03:31:37.281 --> 03:31:42.281
<v Speaker 1>or hiring people and Donald Trump creating new jobs to clear all this dead wood</v>

7978
03:31:42.951 --> 03:31:44.260
<v Speaker 1>and the in the forest and,</v>

7979
03:31:44.530 --> 03:31:49.190
<v Speaker 1>and to figure out some way to get to the scene quicker and have flights that are</v>

7980
03:31:49.191 --> 03:31:52.220
<v Speaker 1>ready on standby filled with water at all times.</v>

7981
03:31:52.220 --> 03:31:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck it would be,</v>

7982
03:31:53.900 --> 03:31:58.900
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that these things when they get out of hand like this,</v>

7983
03:32:00.200 --> 03:32:03.620
<v Speaker 1>leave people unusually helpless.</v>

7984
03:32:04.010 --> 03:32:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Like we're oftentimes help us to nature.</v>

7985
03:32:06.650 --> 03:32:07.071
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

7986
03:32:07.071 --> 03:32:10.850
<v Speaker 1>this is one of those unusually helpless moments where it makes you really</v>

7987
03:32:10.851 --> 03:32:13.640
<v Speaker 1>understand how dangerous fire is and,</v>

7988
03:32:13.641 --> 03:32:14.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7989
03:32:14.450 --> 03:32:17.630
<v Speaker 1>nothing but love and respect out there for all the firefighters and first</v>

7990
03:32:17.631 --> 03:32:19.970
<v Speaker 1>responders and all these people that are taking care of people.</v>

7991
03:32:19.971 --> 03:32:20.380
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

7992
03:32:20.380 --> 03:32:21.660
