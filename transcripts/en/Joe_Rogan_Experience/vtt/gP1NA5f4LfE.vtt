00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Four three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Peter.</v>

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Hello Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on man?</v>

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>A whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were just telling me something that</v>

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most ridiculous things</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard.</v>

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>That you swam from Maui to Lanai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>And you're the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only humans ever do that.</v>

8
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I am told I was the first person to swim</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Maui to when I am back.</v>

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>The one way is a pretty famous swim race</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's done every year.</v>

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>You're the first person to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The round.</v>

11
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Dude.</v>

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long have you got it started when I</v>

13
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>was a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told me I couldn't do it.</v>

14
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>What made you want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a ridiculous proposition.</v>

15
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got into,</v>

16
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I decided in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to sound silly.</v>

17
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I read a book in January of 2004 about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman named Penny Dean,</v>

18
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>who still to this day holds the record</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the fastest crossing of the Catalina</v>

19
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Channel.</v>

20
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>So it was for me from Catalina Island to</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Pedro or or a to a not you typically</v>

21
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:11.541
<v Speaker 1>swimming to point point [inaudible] and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had done it in like seven hours and</v>

22
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

23
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I far as a crow flies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 21 miles with the currents.</v>

24
00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a little longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

25
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really want to do this.</v>

26
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

27
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I got to learn how to swim first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems that's three miles an hour</v>

28
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is a phenom.</v>

29
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Penny Dean had a stroke rate of 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>strokes per minute,</v>

30
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>which I mean that might not mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to someone who doesn't swim,</v>

31
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>but like to turn to have a hand hit the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water every,</v>

32
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third of it.</v>

33
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Two thirds of a second is a remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

34
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't hold a cadence of that for a</v>

35
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>hundred yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

36
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>And she did it for 20 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>What a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's out of control.</v>

38
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>There's certain people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

39
00:01:57.981 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>it freaked me out I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think marathon's swimming might be one</v>

40
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>sport where if you just look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

41
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>I think women are better than men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's that woman who swam from</v>

42
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Cuba to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

43
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 1>She was the first person ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diana,</v>

44
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Diane and she didn't she do it like at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly advanced age.</v>

45
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's of course got an amazing</v>

46
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>pedigree of swimming and this wasn't her</v>
<v Speaker 1>first Rodeo.</v>

47
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.351
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

48
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

49
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>why do you think women are better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>men?</v>

50
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those of us that,</v>

51
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a member of this community</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

52
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>but when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of our favorite topics of</v>

53
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a thing,</v>

54
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>opportunities or ideas that were put</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth were higher pain tolerance.</v>

55
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Something about being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.520
<v Speaker 1>evolving to be able to give birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>just means they can tolerate pain a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>

58
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think another thing I've heard is</v>

59
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>buoyancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>women are naturally going to have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>body fat,</v>

61
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>which provides insulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do these swims,</v>

62
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed any wetsuits or aids</v>
<v Speaker 1>of any sort.</v>

63
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>So shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

64
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>you're in a speedo and single latex cap</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>

65
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.770
<v Speaker 1>And so if you can have a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think women's hips because</v>

66
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have more fat on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hips,</v>

67
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.701
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

68
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>it corrects one of the big buoyancy</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that we have in swimming.</v>

69
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>We didn't evolve to swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're horrible at it naturally because</v>

70
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>we swim like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We drag our hips through the water.</v>

71
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about the importance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>aerodynamics in most of the things that</v>

72
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>we think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be archery or race,</v>

73
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>car driving or cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>in water it's that much more important</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the density of water is,</v>

75
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of times greater than air.</v>

76
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>So swimming is just a hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>about avoiding drag.</v>

77
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that totally makes sense.</v>

78
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have been fascinated forever with</v>

79
00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:48.620
<v Speaker 2>people that are capable of pushing their</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain to do things that other people</v>

80
00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:50.300
<v Speaker 2>just don't think are possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>

81
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big foot,</v>

82
00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:54.320
<v Speaker 2>200 race or like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of those things.</v>

83
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:58.760
<v Speaker 2>But the swim one is particularly crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't stop.</v>

84
00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.601
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

85
00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're running an ultra marathon and</v>

86
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.370
<v Speaker 2>you just want to sit down for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and just take a break,</v>

87
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.800
<v Speaker 2>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're swimming,</v>

88
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.320
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a damn thing you could do.</v>

89
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.540
<v Speaker 2>You could tread water is about as good</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it gets,</v>

90
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.840
<v Speaker 2>but you can't touch the boat or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kayak or it's an immediate</v>

91
00:04:14.841 --> 00:04:17.420
<v Speaker 2>disqualification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

92
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.230
<v Speaker 2>that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mat.</v>

93
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.840
<v Speaker 2>That is such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

94
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.160
<v Speaker 2>So you heard about this woman doing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I read</v>

95
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.170
<v Speaker 1>this book and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really want to do this.</v>

96
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>At the time I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

97
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.420
<v Speaker 1>I was actually in my residency in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baltimore and I was like,</v>

98
00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really want to do this and I don't</v>

99
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.920
<v Speaker 1>have to learn how to swim to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started taking swimming lessons and</v>

100
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:39.600
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

101
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.580
<v Speaker 1>let me to make it very long story short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically by about the summer of 2005,</v>

102
00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I entered my first swim race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a two mile swim race in Lake</v>

103
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.273
<v Speaker 1>Restin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virginia.</v>

104
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And I did it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

105
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:56.460
<v Speaker 1>I just swam two miles in the open water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

106
00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:57.960
<v Speaker 1>it was hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

107
00:04:57.961 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the proof of concept.</v>

108
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you just got to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it 2025 miles.</v>

109
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.150
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just,</v>

110
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went completely psycho and ratcheted up</v>

111
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:10.500
<v Speaker 1>the training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

112
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.410
<v Speaker 1>and then in October of 2005 I did my</v>
<v Speaker 1>first catalina swim.</v>

113
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be a pretty good feeling</v>

114
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:25.220
<v Speaker 2>though when you're done that you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of pushing yourself to what most</v>

115
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:27.080
<v Speaker 2>people think is an impossible distance.</v>

116
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

117
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:30.450
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked a moment ago,</v>

118
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:33.270
<v Speaker 1>why do you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that in life,</v>

119
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>velocity means very little acceleration</v>

120
00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:38.880
<v Speaker 1>means everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do I mean by that?</v>

121
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going 650 miles an hour</v>

122
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:43.740
<v Speaker 1>in an airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't actually feel it.</v>

123
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.490
<v Speaker 1>You only feel when speed changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

124
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.140
<v Speaker 1>So I've always had this theory that</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally that's also true.</v>

125
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Like happiness is only interesting when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's juxtaposed with sadness.</v>

126
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And so the feeling of crawling on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shore after you've been swimming for 12</v>

127
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 1>to 14 hours is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what makes it especially amazing is</v>

128
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>that six hours earlier you thought you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to die.</v>

129
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>So you start these swims in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the night to avoid the shipping</v>

130
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that first swim boat drops you off at</v>

131
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Catalina island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's midnight.</v>

132
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't imagine like you can't even</v>

133
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>see la from Catalina.</v>

134
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>You have to swim for six hours before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you even see the lights of Las Angeles.</v>

135
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

136
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.340
<v Speaker 1>What do you see the stars and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phospho like bioluminescent organisms in</v>

137
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

138
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Just incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

139
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 1>That's worth the price of admission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time your hand comes through</v>

140
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pulling and ripping these little</v>

141
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>things and you're seeing the sparks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell where the water ends in</v>

142
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 1>the sky starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

143
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:56.690
<v Speaker 1>the stars and the bio luminescence looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one cylinder.</v>

144
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the first few hours,</v>

145
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

146
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first swim,</v>

147
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>the water was incredibly rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 1>I had only swim in the ocean for two</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks before the swim.</v>

149
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 1>I did all my training in a swimming</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool,</v>

150
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Speaker 1>so in a lake on the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I look,</v>

151
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't used to how to keep the</v>
<v Speaker 1>saltwater out of my mouth.</v>

152
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.290
<v Speaker 1>So then I was like puking my guts out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then my,</v>

153
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you were swimming?</v>

154
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

155
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because at work you just stop and</v>

156
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>puke and then keep swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

157
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then my tongue started to get really</v>

158
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>swollen from the saltwater because</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

159
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 1>as I would learn later on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go on to do many more of these</v>

160
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 1>swims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I learned is the importance of</v>

161
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 1>spitting in the water out of your mouth</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

162
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>So in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a freshwater pool or lake,</v>

163
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 1>you get away with more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the ocean you swallow that salt</v>

164
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get sick as hell.</v>

165
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 1>So all this stuff's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by five in the morning,</v>

166
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>you've been swimming for five hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting cold.</v>

167
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

168
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

169
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:05.130
<v Speaker 1>just physiologically like your cortisol</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels are at a nadir,</v>

170
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel horrible.</v>

171
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really bad feeling and you're not</v>

172
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>even halfway there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like you don't know if you can</v>

173
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:12.781
<v Speaker 1>do it and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

174
00:08:12.781 --> 00:08:13.001
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

175
00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

176
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 1>if six hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're now crawling out of the water</v>

177
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:18.740
<v Speaker 1>feeling like you've done this amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

178
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.420
<v Speaker 1>that that's emotional acceleration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the greatest contrast.</v>

179
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.450
<v Speaker 1>I know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never experienced that.</v>

180
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:27.760
<v Speaker 1>But I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

181
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>explaining the other day to a friend of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine about this,</v>

182
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>a camping trip that we went on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana when it was like nine degrees</v>

183
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was freezing cold.</v>

184
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>We stayed out there for five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six days.</v>

185
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 1>And then when we finally got to a hotel</v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

186
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>I took a shower and it was the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing shower I've ever experienced in</v>

187
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:46.330
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a small thing,</v>

188
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>but you take a shower every day and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a big deal when you do it in that</v>

189
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:51.400
<v Speaker 1>setting or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or think about the,</v>

190
00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>the meal you've had if you've been fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar situation.</v>

191
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're starving or lost at sea.</v>

192
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

193
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine.</v>

194
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now that you've done,</v>

195
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>and how many of these have you done</v>
<v Speaker 1>these crazy?</v>

196
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>He swim races or swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call them several.</v>

197
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually these major,</v>

198
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:10.700
<v Speaker 1>major ones are not racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

199
00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

200
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>you go to the Federation that oversees</v>
<v Speaker 1>that body of water and you say,</v>

201
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do this.</v>

202
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:19.640
<v Speaker 1>you go through all the channels to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

204
00:09:19.641 --> 00:09:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Like they have to have an observer there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

205
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.590
<v Speaker 1>you follow these official rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be registered as someone was</v>

206
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.730
<v Speaker 1>actually completed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

207
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>And someone's there to make sure you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

208
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it correctly.</v>

209
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

210
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I probably done all in probably like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozen of these,</v>

211
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 1>but probably like six of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really long ones.</v>

212
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 1>What's the longest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

213
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does the Mallee one was 20 miles</v>

214
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>there and back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 40 miles miles total.</v>

215
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>The maui channel is a 10 mile channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So round trip is 20.</v>

216
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.540
<v Speaker 1>The bigger question is time in the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you rarely get to swim these in</v>

217
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:56.730
<v Speaker 1>a straight line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Maui Lanai one,</v>

218
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to go Maui Lanai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Molokai,</v>

219
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Maui to do the triangle and that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been 30 miles as a crow flies.</v>

220
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 1>But we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 1>boat captain wasn't willing to do it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>night because of the tiger sharps.</v>

222
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.050
<v Speaker 1>And during the daytime we couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically figure out how one could</v>

223
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 1>suffer against those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wind,</v>

224
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.380
<v Speaker 1>cause the wind gets so brutal in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the day.</v>

225
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 1>So even the one that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was just a there and back,</v>

226
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I ended up swimming for 12 hours because</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

227
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first way crossing where there was</v>

228
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:35.061
<v Speaker 1>no wind took me four hours and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>took eight hours to get back because I</v>

229
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:38.190
<v Speaker 1>was swimming like the hypotenuse of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>triangle,</v>

230
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:38.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

231
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Like the current's going this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had to swim this way just to go in</v>

232
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:46.530
<v Speaker 1>a straight line and I still can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost missed Maui,</v>

233
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I almost got swept out to Molokai</v>

234
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 1>just because the current was about 1.7</v>
<v Speaker 1>knots,</v>

235
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.850
<v Speaker 1>which is about as fast as I can swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe two knots.</v>

236
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a ridiculous thing,</v>

237
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:03.540
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing this?</v>

238
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:04.374
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

239
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.790
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this maniacal?</v>

240
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it anymore.</v>

241
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was certainly a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an amazing season in my life,</v>

242
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:15.771
<v Speaker 1>but I think once my daughter was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was 10 years ago this summer,</v>

243
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 1>that's when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only probably did two of these after</v>

244
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:25.140
<v Speaker 1>she was born because then the training</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got,</v>

245
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to live in the water if you want</v>

246
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 1>to do this sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you got to including the winter,</v>

247
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

248
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in San Diego where I live,</v>

249
00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:35.350
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.740
<v Speaker 1>55 degrees in the water and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to spend three,</v>

251
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:41.400
<v Speaker 1>four hours a day in the water freezing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.660
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>

253
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have the,</v>

254
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drive to spend 25 hours a week</v>

255
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:48.474
<v Speaker 1>swimming.</v>

256
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the,</v>

257
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 1>what was going on in San Diego when that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy got bitten half by a shark</v>

258
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 3>couple of years back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were training for something.</v>

259
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny you remember that.</v>

260
00:11:58.741 --> 00:12:02.370
<v Speaker 1>That was may of 2008 I remember that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was yesterday.</v>

261
00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:06.480
<v Speaker 1>So at the time I lived in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually just before I swim,</v>

262
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.220
<v Speaker 1>the Maui thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that I think about it,</v>

263
00:12:08.221 --> 00:12:09.990
<v Speaker 1>that was 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swim the Maui thing in,</v>

264
00:12:09.991 --> 00:12:12.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>June of oh six but June of,</v>

265
00:12:12.261 --> 00:12:14.820
<v Speaker 1>oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm doing all my training in a</v>

266
00:12:14.821 --> 00:12:19.770
<v Speaker 1>swimming pool up in San Francisco</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want to acclimate to</v>

267
00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:22.740
<v Speaker 1>very cold water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually want to be in warm water,</v>

268
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.100
<v Speaker 1>but I needed one long ocean swim of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 or 15 miles as my last training swim.</v>

269
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.000
<v Speaker 1>So I came down to San Diego to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just by bad luck,</v>

270
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I came down a few days after that guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>was killed.</v>

271
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a,</v>

272
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.790
<v Speaker 1>a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know him,</v>

273
00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:42.480
<v Speaker 1>but he was a triathlete training with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>triathlon group that they would go out</v>

274
00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:45.510
<v Speaker 1>and swim every morning and I know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beach exactly where it happened in</v>

275
00:12:45.511 --> 00:12:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Solana beach.</v>

276
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:47.790
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

277
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.130
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most people who get attacked by</v>

278
00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:51.690
<v Speaker 1>great whites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a very,</v>

279
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.180
<v Speaker 1>they always attack the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is below and behind stealth bite</v>

280
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.630
<v Speaker 1>up and then they retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying to basically enjoy the</v>

281
00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:03.570
<v Speaker 1>praise so that their prey exsanguinate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they take off and then they</v>

282
00:13:03.571 --> 00:13:07.290
<v Speaker 1>wait until you bleed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they never saw the shark.</v>

283
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.570
<v Speaker 1>But you could tell from the bite marks</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

284
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually had a friend who was on the</v>

285
00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:17.091
<v Speaker 1>beach and saw him when he came out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was basically dead when he got to</v>

286
00:13:17.191 --> 00:13:18.000
<v Speaker 1>shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>

287
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.680
<v Speaker 1>he had bled to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

288
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 1>so in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shark had bitten and cut through his</v>

289
00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:26.280
<v Speaker 1>femoral arteries and veins and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>saltwater prevents you from having any</v>

290
00:13:26.281 --> 00:13:29.400
<v Speaker 1>hemostasis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it exacerbates the blood loss.</v>

291
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's generally how folks parish</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're out of the water.</v>

292
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.430
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other swimmers came to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>rescue.</v>

294
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.090
<v Speaker 1>And Luckily that commotion prevents the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharks from wanting to come back.</v>

295
00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.760
<v Speaker 1>So three days later I go out and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming at that beach because I swam</v>

296
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:50.850
<v Speaker 1>from my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my training swim was La Jolla up to</v>

297
00:13:50.851 --> 00:13:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Solana beach and back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got to tell you like three days</v>

298
00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:58.500
<v Speaker 1>after a guy dies where you're swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

299
00:13:58.501 --> 00:14:00.510
<v Speaker 1>it was about one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

300
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.830
<v Speaker 1>mentally challenging training swims to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

301
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.540
<v Speaker 1>cause you can't see like the water at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of the beach is so murky,</v>

302
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're only a couple of hundred</v>

303
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.180
<v Speaker 1>yards off shore that like you can barely</v>
<v Speaker 1>see your hands when you're swimming.</v>

304
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're just thinking this the</v>

305
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.943
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

306
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

307
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't see why.</v>

308
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just something about sharks too.</v>

309
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

310
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 3>one of the most terrifying thing for</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's first of all were so inept in the</v>

311
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:34.871
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

312
00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 3>even a person like you is a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>swimmer.</v>

313
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:37.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

314
00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:38.740
<v Speaker 3>we're a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

315
00:14:38.741 --> 00:14:41.260
<v Speaker 3>What we are in comparison to what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

316
00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:44.440
<v Speaker 3>It's just you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're throwing yourself into the world</v>

317
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.640
<v Speaker 3>of a super predator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to know that one just jacked a</v>

318
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:50.920
<v Speaker 3>person just a few days before and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there swimming.</v>

319
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I will say this,</v>

320
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's all said and done,</v>

321
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 1>all of the close encounters I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the scariest moment I've ever</v>

322
00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 1>had in the water was doing a swim from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Rosa to Santa Barbara.</v>

323
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:06.140
<v Speaker 1>So Santa Rosa Island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the second furthest North</v>

324
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Channel Island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got San Miguel,</v>

325
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Santa Rosa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Cruz,</v>

326
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 1>and Anacapa represent the top four</v>
<v Speaker 1>channel islands.</v>

327
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.170
<v Speaker 1>So we did this November swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a nighttime thing.</v>

328
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming from Santa Rosa Island to Santa</v>

329
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

330
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.700
<v Speaker 1>at about five in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe six in the morning,</v>

331
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:25.910
<v Speaker 1>you're just starting to get enough light</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can see and you're out there.</v>

332
00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:30.911
<v Speaker 1>So you really have amazing visibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked down probably 40 feet and I</v>

333
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:37.361
<v Speaker 1>see this enormous thing swimming like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

334
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 1>which is how sharks swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see the dorsal fin and the</v>

335
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 1>position that freaks me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the tails this way.</v>

336
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.560
<v Speaker 1>But all of that is shark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

337
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 1>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.170
<v Speaker 1>like lift up out of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of hyperventilate for a second.</v>

339
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 1>And I'm thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

340
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:55.070
<v Speaker 1>you got to make a judgment call here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's really a great white,</v>

341
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:56.630
<v Speaker 1>you probably ought to get out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

342
00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment you are out of the water,</v>

343
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The swim was over.</v>

344
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you just spent like months doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

345
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:06.560
<v Speaker 1>like it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I convinced myself,</v>

346
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:08.990
<v Speaker 1>and I think I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a dolphin on its side</v>

347
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.700
<v Speaker 1>because a dolphin on its side with its</v>
<v Speaker 1>fin would get stale.</v>

348
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Fin would be the same way and it could</v>
<v Speaker 1>swim that way.</v>

349
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 1>So in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kept swimming.</v>

350
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:18.530
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that scared the shit out of me.</v>

351
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have seen quite a few of them off</v>

352
00:16:20.571 --> 00:16:22.330
<v Speaker 1>the coast of Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

353
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:23.061
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's tons.</v>

354
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 1>There's no question they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are way more plentiful than we</v>

355
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:29.480
<v Speaker 1>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all you can do is talk to the</v>

356
00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 1>fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the fishermen will tell you,</v>

357
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.420
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like off core and auto.</v>

358
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like nonstop great whites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

359
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.663
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

360
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Why are you freaking me out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news is they see us all the</v>

361
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:47.630
<v Speaker 1>time and most of the time they realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not what they want.</v>

362
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.930
<v Speaker 1>They want seals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

363
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.790
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

364
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.590
<v Speaker 1>whenever they attack us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making a mistake.</v>

365
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Now is there a s like a suit you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear your Kevlar suit to protect,</v>

366
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.220
<v Speaker 1>protects you from getting bitten in</v>
<v Speaker 1>half?</v>

367
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is so funny.</v>

368
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 1>You bring this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became obsessed with this thing called</v>

369
00:17:03.891 --> 00:17:04.724
<v Speaker 1>the uh</v>

370
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.340
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it called?</v>

371
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

372
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put the thing on your ankle.</v>

373
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Like you had like a little velcro thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd wrap it on your ankle and had a</v>

374
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:14.810
<v Speaker 1>tail like this long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:17:14.811 --> 00:17:19.811
<v Speaker 1>like four foot long thing and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>charged and it sends out an electrical</v>

376
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:24.440
<v Speaker 1>impulse that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbs the shit out of the sharks.</v>

377
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:28.220
<v Speaker 1>The sharks knows is an Oregon that</v>
<v Speaker 1>census electricity.</v>

378
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.790
<v Speaker 1>So when a shark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it could be pitch black,</v>

379
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 1>it could be salt water and they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>still scope you ma,</v>

380
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from hundreds of yards away based on the</v>

381
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>electrical activity of your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that Oregon is their nose.</v>

382
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:41.930
<v Speaker 1>So this little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what it was called,</v>

383
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:46.750
<v Speaker 1>like the Shark Taser or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It puts out a signal that like tazes</v>

384
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 1>them and they don't want to get within</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

385
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 1>oh there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James caught up here,</v>

386
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:55.430
<v Speaker 2>the world's first shark deterrent band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the shark bands worn on the</v>

387
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:57.480
<v Speaker 2>wrist or ankle it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

388
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 2>I thought it had a different name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because the one that I was going to</v>

389
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:04.860
<v Speaker 2>get and did a ton of research into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a really long tail hanging off it</v>

390
00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:09.210
<v Speaker 2>and that became the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's uses patented magnetic technology</v>

391
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 2>to repel sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the tail was a problem because of the</v>

392
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:12.960
<v Speaker 2>drag?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

393
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 2>because it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds silly,</v>

394
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:16.800
<v Speaker 2>but it would come up and zap you in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuts.</v>

395
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 2>So you'd be so they became unbearable to</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice swimming in this thing.</v>

396
00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're like every 37 seconds you'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>get zapped by the tail.</v>

397
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just like,</v>

398
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:31.850
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like how it says reduced the risk.</v>

399
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:32.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

400
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:33.960
<v Speaker 2>can I get some numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please</v>

401
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.600
<v Speaker 2>tell I went to see a reduced by how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>fy one,</v>

402
00:18:39.601 --> 00:18:40.500
<v Speaker 2>7%.</v>

403
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it also is a leash for your</v>

404
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:47.910
<v Speaker 2>surfboard too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can use one of those,</v>

405
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.050
<v Speaker 2>the trap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tier,</v>

406
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.220
<v Speaker 2>a strapped to your ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

407
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

408
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 2>it's going to come to me like in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

409
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll remember what this silly thing was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

410
00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:57.873
<v Speaker 2>You'll probably find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

411
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.320
<v Speaker 2>off of Catalina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's one of the best shark</v>

412
00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:05.040
<v Speaker 2>fishing places in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend of mine who told me that</v>

413
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.910
<v Speaker 2>if you think about like wild places on</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth that are just overrun with</v>

414
00:19:08.911 --> 00:19:13.290
<v Speaker 2>predators and terrifying like Predator</v>
<v Speaker 2>prey activity.</v>

415
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Catalina island is one of the top spots</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

416
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

417
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you man,</v>

418
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.630
<v Speaker 2>the shark fishing off Catalina Island is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking insane.</v>

419
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 2>And then I watched a television show</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

420
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>synchronicity a couple of days later and</v>

421
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.070
<v Speaker 2>it was these guys shark fishing off of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catalina.</v>

422
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck?</v>

423
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I could have never guessed the catching</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makos mostly.</v>

424
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually my recollection</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we swam around Catalina ones as</v>

425
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The backside is way more aggressive than</v>

426
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:49.170
<v Speaker 2>the front side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The side that faces the Pacific side</v>

427
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:51.300
<v Speaker 2>they'd rather than face as Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

428
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.970
<v Speaker 2>there's way more crazy stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

429
00:19:52.971 --> 00:19:54.780
<v Speaker 2>I think that's exactly where they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

430
00:19:54.781 --> 00:19:57.600
<v Speaker 2>It looked pretty nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were bringing in these 15</v>

431
00:19:57.601 --> 00:19:58.950
<v Speaker 2>foot sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like,</v>

432
00:19:58.951 --> 00:20:01.740
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are just floating around out</v>

433
00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:03.360
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

434
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.710
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

435
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I guess of course they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

436
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of fish out there as well,</v>

437
00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 2>so I'm sure they Adelina is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty crazy.</v>

438
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:13.880
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>

439
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 2>I'd swim to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd swam from it.</v>

440
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.270
<v Speaker 2>I just want him around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd done the only thing and I'd never</v>

441
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:21.930
<v Speaker 2>stepped foot on it except at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning or end of a swim until five</v>

442
00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:22.290
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

443
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I went there for a vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like actually just went to avalon for</v>

444
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three days.</v>

445
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a place I could live.</v>

446
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a little too quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for three or four days.</v>

447
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.930
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people hunt on Catalina.</v>

448
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.480
<v Speaker 2>They've got huge buffalo there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

449
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so apparently there was a movie that was</v>

450
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:43.630
<v Speaker 2>made there back in the 20s or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

451
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Let a bunch of Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a bunch of Buffalo.</v>

452
00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the movie and I guess they never</v>

453
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.890
<v Speaker 2>liked to corral or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She shits is totally overrun with</v>

454
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there was one of the channel</v>

455
00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 2>islands that they had actually turned</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a bow hunting destination.</v>

456
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Like they had brought in a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>

457
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I think they brought in stags and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of weird exotic shit and they put</v>

458
00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:05.410
<v Speaker 2>him on this island.</v>

459
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I think they even had elk and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologists just weren't having it.</v>

460
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just so out of whack.</v>

461
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 2>And so they had them eradicated and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way they do that is it's pretty</v>

462
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 2>gruesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just gunned down from the air and</v>

463
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:21.760
<v Speaker 2>just leave the bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

464
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.850
<v Speaker 2>They just decided that they were to</v>
<v Speaker 2>invasive species regardless of how</v>

465
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.700
<v Speaker 2>valuable they might have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two people that wanted to go there and</v>

466
00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:28.810
<v Speaker 2>eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:31.780
<v Speaker 2>they just decided just for the ecosystem</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone,</v>

468
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.000
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's no predators there and they</v>

469
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:37.780
<v Speaker 2>weren't going to turn the fucking island</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wild kingdom and bring wolves or</v>

470
00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:40.240
<v Speaker 2>something in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be pretty God damn crazy.</v>

471
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if there was an island you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just had wolves and elk running</v>

472
00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:45.970
<v Speaker 2>around an island just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

473
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:47.260
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surprised that we'd gotten them</v>

474
00:21:47.261 --> 00:21:47.680
<v Speaker 2>all down.</v>

475
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.320
<v Speaker 2>At least say make it open season for</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting or something like that.</v>

476
00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:51.640
<v Speaker 2>They could have been productive about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

477
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.850
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting perspective.</v>

478
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Cell Biologists look at it in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire ecosystem,</v>

479
00:21:58.871 --> 00:22:00.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look at in terms of the plants,</v>

480
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.050
<v Speaker 2>the amount of waste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fecal waste,</v>

481
00:22:04.051 --> 00:22:06.580
<v Speaker 2>if these animals are leaving behind the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that they're,</v>

482
00:22:06.581 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 2>they're literally eating everything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can on the sound.</v>

483
00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 2>They're not supposed to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they're competing with whatever</v>

484
00:22:13.871 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 2>things are native to that island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

485
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.380
<v Speaker 2>And probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

486
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.840
<v Speaker 2>you've kind of thousand pound elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not supposed to be on a fucking</v>

487
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 2>island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing's just eating everything it</v>

488
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:25.390
<v Speaker 2>can and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a winter either.</v>

489
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're just not supposed to be.</v>

490
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.980
<v Speaker 2>The channel islands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islands</v>

491
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.440
<v Speaker 1>themselves are kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

492
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.850
<v Speaker 1>most people know of Catalina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

493
00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:35.280
<v Speaker 1>there's eight of them and now two of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

494
00:22:35.281 --> 00:22:37.930
<v Speaker 1>you can't step foot on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's allowed to,</v>

495
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Clemente and San Nicolas through</v>

496
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.220
<v Speaker 1>military basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we tried to do a swim from San</v>

497
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Nicolas back to Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a relay swim because it's like</v>

498
00:22:46.921 --> 00:22:51.921
<v Speaker 1>an 85 mile swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I spent like six months researching</v>

499
00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.630
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking to a bunch of naval officers.</v>

500
00:22:54.631 --> 00:22:55.081
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

501
00:22:55.081 --> 00:22:58.420
<v Speaker 1>is there any way we can cause you</v>
<v Speaker 1>officially to have to start a swim,</v>

502
00:22:58.421 --> 00:23:01.080
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to touch dry land</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be out of the water.</v>

503
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:01.921
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

504
00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:04.050
<v Speaker 1>you can't come on the island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the end,</v>

505
00:23:04.051 --> 00:23:06.450
<v Speaker 1>what we decided was we were just going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a stealth landing,</v>

506
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time they came down and screamed</v>

507
00:23:08.941 --> 00:23:11.010
<v Speaker 1>at us and shot at us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have been off the island.</v>

508
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.413
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

509
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.850
<v Speaker 1>then we got to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the other big thing I've been</v>

510
00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:15.361
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nick,</v>

511
00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:18.240
<v Speaker 1>is that's real shark territory because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the elephant seals live.</v>

512
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.730
<v Speaker 1>And so when we got out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we literally could not get to shore</v>

513
00:23:23.731 --> 00:23:26.070
<v Speaker 1>because of the elephant seals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're,</v>

514
00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:29.260
<v Speaker 1>we're 200 yards off sand neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

515
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.770
<v Speaker 1>this is after I'd taken a full two days</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out there.</v>

516
00:23:31.771 --> 00:23:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place is really hard to get to</v>

517
00:23:33.361 --> 00:23:35.490
<v Speaker 1>because the water is brutal and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in a huge boat.</v>

518
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:36.863
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

519
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at like thousand pound</v>

520
00:23:39.061 --> 00:23:41.220
<v Speaker 1>elephant seals that are just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>licking their chops,</v>

521
00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:42.630
<v Speaker 1>looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get in the water.</v>

522
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 1>What would they do with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to find out,</v>

523
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Speaker 2>but they're not predatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

524
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think they're aggressive is</v>

525
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that video of the little</v>

526
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:56.840
<v Speaker 2>girl that's sitting on a dock and a seal</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumps up and grabs her in the ass and</v>

527
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 2>pulled her under the water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see that Jamie?</v>

528
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't think that seals ever did</v>

529
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:03.440
<v Speaker 2>something like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

530
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.370
<v Speaker 2>I did see a special once about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins could be kind of aggressive</v>

531
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.140
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they could harm,</v>

532
00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:11.750
<v Speaker 2>you know Lou,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

533
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.190
<v Speaker 2>the seal is sitting there and this girl</v>
<v Speaker 2>see line actually look at this.</v>

534
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.440
<v Speaker 2>It comes up and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

535
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.340
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was probably looking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a handout and these people weren't</v>

536
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:29.340
<v Speaker 2>giving it to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

537
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.360
<v Speaker 2>And then she turns her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

538
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that thing.</v>

539
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be right back.</v>

540
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Fill that fucking puddle with led.</v>

541
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.260
<v Speaker 2>That was fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

542
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 2>They jumped up fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

543
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:52.820
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're predators.</v>

544
00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eat things.</v>

545
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 19 plants in the water,</v>

546
00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.420
<v Speaker 2>they're eating fish and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

547
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.800
<v Speaker 2>whatever they can get ahold of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably birds and stuff too.</v>

548
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.240
<v Speaker 2>They're probably used to scoop and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things up,</v>

549
00:25:02.241 --> 00:25:06.410
<v Speaker 2>but I bet that what that's from is them</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting to acclimated to people.</v>

550
00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feeding them.</v>

551
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.793
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

552
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

553
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.400
<v Speaker 2>they have an issue in boulder where</v>
<v Speaker 2>boulder is a,</v>

554
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.310
<v Speaker 2>if you're been Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

555
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

556
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gorgeous.</v>

557
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Super Liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as progressive as it gets.</v>

558
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever been to San Francisco?</v>

559
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

560
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think boulder is right up there,</v>

561
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.070
<v Speaker 2>but there's less people in there that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

562
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.310
<v Speaker 2>everyone's real healthy and active and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hiking and stuff like that.</v>

563
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:39.760
<v Speaker 2>They don't allow hunting for mountain</v>
<v Speaker 2>goats on the weekends because there's so</v>

564
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:43.220
<v Speaker 2>many people hiking and going.</v>

565
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.250
<v Speaker 2>They don't want people killing these</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain goats in front of them because</v>

566
00:25:46.251 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 2>people freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though they have decided that they</v>

567
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:52.820
<v Speaker 2>have to control the population and kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain number of them to keep the,</v>

568
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:58.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so many people go out there that</v>

569
00:25:58.701 --> 00:26:02.780
<v Speaker 2>these things aren't scared of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's created this really weird</v>

570
00:26:02.781 --> 00:26:06.830
<v Speaker 2>situation where if you are hunting them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

571
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.890
<v Speaker 2>you're almost hunting something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>domesticated.</v>

572
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.820
<v Speaker 2>People feed them cheetos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much so that a friend of mine was</v>

573
00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:17.210
<v Speaker 2>talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was up there with his daughter.</v>

574
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:22.220
<v Speaker 2>His daughter opened up a bag of cheetos</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the goat walked right to a wild</v>

575
00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:23.750
<v Speaker 2>goat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives out in the fucking woods,</v>

576
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.740
<v Speaker 2>walked right up to his daughter and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were laughing.</v>

577
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:31.280
<v Speaker 2>She opened up the bag of cheetos and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and he stuffed his head in the bag of</v>

578
00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:31.640
<v Speaker 2>cheetos.</v>

579
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.150
<v Speaker 2>He knew what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's in this guy who was talking</v>

580
00:26:35.151 --> 00:26:40.151
<v Speaker 2>about this is a hunter and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking goat has like cheeto dust</v>

581
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:42.620
<v Speaker 2>all over its face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the craziest thing.</v>

582
00:26:42.621 --> 00:26:45.450
<v Speaker 2>It's face is all red with a cheeto dust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's sitting there chewing these</v>

583
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:48.620
<v Speaker 2>cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's done it before and it's just</v>

584
00:26:48.621 --> 00:26:51.660
<v Speaker 2>read that goat had diabetes I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably eventually,</v>

585
00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

586
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I was in Costa Rica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is another similar situation and we</v>

587
00:26:56.491 --> 00:27:01.491
<v Speaker 2>were staying at this four seasons out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and the monkeys have gotten very</v>

588
00:27:02.161 --> 00:27:04.800
<v Speaker 2>accustomed to people being there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

589
00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come by and they hang out and they</v>

590
00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:10.410
<v Speaker 2>were like trying to get things from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

591
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:14.790
<v Speaker 2>my daughter opened up a package oreos</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the monkey just jumped onto this</v>

592
00:27:14.791 --> 00:27:16.680
<v Speaker 2>little ledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a couple feet away from her.</v>

593
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.660
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my wife was like,</v>

594
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think it's a good idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we feed this thing oreos.</v>

595
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

596
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably going to get eaten by a</v>

597
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:25.980
<v Speaker 2>fucking crocodile anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

598
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 2>it's going to food poisoning it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're thinking?</v>

599
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to eat this every day.</v>

600
00:27:30.841 --> 00:27:32.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be a normal part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>its diet.</v>

601
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:37.730
<v Speaker 2>But we hand the monkey and Oreo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it pops open the Oreo and starts chewing</v>

602
00:27:37.981 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 2>on the frosting like a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we're like,</v>

603
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.570
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little fucker probably gets these</v>

604
00:27:42.571 --> 00:27:43.920
<v Speaker 2>things every week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

605
00:27:43.921 --> 00:27:47.010
<v Speaker 2>so it begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does he know how to do that?</v>

606
00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Because he's watched some human do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we innately wired to do that with</v>

607
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Oreos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

608
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.330
<v Speaker 2>I think he knows how to do it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's giving them Oreos so many</v>

609
00:27:57.331 --> 00:27:59.460
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he knows that the good stuff,</v>

610
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.020
<v Speaker 2>the good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mental,</v>

611
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 2>they should just sell that at a pace.</v>

612
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.933
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be good.</v>

613
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.310
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the middle is only good because</v>

614
00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can contrast it with the,</v>

615
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:11.910
<v Speaker 2>it comes back to the contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

616
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.271
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

617
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're really right.</v>

618
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just pure middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be pretty gross.</v>

619
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 2>If they probably sold pure middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody would buy it,</v>

620
00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 2>but if they sold those black cookies by</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

621
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:22.110
<v Speaker 2>no one by those fucking gross things</v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

622
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Like should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

623
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.230
<v Speaker 2>This gets worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cookies like those key,</v>

624
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.530
<v Speaker 2>what'd you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The white stuff.</v>

625
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:29.101
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

626
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll eat this stupid ass black cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a sunk cost and Cole cookie.</v>

627
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a little monkey doing it.</v>

628
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they grab it from you and they just</v>

629
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:38.880
<v Speaker 2>fucking love o worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

630
00:28:38.881 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Speaker 2>they look at him opening up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately open it up and start chewing</v>

631
00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:43.074
<v Speaker 2>that white stuff.</v>

632
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

633
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:47.880
<v Speaker 2>And we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

634
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing that is called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Monday.</v>

635
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

636
00:28:55.170 --> 00:29:00.170
<v Speaker 2>it's related to the raccoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this weird animal that lives mostly</v>

637
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:05.211
<v Speaker 2>in central and South America and it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>a northern range that extends into</v>

638
00:29:05.521 --> 00:29:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Arizona all the way up into Mesa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

639
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it gets into the areas where it</v>

640
00:29:10.261 --> 00:29:13.650
<v Speaker 2>gets cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Arizona I think is the only state in</v>

641
00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:17.850
<v Speaker 2>the u s that has it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's this weird looking monkey</v>

642
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:22.500
<v Speaker 2>raccoon thing that is so domesticated</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we gave it some grapes.</v>

643
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gave it some grapes and this little</v>

644
00:29:27.481 --> 00:29:28.350
<v Speaker 2>fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

645
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that weird little thing.</v>

646
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:31.650
<v Speaker 2>It came and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat,</v>

647
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.610
<v Speaker 2>we had like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a patio area in the hotel room and he</v>

648
00:29:35.611 --> 00:29:40.611
<v Speaker 2>came and sat down with us and so calm</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it sat and went underneath one of</v>

649
00:29:41.351 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>the chairs.</v>

650
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.260
<v Speaker 2>And took a nap after we gave it some</v>
<v Speaker 2>grapes,</v>

651
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.330
<v Speaker 2>like while we're hanging around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughters are running around making</v>

652
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.600
<v Speaker 2>noise and this thing's just chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a pet.</v>

653
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 2>It was a total pet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a total pet.</v>

654
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There they are.</v>

655
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.740
<v Speaker 2>They're cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird looking things.</v>

656
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.860
<v Speaker 2>People eat them apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they hunt them in Arizona.</v>

657
00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.510
<v Speaker 2>He's eating Nachos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

658
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean after seeing this as just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I can hunt that.</v>

659
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to be pretty hungry to eat one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those.</v>

660
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 2>They're so cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little face,</v>

661
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:18.040
<v Speaker 2>weird little animal man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting.</v>

662
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our relationship with animals is very</v>

663
00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:23.050
<v Speaker 2>odd when they get into close proximity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

664
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

665
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.420
<v Speaker 2>we've got a wicked coyote problem and</v>
<v Speaker 2>San Diego and at least in the part I</v>

666
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:31.300
<v Speaker 2>live in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just one of those things once we</v>

667
00:30:31.301 --> 00:30:34.270
<v Speaker 2>got rid of mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody wants mountain lions</v>

668
00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:36.340
<v Speaker 2>around the coyotes running a muck.</v>

669
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

670
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was talking to a friend of mine</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this the other day actually,</v>

671
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.300
<v Speaker 2>and he was saying that there's probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>only like in our neighborhood there's</v>

672
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:47.560
<v Speaker 2>probably only like two mountain lions</v>
<v Speaker 2>left and the,</v>

673
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:52.090
<v Speaker 2>the coyotes just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've exploded there.</v>

674
00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.720
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of them around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't really bother me that</v>

675
00:30:55.721 --> 00:30:57.370
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could kind of like listening to</v>

676
00:30:57.371 --> 00:30:59.650
<v Speaker 2>them howl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

677
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.630
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they get into your chicken coop.</v>

678
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one killed chickens just a few</v>

679
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:05.041
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

680
00:31:05.041 --> 00:31:08.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a got video of a dead chicken.</v>

681
00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:10.630
<v Speaker 2>It's such a bummer man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We chase it away.</v>

682
00:31:10.631 --> 00:31:14.350
<v Speaker 2>It was on the roof of the chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way they jump,</v>

683
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.140
<v Speaker 2>it's so stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're so graceful.</v>

684
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Like I've never seen anything that moves</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that in the wild.</v>

685
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.340
<v Speaker 2>The way it coyote does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

686
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.960
<v Speaker 2>there was a six foot fence.</v>

687
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.560
<v Speaker 2>It's on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It jumps to the top of the six foot</v>

688
00:31:29.561 --> 00:31:30.810
<v Speaker 2>fence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like it's,</v>

689
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:35.050
<v Speaker 2>it's under different gravity rules than</v>
<v Speaker 2>us and touches the top of the fence and</v>

690
00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:36.790
<v Speaker 2>then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on the top of the chicken coop.</v>

691
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean in like a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I haven't seen that.</v>

692
00:31:39.971 --> 00:31:40.960
<v Speaker 2>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

693
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have video of one of them jumping my</v>

694
00:31:43.271 --> 00:31:44.560
<v Speaker 2>fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

695
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.570
<v Speaker 2>I caught one of them with a chicken in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mouth,</v>

696
00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:48.940
<v Speaker 2>jumping the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped the six foot fence with a chicken</v>

697
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:50.740
<v Speaker 2>in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just jump point,</v>

698
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.040
<v Speaker 2>touch the top of the fence with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>front paws back.</v>

699
00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Paws went over right behind it and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was gone.</v>

700
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.150
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

701
00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.370
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

702
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.460
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need them.</v>

703
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.250
<v Speaker 2>We need them to kill the rabbits and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rats.</v>

704
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:04.990
<v Speaker 2>And if we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd have a giant,</v>

705
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:06.520
<v Speaker 2>like here's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I tell my daughter,</v>

706
00:32:06.521 --> 00:32:09.040
<v Speaker 2>cause she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she like gets all stressed out that</v>

707
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:10.840
<v Speaker 2>there's coyotes and around walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around her house.</v>

708
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.890
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well first of all,</v>

709
00:32:11.891 --> 00:32:13.720
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty skittish of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And boy,</v>

710
00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:15.820
<v Speaker 2>they keep those roads under control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really do.</v>

711
00:32:15.821 --> 00:32:19.120
<v Speaker 2>You need them for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a coyote problem across the</v>

712
00:32:19.121 --> 00:32:21.160
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the only animal that's in every</v>

713
00:32:21.161 --> 00:32:23.770
<v Speaker 2>single state in every single city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

714
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.180
<v Speaker 2>every single city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

715
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:28.940
<v Speaker 2>there's coyotes in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

716
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bullshitting in the park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've found them in the park.</v>

717
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.640
<v Speaker 2>They found them in the bronx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found them in abandoned buildings.</v>

718
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great book I read called</v>

719
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 2>America by a past guests of the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Flores.</v>

720
00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.370
<v Speaker 2>He's a a wildlife historian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's fascinating.</v>

721
00:32:46.371 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 2>There are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really unusual animal in that.</v>

722
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:52.700
<v Speaker 2>When you shoot one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they yell out,</v>

723
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:54.740
<v Speaker 2>here's this wizards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coyotes in New York City.</v>

724
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Look at this in fucking New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

725
00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.470
<v Speaker 2>she hit in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York City Police Department.</v>

726
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Coyote running down the street.</v>

727
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're everywhere,</v>

728
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:04.400
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

729
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.140
<v Speaker 2>they have a real problem with them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago.</v>

730
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.840
<v Speaker 2>I thought I could escape them when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York.</v>

731
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't escape them anywhere.</v>

732
00:33:10.671 --> 00:33:14.180
<v Speaker 2>They're in all 50 states now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've completely extended the range.</v>

733
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.420
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why they extended their</v>
<v Speaker 2>range is because we,</v>

734
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.790
<v Speaker 2>we went after them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hunted them down.</v>

735
00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were able to eradicate wolves and</v>

736
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:27.341
<v Speaker 2>the way they were able to eradicate</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves is they would kill the Alpha and</v>

737
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:29.870
<v Speaker 2>then they would take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an animal like a horse,</v>

738
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.080
<v Speaker 2>they would shoot it and then they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill it up with strict nine.</v>

739
00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.700
<v Speaker 2>And so then they would rub the Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body of the Alpha all over this,</v>

740
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.090
<v Speaker 2>this carcass of the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other wolves would come and</v>

741
00:33:41.091 --> 00:33:44.870
<v Speaker 2>smell that the Alpha had been there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they would eat the wolf or eat the</v>

742
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.460
<v Speaker 2>horse rather and die.</v>

743
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.720
<v Speaker 2>And so they were able to do this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially use this method plus</v>

744
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.900
<v Speaker 2>shooting them and things like that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eradicate them from the west.</v>

745
00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Because of ranchers and cattle farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never been able to do that with</v>

746
00:33:58.341 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 2>coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you shoot a coyote,</v>

747
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.350
<v Speaker 2>if they do roll call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you hear them howling,</v>

748
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:07.010
<v Speaker 2>if one of them is missing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sends the females,</v>

749
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.820
<v Speaker 2>it sends some sort of a signal where</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bodies produce more pups.</v>

750
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.600
<v Speaker 2>So if ones missing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of having like three pups,</v>

751
00:34:14.601 --> 00:34:18.070
<v Speaker 2>she'll have six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you make more coyotes when you kill</v>

752
00:34:18.071 --> 00:34:20.630
<v Speaker 2>them and they extend the range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you persecute them,</v>

753
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:22.620
<v Speaker 2>they just extend their range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

754
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.520
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking crazy animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are wicked smart man.</v>

755
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:27.740
<v Speaker 2>They've been chewing at the roof of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken coop,</v>

756
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 2>trying to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came outside the other night,</v>

757
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.810
<v Speaker 2>my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>

758
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.960
<v Speaker 2>I have three dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of them is a golden retriever</v>

759
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.750
<v Speaker 2>and that dog has fucking zero instincts.</v>

760
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is just,</v>

761
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a little human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

762
00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:45.110
<v Speaker 2>it's like a little marshmallow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>

763
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

770

<v Speaker 2>One job to do.</v>

771
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Speaker 2>He'll bark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not interested.</v>

772

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Kirk said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

811
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 2>you gotta meet my friend Jocko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically it's just like you guys,</v>

812
00:36:37.711 --> 00:36:40.050
<v Speaker 2>you just gotta meet Jocko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to experience Jocko.</v>

813
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.330
<v Speaker 2>That was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a ride.</v>

814
00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

815
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.030
<v Speaker 2>so I'm at Jocko,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we obviously connected pretty quickly.</v>

816
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.430
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

817
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

818
00:36:52.051 --> 00:36:57.051
<v Speaker 2>this was before Jockos book had come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his first first book had come out and I</v>

819
00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:59.460
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to introduce you to one of my best</v>

820
00:36:59.461 --> 00:37:00.390
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Guy Tim Ferriss,</v>

821
00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:01.141
<v Speaker 2>who I'm obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

822
00:37:01.141 --> 00:37:01.974
<v Speaker 2>tim.</v>

823
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.750
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause Tim's always looking for,</v>

824
00:37:03.751 --> 00:37:05.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great guest on a podcast.</v>

825
00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:07.710
<v Speaker 2>And so I called Tim and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

826
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.130
<v Speaker 2>you got to just trust me on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sight unseen.</v>

827
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Just have Jocko come to San Francisco</v>
<v Speaker 2>next week.</v>

828
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Just I don't need to say anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be worth it.</v>

829
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:19.830
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>luckily I had enough credit in the bank</v>

830
00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:20.664
<v Speaker 2>with Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd done it.</v>

831
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I'd been successful on enough sight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unseen recommendations,</v>

832
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:26.310
<v Speaker 2>but I think the Jocko when was the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>one ever,</v>

833
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:29.850
<v Speaker 2>because he called me after he called me</v>
<v Speaker 2>while Jocko was still there and he's</v>

834
00:37:29.851 --> 00:37:31.080
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

835
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.340
<v Speaker 2>that was pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

836
00:37:32.341 --> 00:37:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I send them an email after that podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my,</v>

837
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.230
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the best podcasts I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever heard in my life and I made a post</v>

838
00:37:37.231 --> 00:37:39.930
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chaco responded to the post and then I</v>

839
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:43.830
<v Speaker 2>got Jocko on and then I end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim convinced Jocko to do his own</v>

840
00:37:43.831 --> 00:37:44.170
<v Speaker 2>podcasts.</v>

841
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now it's huge.</v>

842
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his podcast,</v>

843
00:37:46.621 --> 00:37:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I get text messages all the time from</v>
<v Speaker 2>people thanking me for telling them to</v>

844
00:37:51.451 --> 00:37:53.640
<v Speaker 2>listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I get tweets from people</v>

845
00:37:53.641 --> 00:37:58.360
<v Speaker 2>thanking me for talking Jocko in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it because it's just this app.</v>

846
00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

847
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.960
<v Speaker 2>there's outliers in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

848
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in everything.</v>

849
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.160
<v Speaker 2>There's outliers in athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's out.</v>

850
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:08.520
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to like discipline and</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation and just,</v>

851
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:12.330
<v Speaker 2>just when you look at someone who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just undeniable,</v>

852
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.780
<v Speaker 2>like Jocko is one of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just undeniable.</v>

853
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:17.310
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a specimen.</v>

854
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:21.330
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the graph.</v>

855
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd met him a long time ago when,</v>

856
00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:26.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was training with Dean lister and</v>

857
00:38:26.191 --> 00:38:29.760
<v Speaker 2>dean was fighting in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember meeting him and I'm like,</v>

858
00:38:29.761 --> 00:38:34.260
<v Speaker 2>what's that guy's deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certain dudes that have got that whole</v>

859
00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 2>lot of shit going on behind their eyes.</v>

860
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.341
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

861
00:38:37.341 --> 00:38:39.480
<v Speaker 1>guys seen some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

862
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you.</v>

863
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a funny Jocko story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I,</v>

864
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess I can tell this story in public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty funny.</v>

865
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.910
<v Speaker 1>So Jocko was in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

866
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:53.500
<v Speaker 1>after his book came out and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this and I was like,</v>

867
00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:53.881
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

868
00:38:53.881 --> 00:38:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I want to juice you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of my,</v>

869
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.560
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my buddies who run hedge funds here,</v>

870
00:38:56.561 --> 00:38:58.600
<v Speaker 1>because some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what Jocko does is they,</v>

871
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and his partner,</v>

872
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.320
<v Speaker 1>they consult with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with guys like this doing leadership</v>

873
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:05.650
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we went up to the offices of one</v>

874
00:39:05.651 --> 00:39:08.980
<v Speaker 1>of my friends who has this very famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>hedge fund.</v>

875
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:11.290
<v Speaker 1>And his office is like on the 50th floor</v>
<v Speaker 1>on park.</v>

876
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:14.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a beautiful view down park and</v>

877
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're just sitting there in his</v>

878
00:39:15.371 --> 00:39:16.660
<v Speaker 1>office just shooting the shit.</v>

879
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 1>And I forget how it came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow,</v>

880
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about like,</v>

881
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.780
<v Speaker 1>like how good is a sniper?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what does it actually take?</v>

882
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

883
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.520
<v Speaker 1>and then of course we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking very specifically about,</v>

884
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm blanking on his</v>

885
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:33.064
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

886
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the Bradley Cooper played him in.</v>

887
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kyle were talking cause cause</v>

888
00:39:39.971 --> 00:39:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kyle had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

889
00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 1>part of Jockos uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

890
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget which seal team,</v>

891
00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was he when he was seal team</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

892
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.453
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

893
00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Jocko said,</v>

894
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:50.891
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

895
00:39:50.891 --> 00:39:53.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris was a part of my team for more of</v>

896
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:57.300
<v Speaker 1>his kills than any of his other kills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then we were like,</v>

897
00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.530
<v Speaker 1>like what sets him apart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

898
00:39:59.531 --> 00:40:02.380
<v Speaker 1>obviously any snow navy seal sniper has</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta be amazing.</v>

899
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.510
<v Speaker 1>But Chris took it to another level.</v>

900
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>

901
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

902
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:07.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you what it was.</v>

903
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.810
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we walked us over to the window and he</v>

904
00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:11.644
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

905
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.030
<v Speaker 1>you see that guy in that hat over there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like about a mile down the,</v>

906
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can basically see it cause we're</v>

907
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.150
<v Speaker 1>like a pink hat or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

908
00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:19.871
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

909
00:40:19.871 --> 00:40:21.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a sniper,</v>

910
00:40:21.641 --> 00:40:25.750
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be able to lay down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not move and put your eye up against</v>

911
00:40:25.751 --> 00:40:29.890
<v Speaker 1>this thing and like look out at him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

912
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.610
<v Speaker 1>if you ever take your eye off that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lose the sight.</v>

913
00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:36.110
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta be able to stay in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>position and I'm moving to it.</v>

914
00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.690
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what the number was,</v>

915
00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:42.460
<v Speaker 1>but Jocko said the average navy seal</v>
<v Speaker 1>sniper can stay in that position without</v>

916
00:40:42.461 --> 00:40:45.820
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I glued to the site for x number of</v>

917
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:47.080
<v Speaker 1>minutes and I forgot what the number</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

918
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was like 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

919
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Chris could do that for two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could lay in that position,</v>

920
00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:59.610
<v Speaker 1>not moving and not taking his eye off</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing with one eye shut for hours</v>

921
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:01.631
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

922
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:03.580
<v Speaker 1>he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just had a different,</v>

923
00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:07.570
<v Speaker 1>he just had a different gear and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just an amazing,</v>

924
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are some of my favorite</v>

925
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.730
<v Speaker 1>moments with Jocko is when he like can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you something that is like,</v>

926
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:16.840
<v Speaker 1>like they're like maybe three people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world that would understand why that</v>

927
00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:17.710
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

928
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.500
<v Speaker 1>sniping is fat is really fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

929
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Because just sharp shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being able to shoot something at a</v>

930
00:41:24.011 --> 00:41:27.340
<v Speaker 1>distance and long distance shooting is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

931
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.870
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big sport.</v>

932
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of target shooting,</v>

933
00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's guys that are out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're shooting 1500 yards</v>

934
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 3>and doing it competitively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy distance.</v>

935
00:41:37.731 --> 00:41:39.140
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy distance.</v>

936
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.620
<v Speaker 3>But when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got a rifle,</v>

937
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.020
<v Speaker 3>it's on arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting,</v>

938
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:47.810
<v Speaker 3>you're either on a bench or you're prone</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it is.</v>

939
00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:50.960
<v Speaker 3>You're lying down most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all it is.</v>

940
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.880
<v Speaker 3>It's this with your finger pull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>

941
00:41:52.881 --> 00:41:53.571
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>

942
00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:54.404
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

943
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.500
<v Speaker 3>Some people are way better at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just think of that coordinating your</v>

944
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:03.140
<v Speaker 3>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting the radical set on the target,</v>

945
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:08.420
<v Speaker 3>polling that and without movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The outliers are the people who can do</v>

946
00:42:08.421 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've got to think like when you,</v>

947
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.560
<v Speaker 3>when you break down physical movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

948
00:42:12.561 --> 00:42:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Like he watched gymnastics routine in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Olympics,</v>

949
00:42:15.351 --> 00:42:19.670
<v Speaker 3>like holy shit and it flips and the land</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they stick and it's incredible.</v>

950
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 3>But now break it down to just the</v>
<v Speaker 3>movement of your trigger finger,</v>

951
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.251
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>

952
00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:25.911
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>

953
00:42:25.911 --> 00:42:27.070
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>play,</v>

954
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:28.303
<v Speaker 3>no movement.</v>

955
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:29.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

956
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've shot guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard to like if you shoot</v>

957
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.680
<v Speaker 3>pistols and you have dummy rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

958
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:39.660
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people and they mix in</v>
<v Speaker 3>dummy rounds so that they find out that</v>

959
00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 3>they're a jerk and a trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you see,</v>

960
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:44.810
<v Speaker 3>like I was watching a video with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

961
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Tim Kennedy and Tim Kennedy was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting at the range and he's,</v>

962
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.180
<v Speaker 3>he's pulling bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

963
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it goes click.</v>

964
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:52.940
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo,</v>

965
00:42:52.941 --> 00:42:55.220
<v Speaker 3>look at that trigger control like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it was,</v>

966
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.780
<v Speaker 3>he put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he pulled it,</v>

967
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.540
<v Speaker 3>it didn't go off target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't move.</v>

968
00:42:59.541 --> 00:43:01.520
<v Speaker 3>It was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no punch to it,</v>

969
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you gotta fucking practice for</v>

970
00:43:04.401 --> 00:43:09.401
<v Speaker 3>forever just to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to not anticipate the recoil of the</v>

971
00:43:09.531 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Speaker 3>gun and Yank and move and twitch and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just controlling the mind.</v>

972
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:16.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fascinating thing to me that</v>

973
00:43:16.101 --> 00:43:18.770
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just pulling this one thing or you would</v>

974
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:21.110
<v Speaker 3>think fucking anybody could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can show you how to do that.</v>

975
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:22.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

976
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.220
<v Speaker 3>like I've had friends that say they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go hunting.</v>

977
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:25.941
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

978
00:43:25.941 --> 00:43:27.030
<v Speaker 3>I want to go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

979
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:28.280
<v Speaker 3>what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do I get a boat?</v>

980
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow down.</v>

981
00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Let's get your rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I could teach you how to shoot a</v>

982
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:34.490
<v Speaker 3>rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could,</v>

983
00:43:34.491 --> 00:43:36.570
<v Speaker 3>we could get someone that we could cite</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your rifle,</v>

984
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.960
<v Speaker 3>go to the range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll cite it in under a hundred yards,</v>

985
00:43:38.961 --> 00:43:43.190
<v Speaker 3>get ya a good accurate rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all you have to do is kind of</v>

986
00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 3>keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A rifle,</v>

987
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.540
<v Speaker 3>we get into a hundred yards of a wild</v>
<v Speaker 3>pig,</v>

988
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.950
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be able to kill this</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing 100% you got years before you're</v>

989
00:43:51.951 --> 00:43:53.330
<v Speaker 3>gonna be able to shoot that thing with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bow.</v>

990
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:54.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking years.</v>

991
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 3>First of all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the bow is like,</v>

992
00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.590
<v Speaker 3>my wife said this to me awhile ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

993
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 3>of all the things you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

994
00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.460
<v Speaker 3>archery seems to be the only one where</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't have a good day,</v>

995
00:44:07.461 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 3>you're still happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I,</v>

996
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm on the race track and I'm driving</v>

997
00:44:11.871 --> 00:44:13.430
<v Speaker 3>a race car or if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

998
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.920
<v Speaker 3>swimming or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just have a bad day,</v>

999
00:44:15.921 --> 00:44:17.840
<v Speaker 3>like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not firing on all cylinders</v>

1000
00:44:17.841 --> 00:44:18.674
<v Speaker 3>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1001
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:20.270
<v Speaker 3>just kind of pisses me off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1002
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 3>There's something about archery where</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if I'm not having a good day,</v>

1003
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:26.390
<v Speaker 3>like</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's an extension of what you're</v>

1004
00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:28.460
<v Speaker 3>talking about with the trigger finger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>

1005
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 3>I got an artery because of tim and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>story</v>

1006
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.570
<v Speaker 1>that the thing that he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which obviously for anyone who has,</v>

1007
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that he told me that</v>

1008
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 1>immediately made me be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do this.</v>

1009
00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:42.660
<v Speaker 1>It was just anything that requires that</v>
<v Speaker 1>much perfection just seems great.</v>

1010
00:44:42.661 --> 00:44:43.890
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1011
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:45.660
<v Speaker 1>you don't take a shot unless you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the animal.</v>

1012
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1013
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.870
<v Speaker 1>And so like you might take one shot in</v>
<v Speaker 1>two days,</v>

1014
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.490
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be a kill shot and the kill</v>

1015
00:44:50.491 --> 00:44:51.660
<v Speaker 1>shots got to look like x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>y,</v>

1016
00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:52.230
<v Speaker 1>and Z.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1017
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like you gotta be dialed in.</v>

1018
00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:58.860
<v Speaker 1>So it was this idea of back tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1019
00:44:58.861 --> 00:45:00.300
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1020
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:03.880
<v Speaker 1>you're taking a perfect shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's all in the Rhomboids,</v>

1021
00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all back here and you've got to be</v>

1022
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:07.410
<v Speaker 1>able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

1023
00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:11.520
<v Speaker 1>you've got to completely be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate any anticipation,</v>

1024
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.840
<v Speaker 1>any of this business.</v>

1025
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that,</v>

1026
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I think of archery for me is almost like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meditation.</v>

1027
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1028
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.630
<v Speaker 1>like I'm talking in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Sam Harris would talk about sort of</v>

1029
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:26.631
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and the way you are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper aware of what you're doing that</v>

1030
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can daydream and your mind can</v>

1031
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:32.220
<v Speaker 1>wander.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you actually start to imagine the</v>

1032
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 1>sensations of every part of archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways it feels like meditating.</v>

1033
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.900
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's why I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1034
00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Speaker 1>and I never really thought about it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting a rifle.</v>

1035
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't have much experience with</v>

1036
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 1>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm guessing it's very similar.</v>

1037
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:48.660
<v Speaker 1>But as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1038
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between the good and the</v>

1039
00:45:50.851 --> 00:45:54.090
<v Speaker 1>great and that is less obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1040
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 1>at a distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1041
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I think a offhand shooting a rifle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting a bow,</v>

1042
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:00.683
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

1043
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1044
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.920
<v Speaker 1>just as accurate at 60 yards as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>average person is not a sniper,</v>

1045
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:11.880
<v Speaker 1>but the average person with a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be pretty fucking accurate.</v>

1046
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.850
<v Speaker 1>You can't off a bench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

1047
00:46:14.851 --> 00:46:16.650
<v Speaker 1>there's some similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1048
00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a similarity to having the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have perfect technique.</v>

1049
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:24.060
<v Speaker 1>You have to have the right stance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make sure that you know</v>

1050
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:27.900
<v Speaker 1>everything's locked in and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your structure is correct.</v>

1051
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:31.320
<v Speaker 1>But I agree with you that I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a meditation.</v>

1052
00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:36.321
<v Speaker 1>I also think there's something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting a target that is in our DNA</v>

1053
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:41.370
<v Speaker 1>that's connected to hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's connected to survival,</v>

1054
00:46:41.371 --> 00:46:46.350
<v Speaker 1>that's connected to the thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years that people through arrows and</v>

1055
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.080
<v Speaker 1>fucking what did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that thing called?</v>

1056
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.090
<v Speaker 1>What's that thing called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they had a lot of,</v>

1057
00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:52.951
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

1058
00:46:52.951 --> 00:46:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I say that Atlatl right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.260
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.800
<v Speaker 1>That's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an advanced spear throwing thing and</v>

1061
00:46:58.801 --> 00:47:03.801
<v Speaker 1>then archery and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when a person would hit a deer,</v>

1062
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.960
<v Speaker 1>they knew their tribe was going to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1063
00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:11.790
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this like charge and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a small amount of that juice when</v>

1064
00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:12.780
<v Speaker 1>you hit a target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1065
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:13.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's,</v>

1066
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.150
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be dopamine that's being</v>
<v Speaker 1>secreted when we send to do that.</v>

1067
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:21.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the greatest feeling in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't make sense.</v>

1068
00:47:21.511 --> 00:47:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Like when you looking at someone doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1069
00:47:23.221 --> 00:47:24.930
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you give a fuck if that Arrow</v>

1070
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:26.490
<v Speaker 1>goes in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1071
00:47:26.491 --> 00:47:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Like why does it make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a fucking sat like Jamie</v>

1072
00:47:31.031 --> 00:47:34.090
<v Speaker 1>laughs at me cause I'll hit the bullseye</v>
<v Speaker 1>from 45 yards.</v>

1073
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:35.440
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1074
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:39.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get this little Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a little a little burst man.</v>

1075
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I just liked the whole experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the sound.</v>

1076
00:47:41.591 --> 00:47:44.200
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes like when my veins get</v>
<v Speaker 1>holes in them,</v>

1077
00:47:44.201 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes you put a broadhead</v>
<v Speaker 1>through or are you put like a field tip</v>

1078
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:50.360
<v Speaker 1>through another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now obviously sometimes if you trash</v>

1079
00:47:50.361 --> 00:47:50.951
<v Speaker 1>the vein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air,</v>

1080
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:53.480
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like usually just a single hole and</v>

1081
00:47:53.481 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 1>a vein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll produce a sound that is the</v>

1082
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:59.080
<v Speaker 1>greatest sound you've ever heard when</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Arrow leaves to whistle.</v>

1083
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1084
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when certain broadheads certain</v>

1085
00:48:04.421 --> 00:48:06.910
<v Speaker 1>vented broadheads they whistle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was still too much.</v>

1086
00:48:06.911 --> 00:48:08.400
<v Speaker 1>They give you all the heads up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that whole experience of like the</v>

1088
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:13.960
<v Speaker 1>perfect release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1089
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.670
<v Speaker 1>even when you surprise yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've been,</v>

1090
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I switched over to this Carter</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution release about a back tension</v>

1091
00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:20.660
<v Speaker 1>release.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1092
00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 1>It's the most pure back tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better than the honey.</v>

1093
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Cause the honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could still cheat a little bit.</v>

1094
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were getting lazy,</v>

1095
00:48:26.201 --> 00:48:28.470
<v Speaker 1>you could twist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twist and exactly right.</v>

1096
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.640
<v Speaker 1>But the evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no cheating.</v>

1097
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

1098
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.410
<v Speaker 1>you so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can surprise yourself with a shot.</v>

1099
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no anticipation.</v>

1100
00:48:37.571 --> 00:48:38.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1101
00:48:38.401 --> 00:48:39.940
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't explain this to people who</v>

1102
00:48:39.941 --> 00:48:42.100
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you notice that now you can't,</v>

1103
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:43.900
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you rambling about?</v>

1104
00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Boring the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have tried to explain this to people</v>

1105
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.090
<v Speaker 1>who don't know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to explain it to Alexander</v>

1106
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Gustafson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's in here the other day and he's a</v>

1107
00:48:53.621 --> 00:48:54.880
<v Speaker 1>hunter too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

1108
00:48:54.881 --> 00:48:57.130
<v Speaker 1>but he only hunts in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't bow hunt.</v>

1109
00:48:57.131 --> 00:48:57.964
<v Speaker 1>It's not legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1110
00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:59.270
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1111
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:02.470
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to learn how to shoot a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was explaining that I put my</v>

1112
00:49:02.471 --> 00:49:03.700
<v Speaker 1>finger on this trigger.</v>

1113
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.940
<v Speaker 1>My fingers sits on the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use a Carter too.</v>

1114
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I use it a first choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the name of the race.</v>

1115
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I go my finger and my thumb is on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger,</v>

1116
00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:12.210
<v Speaker 1>but I never squeeze it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1117
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.890
<v Speaker 1>The squeezing is all done with my back</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I pull,</v>

1118
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.070
<v Speaker 1>then it just goes off and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see his head was like,</v>

1119
00:49:18.071 --> 00:49:19.630
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you?</v>

1120
00:49:19.631 --> 00:49:20.830
<v Speaker 1>But you could just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1121
00:49:20.831 --> 00:49:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1122
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:27.220
<v Speaker 1>It's so counter intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1123
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 1>once I got into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim actually sent me this book on back</v>

1124
00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:33.670
<v Speaker 1>tension and then I just devoured it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was sort of like the reading</v>

1125
00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:35.080
<v Speaker 1>the Penny Dean Book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1126
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:39.220
<v Speaker 1>is tim doing this a lot now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as much as he should be.</v>

1127
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1128
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.220
<v Speaker 1>trying to hunt with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:42.871
<v Speaker 1>Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim,</v>

1130
00:49:42.871 --> 00:49:43.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt.</v>

1131
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually got it so far.</v>

1132
00:49:46.001 --> 00:49:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I know he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's hunting rifles.</v>

1133
00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:48.721
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1134
00:49:48.721 --> 00:49:49.200
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hot.</v>

1135
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:49.810
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1136
00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:52.030
<v Speaker 1>he's been on bow hunting trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in fact what got me into it</v>

1137
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:55.150
<v Speaker 1>because about two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was getting ready to go to a trip do</v>

1138
00:49:55.151 --> 00:49:57.640
<v Speaker 1>at five day trip in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he called me and said,</v>

1139
00:49:57.641 --> 00:49:59.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1140
00:49:59.351 --> 00:50:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk with you about like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>training and some nutrition to like get</v>

1141
00:50:02.681 --> 00:50:05.530
<v Speaker 1>ready for this because it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of an extreme whole deal.</v>

1142
00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:06.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at altitude,</v>

1143
00:50:06.521 --> 00:50:08.610
<v Speaker 1>you're running around like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be able to like,</v>

1144
00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:12.670
<v Speaker 1>like sprint and then be totally relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like,</v>

1145
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you help me think about how to train</v>

1146
00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:16.510
<v Speaker 1>and what the nutrition would be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1147
00:50:16.511 --> 00:50:18.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me more about what the demands are.</v>

1148
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:20.410
<v Speaker 1>And the more he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more I was like,</v>

1149
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.680
<v Speaker 1>why am I not doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sounds really fricking awesome.</v>

1150
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1151
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 1>and he's got an awesome video of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1152
00:50:28.101 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>

1153
00:50:29.181 --> 00:50:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took,</v>

1154
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:34.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean probably he only took one shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like the whole five day trip and it</v>

1155
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:36.310
<v Speaker 1>was a perfect kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kill.</v>

1156
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge bird and I can't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember what it works.</v>

1157
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1158
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 1>It was like a bird on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some huge ass bird,</v>

1159
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:45.440
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1160
00:50:45.441 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the shot,</v>

1161
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:48.801
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1162
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:50.270
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those things where it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1163
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.460
<v Speaker 1>cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1164
00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:54.560
<v Speaker 1>like all my practices on stationary</v>
<v Speaker 1>targets,</v>

1165
00:50:54.561 --> 00:50:56.660
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a totally new dimension when</v>

1166
00:50:56.661 --> 00:51:00.410
<v Speaker 1>it's like the things doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was flying.</v>

1167
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:02.600
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like kind of like either running</v>

1168
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.030
<v Speaker 1>on the ground or about to fly or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1169
00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Anybody hit it in motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1170
00:51:06.381 --> 00:51:08.030
<v Speaker 1>it was a great shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1171
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonder what the fuck that would be.</v>

1172
00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to ask him.</v>

1173
00:51:11.391 --> 00:51:16.391
<v Speaker 1>Big Bird in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he shoot a fucking eagle to shooting</v>

1174
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.210
<v Speaker 1>the Pelican?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely wasn't me.</v>

1175
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading something about the goose</v>

1176
00:51:23.841 --> 00:51:25.730
<v Speaker 1>problem about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1177
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.820
<v Speaker 1>how the goose population has exploded</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1178
00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:29.471
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1179
00:51:29.471 --> 00:51:31.160
<v Speaker 1>farmlands and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1180
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:33.020
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally don't,</v>

1181
00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:38.060
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain population of different kinds of</v>

1182
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 1>geese that are flying into this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Canada.</v>

1183
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.620
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Toronto,</v>

1184
00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks ago and it,</v>

1185
00:51:44.481 --> 00:51:47.180
<v Speaker 1>which is where I'm from and though I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go off,</v>

1186
00:51:47.181 --> 00:51:50.690
<v Speaker 1>and we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with my brother and we were up</v>

1187
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 1>taking the kids to some place and sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

1188
00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:57.680
<v Speaker 1>like we're walking from one area to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and these geese come up and they</v>

1189
00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:00.350
<v Speaker 1>kind of start posturing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm thinking,</v>

1190
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.200
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my brother's like,</v>

1191
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Gavin moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly one of us is near one of their</v>

1192
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:07.730
<v Speaker 1>eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1193
00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:08.870
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1194
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:09.621
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1195
00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:12.980
<v Speaker 1>these are the most aggressive creatures</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're big.</v>

1196
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.540
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

1197
00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:16.670
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just keep walking.</v>

1198
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Don't make eye contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're big,</v>

1199
00:52:18.861 --> 00:52:20.810
<v Speaker 1>but you can cook them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fuck them.</v>

1200
00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Geese.</v>

1201
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1202
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:26.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1203
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:31.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain type of geese that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call Ribeye in the sky because they</v>

1204
00:52:32.001 --> 00:52:37.001
<v Speaker 1>have a delicious red meat to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that call which fucking God</v>

1205
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.620
<v Speaker 1>damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1206
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:43.100
<v Speaker 1>but they're very plentiful in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1207
00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:45.360
<v Speaker 1>They hunt them in Texas and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally,</v>

1208
00:52:45.361 --> 00:52:47.140
<v Speaker 1>it's the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is it modeled?</v>

1209
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.160
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a Ribeye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1210
00:52:49.161 --> 00:52:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Sandhill cranes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sandhill crane.</v>

1211
00:52:51.291 --> 00:52:53.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you don't know.</v>

1212
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.620
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking wizard with the Google</v>
<v Speaker 1>massly with Google.</v>

1213
00:52:57.621 --> 00:53:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is a wizard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Jamie's an extra wizard.</v>

1214
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.510
<v Speaker 1>He's really getting at an India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.110
<v Speaker 1>But that is what they call them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1216
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a common phrase because</v>

1217
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had friends that say it might be</v>

1218
00:53:08.961 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 1>the most delicious meat in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1219
00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:13.430
<v Speaker 1>it tastes like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1220
00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:18.490
<v Speaker 1>like a wad Gu ribeye and it's flying</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and you could shoot like fucking</v>

1221
00:53:19.401 --> 00:53:22.610
<v Speaker 1>10 a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1222
00:53:22.611 --> 00:53:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Like I have friends that hunt these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and you know,</v>

1223
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 1>they're fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're mostly in</v>

1224
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where they are,</v>

1225
00:53:28.021 --> 00:53:31.140
<v Speaker 2>but my friends who have hunted them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunted them in Texas and I'm sure they</v>

1226
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:33.780
<v Speaker 2>fly all across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>

1227
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:34.561
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crane.</v>

1228
00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not a goose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:53:35.731 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I've never been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only been bird hunting twice.</v>

1230
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I went once with Anthony Bordain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1231
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.170
<v Speaker 2>for his TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hunted pheasants and he shot one and</v>

1232
00:53:46.171 --> 00:53:48.180
<v Speaker 2>then we cooked it and ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>

1233
00:53:48.181 --> 00:53:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I shot at one and missed and then I shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Turkey once,</v>

1234
00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:53.550
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wild Turkeys.</v>

1235
00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very delicious.</v>

1236
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.780
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1237
00:53:57.781 --> 00:53:58.614
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1238
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:00.990
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like mammals,</v>

1239
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:03.900
<v Speaker 2>I like eating mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I prefer,</v>

1240
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.440
<v Speaker 2>I prefer red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just better for you.</v>

1241
00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more nutritious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more exhilarating.</v>

1242
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.200
<v Speaker 2>There's something about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat itself,</v>

1243
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:14.430
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tastes better.</v>

1244
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:16.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't met too many foods.</v>

1245
00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just sit and eat it.</v>

1246
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the kind of exercise that you do,</v>

1247
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you almost have a voracious appetite.</v>

1248
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:25.351
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1249
00:54:25.351 --> 00:54:27.290
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like what I used to be.</v>

1250
00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 1>And I fast pretty much every day doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 hours.</v>

1251
00:54:30.991 --> 00:54:32.400
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1252
00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:33.510
<v Speaker 1>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm in,</v>

1253
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I split my time between New York and</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

1254
00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:38.610
<v Speaker 1>When I'm in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely one meal a day,</v>

1255
00:54:38.611 --> 00:54:40.560
<v Speaker 1>no ifs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ands or buts because it's just the</v>

1256
00:54:40.561 --> 00:54:41.850
<v Speaker 1>schedule is such that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1257
00:54:41.851 --> 00:54:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing patients in the morning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon and I don't want to do,</v>

1258
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to waste time to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you doctor in?</v>

1259
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's a good question.</v>

1260
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:50.483
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1261
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I trained as a surgeon and did cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

1262
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1263
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:58.500
<v Speaker 1>my practice is based on longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of how do you apply</v>

1264
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:00.930
<v Speaker 1>nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>

1265
00:55:00.931 --> 00:55:03.480
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress management,</v>

1266
00:55:03.481 --> 00:55:04.430
<v Speaker 1>endocrinology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lipid,</v>

1267
00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Ology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements,</v>

1268
00:55:05.851 --> 00:55:06.930
<v Speaker 1>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

1269
00:55:06.931 --> 00:55:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to make somebody live longer as soon</v>

1270
00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:11.850
<v Speaker 1>as my clinical interest.</v>

1271
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1272
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:16.920
<v Speaker 1>so in New York I eat one meal a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's basically like a 22 hour fasting</v>

1273
00:55:16.921 --> 00:55:19.290
<v Speaker 1>window and then I'm feeding within a two</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour window.</v>

1274
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm here.</v>

1275
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about this,</v>

1276
00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:23.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1277
00:55:23.311 --> 00:55:24.690
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and today it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1278
00:55:24.691 --> 00:55:27.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today it's just been kind of a busy day.</v>

1279
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I won't eat until dinner tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1280
00:55:29.791 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my short fast would be 16 hours where I</v>

1281
00:55:32.731 --> 00:55:34.680
<v Speaker 1>would eat kind of short fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a short,</v>

1282
00:55:34.681 --> 00:55:39.120
<v Speaker 1>fast one for me really to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get in touch with your</v>

1283
00:55:39.121 --> 00:55:41.520
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had this discussion with a friend</v>

1284
00:55:41.521 --> 00:55:43.230
<v Speaker 1>this morning because he was saying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1285
00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:45.360
<v Speaker 1>he can't do 16 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he's a pussy.</v>

1286
00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:46.171
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1287
00:55:46.171 --> 00:55:48.570
<v Speaker 1>my studies a puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just told them no,</v>

1288
00:55:48.571 --> 00:55:51.190
<v Speaker 1>but I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to understand if,</v>

1289
00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:54.060
<v Speaker 1>if our ancestors couldn't function when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were hungry,</v>

1290
00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:55.043
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be here.</v>

1291
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that starvation,</v>

1292
00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:00.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short term adaptation to starvation is,</v>

1293
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:02.790
<v Speaker 1>is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably beneficial.</v>

1294
00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

1295
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during these short periods of</v>

1296
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.280
<v Speaker 1>deprivation of food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1297
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:11.080
<v Speaker 1>we get just a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>epinephrine and Norepinephrine,</v>

1298
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.080
<v Speaker 1>we just get a little bit sharper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit better.</v>

1299
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1300
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember what it's like to</v>

1301
00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:19.200
<v Speaker 1>eat three meals a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been so long,</v>

1302
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:24.320
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been doing crazy shit for 10</v>

1303
00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.410
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nutritional wise.</v>

1304
00:56:26.411 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm gonna spend three years in</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketosis where we go from a one day I was</v>

1305
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:33.100
<v Speaker 1>in Ketosis for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1306
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.580
<v Speaker 1>lots of fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think intermittent fasting or time</v>

1307
00:56:36.581 --> 00:56:39.490
<v Speaker 1>restricted feeding probably at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years.</v>

1308
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.420
<v Speaker 1>And what does for people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the benefits of that?</v>

1309
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're,</v>

1310
00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:48.220
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to get really technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to be clear that I think a lot</v>

1311
00:56:48.221 --> 00:56:51.340
<v Speaker 1>of the benefits are overstated and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the benefits or things that we've</v>

1312
00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:52.450
<v Speaker 1>only studied in animals.</v>

1313
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:56.650
<v Speaker 1>So there's a guy named Satchin panda at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Salk Institute in San Diego who's I</v>

1314
00:56:56.651 --> 00:56:59.260
<v Speaker 1>think one of the world's experts on time</v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted feeding.</v>

1315
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.020
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1316
00:57:02.021 --> 00:57:05.230
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 16 hour fast and a mouse produces</v>

1317
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.300
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take a group of,</v>

1318
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain types of mice are strains of</v>

1319
00:57:09.071 --> 00:57:12.250
<v Speaker 1>rats or other rodents and you in a 24</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour period period,</v>

1320
00:57:12.251 --> 00:57:14.530
<v Speaker 1>deprive them of any nutrient for 16</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

1321
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:17.200
<v Speaker 1>but then for eight hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them eat whatever the hell they</v>

1322
00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:18.820
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't gain weight.</v>

1323
00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:20.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1324
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:21.411
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

1325
00:57:21.411 --> 00:57:25.510
<v Speaker 1>and the reason we think is that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you give a long enough period of</v>

1326
00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:28.690
<v Speaker 1>time when the animal can ramp up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

1327
00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:31.780
<v Speaker 1>the like the enzymes in the liver that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are responsible for fat oxidation.</v>

1328
00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean they just basically become fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>burn.</v>

1329
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I hate that term fat burning machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so overused,</v>

1330
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:37.720
<v Speaker 1>but that's bay.</v>

1331
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.690
<v Speaker 1>They basically just become unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient at metabolizing fat.</v>

1332
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1333
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:44.710
<v Speaker 1>we have to be careful that when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>extrapolate that,</v>

1334
00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:48.250
<v Speaker 1>cause you and I have a very different</v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolism than a mouse,</v>

1335
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.720
<v Speaker 1>like a 16 hour fast to a mouse is much</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer than it is to us.</v>

1336
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:55.260
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if those benefits would</v>
<v Speaker 1>extend.</v>

1337
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also it's not entirely clear the time</v>

1338
00:57:58.181 --> 00:58:01.720
<v Speaker 1>restricted feeding will produce the</v>
<v Speaker 1>longevity benefit that we see in other</v>

1339
00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.870
<v Speaker 1>sort of fasting or fasting mimicking</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of diets.</v>

1340
00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>

1341
00:58:07.001 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 1>what it comes down to is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1342
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.320
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just an easier way.</v>

1343
00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:14.200
<v Speaker 1>It gives me a much more liberty with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I eat during my feeding window.</v>

1344
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to be nearly as restrictive</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm feeding.</v>

1345
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have that period off it just,</v>

1346
00:58:19.631 --> 00:58:21.730
<v Speaker 1>just in terms of like my physiologic</v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

1347
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a convenience thing.</v>

1348
00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Like I kind of hate being tethered to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

1349
00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I like knowing that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I get into a pinch,</v>

1350
00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:33.400
<v Speaker 1>like I don't have to eat right now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm sitting on the airplane and</v>

1351
00:58:33.401 --> 00:58:35.860
<v Speaker 1>they're serving dog shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to eat.</v>

1352
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I can wait another five hours until I</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

1353
00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also just feel much more steady in my</v>

1354
00:58:43.691 --> 00:58:45.350
<v Speaker 1>energy levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1355
00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I kind of vaguely remember like 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago when I was kind of like eating a</v>

1356
00:58:49.331 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 1>normal diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I always had this low in energy</v>

1357
00:58:54.101 --> 00:58:56.320
<v Speaker 1>after lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there is the post lunch,</v>

1358
00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:59.890
<v Speaker 1>pre dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't feel good.</v>

1359
00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Like not that I feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I'm not sharp.</v>

1360
00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in my a game and I don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember what that feels like anymore,</v>

1361
00:59:06.491 --> 00:59:08.650
<v Speaker 1>which is not to say I feel great all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1362
00:59:08.651 --> 00:59:11.890
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacillating energy level.</v>

1363
00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said that to be,</v>

1364
00:59:13.411 --> 00:59:16.150
<v Speaker 1>but when I eliminated most carbs from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

1365
00:59:16.530 --> 00:59:18.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have a friend of mine who you</v>

1366
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:20.890
<v Speaker 1>talked to his trainer about that and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>trainers like you're crazy.</v>

1367
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Eat bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat pasta,</v>

1368
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.410
<v Speaker 3>don't listen to him like no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't listen to him.</v>

1369
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Like just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just google it.</v>

1370
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:29.030
<v Speaker 3>That stuff's fucking terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to eat carbohydrates,</v>

1371
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:30.650
<v Speaker 3>get it from fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1372
00:59:30.651 --> 00:59:34.550
<v Speaker 3>get it from some natural sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just if you have a trainer that's</v>

1373
00:59:34.551 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 3>telling you to eat bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a new fucking trainer.</v>

1374
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.970
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not what you need.</v>

1375
00:59:38.971 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 3>And it's nothing wrong with eating if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to occasionally and in small</v>

1376
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 3>doses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I eliminated most of that stuff</v>

1377
00:59:45.021 --> 00:59:47.060
<v Speaker 3>from my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt the exact same thing.</v>

1378
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I felt that midday nap desire go away</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're just the fogginess about</v>

1379
00:59:53.771 --> 00:59:55.460
<v Speaker 3>like you at the end of the day like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

1380
00:59:55.461 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'd have to drink a cup of</v>

1381
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:01.850
<v Speaker 3>coffee to get ramped back up again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is like never ending cycle of</v>

1382
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.880
<v Speaker 3>having this insulin spike and then this</v>
<v Speaker 3>crash.</v>

1383
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.990
<v Speaker 3>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1384
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.390
<v Speaker 3>that's from carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's from refined carbohydrates and you</v>

1385
01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:13.190
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having too much fucking sugar in your</v>

1386
01:00:13.191 --> 01:00:14.780
<v Speaker 3>body and everybody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1387
01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.090
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this will be funny for your,</v>

1391
01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I was a swimmer because all this time we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about me swimming.</v>

1392
01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 3>You're assuming like I'm a fit dude.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1401
01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.400
<v Speaker 3>after I swim across Lake Tahoe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to that.</v>

1402
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.560
<v Speaker 3>That one right there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's like you boozing it up,</v>

1405
01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the way you're sitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1406
01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Stood up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sucked it in for a picture on instagram.</v>

1407
01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Might look okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1408
01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.720
<v Speaker 3>I was definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1409
01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:05.060
<v Speaker 3>probably what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe 30 pounds heavier.</v>

1410
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.761
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1411
01:01:05.761 --> 01:01:06.351
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1412
01:01:06.351 --> 01:01:08.600
<v Speaker 3>body fat was much greater and what were</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eating?</v>

1413
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I probably went through three or</v>

1414
01:01:10.911 --> 01:01:15.470
<v Speaker 3>four bottles of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a two day training all day and you know</v>

1415
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:20.530
<v Speaker 3>every postworkout was a carvery feed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're in sort of this vicious</v>

1416
01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:24.820
<v Speaker 3>glycogen dependent state people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1417
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:28.520
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy that there's so many folks</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there that are living their life</v>

1418
01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:31.310
<v Speaker 3>that don't even understand that this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a process they're going through.</v>

1419
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.640
<v Speaker 3>They just think this is eating and</v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>

1420
01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:38.780
<v Speaker 3>This is what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not your body lit.</v>

1421
01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.090
<v Speaker 3>If you shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut that off,</v>

1422
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:45.230
<v Speaker 3>push it away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enter into a completely different food</v>

1423
01:01:45.231 --> 01:01:45.800
<v Speaker 3>source.</v>

1424
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Just change the way you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat,</v>

1425
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:53.390
<v Speaker 3>your body will change and that that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>that concept that people,</v>

1426
01:01:53.391 --> 01:01:55.280
<v Speaker 3>that sounds like horseshit it sounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1427
01:01:55.281 --> 01:01:58.380
<v Speaker 3>what are you saying you you're what are</v>
<v Speaker 3>you offering some miracle cure your</v>

1428
01:01:58.410 --> 01:01:59.210
<v Speaker 3>already?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1429
01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying you will change the dimension</v>
<v Speaker 3>of life that you operate in.</v>

1430
01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.830
<v Speaker 3>It will change because you won't be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same person.</v>

1431
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.580
<v Speaker 3>You won't like who you are is dependent</v>
<v Speaker 3>upon a lot of things.</v>

1432
01:02:10.581 --> 01:02:13.310
<v Speaker 3>But one of them is how much energy you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have and how you feel,</v>

1433
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.250
<v Speaker 3>whether you're crashing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you change the way you eat,</v>

1434
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:19.010
<v Speaker 3>you change the energy you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you changed the,</v>

1435
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.003
<v Speaker 3>you feel</v>

1436
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>it'll change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your behavior will change your choices,</v>

1437
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>it'll change your ambitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll change your potential.</v>

1438
01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things that will change.</v>

1439
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>But there's an interesting question</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've,</v>

1440
01:02:30.631 --> 01:02:31.464
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1441
01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I spend some time thinking about and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sort of accepted the fact that we</v>

1442
01:02:35.671 --> 01:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>might not know the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is when I was growing up,</v>

1443
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I was exercising like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as much as I was when I was</v>

1444
01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:43.670
<v Speaker 1>swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1445
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than I was when I was swimming,</v>

1446
01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but I ate like I had the world's worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet growing up,</v>

1447
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:53.870
<v Speaker 1>so I would eat breakfast was a bowl of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1448
01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>like a box of cereal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd take like one of these tupperware</v>

1449
01:02:56.371 --> 01:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this big and fill it with a full</v>

1450
01:02:58.231 --> 01:02:59.910
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So each day I would have just a box of</v>

1451
01:02:59.911 --> 01:03:01.590
<v Speaker 1>cocoa puffs or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would start the day.</v>

1452
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:07.490
<v Speaker 1>And then lunch was a full loaf of bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would seven sandwiches plus a</v>

1453
01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>plate of fries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus a big tub of like,</v>

1454
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.120
<v Speaker 1>like a two liter jug of orange juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was training six hours a day,</v>

1455
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.021
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would,</v>

1456
01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run 10 miles in the morning in the gym,</v>

1457
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:20.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing like it was,</v>

1458
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:21.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what that shit is like.</v>

1459
01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculously energy expending.</v>

1460
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:28.200
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a hard time holding my weight and</v>

1461
01:03:28.201 --> 01:03:33.201
<v Speaker 1>I was a middleweight one 60 walked</v>
<v Speaker 1>around at one 58 who walks around below</v>

1462
01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:35.550
<v Speaker 1>their fight weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1463
01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:38.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my waist was 28 inches.</v>

1464
01:03:38.071 --> 01:03:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I was probably four and a half percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>body fat.</v>

1465
01:03:40.021 --> 01:03:44.010
<v Speaker 1>And I was eating anything and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could put in front of me.</v>

1466
01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:49.230
<v Speaker 1>And then something happened in medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>school where that shit just stopped and</v>

1467
01:03:49.231 --> 01:03:51.570
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even eating as badly at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1468
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:55.350
<v Speaker 1>But all of a sudden the metabolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation just vanished.</v>

1469
01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.290
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1470
01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I wish someone had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could study this,</v>

1471
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:04.530
<v Speaker 1>meaning you would have to take a group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of individuals and do muscle and fat</v>

1472
01:04:04.531 --> 01:04:07.500
<v Speaker 1>biopsies over their course of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1473
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:10.470
<v Speaker 1>or at least during this window when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think this is happening.</v>

1474
01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:13.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think for many of my patients or</v>
<v Speaker 1>just even friends,</v>

1475
01:04:13.981 --> 01:04:17.130
<v Speaker 1>like it seems that this happens kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your thirties if you're a guy,</v>

1476
01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for women,</v>

1477
01:04:18.561 --> 01:04:19.394
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1478
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:22.980
<v Speaker 1>it's harder for me to tell because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think pregnancy can interfere with this.</v>

1479
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sometimes we get a bit of a skew to</v>

1480
01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:28.290
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I had to hypothesize,</v>

1481
01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:33.291
<v Speaker 1>I think that we go from having a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lipid protein lipase on muscle cells and</v>

1482
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:39.291
<v Speaker 1>not much on fat cells to the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I was 16 and invincible,</v>

1483
01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:44.900
<v Speaker 1>my muscles had a lot of this enzyme lpl</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it that could just absolutely take</v>

1484
01:04:46.471 --> 01:04:51.210
<v Speaker 1>whatever I was throwing at them and turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>it into energy for the muscle.</v>

1485
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Whereas when that lpl exists on a fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell,</v>

1486
01:04:53.881 --> 01:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>you're basically just going to store</v>
<v Speaker 1>more fat.</v>

1487
01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.710
<v Speaker 1>And now why that would happen over time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1488
01:04:58.711 --> 01:05:02.280
<v Speaker 1>we could guess reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd love to know if that's the case</v>

1489
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.060
<v Speaker 1>because I still can't really figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why is it today?</v>

1490
01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I am so carbohydrate sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When there was a day when I could eat,</v>

1491
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was probably eating seven or 8,000</v>

1492
01:05:13.111 --> 01:05:16.710
<v Speaker 1>calories a day of which 80%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're probably carbohydrates.</v>

1493
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.990
<v Speaker 1>When I was growing up and was lean and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

1494
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Did you experience a crash at all and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the like post,</v>

1495
01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>afternoon crash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post lunch crash?</v>

1496
01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>

1497
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I did that much back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

1498
01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Which would also speak to the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>better fuel partitioning,</v>

1499
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>fuel partitioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that sort of technical term for</v>

1500
01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>where your body knows to go to access</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

1501
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to glycogen,</v>

1502
01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>are you going into the fat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1503
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>and then where are you storing energy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1504
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>so I suspect I was just better at fuel</v>
<v Speaker 1>partitioning as a kid,</v>

1505
01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.650
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure most of us were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1506
01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.440
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

1507
01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>of course the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we care about this as</v>

1508
01:05:56.351 --> 01:05:57.820
<v Speaker 1>like what could you do about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1509
01:05:57.821 --> 01:05:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1510
01:05:59.891 --> 01:06:01.630
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's probably one of the reasons</v>

1511
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 1>why testosterone as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

1512
01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:06.190
<v Speaker 1>as testosterone goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get fatter,</v>

1513
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.830
<v Speaker 1>all things equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason is testosterone,</v>

1514
01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:11.620
<v Speaker 1>upregulates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lpl and hormone sensitive lipase and all</v>

1515
01:06:11.621 --> 01:06:15.730
<v Speaker 1>of these other enzymes in the direction</v>
<v Speaker 1>of making you leaner versus fatter.</v>

1516
01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1517
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:21.820
<v Speaker 1>but that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that that's enough of</v>

1518
01:06:21.821 --> 01:06:22.300
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1519
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:26.020
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something else that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on that's triggering that decline.</v>

1520
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So for you at this 22 hour window of not</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>

1521
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:35.320
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the benefits are other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than your energy and slight spikes in</v>

1522
01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:38.890
<v Speaker 1>nor epinephrin and some other hormones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1523
01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's sufficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence at this point in time,</v>

1524
01:06:41.381 --> 01:06:44.110
<v Speaker 1>that time restricted feeding is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact my longevity.</v>

1525
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's the big claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the big claim this thing.</v>

1526
01:06:47.951 --> 01:06:48.611
<v Speaker 1>What is the claim?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like?</v>

1527
01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:49.540
<v Speaker 1>What are they saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1528
01:06:49.541 --> 01:06:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the claim would be that fasting</v>

1529
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.640
<v Speaker 1>mimicry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could be,</v>

1530
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

1531
01:06:56.321 --> 01:07:00.910
<v Speaker 1>say valter Longo talks about where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a five day hypo caloric diet of 750</v>

1532
01:07:00.911 --> 01:07:02.680
<v Speaker 1>to a thousand calories a day for five</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

1533
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:04.750
<v Speaker 1>followed by 25 days of ad libitum</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding,</v>

1534
01:07:04.751 --> 01:07:07.000
<v Speaker 1>meaning eat whatever the hell you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1535
01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:09.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of total caloric content,</v>

1536
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:11.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1537
01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the claim is well that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance longevity and,</v>

1538
01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:16.000
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a 16,</v>

1539
01:07:16.001 --> 01:07:18.070
<v Speaker 1>eight or 18 six is going to enhance</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespan.</v>

1540
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.830
<v Speaker 1>So just to take a step back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1541
01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I am only aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1542
01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:31.110
<v Speaker 1>three things that have universally</v>
<v Speaker 1>extended lifespan across all model</v>

1543
01:07:31.151 --> 01:07:32.890
<v Speaker 1>organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think of like all,</v>

1544
01:07:32.891 --> 01:07:36.310
<v Speaker 1>you carry what's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go from yeast to worms to flies</v>

1545
01:07:36.311 --> 01:07:39.550
<v Speaker 1>to mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only things that uniformly extend</v>

1546
01:07:39.551 --> 01:07:40.810
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1547
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:45.160
<v Speaker 1>or almost uniformly is caloric</v>
<v Speaker 1>restriction and or dietary restriction.</v>

1548
01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:49.120
<v Speaker 1>So total reduction in calories during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lifetime and,</v>

1549
01:07:49.121 --> 01:07:51.790
<v Speaker 1>or reduction of certain subsets of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>calories.</v>

1550
01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.430
<v Speaker 1>So there's a super famous experiment</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was done.</v>

1551
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually if anyone's interested,</v>

1552
01:07:56.801 --> 01:07:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on my blog somewhere,</v>

1553
01:07:58.781 --> 01:08:01.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best experiment ever done in chloric</v>

1554
01:08:01.451 --> 01:08:04.990
<v Speaker 1>restriction was between monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a group at the NIH and a</v>

1555
01:08:04.991 --> 01:08:08.140
<v Speaker 1>group at the University of Wisconsin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a 19 year experiment or</v>

1556
01:08:08.141 --> 01:08:11.020
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could really study the impact of</v>

1557
01:08:11.021 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 1>caloric restriction over these things.</v>

1558
01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 1>And that experiment showed us that</v>
<v Speaker 1>caloric restriction,</v>

1559
01:08:16.161 --> 01:08:19.460
<v Speaker 1>extended lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a really shitty diet and it</v>

1560
01:08:19.461 --> 01:08:22.220
<v Speaker 1>did not extend lifespan if you had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good diet,</v>

1561
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:25.580
<v Speaker 1>counterintuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also spoke to the idea that</v>

1562
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 1>dietary restriction probably matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

1563
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're eating a regular diet of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's every day,</v>

1564
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 1>and then we put your counterpart eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>70% of Mcdonald's every day,</v>

1565
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>that's going to move the needle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the Wisconsin,</v>

1566
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:40.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1567
01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.020
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the NIH experiment,</v>

1568
01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:44.660
<v Speaker 1>when you took the monkeys that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating kind of,</v>

1569
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.320
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't their natural food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was less horrible food.</v>

1570
01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>The caloric restriction did not extend</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespan.</v>

1571
01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:55.250
<v Speaker 1>So that threw a wrench in everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of caloric restriction.</v>

1572
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.490
<v Speaker 1>And there are certain strains of mice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also don't seem to be enhanced in</v>

1573
01:08:58.491 --> 01:09:00.950
<v Speaker 1>terms of lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning just time on,</v>

1574
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1575
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:05.840
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation,</v>

1576
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty ubiquitously extends life.</v>

1577
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:14.110
<v Speaker 1>The second thing that uniformly extends</v>
<v Speaker 1>life across this is a drug called</v>

1578
01:09:14.121 --> 01:09:17.210
<v Speaker 1>rapamycin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of like my favorite drug</v>

1579
01:09:17.211 --> 01:09:19.580
<v Speaker 1>in the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean meaning it's like I think it's</v>

1580
01:09:19.581 --> 01:09:22.250
<v Speaker 1>the most important drug in in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this space,</v>

1581
01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:26.000
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily because it's a drug that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will all be taking though I do believe</v>

1582
01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:28.310
<v Speaker 1>that is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly because of what</v>

1583
01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:32.480
<v Speaker 1>it's taught us about the nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensing pathway and its target,</v>

1584
01:09:32.481 --> 01:09:36.460
<v Speaker 1>which is this protein called Tor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the target of Rapamycin or m torres,</v>

1585
01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.550
<v Speaker 1>you probably heard of it as mechanistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>target of rapamycin and wrap a and</v>

1586
01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.610
<v Speaker 1>inhibits that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a bit complicated because</v>

1587
01:09:43.611 --> 01:09:45.730
<v Speaker 1>there's two variants of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something called [inaudible]</v>

1588
01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:50.150
<v Speaker 1>complex one and mtor complex too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you take rap in mice and day in</v>

1589
01:09:50.151 --> 01:09:53.330
<v Speaker 1>and day out every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for example transplant patients</v>

1590
01:09:53.331 --> 01:09:55.130
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an immune suppressant.</v>

1591
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:57.500
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem to really extend</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespan.</v>

1592
01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 1>But if you take it in a pulsatile way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you selectively get this m torque one</v>

1593
01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:05.720
<v Speaker 1>inhibition without the m torque to</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibition that seems to produce</v>

1594
01:10:05.721 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 1>longevity big time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>

1595
01:10:07.731 --> 01:10:10.460
<v Speaker 1>How would you take it selectively?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1596
01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of one of my main clinical</v>

1597
01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:14.140
<v Speaker 1>interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1598
01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.280
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1599
01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.880
<v Speaker 1>obviously I'm waiting for the day when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can start taking it and ultimately,</v>

1600
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:21.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that it's safe enough that I could</v>

1601
01:10:21.861 --> 01:10:23.580
<v Speaker 1>give it to patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1602
01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:26.960
<v Speaker 1>if I'm extrapolating from all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best data out there.</v>

1603
01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's looking at the work that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out of a guy named David Sabatini,</v>

1604
01:10:30.111 --> 01:10:32.300
<v Speaker 1>his lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David's a guy at mit,</v>

1605
01:10:32.301 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 1>he's a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's actually the guy that when he was a</v>

1606
01:10:34.611 --> 01:10:38.960
<v Speaker 1>medical student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing his phd in 1994 actually</v>

1607
01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 1>discovered how wrap a mice and works in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>

1608
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:45.320
<v Speaker 1>He's actually the guy that coined</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanistic target of Rapamycin,</v>

1609
01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:49.700
<v Speaker 1>mtor work as a name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now whatever we are almost 25</v>

1610
01:10:49.701 --> 01:10:51.320
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1611
01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still running the powerhouse lab</v>

1612
01:10:53.511 --> 01:10:55.700
<v Speaker 1>that understands it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at all of the literature</v>

1613
01:10:55.701 --> 01:10:59.610
<v Speaker 1>that's coming out of their lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coupled with a guy named Matt K,</v>

1614
01:10:59.611 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Berlin at the University of Washington</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's doing rap and mice and studies in</v>

1615
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:08.021
<v Speaker 1>dogs along with the work done by someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>named Joan Manic who was at the time at</v>

1616
01:11:08.661 --> 01:11:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Novartis has now at a company called</v>
<v Speaker 1>restore bio and a few other people.</v>

1617
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.510
<v Speaker 1>My intuition is that somewhere between</v>
<v Speaker 1>two to six milligrams every five to</v>

1618
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:22.440
<v Speaker 1>seven days is probably the sweet spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1619
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:25.950
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I confident enough in that to say</v>

1620
01:11:25.951 --> 01:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>that we should all be taking it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

1621
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:32.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple things that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to measure before we</v>

1622
01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:34.230
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1623
01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:37.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the animal data,</v>

1624
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.310
<v Speaker 1>the stuff's remarkable.</v>

1625
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.400
<v Speaker 1>If you look at Matt k Berlin's dog data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's remarkable.</v>

1626
01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing with it?</v>

1627
01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for you,</v>

1628
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.240
<v Speaker 1>you own a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

1629
01:11:45.241 --> 01:11:45.721
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1630
01:11:45.721 --> 01:11:48.210
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at outside of euthanasia or</v>

1631
01:11:48.211 --> 01:11:49.500
<v Speaker 1>accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to dogs die,</v>

1632
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.940
<v Speaker 1>they basically die of cancer and heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1633
01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:52.920
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they get dilated cardiomyopathy.</v>

1634
01:11:52.921 --> 01:11:54.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's a different type of heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease in humans get,</v>

1635
01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:57.540
<v Speaker 1>they don't get atherosclerotic disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get heart failure.</v>

1636
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hearts just get too too,</v>

1637
01:11:59.341 --> 01:12:01.200
<v Speaker 1>too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their ejection fraction,</v>

1638
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.990
<v Speaker 1>which is the amount of blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of blood that leaves the</v>

1639
01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:06.310
<v Speaker 1>ventricular chamber with every</v>
<v Speaker 1>contraction that is,</v>

1640
01:12:06.311 --> 01:12:08.940
<v Speaker 1>that number goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad things happen.</v>

1641
01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Now to put that in perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I sitting here,</v>

1642
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:15.270
<v Speaker 1>couple of normal fit dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we probably have a resting ejection</v>

1643
01:12:15.271 --> 01:12:20.271
<v Speaker 1>fraction of 60% and if like we went out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and like killed it and work out as</v>

1644
01:12:21.211 --> 01:12:24.480
<v Speaker 1>hard as we could at peak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might get that up to 80 85% ejection</v>

1645
01:12:24.481 --> 01:12:25.314
<v Speaker 1>fraction.</v>

1646
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:30.770
<v Speaker 1>So once the ejection fraction gets below</v>
<v Speaker 1>30% you know a person starts to become</v>

1647
01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:33.810
<v Speaker 1>very symptomatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1648
01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Matt took these dogs that had low</v>
<v Speaker 1>ejection fractions to begin with and I</v>

1649
01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:41.910
<v Speaker 1>forget what the exact number was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might've been like below 40% are</v>

1650
01:12:41.911 --> 01:12:46.911
<v Speaker 1>below 30% put them on a rapid mice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 12 weeks and in just 12 weeks saw an</v>

1651
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:52.620
<v Speaker 1>absolute 10% improvements or not didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that's not going from 30 to</v>

1652
01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:55.560
<v Speaker 1>33,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going from 30 to 40% f</v>

1653
01:12:55.561 --> 01:12:57.230
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1654
01:12:58.050 --> 01:13:00.600
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is hard to measure an effect in 12</v>

1655
01:13:00.601 --> 01:13:02.520
<v Speaker 1>weeks of a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1656
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:05.640
<v Speaker 1>and certainly you're not gonna be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to measure a longevity impact over that.</v>

1657
01:13:05.641 --> 01:13:09.390
<v Speaker 1>So much of the study that's being done</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this is looking at surrogate</v>

1658
01:13:09.391 --> 01:13:12.930
<v Speaker 1>markers that we assume would portend</v>
<v Speaker 1>longevity.</v>

1659
01:13:12.931 --> 01:13:15.840
<v Speaker 1>So Matt's work focusing on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1660
01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:18.300
<v Speaker 1>the ejection fraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1661
01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:20.730
<v Speaker 1>mannix work was focused on immune</v>
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>

1662
01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:22.890
<v Speaker 1>which again was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this was the turning point for me.</v>

1663
01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:27.890
<v Speaker 1>This was like December of 2014 was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>when everything in my professional world</v>

1664
01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:33.540
<v Speaker 1>shifted in terms of my interest towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rapamycin is the thing I want to</v>

1665
01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:37.110
<v Speaker 1>know everything about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when I was a surgical resident,</v>

1666
01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to give rapamycin out,</v>

1667
01:13:38.551 --> 01:13:40.920
<v Speaker 1>like it was cotton candy to all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>transplant patients.</v>

1668
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:45.450
<v Speaker 1>It was an amazing drug that</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionized transplant physiology</v>

1669
01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 1>because it had far fewer side effects</v>
<v Speaker 1>than massive doses of prednisone and</v>

1670
01:13:49.501 --> 01:13:51.030
<v Speaker 1>things that we used to have to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients.</v>

1671
01:13:51.031 --> 01:13:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Now you could give them much less</v>
<v Speaker 1>prednisone and you could give them</v>

1672
01:13:53.641 --> 01:13:57.390
<v Speaker 1>rapamycin or cousins of mice and like fk</v>
<v Speaker 1>five Oh six</v>

1673
01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.470
<v Speaker 3>and what you're doing with that stuff as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're suppressing the immune system so</v>

1674
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.270
<v Speaker 3>the body doesn't reject the organ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1675
01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Now when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that leave them to south double to</v>

1676
01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:08.310
<v Speaker 3>illness or disease?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would that be the case with wrap on</v>

1677
01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.580
<v Speaker 3>minds in person taking him for</v>
<v Speaker 3>longevity?</v>

1678
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>That's the dollar question.</v>

1679
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.850
<v Speaker 1>And so I think in two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in a moment I want,</v>

1680
01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you the story of how wrapping</v>

1681
01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.720
<v Speaker 1>mice and came to be because I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting story in biology</v>

1682
01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:24.721
<v Speaker 1>certainly in the last 25 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it was approved in 1999 by the</v>

1683
01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:27.580
<v Speaker 1>FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was for this indication,</v>

1684
01:14:27.581 --> 01:14:32.581
<v Speaker 1>it was an immune suppressant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 10 years before anybody figured</v>

1685
01:14:32.651 --> 01:14:33.790
<v Speaker 1>out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wait,</v>

1686
01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:36.490
<v Speaker 1>this could also extend life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're in,</v>

1687
01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you had this paradox which was waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can an immune suppressant extend</v>

1688
01:14:40.571 --> 01:14:42.220
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody acknowledges that</v>

1689
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:44.460
<v Speaker 1>immunity is a court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1690
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:49.590
<v Speaker 1>element of health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in December of 2014 I feel like</v>

1691
01:14:50.651 --> 01:14:53.170
<v Speaker 1>it was like almost Christmas Day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking this is like the</v>

1692
01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:55.300
<v Speaker 1>best president I've ever got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1693
01:14:55.390 --> 01:15:00.390
<v Speaker 1>mannix group published this paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they did in a group of about 320 a</v>

1694
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:03.640
<v Speaker 1>65 year olds ish.</v>

1695
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:06.850
<v Speaker 1>So they put them into four groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a placebo group,</v>

1696
01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:10.270
<v Speaker 1>there was a group that got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't actually wrapping mice and</v>

1697
01:15:10.271 --> 01:15:11.620
<v Speaker 1>it was ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever alignments,</v>

1698
01:15:11.621 --> 01:15:13.780
<v Speaker 1>which is an analog of rep mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically the same drug.</v>

1699
01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.600
<v Speaker 1>So there's a group that got one</v>
<v Speaker 1>milligram every single day,</v>

1700
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:20.320
<v Speaker 1>five milligrams once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 milligrams once a week.</v>

1701
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:24.760
<v Speaker 1>They did this for something like eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 12 weeks and then they washed out,</v>

1702
01:15:24.761 --> 01:15:27.850
<v Speaker 1>meaning they got nothing for eight to 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and then they were hit with a flu</v>

1703
01:15:27.851 --> 01:15:31.030
<v Speaker 1>vaccine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the scientists measured the</v>

1704
01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:34.390
<v Speaker 1>immune response doing these really</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated as where you look at t cell</v>

1705
01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:38.050
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So relative to the placebo,</v>

1706
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.320
<v Speaker 1>paradoxically all groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said paradoxically,</v>

1707
01:15:41.321 --> 01:15:45.370
<v Speaker 1>because even the group that got one</v>
<v Speaker 1>milligram once a day all saw an increase</v>

1708
01:15:45.371 --> 01:15:46.780
<v Speaker 1>in immunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing.</v>

1709
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:51.340
<v Speaker 1>But the five and 20 group saw an even</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger response.</v>

1710
01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:53.890
<v Speaker 1>The people who just got five once a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 20 once a week.</v>

1711
01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:57.460
<v Speaker 1>So on even bigger response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the group that took 20 once a week</v>

1712
01:15:57.461 --> 01:16:00.450
<v Speaker 1>had more side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the biggest side effect of rap and</v>

1713
01:16:00.451 --> 01:16:04.420
<v Speaker 1>mice and acutely as these awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful mouth sores called aptos ulcers.</v>

1714
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 1>They're nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're brutal.</v>

1715
01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to get them all the time just</v>

1716
01:16:09.401 --> 01:16:11.530
<v Speaker 1>from I think sleep deprivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1717
01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:12.281
<v Speaker 1>or any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1718
01:16:12.281 --> 01:16:13.750
<v Speaker 1>something that was weakening my immune</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1719
01:16:13.751 --> 01:16:16.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's an internal source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1720
01:16:16.730 --> 01:16:19.400
<v Speaker 1>and not like a cold sores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>canker.</v>

1721
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:21.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really nasty type of canker sore.</v>

1722
01:16:21.731 --> 01:16:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1723
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

1724
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:29.200
<v Speaker 1>once I had one so bad that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when I was in residency and I</v>

1725
01:16:29.201 --> 01:16:30.610
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just driving me nuts.</v>

1726
01:16:30.611 --> 01:16:32.740
<v Speaker 1>So I went to the or and I got a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lidacain,</v>

1727
01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:34.000
<v Speaker 1>which is a local anesthetic.</v>

1728
01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:37.690
<v Speaker 1>And I went into the call room and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed my tongue and just injected like</v>

1729
01:16:37.691 --> 01:16:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Lidocaine in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just when I did that,</v>

1730
01:16:39.671 --> 01:16:42.610
<v Speaker 1>somebody walked in and I've got like</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood dripping down from my mouth and</v>

1731
01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I've got a needle in my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1732
01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:45.281
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1733
01:16:45.281 --> 01:16:45.401
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1734
01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:46.211
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what you think.</v>

1735
01:16:46.211 --> 01:16:49.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear it's Lidacain.</v>

1736
01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.020
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1737
01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.550
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1738
01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:52.810
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got you in to help.</v>

1739
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were support groups for people.</v>

1740
01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Like you lie to Keynes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disgusting.</v>

1741
01:16:57.821 --> 01:17:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I had my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deviated septum fixed and they shoved</v>

1742
01:17:01.391 --> 01:17:02.590
<v Speaker 1>the lidacain up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1743
01:17:02.591 --> 01:17:03.130
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1744
01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:06.970
<v Speaker 1>it's hard stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of the day I just felt like</v>

1745
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:10.370
<v Speaker 1>shaky and just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized,</v>

1746
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:11.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like a,</v>

1747
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:14.510
<v Speaker 1>almost like a cocaine type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1748
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.480
<v Speaker 1>do you know why we have wida cane</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of cocaine or,</v>

1749
01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:19.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a guy named William Stewart Hall</v>

1750
01:17:19.461 --> 01:17:21.080
<v Speaker 1>stead who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1751
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 1>so near and dear to my heart because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the original,</v>

1752
01:17:23.541 --> 01:17:27.800
<v Speaker 1>he was the founding surgeon at Johns</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopkins and one of the original four</v>

1753
01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:28.250
<v Speaker 1>horsemen.</v>

1754
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:32.240
<v Speaker 1>So the four main physicians that</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically have shaped medicine in this</v>

1755
01:17:32.241 --> 01:17:35.180
<v Speaker 1>country all started out at Hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh Oh,</v>

1756
01:17:35.181 --> 01:17:38.510
<v Speaker 1>slur in medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopkins in surgery and two other guys,</v>

1757
01:17:38.511 --> 01:17:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Walsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm blanking on the,</v>

1758
01:17:39.861 --> 01:17:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Kelly was the third one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1759
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:46.940
<v Speaker 1>and he basically figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you gotta remember like there was</v>

1760
01:17:46.941 --> 01:17:50.660
<v Speaker 1>a day when surgery was staggeringly</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbaric.</v>

1761
01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Like prior to ether surgery was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1762
01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:58.070
<v Speaker 1>can you hold them down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like gag him,</v>

1763
01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:00.740
<v Speaker 1>get him drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gag him and like we're gonna do our</v>

1764
01:18:00.741 --> 01:18:03.530
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1765
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to know all of this shit.</v>

1766
01:18:06.951 --> 01:18:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember any of the exact dates</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

1767
01:18:08.811 --> 01:18:13.811
<v Speaker 1>but it was like kind of like mid 18</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds to late 18 hundreds when up at</v>

1768
01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts General Hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the name of who it was,</v>

1769
01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 1>but someone basically came up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>ether.</v>

1770
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.920
<v Speaker 1>So ether became the first form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anesthetic.</v>

1771
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:24.170
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were sort of knocking people out.</v>

1772
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1773
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:26.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast forward probably 20,</v>

1774
01:18:26.361 --> 01:18:30.650
<v Speaker 1>30 years when Halstad figured out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing called cocaine could provide</v>

1775
01:18:30.651 --> 01:18:33.830
<v Speaker 1>local anesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he began experimenting with like</v>

1776
01:18:33.831 --> 01:18:37.460
<v Speaker 1>crazy and of course in the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>became patently addicted to it.</v>

1777
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:42.880
<v Speaker 1>So you have this entire generation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeons at Hopkins from that early era</v>

1778
01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.250
<v Speaker 1>that were completely coke addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so halstead and all of his first</v>

1779
01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:48.300
<v Speaker 1>generation of residents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1780
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.890
<v Speaker 1>and then of course from that we got</v>
<v Speaker 1>lidacain be pivot cane,</v>

1781
01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:55.280
<v Speaker 1>all of these things that don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same properties.</v>

1782
01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:58.450
<v Speaker 1>But to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine is still used and,</v>

1783
01:18:58.451 --> 01:19:01.340
<v Speaker 1>and most people don't realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cocaine's a schedule two drug</v>

1784
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.410
<v Speaker 1>meaning it actually has a medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>application.</v>

1785
01:19:03.411 --> 01:19:05.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm like heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is scheduled one and the dea and</v>

1786
01:19:05.961 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1787
01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:08.630
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1788
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 1>the cocaine is schedule two and it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>still used in some ent surgery,</v>

1789
01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it has some favorable properties</v>

1790
01:19:14.901 --> 01:19:17.360
<v Speaker 1>over even lidocaine and Bupivacaine for</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasal surgery.</v>

1791
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that they still use cocoa</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves for flavor and Coca Cola?</v>

1792
01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 1>They actually extract the cocaine from</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1793
01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Use the coca leaves and the cocaine goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to medical for,</v>

1794
01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had cocoa tea for my first time,</v>

1795
01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:30.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this summer.</v>

1796
01:19:30.681 --> 01:19:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Like real Kokoda Latte,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like brought up from my coco.</v>

1797
01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1798
01:19:35.801 --> 01:19:38.120
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not get enough of that stuff.</v>

1799
01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:41.780
<v Speaker 1>You can't shut the fuck up on it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird sort of high.</v>

1800
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:45.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very talkative sort of high.</v>

1801
01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just everything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like just for Cheetah leaves.</v>

1802
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.570
<v Speaker 1>You ever done that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in Peru or no?</v>

1803
01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:51.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never done it either,</v>

1804
01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:53.900
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it's really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1805
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:57.620
<v Speaker 1>it's like a coffee sort of a thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got flavonoids.</v>

1806
01:19:57.621 --> 01:19:59.000
<v Speaker 1>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1807
01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:00.950
<v Speaker 1>it's actually probably healthy for you.</v>

1808
01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I just love plants in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think of the coca leaves as producing</v>

1809
01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.360
<v Speaker 1>cocaine we think of as inherently</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>

1810
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:13.350
<v Speaker 1>But the leaf itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you just don't extract it,</v>

1811
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:15.280
<v Speaker 1>it's actually really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing.</v>

1812
01:20:15.281 --> 01:20:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean I and that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like thinking about the difference</v>

1813
01:20:17.701 --> 01:20:22.230
<v Speaker 1>between eating fruit versus eating Oreos</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sugar.</v>

1814
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like nature's pretty good at regulating</v>

1815
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.560
<v Speaker 1>how fast this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the case of fruit,</v>

1816
01:20:28.561 --> 01:20:31.170
<v Speaker 1>like how quickly does fructose hit your</v>
<v Speaker 1>liver?</v>

1817
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a sort of governor built into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1818
01:20:33.601 --> 01:20:37.050
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating raspberries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like could you get nonalcoholic fatty</v>

1819
01:20:37.051 --> 01:20:38.730
<v Speaker 1>liver disease from eating enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>raspberries?</v>

1820
01:20:38.731 --> 01:20:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

1821
01:20:39.721 --> 01:20:43.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's like go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You needed to become a full time job.</v>

1822
01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Or you could just drink a giant gallon</v>
<v Speaker 1>of orange juice every day.</v>

1823
01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.050
<v Speaker 1>If that would do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do it.</v>

1824
01:20:48.130 --> 01:20:51.960
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot quicker because most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think of fresh squeezed orange</v>

1825
01:20:51.961 --> 01:20:52.950
<v Speaker 1>juice as being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1826
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.030
<v Speaker 1>you're eating healthy.</v>

1827
01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at you over there with your fresh</v>

1828
01:20:55.651 --> 01:20:57.870
<v Speaker 1>squeezed on your juicing as totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

1829
01:20:57.871 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 1>super healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile you're just drinking a big old</v>

1830
01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:03.060
<v Speaker 1>glass of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You literally,</v>

1831
01:21:03.061 --> 01:21:05.310
<v Speaker 1>your body doesn't know the difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between that and a Coke Cola.</v>

1832
01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Very little difference between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

1833
01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Cole's got some other stuff in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caffeine.</v>

1834
01:21:10.621 --> 01:21:13.020
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the sugar itself.</v>

1835
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your liver would have a hard time</v>

1836
01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:16.710
<v Speaker 1>telling the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

1837
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Most people would think a glass of</v>
<v Speaker 1>orange juice at breakfast as a healthy</v>

1838
01:21:21.331 --> 01:21:22.650
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1839
01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Glass of champagne from mountain dew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It might be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might get more shit done.</v>

1841
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this a,</v>

1842
01:21:31.021 --> 01:21:35.070
<v Speaker 1>the dosage of one five and then 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1843
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.840
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that study,</v>

1844
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:38.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading that and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1845
01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:40.530
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at that study,</v>

1846
01:21:40.531 --> 01:21:42.510
<v Speaker 1>you realize if you're going to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo,</v>

1847
01:21:42.511 --> 01:21:45.030
<v Speaker 1>the one a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the five once a week or the 20 once a</v>

1848
01:21:45.031 --> 01:21:47.190
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the five once a week was the way to go.</v>

1849
01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:48.750
<v Speaker 1>And cause you got sweet spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1850
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:53.190
<v Speaker 1>You got all the benefit of 20 more</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit than one and the fewest side</v>

1851
01:21:53.191 --> 01:21:55.470
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how long has this study,</v>

1852
01:21:55.620 --> 01:22:00.390
<v Speaker 1>that was an eight week intervention with</v>
<v Speaker 1>an eight week wash out was enough to see</v>

1853
01:22:00.391 --> 01:22:04.440
<v Speaker 1>the enhanced immunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that a longer term study is</v>

1854
01:22:04.441 --> 01:22:07.830
<v Speaker 1>necessary to see like what the body</v>
<v Speaker 1>adapts?</v>

1855
01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1856
01:22:08.941 --> 01:22:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean all this stuff is in its infancy</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1857
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:12.540
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my shtick is,</v>

1858
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1859
01:22:14.461 --> 01:22:16.380
<v Speaker 1>so right now wrapping my son's off</v>
<v Speaker 1>patent,</v>

1860
01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the drug was approved in [inaudible]</v>

1861
01:22:18.021 --> 01:22:21.480
<v Speaker 1>99 by the FDA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is after an unbelievable,</v>

1862
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.420
<v Speaker 1>amazing story of like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1863
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:27.120
<v Speaker 1>this drug almost got lost forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1864
01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:28.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1865
01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.380
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is no economic incentive for a</v>

1866
01:22:31.381 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 1>company to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1867
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.840
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to do this thing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapamycin.</v>

1868
01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even ever alignments.</v>

1869
01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately Novartis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm saying this with no actual</v>

1870
01:22:40.591 --> 01:22:42.330
<v Speaker 1>knowledge other than just my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation,</v>

1871
01:22:42.331 --> 01:22:44.520
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect Novartis was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1872
01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:46.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to play this game just</v>

1873
01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:49.260
<v Speaker 1>with ever alignments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's I think why it probably spun</v>

1874
01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:51.830
<v Speaker 1>into this other company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a restore bio to,</v>

1875
01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:55.050
<v Speaker 1>to sort of combine it with other agents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1876
01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.440
<v Speaker 1>but at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at an n of one level,</v>

1877
01:22:58.441 --> 01:23:01.860
<v Speaker 1>what I'm kind of interested in doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1878
01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:04.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using myself as a Guinea pig to start to</v>

1879
01:23:04.561 --> 01:23:09.010
<v Speaker 1>measure the benefits of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because my hypothesis is three things</v>

1880
01:23:09.011 --> 01:23:13.090
<v Speaker 1>have to be true if rapamycin is working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could be wrong,</v>

1881
01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.520
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is my hypothesis and this is</v>

1882
01:23:15.521 --> 01:23:16.480
<v Speaker 1>what I test with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1883
01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:19.870
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other scientists is if you were</v>

1884
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:21.880
<v Speaker 1>taking ramp in mice in at the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>dose,</v>

1885
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:23.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so assume you're not getting all the</v>

1886
01:23:23.981 --> 01:23:26.080
<v Speaker 1>nasty side effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting the mouth sores and</v>

1887
01:23:26.081 --> 01:23:26.710
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1888
01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Three things have to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1889
01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:33.040
<v Speaker 1>your glucose metabolism should at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>get no worse but potentially better.</v>

1890
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I suspect it's a function of where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

1891
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:40.150
<v Speaker 1>So there is one doctor in New York who</v>
<v Speaker 1>has like a rap on mice and practice.</v>

1892
01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I think he's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in the bronx actually.</v>

1893
01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 1>And I've talked to him a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he,</v>

1894
01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:52.420
<v Speaker 1>when he started at himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said like the improvements were</v>

1895
01:23:52.421 --> 01:23:54.700
<v Speaker 1>remarkable just in terms of glucose</v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolism,</v>

1896
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.890
<v Speaker 1>but I think he was starting at a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad spot.</v>

1897
01:23:56.891 --> 01:23:58.570
<v Speaker 1>But if maybe you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took it,</v>

1898
01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:02.200
<v Speaker 1>we might not notice much getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we definitely should not get worse.</v>

1899
01:24:02.201 --> 01:24:06.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's easy to measure clinically do</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an oral glucose tolerance test would</v>

1900
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:10.030
<v Speaker 1>give you that answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But two things should get significantly</v>

1901
01:24:10.031 --> 01:24:12.070
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is immune function should get</v>

1902
01:24:12.071 --> 01:24:13.360
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Worse.</v>

1903
01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:16.030
<v Speaker 1>There is no clinical way to measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1904
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:19.780
<v Speaker 1>but we do know how to measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I was doing my post doc,</v>

1905
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:23.290
<v Speaker 1>it was in an immunology lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know how to do that as say I just</v>

1906
01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:26.410
<v Speaker 1>don't have like $1 million worth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment to measure it.</v>

1907
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference in the dosage</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the high end at 20 versus what</v>

1908
01:24:30.431 --> 01:24:33.040
<v Speaker 1>you would give someone if they got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kidney transplant?</v>

1909
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical transplant dose would have been</v>

1910
01:24:35.411 --> 01:24:37.810
<v Speaker 1>like two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three milligrams every day.</v>

1911
01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite a bit different.</v>

1912
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:44.560
<v Speaker 1>It is and it's different on two levels</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know when you're giving it</v>

1913
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:48.010
<v Speaker 1>every day at a lower dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stint still end up producing tissue</v>

1914
01:24:48.011 --> 01:24:52.030
<v Speaker 1>levels that might even be comparable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that person was getting with the</v>

1915
01:24:52.031 --> 01:24:56.050
<v Speaker 1>spike of 20 and in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't always true,</v>

1916
01:24:56.051 --> 01:25:00.220
<v Speaker 1>but in general in pharmacology side</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects are the result of certain side</v>

1917
01:25:00.221 --> 01:25:03.400
<v Speaker 1>effects are the result of the nadir dose</v>
<v Speaker 1>and certain side effects of the result</v>

1918
01:25:03.401 --> 01:25:04.270
<v Speaker 1>of the peak dose.</v>

1919
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:06.580
<v Speaker 1>So with every drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to understand this a</v>

1920
01:25:06.581 --> 01:25:08.850
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But going back to this rap at mycenae</v>

1921
01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:11.680
<v Speaker 1>thing and the third thing that has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>true in my opinion,</v>

1922
01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.740
<v Speaker 1>it could be full of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the third thing that has to</v>

1923
01:25:14.741 --> 01:25:17.770
<v Speaker 1>be true if you're taking the right dose</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you need to see an uptick in</v>

1924
01:25:17.771 --> 01:25:20.530
<v Speaker 1>autophagy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1925
01:25:20.531 --> 01:25:23.350
<v Speaker 1>so just as if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that mean a toffee is this process</v>

1926
01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:26.080
<v Speaker 1>where the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cells start eating themselves.</v>

1927
01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:29.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of like a programmed cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

1928
01:25:29.230 --> 01:25:32.290
<v Speaker 1>although technically we reserve that</v>
<v Speaker 1>term for something called apoptosis.</v>

1929
01:25:32.530 --> 01:25:34.840
<v Speaker 1>But when you're fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

1930
01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.480
<v Speaker 1>why would fasting produce a benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1931
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I think the most logical explanation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhanced the toffee g.</v>

1932
01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:45.670
<v Speaker 1>So the body basically has to prioritize</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of nutrients,</v>

1933
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:50.380
<v Speaker 1>the underperforming cells are basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>told each herself and you know,</v>

1934
01:25:50.381 --> 01:25:51.970
<v Speaker 1>we can recycle some of your components.</v>

1935
01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this mitochondria is worth saving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This golgi apparatus is worth saving.</v>

1936
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:59.200
<v Speaker 1>And then we selectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we refeed repopulate the better</v>

1937
01:25:59.201 --> 01:26:01.780
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in many ways I think wrap mice and</v>

1938
01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:05.690
<v Speaker 1>can do that in a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is we don't have a blood</v>

1939
01:26:05.691 --> 01:26:07.780
<v Speaker 1>test to measure autophagy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>

1940
01:26:07.781 --> 01:26:09.200
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lab,</v>

1941
01:26:09.201 --> 01:26:12.230
<v Speaker 1>when you measure autophagy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need muscle biopsies or they</v>

1942
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:14.210
<v Speaker 1>typically even just sacrifice the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

1943
01:26:14.490 --> 01:26:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has become a very hot area.</v>

1944
01:26:16.101 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 1>So the Nobel prize in medicine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>physiology was awarded for the genetic,</v>

1945
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:23.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the elucidation of the genetic</v>

1946
01:26:23.931 --> 01:26:25.730
<v Speaker 1>regulation of Autophagy in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1947
01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:28.850
<v Speaker 1>actually it's 2016 so it's very recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a year and a half ago.</v>

1948
01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:30.560
<v Speaker 1>This is what the Nobel prize was awarded</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1949
01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:34.850
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm hoping is that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop a signature for autophagy with a</v>

1950
01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:38.720
<v Speaker 1>blood test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe that you should be able to</v>

1951
01:26:38.721 --> 01:26:43.721
<v Speaker 1>look at someone's blood and look at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the metabolomics,</v>

1952
01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.480
<v Speaker 1>all of the small molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the proteome.</v>

1953
01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:51.110
<v Speaker 1>And there should be a signature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should look different from the way we</v>

1954
01:26:51.111 --> 01:26:52.100
<v Speaker 1>look when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1955
01:26:52.101 --> 01:26:54.830
<v Speaker 1>fast it or read a story fully fed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

1956
01:26:54.831 --> 01:26:57.620
<v Speaker 1>would you just take a sample of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle tissue,</v>

1957
01:26:57.621 --> 01:26:59.420
<v Speaker 1>like punch something out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1958
01:26:59.550 --> 01:27:00.320
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

1959
01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to do at all and I probably</v>

1960
01:27:02.241 --> 01:27:03.710
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just trying to get what's called</v>

1961
01:27:03.711 --> 01:27:07.220
<v Speaker 1>an irb and institutional review board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to do these kinds of studies in</v>

1962
01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:09.980
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I'm the only subject and it's</v>

1963
01:27:09.981 --> 01:27:12.080
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you do to me type of</v>

1964
01:27:12.081 --> 01:27:13.670
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still have to get an irb.</v>

1965
01:27:13.671 --> 01:27:18.671
<v Speaker 1>So we're working on getting an n of one</v>
<v Speaker 1>irb so that we can take muscle biopsies,</v>

1966
01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:21.710
<v Speaker 1>fat biopsies for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood tests,</v>

1967
01:27:21.711 --> 01:27:24.410
<v Speaker 1>and then start to actually look for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>signature.</v>

1968
01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Would it vary in where you got it from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like would you want your muscles yeah,</v>

1969
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:29.720
<v Speaker 1>more than one muscle group?</v>

1970
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:31.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer.</v>

1971
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1972
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:35.750
<v Speaker 1>I probably have to talk to people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of experience doing this with</v>

1973
01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:36.750
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

1974
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.650
<v Speaker 1>it actually wouldn't surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I were going to do it,</v>

1975
01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I would just start in the legs because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the muscles in the legs tend to be the</v>

1976
01:27:44.811 --> 01:27:46.550
<v Speaker 1>harbinger of what's going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

1977
01:27:46.551 --> 01:27:47.151
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1978
01:27:47.151 --> 01:27:51.170
<v Speaker 1>one of the first signs of diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a decade before you get diabetes.</v>

1979
01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.760
<v Speaker 1>One thing that if you're actually doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of testing in people it you'll</v>

1980
01:27:55.761 --> 01:27:57.920
<v Speaker 1>notice glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insulin resistance,</v>

1981
01:27:57.921 --> 01:28:01.610
<v Speaker 1>and the muscles of the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once the legs start to get insulin</v>

1982
01:28:01.611 --> 01:28:04.160
<v Speaker 1>resistant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on a glide path to bad things</v>

1983
01:28:04.161 --> 01:28:07.880
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by legs first of all,</v>

1984
01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:12.140
<v Speaker 1>from years of martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because over the last year or</v>

1985
01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:16.040
<v Speaker 1>so I've been doing a lot of running and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the only muscle groups that</v>

1986
01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:17.360
<v Speaker 1>I could work out every day.</v>

1987
01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can run hills every day and I'm not</v>

1988
01:28:22.731 --> 01:28:26.660
<v Speaker 1>sore like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not even possible for any other</v>

1989
01:28:26.661 --> 01:28:27.471
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1990
01:28:27.471 --> 01:28:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of do that with boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can hit the bag and as far as like</v>

1991
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Ryan hills is essentially like</v>
<v Speaker 1>plyometrics,</v>

1992
01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:39.140
<v Speaker 1>like you're pushing your entire weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and then you're catching with the</v>

1993
01:28:39.141 --> 01:28:41.990
<v Speaker 1>other leg and pushing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that with,</v>

1994
01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:44.780
<v Speaker 1>you can't bench press every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking arms would fall off.</v>

1995
01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:47.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably someone out there doing</v>

1996
01:28:47.451 --> 01:28:48.470
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's proven me wrong,</v>

1997
01:28:48.471 --> 01:28:51.320
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing like the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance that you have in your life,</v>

1998
01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but it can just be an adaptation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had as well.</v>

1999
01:28:54.021 --> 01:28:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a competitive cyclist,</v>

2000
01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were definitely days when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

2001
01:29:00.111 --> 01:29:03.090
<v Speaker 1>especially when we did like multi day</v>
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>

2002
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:06.720
<v Speaker 1>like there were days when it's just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're beaten down.</v>

2003
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2004
01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.270
<v Speaker 1>You're going to learn in the first 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

2005
01:29:09.271 --> 01:29:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody else is riding together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're riding alone.</v>

2006
01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:15.720
<v Speaker 1>The fatigue level though is</v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly different than it</v>

2007
01:29:15.721 --> 01:29:18.660
<v Speaker 1>different than it would be if you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something with your arms every</v>

2008
01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:19.650
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like your ability to,</v>

2009
01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you can definitely recruit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably part of it.</v>

2010
01:29:22.330 --> 01:29:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Like more tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have more options like you</v>

2011
01:29:25.411 --> 01:29:25.950
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2012
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 1>especially if you really have good</v>
<v Speaker 1>proprioception.</v>

2013
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:30.060
<v Speaker 1>But for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're dead lifting,</v>

2014
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:32.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think,</v>

2015
01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:34.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2016
01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:36.030
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know how you have like the</v>

2017
01:29:36.031 --> 01:29:37.860
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentric,</v>

2018
01:29:37.861 --> 01:29:41.790
<v Speaker 1>eccentric motion of a weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're willing to do away with the</v>

2019
01:29:41.791 --> 01:29:45.690
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can lift heavy every single day.</v>

2020
01:29:45.691 --> 01:29:47.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's this guy named Ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2021
01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:49.580
<v Speaker 1>unfreaking believable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do,</v>

2022
01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2023
01:29:51.181 --> 01:29:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2024
01:29:52.081 --> 01:29:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Andre Galvao on his instagram the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day was doing dead lifts and just</v>

2025
01:29:55.621 --> 01:29:56.550
<v Speaker 1>dropping the weight.</v>

2026
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems weird to me.</v>

2027
01:29:57.961 --> 01:30:00.330
<v Speaker 1>So when I was a cyclist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was my training,</v>

2028
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was all put together by this guy</v>

2029
01:30:02.191 --> 01:30:04.500
<v Speaker 1>named Ryan flarity who actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced,</v>

2030
01:30:04.501 --> 01:30:07.530
<v Speaker 1>that was another one of my sight unseen</v>
<v Speaker 1>introductions to tim for a podcast.</v>

2031
01:30:07.531 --> 01:30:09.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a great podcast with Ryan flaherty</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2032
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:12.510
<v Speaker 1>and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call him the guru of speed.</v>

2033
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.570
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a guy who likes singlehandedly,</v>

2034
01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say singlehandedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's on the shoulders of many</v>

2035
01:30:17.881 --> 01:30:20.100
<v Speaker 1>other people who have done great work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2036
01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has really done an amazing job at</v>

2037
01:30:22.621 --> 01:30:24.450
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to make people run</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

2038
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2039
01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:29.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a very long story and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does such a great job on the podcast.</v>

2040
01:30:29.911 --> 01:30:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I won't go into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2041
01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:34.710
<v Speaker 1>but for the purpose of this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of our interest was,</v>

2042
01:30:34.711 --> 01:30:36.390
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could we translate everything you've</v>

2043
01:30:36.391 --> 01:30:38.610
<v Speaker 1>learned about sprinting into cycling?</v>

2044
01:30:39.330 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 1>And his biggest observation was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>following.</v>

2045
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.390
<v Speaker 1>If he took a hundred runners and lined</v>
<v Speaker 1>them up and new,</v>

2046
01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:48.330
<v Speaker 1>like before they ran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew how,</v>

2047
01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.180
<v Speaker 1>how hard they could hit a force plate</v>
<v Speaker 1>treadmill.</v>

2048
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:53.850
<v Speaker 1>He could predict the order in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd finished the race.</v>

2049
01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.940
<v Speaker 1>So force plate treadmill as its name</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests a treadmill,</v>

2050
01:30:57.060 --> 01:31:02.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's a special treadmill where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>measures the force that you hit and that</v>

2051
01:31:02.161 --> 01:31:04.740
<v Speaker 1>the higher that number divided by your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodyweight,</v>

2052
01:31:04.770 --> 01:31:07.620
<v Speaker 1>that became what he described as mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific force.</v>

2053
01:31:07.890 --> 01:31:11.400
<v Speaker 1>That number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you rank order it is the order in</v>

2054
01:31:11.401 --> 01:31:15.600
<v Speaker 1>which people would finish the run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of makes sense if you think</v>

2055
01:31:15.601 --> 01:31:15.991
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2056
01:31:15.991 --> 01:31:18.480
<v Speaker 1>The harder you can hit the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>relative to your own weight,</v>

2057
01:31:18.481 --> 01:31:21.780
<v Speaker 1>the higher you go and the higher you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the longer you traveled with each</v>

2058
01:31:21.781 --> 01:31:25.620
<v Speaker 1>stride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you saying bolt has the highest ever</v>

2059
01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:28.350
<v Speaker 1>force plate measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2060
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:32.280
<v Speaker 1>calculation and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what his ratio is.</v>

2061
01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I want to say he's like 6.9 or seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>times more force than his body weight</v>

2062
01:31:38.701 --> 01:31:41.730
<v Speaker 1>every time he hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if fricking staggering.</v>

2063
01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then Ryan's,</v>

2064
01:31:43.711 --> 01:31:45.750
<v Speaker 1>once he figured all this stuff out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his next question,</v>

2065
01:31:45.751 --> 01:31:47.310
<v Speaker 1>this is when he was working at USA</v>
<v Speaker 1>track.</v>

2066
01:31:47.311 --> 01:31:49.200
<v Speaker 1>His next question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you train this?</v>

2067
01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:50.970
<v Speaker 1>In other words like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2068
01:31:50.971 --> 01:31:55.971
<v Speaker 1>if Joe runs a 4.9 40 and we want to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>that down to a four five can that be</v>

2069
01:31:57.991 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 1>done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out the answer was</v>

2070
01:32:00.311 --> 01:32:03.550
<v Speaker 1>categorically yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do two things.</v>

2071
01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:05.830
<v Speaker 1>You have to get stronger and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get lighter.</v>

2072
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.470
<v Speaker 1>So how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when he came up with this</v>

2073
01:32:08.471 --> 01:32:12.250
<v Speaker 1>idea of we do hex bar dead lifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lift really heavy.</v>

2074
01:32:12.251 --> 01:32:14.200
<v Speaker 1>So you're only doing fives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fours,</v>

2075
01:32:14.201 --> 01:32:16.630
<v Speaker 1>threes or twos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never more than five reps.</v>

2076
01:32:16.930 --> 01:32:21.070
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll do five sets every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and you'll pick it.</v>

2077
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:22.810
<v Speaker 1>So some days it will be five sets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2078
01:32:22.811 --> 01:32:24.910
<v Speaker 1>some days it's five sets of five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

2079
01:32:25.090 --> 01:32:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And you're off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're very well prescribed.</v>

2080
01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Like you know at what percentage of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>one rep Max you're doing these APP and</v>

2081
01:32:31.811 --> 01:32:34.270
<v Speaker 1>it's up drop up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop up,</v>

2082
01:32:34.271 --> 01:32:37.750
<v Speaker 1>drop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're never getting the Actin myosin</v>

2083
01:32:37.751 --> 01:32:41.620
<v Speaker 1>filament to tear pass because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happening in the negative is the</v>

2084
01:32:41.621 --> 01:32:46.270
<v Speaker 1>act and the act acting is coming off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>myosin and that is creating a micro tear</v>

2085
01:32:46.271 --> 01:32:47.950
<v Speaker 1>in the muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the muscle rebuilt.</v>

2086
01:32:47.951 --> 01:32:50.260
<v Speaker 1>That's why we get larger when we lift</v>
<v Speaker 1>weights.</v>

2087
01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:54.100
<v Speaker 1>But when you drop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you unload the muscle when you're</v>

2088
01:32:54.101 --> 01:32:56.920
<v Speaker 1>relaxing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the is not going to get bigger.</v>

2089
01:32:57.220 --> 01:32:59.320
<v Speaker 1>So you're getting all the benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the strength,</v>

2090
01:32:59.321 --> 01:33:02.470
<v Speaker 1>which is primarily around the type two b</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle fiber,</v>

2091
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:05.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and without the,</v>

2092
01:33:05.591 --> 01:33:06.490
<v Speaker 1>without the size.</v>

2093
01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.410
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2094
01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:08.710
<v Speaker 1>when I asked Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2095
01:33:08.711 --> 01:33:10.630
<v Speaker 1>could we do this in cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did this experiment,</v>

2096
01:33:10.631 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of came up with,</v>

2097
01:33:12.311 --> 01:33:14.940
<v Speaker 1>this was for me and two other guys who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were very good cyclists.</v>

2098
01:33:14.941 --> 01:33:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a popper.</v>

2099
01:33:16.181 --> 01:33:18.490
<v Speaker 1>But these guys were like cat one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cat,</v>

2100
01:33:18.491 --> 01:33:22.060
<v Speaker 1>two collegiate cyclers cyclists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they were like my training partners.</v>

2101
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:26.530
<v Speaker 1>So we did this thing where we did the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same routine that he had the sprinters</v>

2102
01:33:26.531 --> 01:33:27.850
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a bit more complicated than</v>

2103
01:33:27.851 --> 01:33:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I've described because you're also</v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposing the positive only with</v>

2104
01:33:32.621 --> 01:33:35.050
<v Speaker 1>something called a post activation</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentiation,</v>

2105
01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:37.210
<v Speaker 1>which you may have already experienced</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2106
01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:40.570
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if you've ever tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do plyometrics after deadlifting,</v>

2107
01:33:41.050 --> 01:33:43.570
<v Speaker 1>but it seems counterintuitive that you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to do more,</v>

2108
01:33:43.571 --> 01:33:45.490
<v Speaker 1>but you can really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2109
01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:49.510
<v Speaker 1>it has to be a heavy dead lift and</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes of numbers or no more in</v>

2110
01:33:49.511 --> 01:33:51.520
<v Speaker 1>terms of distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like more in terms of vertical.</v>

2111
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.960
<v Speaker 1>So your highest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2112
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:56.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like plyometric jump is going to come</v>

2113
01:33:56.861 --> 01:33:58.840
<v Speaker 1>after you've done like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2114
01:33:58.841 --> 01:34:01.620
<v Speaker 1>three sets of three at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2115
01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:05.940
<v Speaker 1>95% of your one rep Max three sets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>three dropping or using essential.</v>

2116
01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:06.843
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

2117
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:08.103
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2118
01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we would super set the</v>

2119
01:34:10.451 --> 01:34:14.350
<v Speaker 1>plyometrics with the dead lifts and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do this every day.</v>

2120
01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And I'm so Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2121
01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:19.570
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he runs a training camp where he has,</v>

2122
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:22.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically the top 10 college prospects</v>

2123
01:34:22.541 --> 01:34:24.910
<v Speaker 1>every year just before the NFL combine</v>
<v Speaker 1>come down.</v>

2124
01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:28.300
<v Speaker 1>And I mean the changes he makes in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2125
01:34:28.301 --> 01:34:30.790
<v Speaker 1>like Johnny Menzel was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously Johnny Menzel has</v>

2126
01:34:30.791 --> 01:34:31.960
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2127
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:34.720
<v Speaker 1>not panned out in the pros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people kind of forget how good</v>

2128
01:34:34.721 --> 01:34:37.960
<v Speaker 1>an athlete he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he showed up to camp,</v>

2129
01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I forget what his time was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to say it was about,</v>

2130
01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could probably look this up for me.</v>

2131
01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:48.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was three tenths slower than what he</v>

2132
01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:49.990
<v Speaker 1>ultimately ran at the combine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

2133
01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I think he had the fastest or second</v>
<v Speaker 1>fastest quarterback time at the combine</v>

2134
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:56.500
<v Speaker 1>after just 12 weeks of doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2135
01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was unbelievable</v>

2136
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 3>how fast he can get these guys to run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw something the other day that I'd</v>

2137
01:35:02.331 --> 01:35:04.970
<v Speaker 3>never seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an East centric bike.</v>

2138
01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.010
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it changes back and forth.</v>

2139
01:35:07.011 --> 01:35:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Heard of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the second person to tell me</v>

2140
01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:10.700
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I saw it yesterday.</v>

2141
01:35:10.701 --> 01:35:12.350
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that I think about it,</v>

2142
01:35:12.351 --> 01:35:14.670
<v Speaker 3>it was east sensor can concentric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

2143
01:35:14.671 --> 01:35:16.070
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it alternates.</v>

2144
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:16.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2145
01:35:16.451 --> 01:35:17.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>

2146
01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.110
<v Speaker 3>it looked really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

2147
01:35:19.111 --> 01:35:21.740
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it forces movement and you're resisting</v>

2148
01:35:21.741 --> 01:35:23.720
<v Speaker 3>the movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find that Jamie.</v>

2149
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:26.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like an East centric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it's called,</v>

2150
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:29.090
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone sent me this like,</v>

2151
01:35:29.091 --> 01:35:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing is amazing.</v>

2152
01:35:30.261 --> 01:35:31.190
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a bike.</v>

2153
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:33.530
<v Speaker 3>The fuck you talking about look</v>
<v Speaker 3>different than that.</v>

2154
01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:35.800
<v Speaker 3>The one I saw was also different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked,</v>

2155
01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.550
<v Speaker 3>it was a wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was like a recumbent.</v>

2156
01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2157
01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:40.220
<v Speaker 3>That's what I saw too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2158
01:35:40.570 --> 01:35:41.750
<v Speaker 3>He centric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2159
01:35:41.751 --> 01:35:43.750
<v Speaker 3>You're spelling it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2160
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:45.500
<v Speaker 3>it was coming up though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2161
01:35:45.501 --> 01:35:47.060
<v Speaker 3>it says just centric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2162
01:35:47.061 --> 01:35:48.800
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

2163
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:50.990
<v Speaker 3>East centric exercise bike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try that.</v>

2164
01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:54.920
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the thing is it,</v>

2165
01:35:54.921 --> 01:35:57.850
<v Speaker 3>it alternated between east centric and</v>
<v Speaker 3>concent trick.</v>

2166
01:35:57.851 --> 01:36:02.620
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just the one with the red and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the top row looks like it.</v>

2167
01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.680
<v Speaker 3>What does that pediatric Er Aragon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2168
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:07.570
<v Speaker 3>It's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for little kids.</v>

2169
01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2170
01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:12.610
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had saved it cause I was like,</v>

2171
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:15.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm never buying this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2172
01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:16.830
<v Speaker 3>it just looked interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

2173
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:21.040
<v Speaker 3>there's always these new methods of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulating the body and tricking it</v>

2174
01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:22.450
<v Speaker 3>into doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2175
01:36:22.451 --> 01:36:24.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's essentially what a lot of</v>

2176
01:36:24.431 --> 01:36:26.110
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way a lot of people think of</v>

2177
01:36:26.111 --> 01:36:28.420
<v Speaker 3>intermittent fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of stimulating the body.</v>

2178
01:36:28.421 --> 01:36:29.860
<v Speaker 3>You're hacking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tricking it.</v>

2179
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:30.783
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2180
01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:32.010
<v Speaker 1>and I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2181
01:36:32.011 --> 01:36:36.210
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Ryan and I talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about was could we ever adopt his</v>

2182
01:36:36.211 --> 01:36:39.620
<v Speaker 1>training system to swimming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in,</v>

2183
01:36:39.630 --> 01:36:42.900
<v Speaker 1>in running and cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's primarily going to be quads,</v>

2184
01:36:42.901 --> 01:36:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Hams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glutes have to be the muscles that do</v>

2185
01:36:45.061 --> 01:36:46.660
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in row things like,</v>

2186
01:36:46.661 --> 01:36:47.940
<v Speaker 1>what would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about like,</v>

2187
01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:50.190
<v Speaker 1>you really got to be able to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lats fired,</v>

2188
01:36:50.191 --> 01:36:53.220
<v Speaker 1>but how do you get the last of fire at</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a weight?</v>

2189
01:36:53.370 --> 01:36:56.220
<v Speaker 1>And then without having to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative as well.</v>

2190
01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:59.100
<v Speaker 1>So we just couldn't really kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to do it.</v>

2191
01:36:59.150 --> 01:37:02.700
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we adopted part of his technique to</v>

2192
01:37:02.701 --> 01:37:05.460
<v Speaker 1>swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the actual training routine</v>

2193
01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:08.490
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the big misconceptions,</v>

2194
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:11.910
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to go fast is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to still train slow.</v>

2195
01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:14.520
<v Speaker 1>But the reality of it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2196
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:19.320
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to run a marathon at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2197
01:37:19.321 --> 01:37:23.880
<v Speaker 1>call it a pace of two 15 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world class marathon runner,</v>

2198
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:27.720
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of benefit to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending much time running at a pace</v>

2199
01:37:27.721 --> 01:37:28.560
<v Speaker 1>slower than that.</v>

2200
01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:30.060
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be running slightly faster.</v>

2201
01:37:30.061 --> 01:37:31.230
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know who meb is,</v>

2202
01:37:31.231 --> 01:37:34.290
<v Speaker 1>the American marathoner who won the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston marathon three years ago.</v>

2203
01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:37.420
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So amazing marathon or um,</v>

2204
01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:41.400
<v Speaker 1>he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's the only person to have won</v>

2205
01:37:41.401 --> 01:37:43.440
<v Speaker 1>the New York Marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Boston Marathon,</v>

2206
01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:45.450
<v Speaker 1>and to have won an Olympic medal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon.</v>

2207
01:37:45.451 --> 01:37:48.360
<v Speaker 1>He won a silver medal in the 2004 Athens</v>
<v Speaker 1>Games.</v>

2208
01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:52.920
<v Speaker 1>But when he won the Boston Marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like 38 years old,</v>

2209
01:37:52.921 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 1>which in marathon parlance is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well be a hundred.</v>

2210
01:37:56.610 --> 01:38:00.240
<v Speaker 1>And he had not really had a great race</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the previous few years.</v>

2211
01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:04.200
<v Speaker 1>So he had been effectively written off</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sport and Ryan actually helped</v>

2212
01:38:04.201 --> 01:38:08.190
<v Speaker 1>train them and all they did was apply</v>
<v Speaker 1>this principle of sprinting into</v>

2213
01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:10.690
<v Speaker 1>marathon running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was all right matt,</v>

2214
01:38:10.691 --> 01:38:14.490
<v Speaker 1>if you want to win the Boston Marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be able to travel like four</v>

2215
01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:18.930
<v Speaker 1>inches further with every step you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the same number of steps at the</v>

2216
01:38:18.931 --> 01:38:20.490
<v Speaker 1>same cadence that you currently run.</v>

2217
01:38:21.150 --> 01:38:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2218
01:38:22.111 --> 01:38:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Ryan did the math and said that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're forced number has to go from</v>

2219
01:38:26.131 --> 01:38:29.010
<v Speaker 1>where it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think was 1.7 meaning he could</v>

2220
01:38:29.011 --> 01:38:31.350
<v Speaker 1>only dead lift 1.7 times his body</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

2221
01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:33.720
<v Speaker 1>You have to get that until like 2.6 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2222
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.360
<v Speaker 1>And so when meb train for the Boston</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marathon,</v>

2223
01:38:36.570 --> 01:38:41.220
<v Speaker 1>he was focusing heavily on these dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifts and doing much shorter,</v>

2224
01:38:41.221 --> 01:38:43.680
<v Speaker 1>faster runs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2225
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you watch the video of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston marathon when it's incredible,</v>

2226
01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.750
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just takes off and like leaves</v>

2227
01:38:51.751 --> 01:38:53.730
<v Speaker 1>everybody behind him and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2228
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.080
<v Speaker 1>there's no way he'll be able to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>that up.</v>

2229
01:38:55.081 --> 01:38:56.820
<v Speaker 1>We'll let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they couldn't write them in.</v>

2230
01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that someone's going to</v>

2231
01:39:00.011 --> 01:39:02.010
<v Speaker 1>build a break too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the big,</v>

2232
01:39:02.011 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2233
01:39:03.151 --> 01:39:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Some guy got really close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say?</v>

2234
01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.900
<v Speaker 1>He hit Jamie like two oh six or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2235
01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I think someone's gone closer to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nighttime.</v>

2236
01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Then that guy in Germany last year go</v>
<v Speaker 1>even closer.</v>

2237
01:39:11.461 --> 01:39:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it was two oh two or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>

2238
01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And you think that this sort of method</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what they're using?</v>

2239
01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.150
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if I'm allowed to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you about this stuff publicly.</v>

2240
01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

2241
01:39:22.561 --> 01:39:23.394
<v Speaker 1>No one's listening.</v>

2242
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2243
01:39:27.091 --> 01:39:29.520
<v Speaker 1>so short answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this can be done.</v>

2244
01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything has to be perfect,</v>

2245
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:35.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning you have to have the perfect</v>

2246
01:39:35.551 --> 01:39:39.540
<v Speaker 1>athlete trained to peak at the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2247
01:39:39.541 --> 01:39:41.910
<v Speaker 1>You need the right humidity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything has to fire on all</v>

2248
01:39:41.911 --> 01:39:45.480
<v Speaker 1>cylinders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just as there was nothing</v>

2249
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:49.560
<v Speaker 1>physiologically special about a four</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute mile when Roger bannister broke</v>

2250
01:39:49.561 --> 01:39:51.480
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more of a psychological barrier.</v>

2251
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2252
01:39:53.670 --> 01:39:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not suggesting for a moment that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this will be easy,</v>

2253
01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get there.</v>

2254
01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean like this can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is incredible.</v>

2255
01:40:01.441 --> 01:40:05.790
<v Speaker 1>If you think about how fast you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>running to run 26 miles in two hours and</v>

2256
01:40:05.791 --> 01:40:06.840
<v Speaker 1>two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Staggering.</v>

2257
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people understand like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2258
01:40:08.881 --> 01:40:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was never a great runner.</v>

2259
01:40:13.051 --> 01:40:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about a two 50 marathon,</v>

2260
01:40:16.141 --> 01:40:19.680
<v Speaker 1>two 55 marathon when I was a boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never trained as a runner.</v>

2261
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Like it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just ran so much and I was pretty</v>

2262
01:40:21.691 --> 01:40:25.950
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like when I think about how hard I</v>

2263
01:40:25.951 --> 01:40:30.780
<v Speaker 1>would have to run to bust out a to 50 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>two 55 and to think like,</v>

2264
01:40:30.781 --> 01:40:33.990
<v Speaker 1>was there any chance I could have ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>got that down to a two 30?</v>

2265
01:40:35.190 --> 01:40:39.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is such an enormous change in pace.</v>

2266
01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.510
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2267
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I ever could have done</v>

2268
01:40:43.081 --> 01:40:45.270
<v Speaker 1>that regardless of all the training</v>
<v Speaker 1>tricks in the world.</v>

2269
01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:47.100
<v Speaker 1>And what kind of diet of those guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>following?</v>

2270
01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know personally I can't speak to what</v>

2271
01:40:51.001 --> 01:40:53.740
<v Speaker 1>the other guys do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of those guys are in</v>

2272
01:40:53.741 --> 01:40:56.890
<v Speaker 1>the state of where I was when they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>

2273
01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Meaning like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can probably get away with a lot</v>

2274
01:40:59.411 --> 01:41:00.520
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2275
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:03.070
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the physiques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if most of these guys,</v>

2276
01:41:03.071 --> 01:41:06.010
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're perfectly built,</v>

2277
01:41:06.011 --> 01:41:08.500
<v Speaker 1>like I'm talking to elite level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about like anyone who runs a</v>

2278
01:41:08.501 --> 01:41:08.800
<v Speaker 1>marathon.</v>

2279
01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.360
<v Speaker 1>But if you're talking about like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were going to win the</v>

2280
01:41:10.361 --> 01:41:15.340
<v Speaker 1>marathons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are basically all engine and then</v>

2281
01:41:15.341 --> 01:41:18.100
<v Speaker 1>chassis in the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically all they come down to.</v>

2282
01:41:18.101 --> 01:41:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are enormous cardiovascular</v>

2283
01:41:21.431 --> 01:41:24.100
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strong quads,</v>

2284
01:41:24.101 --> 01:41:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Hams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glutes,</v>

2285
01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:27.670
<v Speaker 1>and then everything else is very tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say enormous,</v>

2286
01:41:27.671 --> 01:41:30.490
<v Speaker 1>like is literally the size of their law</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you actually look at,</v>

2287
01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:34.180
<v Speaker 1>well I mean it's all relative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at their frame,</v>

2288
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:37.660
<v Speaker 1>their thorax is going to be larger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is it expanded because of the</v>

2289
01:41:37.661 --> 01:41:39.040
<v Speaker 1>training?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2290
01:41:39.041 --> 01:41:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean sense you never know cause and</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

2291
01:41:41.441 --> 01:41:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you could argue like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys were,</v>

2292
01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:47.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe the people who are drawn to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports are the ones that are,</v>

2293
01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:50.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are drawn to come to be elite in those</v>

2294
01:41:50.351 --> 01:41:52.780
<v Speaker 1>sports already had a genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>predisposition.</v>

2295
01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:54.730
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of my feeling is it's a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of both.</v>

2296
01:41:54.731 --> 01:41:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Lance Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have a very large heart.</v>

2297
01:41:57.970 --> 01:42:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2298
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what lance had that was pretty</v>

2299
01:42:03.101 --> 01:42:06.130
<v Speaker 1>unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even amongst the world's best,</v>

2300
01:42:06.190 --> 01:42:08.290
<v Speaker 1>which is what he competed with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2301
01:42:08.770 --> 01:42:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I think his lactate threshold was a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than most people genetically.</v>

2302
01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

2303
01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:15.851
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2304
01:42:15.851 --> 01:42:16.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2305
01:42:16.361 --> 01:42:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I know it's such a controversial topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although my view is I think that every</v>

2306
01:42:20.741 --> 01:42:25.741
<v Speaker 1>single cyclist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least from 1991 till 2011 was on</v>

2307
01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:27.460
<v Speaker 1>highly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly,</v>

2308
01:42:27.730 --> 01:42:29.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>augmented programs.</v>

2309
01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:33.460
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Lance one seven of those years,</v>

2310
01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:34.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

2311
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:37.150
<v Speaker 1>in that context just tells me that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2312
01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training harder and being more specific</v>

2313
01:42:40.481 --> 01:42:41.021
<v Speaker 1>to the race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2314
01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:42.910
<v Speaker 1>what people don't understand is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2315
01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.190
<v Speaker 1>lance only peaked for one race a year.</v>

2316
01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Like everything that that team us postal</v>
<v Speaker 1>did was geared for that one race.</v>

2317
01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also when you really look at how</v>

2318
01:42:53.681 --> 01:42:55.990
<v Speaker 1>much doping they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well actually it wasn't that much.</v>

2319
01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2320
01:42:58.121 --> 01:43:00.910
<v Speaker 1>when they were blood transfusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might've been two units over the</v>

2321
01:43:00.911 --> 01:43:03.550
<v Speaker 1>course of a race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that that wouldn't</v>

2322
01:43:03.551 --> 01:43:04.930
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would help a lot,</v>

2323
01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:09.310
<v Speaker 1>but that's nothing compared to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were doing just a few years</v>

2324
01:43:09.311 --> 01:43:11.380
<v Speaker 1>before lance came along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Lance one,</v>

2325
01:43:11.381 --> 01:43:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I think his first one in [inaudible] 99</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who won before that in</v>

2326
01:43:14.591 --> 01:43:17.320
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 98 was Marco Pantani before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was going to be on,</v>

2327
01:43:17.321 --> 01:43:17.711
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick,</v>

2328
01:43:17.711 --> 01:43:19.960
<v Speaker 1>in 97 and before that was gonna be horn</v>
<v Speaker 1>reese,</v>

2329
01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:23.620
<v Speaker 1>bjorn [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>his nickname was Mr 60 because his</v>

2330
01:43:23.621 --> 01:43:28.621
<v Speaker 1>hematocrit was always over 60.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fricking like how that guy didn't</v>

2331
01:43:28.811 --> 01:43:30.490
<v Speaker 1>die of a stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2332
01:43:30.890 --> 01:43:31.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not from EPO.</v>

2333
01:43:32.170 --> 01:43:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lance never had a credit over 50 to my</v>

2334
01:43:34.841 --> 01:43:38.410
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would basically always titrate with</v>

2335
01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:42.340
<v Speaker 1>EPO and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or hemoglobin up to 50 which was the</v>

2336
01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:43.990
<v Speaker 1>trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2337
01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2338
01:43:45.221 --> 01:43:46.180
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2339
01:43:46.181 --> 01:43:46.841
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

2340
01:43:46.841 --> 01:43:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know lance at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I certainly don't know anything about</v>

2341
01:43:49.481 --> 01:43:52.310
<v Speaker 1>him beyond like the little bits that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had read over time.</v>

2342
01:43:52.311 --> 01:43:55.430
<v Speaker 1>But I do think his lactate tolerance was</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable,</v>

2343
01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:56.930
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2344
01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:58.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we measure lactate in athletes,</v>

2345
01:43:58.851 --> 01:44:00.770
<v Speaker 1>swimmers and cyclists when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2346
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:04.010
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what their</v>
<v Speaker 1>performances and as far as I can tell,</v>

2347
01:44:04.011 --> 01:44:05.810
<v Speaker 1>there are seem to be these two</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenotypes.</v>

2348
01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:09.680
<v Speaker 1>There's the one phenotype where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tolerate staggeringly high amounts</v>

2349
01:44:09.681 --> 01:44:10.740
<v Speaker 1>of lactate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2350
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:13.520
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not lactate per se that is causing</v>

2351
01:44:13.521 --> 01:44:17.180
<v Speaker 1>the pain that you're experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the hydrogen ion that accompanies</v>

2352
01:44:17.181 --> 01:44:18.840
<v Speaker 1>the lactate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2353
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:22.640
<v Speaker 1>so lactic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the acid part of that is a hydrogen ion</v>

2354
01:44:22.641 --> 01:44:26.840
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually what's poisoning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle and preventing the muscle from</v>

2355
01:44:26.841 --> 01:44:30.680
<v Speaker 1>having this effortless Actin Myosin Act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2356
01:44:30.710 --> 01:44:32.330
<v Speaker 1>contract release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

2357
01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:35.420
<v Speaker 1>But we use lactate as a proxy cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're lactate is high,</v>

2358
01:44:35.421 --> 01:44:38.390
<v Speaker 1>the hydrogen ion is high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were some people who can just</v>

2359
01:44:38.391 --> 01:44:40.610
<v Speaker 1>holler rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like incredible doses.</v>

2360
01:44:40.611 --> 01:44:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I used to work with Olympic swimmers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2361
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were just a couple of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like they could actually be</v>

2362
01:44:46.671 --> 01:44:50.480
<v Speaker 1>standing with a lactate of 24 I mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was competing,</v>

2363
01:44:50.481 --> 01:44:55.481
<v Speaker 1>if I had a lactate above 16 or 17 I</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be standing like that was just</v>

2364
01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:58.310
<v Speaker 1>too much pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was on the floor.</v>

2365
01:44:58.370 --> 01:45:03.370
<v Speaker 1>If I was over 17 I was puking and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes that could stand there at 24 I've</v>

2366
01:45:04.650 --> 01:45:06.440
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my good friends,</v>

2367
01:45:06.441 --> 01:45:06.751
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2368
01:45:06.751 --> 01:45:11.751
<v Speaker 1>he won a gold and a silver medal in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sydney Olympics and retired from</v>

2369
01:45:11.991 --> 01:45:14.780
<v Speaker 1>swimming in 2004 then came back to swim</v>
<v Speaker 1>masters.</v>

2370
01:45:14.781 --> 01:45:17.090
<v Speaker 1>So and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually was trying to make a</v>

2371
01:45:17.091 --> 01:45:19.580
<v Speaker 1>comeback to make the 2012 Olympic team.</v>

2372
01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:22.970
<v Speaker 1>And when he was training for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I would poke him between races and</v>

2373
01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I saw him get out of a 402 the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual medley race,</v>

2374
01:45:25.821 --> 01:45:27.770
<v Speaker 1>which is the hardest swim race of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2375
01:45:27.771 --> 01:45:30.770
<v Speaker 1>The 400 I am is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might as well just shoot</v>

2376
01:45:30.771 --> 01:45:31.910
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so painful.</v>

2377
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.350
<v Speaker 1>He got out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had a lactate of 18 two minutes later,</v>

2378
01:45:36.650 --> 01:45:38.270
<v Speaker 1>not two minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe seven minutes,</v>

2379
01:45:38.271 --> 01:45:40.730
<v Speaker 1>they are jumped on the blocks and 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>breast race,</v>

2380
01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:42.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out with a lactate of 21 and that</v>

2381
01:45:42.921 --> 01:45:44.840
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are those guys.</v>

2382
01:45:44.841 --> 01:45:46.520
<v Speaker 1>And then I think at the other end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum,</v>

2383
01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.840
<v Speaker 1>the word on the street is guys like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Phelps or at the opposite end of</v>

2384
01:45:50.841 --> 01:45:55.841
<v Speaker 1>that where they are so efficient at</v>
<v Speaker 1>shuttling lactic acid out of the cell</v>

2385
01:45:57.201 --> 01:46:01.130
<v Speaker 1>back to the liver where this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Cori cycle actually turns</v>

2386
01:46:01.131 --> 01:46:04.880
<v Speaker 1>lactate back into glucose that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>never have high levels of lactate.</v>

2387
01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this is sort of were,</v>

2388
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation because I don't,</v>

2389
01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I think they were very hush hush about</v>
<v Speaker 1>phelps as numbers,</v>

2390
01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:14.630
<v Speaker 1>but I heard from reliable and reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>sources that he would rarely have a</v>

2391
01:46:14.631 --> 01:46:18.050
<v Speaker 1>lactate of of 8.0 including when he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking world records.</v>

2392
01:46:18.330 --> 01:46:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which for me at 8.0 like I'm smoking and</v>

2393
01:46:21.351 --> 01:46:24.490
<v Speaker 1>joking like that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for you know,</v>

2394
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:28.190
<v Speaker 1>he was so efficient at getting rid of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that yeah,</v>

2395
01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:29.150
<v Speaker 1>he could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2396
01:46:29.150 --> 01:46:31.500
<v Speaker 1>set the world record in the 400 I am and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lactate of eight.</v>

2397
01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is true,</v>

2398
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:34.370
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've,</v>

2399
01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:38.060
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly a plausible mechanism</v>
<v Speaker 1>by which it could be,</v>

2400
01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:39.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating that this could</v>

2401
01:46:39.741 --> 01:46:41.510
<v Speaker 1>potentially all be engineered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2402
01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:43.970
<v Speaker 1>That like through use of crispr or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>

2403
01:46:43.971 --> 01:46:48.971
<v Speaker 1>you could take all these various facets</v>
<v Speaker 1>of performance enhancing modalities,</v>

2404
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 1>extend a person's ability and so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways and create a super</v>

2405
01:46:54.151 --> 01:46:54.984
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

2406
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:55.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

2407
01:46:55.621 --> 01:46:56.371
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2408
01:46:56.371 --> 01:46:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Once he started genetically doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could,</v>

2409
01:46:58.591 --> 01:47:00.930
<v Speaker 1>does it become cheating in the same way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like would we,</v>

2410
01:47:00.931 --> 01:47:03.720
<v Speaker 1>would we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have someone like Phelps who has</v>

2411
01:47:03.721 --> 01:47:08.721
<v Speaker 1>this genetic predisposition to getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of lactose lactaid and you take</v>

2412
01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:11.670
<v Speaker 1>someone like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably has none of that and you</v>

2413
01:47:11.671 --> 01:47:13.560
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you juice me up to his level.</v>

2414
01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Is that cheating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is.</v>

2415
01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are the questions.</v>

2416
01:47:18.061 --> 01:47:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why people like Daniel Coyle who</v>

2417
01:47:20.281 --> 01:47:24.390
<v Speaker 1>are so critical of Lance Armstrong say</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause cause on the one hand you'll have</v>

2418
01:47:24.391 --> 01:47:25.171
<v Speaker 1>camps and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2419
01:47:25.171 --> 01:47:27.780
<v Speaker 1>it's the great equalizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why don't we just let everybody</v>

2420
01:47:27.781 --> 01:47:30.660
<v Speaker 1>dope and steroid argument with them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>may as well.</v>

2421
01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Well and and frankly it's more my</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>

2422
01:47:32.970 --> 01:47:35.130
<v Speaker 1>but I have a different reason for</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing that way,</v>

2423
01:47:35.131 --> 01:47:38.820
<v Speaker 1>which is I think having done these</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports and nowhere near at the high</v>

2424
01:47:38.821 --> 01:47:40.110
<v Speaker 1>level that those guys do it.</v>

2425
01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I just know how destructive they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Tour de France is the most</v>

2426
01:47:43.501 --> 01:47:45.090
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy thing on the face of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

2427
01:47:45.150 --> 01:47:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that it's healthier to do to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Tour de France on steroids than it is</v>

2428
01:47:50.161 --> 01:47:53.790
<v Speaker 1>to do it off sterile absa fucking loot</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee.</v>

2429
01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.590
<v Speaker 1>When those guys finish the Tour de</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

2430
01:47:55.591 --> 01:47:58.770
<v Speaker 1>they are osteopenic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean their bone density has eroded</v>

2431
01:47:59.070 --> 01:48:01.470
<v Speaker 1>their muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have lost so much muscle mass.</v>

2432
01:48:01.471 --> 01:48:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is a devastating grueling</v>
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

2433
01:48:04.170 --> 01:48:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Now nothing's going to completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>ameliorate that.</v>

2434
01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:10.140
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we think that like watching these</v>

2435
01:48:10.141 --> 01:48:13.500
<v Speaker 1>guys killed themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>riding six hours a day,</v>

2436
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 1>hitting peak thresholds of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2437
01:48:15.871 --> 01:48:18.720
<v Speaker 1>six watts per kilogram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we think there's anything</v>

2438
01:48:18.721 --> 01:48:21.930
<v Speaker 1>physiologically reasonable about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're out to fucking lunch.</v>

2439
01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.490
<v Speaker 1>But is that the point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2440
01:48:23.491 --> 01:48:27.240
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the point is that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>push your mind to do something your body</v>

2441
01:48:27.241 --> 01:48:29.100
<v Speaker 1>absolutely doesn't want to do.</v>

2442
01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.230
<v Speaker 1>So you should be rewarded for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

2443
01:48:31.770 --> 01:48:33.750
<v Speaker 1>And these guys are in a league of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>

2444
01:48:33.751 --> 01:48:35.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional cyclists for some of the</v>

2445
01:48:35.071 --> 01:48:36.660
<v Speaker 1>toughest athletes out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2446
01:48:36.661 --> 01:48:39.620
<v Speaker 1>obviously every athlete at the peak of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their game is remarkable and,</v>

2447
01:48:39.621 --> 01:48:42.780
<v Speaker 1>and no disrespect to like the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>running back in the NFL,</v>

2448
01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:46.110
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even compare that to what a</v>

2449
01:48:46.111 --> 01:48:48.390
<v Speaker 1>guy does for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for workload for sure.</v>

2450
01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For just the pain,</v>

2451
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:52.250
<v Speaker 1>like the absolute sheer discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2452
01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and the physiologic torture and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>duration of it and all of these other</v>

2453
01:48:55.261 --> 01:48:56.021
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2454
01:48:56.021 --> 01:48:59.150
<v Speaker 1>you see it in their faces to those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when they retired,</v>

2455
01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:01.110
<v Speaker 1>they look like they're 10 years older</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they are.</v>

2456
01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2457
01:49:01.490 --> 01:49:03.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've lost all of the fat.</v>

2458
01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.021
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2459
01:49:04.021 --> 01:49:06.060
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have fat in your face,</v>

2460
01:49:06.061 --> 01:49:09.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean you age dramatically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just look exhausted too.</v>

2461
01:49:09.930 --> 01:49:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's just drained them</v>

2462
01:49:12.391 --> 01:49:15.180
<v Speaker 1>like they've forced to live 30 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of 10.</v>

2463
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:16.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2464
01:49:16.081 --> 01:49:17.760
<v Speaker 1>what if we just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

2465
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's allowed to use whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of EPO,</v>

2466
01:49:20.761 --> 01:49:25.470
<v Speaker 1>blood testosterone to be at the 80th</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile of what we consider normal.</v>

2467
01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:30.500
<v Speaker 1>So everybody is allowed to walk around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a hemoglobin of 14.7 or up to 14.7</v>

2468
01:49:31.141 --> 01:49:33.120
<v Speaker 1>or 15 or cheat that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2469
01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:34.141
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2470
01:49:34.141 --> 01:49:38.580
<v Speaker 1>if you allow people to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think like the,</v>

2471
01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:43.670
<v Speaker 1>the testing on this stuff is so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so jv now there's this idea called</v>

2472
01:49:43.981 --> 01:49:46.440
<v Speaker 1>the biological passport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was introduced many years ago,</v>

2473
01:49:46.441 --> 01:49:47.440
<v Speaker 1>which basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2474
01:49:47.441 --> 01:49:51.370
<v Speaker 1>we're going to develop a signature for</v>
<v Speaker 1>every person and now if you deviate much</v>

2475
01:49:51.371 --> 01:49:53.740
<v Speaker 1>from your signature will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll be the trigger.</v>

2476
01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the argument again by certain</v>

2477
01:49:56.351 --> 01:49:58.270
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think Daniel coyle argued this a</v>

2478
01:49:58.271 --> 01:50:01.840
<v Speaker 1>lot in um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his books that he wrote ripping</v>

2479
01:50:01.841 --> 01:50:04.790
<v Speaker 1>apart lance was the reason.</v>

2480
01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.860
<v Speaker 1>It's the reason doping is unfair because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the everybody does it argument doesn't</v>

2481
01:50:08.861 --> 01:50:13.690
<v Speaker 1>hold water is because if you're a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who naturally lives at a hematocrit of</v>

2482
01:50:13.691 --> 01:50:16.990
<v Speaker 1>47,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only getting a slight improvement</v>

2483
01:50:16.991 --> 01:50:20.410
<v Speaker 1>going from 47 to 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a person who naturally lives</v>

2484
01:50:20.411 --> 01:50:23.590
<v Speaker 1>at 43,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you going from 43 to 50,</v>

2485
01:50:23.591 --> 01:50:27.250
<v Speaker 1>you get a much bigger advantage to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

2486
01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:30.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's true on a relative basis.</v>

2487
01:50:30.551 --> 01:50:33.820
<v Speaker 1>But an absolute level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everybody's walking around with a</v>

2488
01:50:33.821 --> 01:50:37.360
<v Speaker 1>hematocrit of 48 to 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still have the same oxygen carrying</v>

2489
01:50:37.361 --> 01:50:39.460
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does level the playing field.</v>

2490
01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.170
<v Speaker 1>The concern though isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would believe the concern is you don't</v>

2491
01:50:44.171 --> 01:50:48.010
<v Speaker 1>want people to think that the only way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do this sport is to take drugs.</v>

2492
01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Well absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also worth putting in in mind</v>

2493
01:50:52.001 --> 01:50:53.920
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of my pet peeve with</v>

2494
01:50:53.921 --> 01:50:57.100
<v Speaker 1>this whole drug and sport thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

2495
01:50:58.870 --> 01:51:00.190
<v Speaker 1>personally I don't really give a shit.</v>

2496
01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just have bigger things I care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2497
01:51:01.751 --> 01:51:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Then like how many steroids barry bonds</v>
<v Speaker 1>took to hit all those home runs.</v>

2498
01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:08.890
<v Speaker 1>But what really does chap my ass is when</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't actually understand how</v>

2499
01:51:08.891 --> 01:51:10.630
<v Speaker 1>steroids work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2500
01:51:10.631 --> 01:51:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Like it bugs the shit out of me when</v>
<v Speaker 1>people assume that if you take steroids</v>

2501
01:51:15.041 --> 01:51:16.450
<v Speaker 1>you will have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2502
01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you will hit that many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2503
01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:20.890
<v Speaker 1>home runs or you will run this fast or</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift this much.</v>

2504
01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:25.690
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that steroid is doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>enabling you to recover faster from the</v>

2505
01:51:25.691 --> 01:51:29.170
<v Speaker 1>brutal work that it takes to actually do</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

2506
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.880
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

2507
01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:34.840
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I shot myself full of Epo,</v>

2508
01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've probably seen ICARUS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2509
01:51:37.170 --> 01:51:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I thought that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he did it.</v>

2510
01:51:38.441 --> 01:51:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I thought bit Bryan Fogel that prideful</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

2511
01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:43.280
<v Speaker 1>A really good job of showing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2512
01:51:43.281 --> 01:51:46.150
<v Speaker 1>and he was a pretty good responder to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the EPO.</v>

2513
01:51:46.150 --> 01:51:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I think he did a growth hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Testosterone,</v>

2514
01:51:48.341 --> 01:51:52.010
<v Speaker 1>an EPO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you saw in the end of the day he</v>

2515
01:51:52.011 --> 01:51:56.050
<v Speaker 1>f he finished worse the second year</v>
<v Speaker 1>round because his bike ran out of,</v>

2516
01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:57.460
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my point.</v>

2517
01:51:57.461 --> 01:52:01.210
<v Speaker 1>You see like people don't realize like</v>
<v Speaker 1>one little thing makes all the</v>

2518
01:52:01.211 --> 01:52:03.640
<v Speaker 1>difference from a performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint.</v>

2519
01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably would have done a little bit</v>

2520
01:52:04.991 --> 01:52:07.660
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because the drugs were in</v>

2521
01:52:07.661 --> 01:52:09.640
<v Speaker 1>him per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because the drugs that were in him</v>

2522
01:52:09.641 --> 01:52:13.600
<v Speaker 1>allowed to train more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason he was a fitter rider the</v>

2523
01:52:13.601 --> 01:52:18.160
<v Speaker 1>second year was because his watts per</v>
<v Speaker 1>kilo were hired because of how much more</v>

2524
01:52:18.161 --> 01:52:21.190
<v Speaker 1>he trained the drugs enabled him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>train that much harder.</v>

2525
01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it does.</v>

2526
01:52:22.451 --> 01:52:24.820
<v Speaker 1>It allows you to train harder so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>recover better.</v>

2527
01:52:24.821 --> 01:52:27.130
<v Speaker 1>So you have more output.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2528
01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:30.400
<v Speaker 1>But we don't want young kids to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only way to do this is start</v>

2529
01:52:30.401 --> 01:52:32.560
<v Speaker 1>taking steroids and fuck up your</v>
<v Speaker 1>endocrine system.</v>

2530
01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.281
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2531
01:52:33.281 --> 01:52:35.770
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we also want to keep in mind like</v>

2532
01:52:36.610 --> 01:52:38.230
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost requires like a broader</v>

2533
01:52:38.231 --> 01:52:40.120
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like why do we care?</v>

2534
01:52:40.690 --> 01:52:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Well we care in combat sports because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows you to inflict more damage and</v>

2535
01:52:44.370 --> 01:52:44.581
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2536
01:52:44.581 --> 01:52:44.801
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2537
01:52:44.801 --> 01:52:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like why would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do,</v>

2538
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:48.950
<v Speaker 1>why do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say I'm not a professional</v>

2539
01:52:48.951 --> 01:52:49.784
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2540
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Why do I actually care how fast I run or</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fast I ride or any of these other</v>

2541
01:52:54.411 --> 01:52:55.880
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2542
01:52:55.881 --> 01:52:58.580
<v Speaker 1>because you want to brag about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe or weight,</v>

2543
01:52:58.930 --> 01:53:00.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe there in lies the problem.</v>

2544
01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

2545
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:06.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I stopped cycling competitively,</v>

2546
01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I think a big part of it was I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that performance and longevity</v>

2547
01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:16.160
<v Speaker 1>stopped being colinear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started to become somewhat</v>

2548
01:53:16.161 --> 01:53:17.900
<v Speaker 1>orthogonal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started to deviate.</v>

2549
01:53:18.170 --> 01:53:20.150
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that I was doing that we're</v>

2550
01:53:20.151 --> 01:53:23.120
<v Speaker 1>enhancing my performance and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even talking about drugs,</v>

2551
01:53:23.121 --> 01:53:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking training wise.</v>

2552
01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:28.550
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to come at the expense of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believed was going to make me live</v>

2553
01:53:28.551 --> 01:53:31.040
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So specifically the,</v>

2554
01:53:31.090 --> 01:53:33.530
<v Speaker 1>the thing I cared most about was</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular health.</v>

2555
01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Now the incidence of atrial fibrillation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in highly trained athletes is 10 times</v>

2556
01:53:40.251 --> 01:53:44.150
<v Speaker 1>higher than that of non athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that's a little</v>

2557
01:53:44.151 --> 01:53:45.210
<v Speaker 1>counterintuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2558
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Why would people who have such amazingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit cardiovascular systems have 10 times</v>

2559
01:53:51.051 --> 01:53:54.590
<v Speaker 1>the risk of this horrible condition</v>
<v Speaker 1>called atrial fibrillation,</v>

2560
01:53:54.770 --> 01:53:57.320
<v Speaker 1>which yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people have it but not young.</v>

2561
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:59.030
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to have that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 40.</v>

2562
01:53:59.630 --> 01:54:02.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's usually associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular disease.</v>

2563
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:05.240
<v Speaker 1>And yet people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2564
01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.900
<v Speaker 1>showing up with these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have four patients who have had</v>

2565
01:54:08.901 --> 01:54:11.030
<v Speaker 1>to get ablations for atrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>fibrillation.</v>

2566
01:54:11.031 --> 01:54:14.120
<v Speaker 1>What does an ablation and ablation is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedure where they stick a catheter up</v>

2567
01:54:14.121 --> 01:54:19.121
<v Speaker 1>through the femoral artery in the vein</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they burned pieces of the heart</v>

2568
01:54:19.581 --> 01:54:21.440
<v Speaker 1>specifically around the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2569
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:25.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulmonary veins and they basically are</v>

2570
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:29.330
<v Speaker 1>trying to burn away and create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2571
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:32.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or remove the ability of the electrical</v>

2572
01:54:32.571 --> 01:54:33.740
<v Speaker 1>system to move in this way.</v>

2573
01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:37.040
<v Speaker 1>So what's basically happening with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this type of athlete's heart is,</v>

2574
01:54:37.650 --> 01:54:39.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your heart is constantly being</v>

2575
01:54:39.951 --> 01:54:43.040
<v Speaker 1>exposed to that high stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high ejection fraction load,</v>

2576
01:54:43.190 --> 01:54:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you're basically stretching out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical system cause the electrical</v>

2577
01:54:45.531 --> 01:54:47.360
<v Speaker 1>system of the heart runs within its</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles.</v>

2578
01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:52.040
<v Speaker 1>So as you stretch it out a certain group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people and we don't know why certain</v>

2579
01:54:52.041 --> 01:54:53.630
<v Speaker 1>people are susceptible and certain or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2580
01:54:54.110 --> 01:54:55.970
<v Speaker 1>but they just developed this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2581
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:59.360
<v Speaker 1>this dysrhythmia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're soldering the motherboard as</v>

2582
01:54:59.361 --> 01:54:59.970
<v Speaker 1>it were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2583
01:54:59.970 --> 01:55:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can possibly think of that.</v>

2584
01:55:01.041 --> 01:55:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like creating new lines to block</v>

2585
01:55:04.311 --> 01:55:04.871
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2586
01:55:04.871 --> 01:55:06.580
<v Speaker 1>the connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2587
01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:08.690
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2588
01:55:08.691 --> 01:55:10.490
<v Speaker 1>So think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone said once,</v>

2589
01:55:10.491 --> 01:55:13.280
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'd be able to have some insight</v>

2590
01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:18.440
<v Speaker 1>there that there is a concept that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire life,</v>

2591
01:55:18.441 --> 01:55:19.910
<v Speaker 1>you have a certain amount of heartbeats.</v>

2592
01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

2593
01:55:23.481 --> 01:55:24.680
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it many times.</v>

2594
01:55:24.681 --> 01:55:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2595
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:28.550
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2596
01:55:28.551 --> 01:55:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't tend to agree with that.</v>

2597
01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

2598
01:55:33.490 --> 01:55:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't compare one beat to the other.</v>

2599
01:55:35.661 --> 01:55:36.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2600
01:55:36.141 --> 01:55:36.741
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2601
01:55:36.741 --> 01:55:38.750
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2602
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:44.470
<v Speaker 1>an 80 to 90% ejection fraction beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>under incredible load is the same as the</v>

2603
01:55:45.511 --> 01:55:46.560
<v Speaker 1>beat that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2604
01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:49.560
<v Speaker 1>like it is beat per beat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as the beat I experience when</v>

2605
01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm sleeping and my heart's writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2606
01:55:51.091 --> 01:55:52.590
<v Speaker 1>my heart's beating at 40 beats per</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

2607
01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2608
01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:56.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a directional truth to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2609
01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:59.400
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like when you're talking about</v>

2610
01:55:59.401 --> 01:56:01.770
<v Speaker 1>human longevity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a game of inches.</v>

2611
01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:05.040
<v Speaker 1>And that is like something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably directionally true within a</v>

2612
01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:05.873
<v Speaker 1>mile.</v>

2613
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Now when you're talking about human</v>
<v Speaker 3>longevity and you,</v>

2614
01:56:08.781 --> 01:56:10.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're thinking about all these</v>

2615
01:56:10.701 --> 01:56:12.590
<v Speaker 3>different things that you could do to</v>
<v Speaker 3>extend,</v>

2616
01:56:13.070 --> 01:56:18.070
<v Speaker 3>how much of that is supplementation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you supplement?</v>

2617
01:56:18.110 --> 01:56:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Like are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you a person who takes colloidal</v>

2618
01:56:21.201 --> 01:56:25.820
<v Speaker 3>minerals or are you a person that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in antioxidants?</v>

2619
01:56:25.821 --> 01:56:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do in terms of that?</v>

2620
01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

2621
01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:34.600
<v Speaker 1>my view on longevity is it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the hardest problem there is.</v>

2622
01:56:34.630 --> 01:56:38.560
<v Speaker 1>And so you gotta have every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm agnostic about what the</v>

2623
01:56:38.561 --> 01:56:41.560
<v Speaker 1>approach is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to understand everything that</v>

2624
01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:43.210
<v Speaker 1>you can do with respect to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2625
01:56:43.211 --> 01:56:44.710
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

2626
01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:46.600
<v Speaker 1>supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones.</v>

2627
01:56:46.630 --> 01:56:49.270
<v Speaker 1>And to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only difference between a drug and a</v>

2628
01:56:49.271 --> 01:56:51.370
<v Speaker 1>supplement is one's regulated and one is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

2629
01:56:51.371 --> 01:56:51.991
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2630
01:56:51.991 --> 01:56:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I have patients that'll say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2631
01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:54.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor,</v>

2632
01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to take that drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather do it naturally.</v>

2633
01:56:58.031 --> 01:56:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Can I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sort of like,</v>

2634
01:56:59.321 --> 01:57:00.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2635
01:57:00.191 --> 01:57:01.510
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to take a stat and,</v>

2636
01:57:01.511 --> 01:57:05.320
<v Speaker 1>but you do want to take red yeast rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they both inhibit HMG coa</v>

2637
01:57:05.321 --> 01:57:07.600
<v Speaker 1>reductase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The enzyme that catalyzes the first step</v>

2638
01:57:07.601 --> 01:57:11.620
<v Speaker 1>of cholesterol synthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to take one that you buy</v>

2639
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:14.530
<v Speaker 1>in a drug store that's totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>unregulated and you're not willing to</v>

2640
01:57:14.531 --> 01:57:18.310
<v Speaker 1>buy the one that comes from a drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>company where the FDA has their foot up</v>

2641
01:57:18.311 --> 01:57:20.680
<v Speaker 1>the ass of the company making it to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure it's perfect.</v>

2642
01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:22.490
<v Speaker 1>That just strikes me as a false</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent.</v>

2643
01:57:22.491 --> 01:57:26.170
<v Speaker 1>So I only say that to just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everything should be on the</v>

2644
01:57:26.171 --> 01:57:29.080
<v Speaker 1>table and then the question should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you decide what to do?</v>

2645
01:57:29.081 --> 01:57:30.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2646
01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:32.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are absolutely a bunch of</v>

2647
01:57:32.681 --> 01:57:34.450
<v Speaker 1>supplements that I take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2648
01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:37.750
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have kind of a one size fits</v>
<v Speaker 1>all approach to it because I think</v>

2649
01:57:37.751 --> 01:57:40.930
<v Speaker 1>you've gotta be able to kind of measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in a person,</v>

2650
01:57:41.170 --> 01:57:42.460
<v Speaker 1>get a baseline and figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2651
01:57:42.461 --> 01:57:43.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2652
01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:46.120
<v Speaker 1>my guess is you've had a million people</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the show that can talk your ears off</v>

2653
01:57:46.121 --> 01:57:47.140
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2654
01:57:47.141 --> 01:57:48.940
<v Speaker 1>which paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people should take methylated</v>

2655
01:57:48.941 --> 01:57:52.750
<v Speaker 1>vitamins versus which shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you have this mthfr mutation</v>

2656
01:57:52.751 --> 01:57:55.150
<v Speaker 1>versus this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you be taking this versus that.</v>

2657
01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I think all of those things are valid.</v>

2658
01:57:57.010 --> 01:57:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the stuff that I find even more</v>

2659
01:57:59.591 --> 01:58:02.920
<v Speaker 1>interesting is actually a lot less sexy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't have a good answer for it.</v>

2660
01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:03.813
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2661
01:58:04.330 --> 01:58:05.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at,</v>

2662
01:58:05.051 --> 01:58:06.610
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D levels.</v>

2663
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:07.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2664
01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you see a huge disparity and the vitamin</v>
<v Speaker 1>D levels people have.</v>

2665
01:58:11.410 --> 01:58:16.360
<v Speaker 1>And it begs the question to all people</v>
<v Speaker 1>run effectively at the same vitamin D</v>

2666
01:58:16.361 --> 01:58:18.070
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2667
01:58:18.250 --> 01:58:20.920
<v Speaker 1>and is that a function of not just their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own individual,</v>

2668
01:58:20.921 --> 01:58:24.460
<v Speaker 1>like how much sun they're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly like potentially</v>

2669
01:58:24.461 --> 01:58:29.461
<v Speaker 1>genetically where they're from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm starting to feel like people who</v>

2670
01:58:30.341 --> 01:58:32.340
<v Speaker 1>have northern European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2671
01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.440
<v Speaker 1>blood might actually run better at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower vitamin D level than people like</v>

2672
01:58:37.541 --> 01:58:38.500
<v Speaker 1>me who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2673
01:58:38.530 --> 01:58:43.030
<v Speaker 1>come from places near the equator where</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe just evolved to see more sunlight</v>

2674
01:58:43.031 --> 01:58:45.400
<v Speaker 1>and have more vitamin d.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your ancestry?</v>

2675
01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:46.900
<v Speaker 1>My parents are both from Egypt.</v>

2676
01:58:47.170 --> 01:58:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

2677
01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2678
01:58:50.710 --> 01:58:53.050
<v Speaker 1>and the range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you look at a laboratory test,</v>

2679
01:58:53.051 --> 01:58:56.560
<v Speaker 1>when you check somebody vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the range that's offered is 30 to a</v>

2680
01:58:56.561 --> 01:58:59.500
<v Speaker 1>hundred is optimal say range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2681
01:58:59.501 --> 01:59:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2682
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:01.520
<v Speaker 1>that's probably not the range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2683
01:59:01.630 --> 01:59:02.890
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I personally think the range is</v>

2684
01:59:02.891 --> 01:59:05.470
<v Speaker 1>probably 40 to 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also measure something called</v>

2685
01:59:05.471 --> 01:59:09.010
<v Speaker 1>parathyroid hormone that allows me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>further titrate that range and stuff</v>

2686
01:59:09.011 --> 01:59:10.540
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when you talking about this,</v>

2687
01:59:10.541 --> 01:59:13.690
<v Speaker 1>it's really obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really clear that there's so much data</v>

2688
01:59:13.691 --> 01:59:16.140
<v Speaker 1>to go through that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2689
01:59:16.210 --> 01:59:19.990
<v Speaker 1>we're learning this and [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say it's in its infancy,</v>

2690
01:59:19.991 --> 01:59:23.340
<v Speaker 1>but if we look back a thousand years now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we will most certainly say their</v>

2691
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:25.570
<v Speaker 1>understanding of this science is at its</v>
<v Speaker 1>infancy.</v>

2692
01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2693
01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue is how do you make sense of a</v>

2694
01:59:31.901 --> 01:59:34.810
<v Speaker 1>problem or how do you try to solve a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem which is unsolvable.</v>

2695
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:36.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I say that is the</v>

2696
01:59:36.371 --> 01:59:37.690
<v Speaker 1>following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2697
01:59:38.650 --> 01:59:41.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have what I call kind of the</v>

2698
01:59:41.561 --> 01:59:44.080
<v Speaker 1>medicine 1.0 world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

2699
01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I define that as everything that took</v>
<v Speaker 1>place before Francis Bacon.</v>

2700
01:59:48.610 --> 01:59:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably tell me when that was.</v>

2701
01:59:50.891 --> 01:59:55.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to guess Francis Bacon is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>1650 to 1670 or something like that.</v>

2702
01:59:56.260 --> 02:00:00.400
<v Speaker 1>But that was basically the first person</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come along and codify the scientific</v>

2703
02:00:00.401 --> 02:00:03.760
<v Speaker 1>method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything that came along before the</v>

2704
02:00:03.761 --> 02:00:08.761
<v Speaker 1>scientific method may have been correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning there were things that were</v>

2705
02:00:08.951 --> 02:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>certainly done back then that proved</v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful,</v>

2706
02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:15.400
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't grounded in a principle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of science.</v>

2707
02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2708
02:00:17.111 --> 02:00:19.390
<v Speaker 1>even a blind squirrel is gonna find nuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

2709
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:22.840
<v Speaker 1>And then we basically through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2710
02:00:22.841 --> 02:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>following the Qaddafi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2711
02:00:24.301 --> 02:00:24.811
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2712
02:00:24.811 --> 02:00:28.420
<v Speaker 1>the elucidation of a scientific method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of statistics to</v>

2713
02:00:28.421 --> 02:00:30.070
<v Speaker 1>actually make sense of data.</v>

2714
02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:33.220
<v Speaker 1>We then got into the sweet spot where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think we are now,</v>

2715
02:00:33.221 --> 02:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>which is medicine 2.0 and to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine 2.0 is really good at solving</v>

2716
02:00:37.781 --> 02:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>problems that are amenable to relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>short,</v>

2717
02:00:40.601 --> 02:00:44.650
<v Speaker 1>simple clinical trials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there has been no better example</v>

2718
02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:47.260
<v Speaker 1>than in this space than infectious</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

2719
02:00:47.590 --> 02:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>So like if you think about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable improvement in human</v>

2720
02:00:52.601 --> 02:00:56.350
<v Speaker 1>longevity that has come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics,</v>

2721
02:00:56.590 --> 02:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>antiviral therapy for HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean remember 30 years ago,</v>

2722
02:00:59.711 --> 02:01:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Hiv was a lethal Li,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no questions asked lethal condition.</v>

2723
02:01:03.971 --> 02:01:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Today it's a chronic disease for</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually every patient with HIV.</v>

2724
02:01:07.061 --> 02:01:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a chronic disease today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning you will die with HIV,</v>

2725
02:01:10.211 --> 02:01:12.010
<v Speaker 1>not from HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

2726
02:01:12.730 --> 02:01:17.230
<v Speaker 1>that's almost hard to fathom when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider how shitty we are at addressing</v>

2727
02:01:17.231 --> 02:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>other chronic diseases like heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>

2728
02:01:19.181 --> 02:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's disease.</v>

2729
02:01:21.190 --> 02:01:26.020
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is if you want to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer,</v>

2730
02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:28.420
<v Speaker 1>should I eat this way or that way?</v>

2731
02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Should I exercise this way or that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I take this drug or that drug or</v>

2732
02:01:31.331 --> 02:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>this supplement or that supplement to</v>
<v Speaker 1>live longer?</v>

2733
02:01:34.150 --> 02:01:38.440
<v Speaker 1>We can never know the answer in humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is no clinical trial that</v>

2734
02:01:38.441 --> 02:01:41.420
<v Speaker 1>can answer that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we can do that experiment in</v>

2735
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>everything that's not human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've already learned the hard way</v>

2736
02:01:44.841 --> 02:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>that what happens in not humans doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily extrapolate to humans.</v>

2737
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>And we can do things to be slicker about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2738
02:01:51.801 --> 02:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you study rhesus monkeys for 20</v>

2739
02:01:53.991 --> 02:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly more interesting than</v>

2740
02:01:56.061 --> 02:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>studying mice for one year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the end,</v>

2741
02:01:59.630 --> 02:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still animals in captivity.</v>

2742
02:02:01.521 --> 02:02:03.830
<v Speaker 1>They're still not in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and all these things.</v>

2743
02:02:03.831 --> 02:02:08.831
<v Speaker 1>So my view on this topic is the only way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to this kind of medicine 3.0 is</v>

2744
02:02:09.501 --> 02:02:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you've got to have kind of a strategy</v>
<v Speaker 1>around how you think about it.</v>

2745
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>And so in many ways that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's if,</v>

2746
02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>that's what I spend most of my time</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with is what is a strategy for</v>

2747
02:02:21.531 --> 02:02:26.531
<v Speaker 1>longevity that becomes a scaffolding</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon which you anchor every new piece of</v>

2748
02:02:27.171 --> 02:02:29.090
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean,</v>

2749
02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I know things today from a data</v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint,</v>

2750
02:02:31.131 --> 02:02:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know 10 years ago and to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

2751
02:02:32.901 --> 02:02:36.230
<v Speaker 1>even in five years we'll look back at</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff we're doing today and thank God we</v>

2752
02:02:36.231 --> 02:02:38.690
<v Speaker 1>have more data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that still the right thing to do?</v>

2753
02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that strategy to me is,</v>

2754
02:02:41.781 --> 02:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>is sort of fundamentally based on three</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies of literature.</v>

2755
02:02:45.710 --> 02:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And the first is is like what did we</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from centenarians so that people</v>

2756
02:02:49.161 --> 02:02:52.490
<v Speaker 1>who naturally live to a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2757
02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:56.120
<v Speaker 1>they have the advantage or that body of</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature has the advantage of being</v>

2758
02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:59.210
<v Speaker 1>based on humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has the disadvantage of it not being</v>

2759
02:02:59.211 --> 02:03:00.080
<v Speaker 1>experimental.</v>

2760
02:03:00.110 --> 02:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2761
02:03:01.181 --> 02:03:03.860
<v Speaker 1>like we don't know like what cause and</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect was.</v>

2762
02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:06.110
<v Speaker 1>And then secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at all of the animal</v>

2763
02:03:06.111 --> 02:03:09.320
<v Speaker 1>literature or nonhuman literature where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually do the experiments,</v>

2764
02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:12.530
<v Speaker 1>what's common there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you look at the underlying</v>

2765
02:03:12.770 --> 02:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>molecular mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you,</v>

2766
02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you tie those three</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

2767
02:03:18.110 --> 02:03:21.620
<v Speaker 1>you come up with a general scaffolding</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what it means to live longer and</v>

2768
02:03:21.621 --> 02:03:26.621
<v Speaker 1>live healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we can try to look at one thing at</v>

2769
02:03:28.131 --> 02:03:29.060
<v Speaker 1>a time and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2770
02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:31.400
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yay or nay antioxidant,</v>

2771
02:03:31.401 --> 02:03:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Yay or nay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're,</v>

2772
02:03:34.590 --> 02:03:35.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2773
02:03:35.150 --> 02:03:38.030
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be very time consuming for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2774
02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:41.030
<v Speaker 1>We'll have a research team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I started this practice</v>

2775
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:45.980
<v Speaker 1>about three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized like I was losing the battle.</v>

2776
02:03:46.010 --> 02:03:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ability to sit down and read</v>

2777
02:03:47.661 --> 02:03:49.550
<v Speaker 1>scientific papers was like shrinking.</v>

2778
02:03:50.090 --> 02:03:51.800
<v Speaker 1>So I hired an analyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2779
02:03:51.801 --> 02:03:52.011
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2780
02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:54.140
<v Speaker 1>he had worked with me in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was amazing.</v>

2781
02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I brought him over full time to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then another one that another,</v>

2782
02:03:57.470 --> 02:04:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean now I have four full time</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysts and I mean as this practice</v>

2783
02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:04.250
<v Speaker 1>grows and or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2784
02:04:04.251 --> 02:04:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I have the revenue to justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll have 10 analysts one day and</v>

2785
02:04:07.401 --> 02:04:09.320
<v Speaker 1>this practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even that's not enough.</v>

2786
02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean approximately 100,000 papers are</v>
<v Speaker 1>published every month on pub med,</v>

2787
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I forgot I did the math on that one.</v>

2788
02:04:17.421 --> 02:04:19.910
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's like three papers a</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

2789
02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:22.640
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty stunning when you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the amount of human achievement</v>

2790
02:04:22.641 --> 02:04:25.100
<v Speaker 1>that we've experienced just in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime in that regard.</v>

2791
02:04:25.101 --> 02:04:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people are working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding just the mechanisms and</v>

2792
02:04:29.871 --> 02:04:32.960
<v Speaker 1>the human body and this data is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>piling up as we speak.</v>

2793
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is the signal to noise</v>

2794
02:04:34.701 --> 02:04:39.701
<v Speaker 1>ratio is almost zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say conservatively 90%,</v>

2795
02:04:39.931 --> 02:04:42.930
<v Speaker 1>if not 99% of that is completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>

2796
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2797
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually wrote about this once.</v>

2798
02:04:47.690 --> 02:04:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when a paper comes out,</v>

2799
02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:54.780
<v Speaker 1>if it is never cited again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning for the remainder of time,</v>

2800
02:04:54.781 --> 02:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>no one ever even goes back to reference</v>
<v Speaker 1>that paper.</v>

2801
02:04:57.810 --> 02:05:00.090
<v Speaker 1>You could probably make the case that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that paper is not relevant.</v>

2802
02:05:00.930 --> 02:05:04.170
<v Speaker 1>And if you then further strip out auto</v>
<v Speaker 1>citations,</v>

2803
02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:07.980
<v Speaker 1>meaning the only time it's ever cited is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the author then goes back and cites</v>

2804
02:05:07.981 --> 02:05:12.981
<v Speaker 1>his or her own paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like 70 or 80% of patients of</v>

2805
02:05:13.671 --> 02:05:17.850
<v Speaker 1>papers never get cited outside of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>auto citation.</v>

2806
02:05:17.851 --> 02:05:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this because they're not relevant or</v>

2807
02:05:19.771 --> 02:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>does it possible to get lofts lost in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shuffle?</v>

2808
02:05:22.091 --> 02:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Like some of them might be worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

2809
02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Probably possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would bet it is much,</v>

2810
02:05:26.701 --> 02:05:28.380
<v Speaker 1>much more the former than the latter.</v>

2811
02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:32.550
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of stuff comes out and then years</v>

2812
02:05:32.551 --> 02:05:35.070
<v Speaker 1>later you realize it was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2813
02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:37.950
<v Speaker 1>or it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's more often the case that it</v>

2814
02:05:37.951 --> 02:05:41.130
<v Speaker 1>was wrong through an honest mistake then</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong through a dishonest mistake.</v>

2815
02:05:41.131 --> 02:05:43.260
<v Speaker 1>But there's still a lot of wrong through</v>
<v Speaker 1>dishonest mistake.</v>

2816
02:05:43.261 --> 02:05:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Stuff's coming out there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much of this data is forcing you</v>

2817
02:05:46.921 --> 02:05:49.650
<v Speaker 1>or causing you to alter your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns?</v>

2818
02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2819
02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:56.500
<v Speaker 1>we believe internally that probably 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>papers a month enter the literature that</v>

2820
02:05:57.571 --> 02:06:01.170
<v Speaker 1>are relevant to what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning it means some of the literature</v>

2821
02:06:01.171 --> 02:06:01.861
<v Speaker 1>that comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2822
02:06:01.861 --> 02:06:04.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rheumatology literature might be</v>

2823
02:06:04.021 --> 02:06:05.670
<v Speaker 1>relevant to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what I do.</v>

2824
02:06:05.671 --> 02:06:07.620
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three a day.</v>

2825
02:06:07.650 --> 02:06:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why when I say I want 10</v>

2826
02:06:11.671 --> 02:06:14.370
<v Speaker 1>analysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see why it's like it's you got it.</v>

2827
02:06:14.370 --> 02:06:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Because first of all it's finding those</v>
<v Speaker 1>papers too.</v>

2828
02:06:16.471 --> 02:06:20.280
<v Speaker 1>So how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what we subscribe to a whole bunch</v>

2829
02:06:20.281 --> 02:06:23.520
<v Speaker 1>of services that basically prefilter a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of shit for us.</v>

2830
02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:28.500
<v Speaker 1>And then we have a system where we go</v>
<v Speaker 1>about kind of pulling that stuff.</v>

2831
02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:31.440
<v Speaker 1>So you get those three a day and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bring them to you.</v>

2832
02:06:31.441 --> 02:06:33.100
<v Speaker 1>How do you have the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2833
02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:34.510
<v Speaker 1>So is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2834
02:06:34.630 --> 02:06:35.730
<v Speaker 1>it's funny you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2835
02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:38.370
<v Speaker 1>literally as I was driving here today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my buddy of mine and I</v>

2836
02:06:38.371 --> 02:06:39.450
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2837
02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:41.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm the fucking bottleneck and I hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2838
02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm now the bottleneck because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysts are now turning out stuff</v>

2839
02:06:46.561 --> 02:06:50.250
<v Speaker 1>faster than I can even provide ancillary</v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback.</v>

2840
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Cause my job is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2841
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:56.160
<v Speaker 1>you hire great people who are smarter</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you and like you just guide them,</v>

2842
02:06:56.161 --> 02:06:57.390
<v Speaker 1>you just point them in the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

2843
02:06:57.690 --> 02:07:02.690
<v Speaker 1>So what we mostly do is create programs</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're going out and looking for</v>

2844
02:07:04.201 --> 02:07:06.150
<v Speaker 1>new knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

2845
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:09.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the questions that is tormenting</v>
<v Speaker 1>me right now because I still don't know</v>

2846
02:07:09.001 --> 02:07:11.580
<v Speaker 1>the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any benefit to taking human</v>

2847
02:07:11.581 --> 02:07:13.530
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone from a longevity</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective?</v>

2848
02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:16.620
<v Speaker 1>There's clearly a performance benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Growth Hormone is probably the single</v>

2849
02:07:16.621 --> 02:07:19.380
<v Speaker 1>most abused drug in all of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about that.</v>

2850
02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:21.100
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2851
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:24.030
<v Speaker 1>is there a way to take it where it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live longer?</v>

2852
02:07:24.090 --> 02:07:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I've never prescribed growth hormone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a patient.</v>

2853
02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because frankly I'm not yet confident</v>

2854
02:07:29.101 --> 02:07:32.730
<v Speaker 1>that I know the answer to that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like it's worth knowing,</v>

2855
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:35.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I can certainly make a teleologic</v>

2856
02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:37.180
<v Speaker 1>argument for why growth hormone can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>

2857
02:07:37.330 --> 02:07:40.000
<v Speaker 1>But I can also make a teleologic</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument for why it can be harmful.</v>

2858
02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:45.540
<v Speaker 1>And so like many things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your knee jerk reaction to something can</v>

2859
02:07:45.881 --> 02:07:46.720
<v Speaker 1>often be wrong.</v>

2860
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:50.320
<v Speaker 1>And My kneejerk reaction to growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone has historically been causes</v>

2861
02:07:50.321 --> 02:07:52.810
<v Speaker 1>cancer because why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2862
02:07:52.811 --> 02:07:57.280
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone tells your liver to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>igf insulin like growth factor and you</v>

2863
02:07:57.281 --> 02:07:59.350
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two thirds of tumors seem to thrive on</v>

2864
02:07:59.351 --> 02:08:02.530
<v Speaker 1>igf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ostensibly you would think,</v>

2865
02:08:02.531 --> 02:08:03.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone can't be right.</v>

2866
02:08:03.941 --> 02:08:07.390
<v Speaker 1>But then one of my analysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Kaplan pointed out to me a year ago,</v>

2867
02:08:07.391 --> 02:08:07.841
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2868
02:08:07.841 --> 02:08:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about this.</v>

2869
02:08:08.861 --> 02:08:11.770
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given how ubiquitous growth hormone is</v>

2870
02:08:11.771 --> 02:08:14.200
<v Speaker 1>in sports and how long it's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>ubiquitous in sports,</v>

2871
02:08:14.201 --> 02:08:15.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2872
02:08:15.490 --> 02:08:20.490
<v Speaker 1>this was the drug that turned around us</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympic athletes in the late seventies,</v>

2873
02:08:20.621 --> 02:08:22.110
<v Speaker 1>early eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2874
02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:23.290
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the body count?</v>

2875
02:08:24.190 --> 02:08:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Like we're all of these people dying of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer from all these years of</v>

2876
02:08:28.061 --> 02:08:29.830
<v Speaker 1>staggering growth hormone use.</v>

2877
02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:31.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2878
02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really see it.</v>

2879
02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:34.500
<v Speaker 1>When we went back and looked at</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

2880
02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found that the data on growth hormone</v>

2881
02:08:37.891 --> 02:08:41.550
<v Speaker 1>and igf are not nearly as straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward as people have made it out to</v>

2882
02:08:41.551 --> 02:08:42.780
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2883
02:08:42.781 --> 02:08:43.500
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2884
02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could draw it actually for you,</v>

2885
02:08:44.971 --> 02:08:46.260
<v Speaker 1>not that anyone who won't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>see this,</v>

2886
02:08:46.261 --> 02:08:47.730
<v Speaker 1>but at least you'll see what I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2887
02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>If this is percentile so higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is igf level,</v>

2888
02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2889
02:08:55.770 --> 02:08:57.810
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Igf Level,</v>

2890
02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:59.520
<v Speaker 1>most people are listening to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2891
02:08:59.521 --> 02:09:02.610
<v Speaker 1>actually it's talking about that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2892
02:09:02.850 --> 02:09:07.850
<v Speaker 1>So the overall mortality curve for igf</v>
<v Speaker 1>and growth hormone is like a j curve,</v>

2893
02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>meaning low igfs really high mortality.</v>

2894
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:17.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2895
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you go from about the 70th or 80th</v>

2896
02:09:19.961 --> 02:09:24.100
<v Speaker 1>percentile up to the 90th percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a slight increase in mortality.</v>

2897
02:09:24.610 --> 02:09:27.190
<v Speaker 1>But this is not what you would think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you would sort of,</v>

2898
02:09:27.250 --> 02:09:29.890
<v Speaker 1>if you were just reading the headlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think it looks like this.</v>

2899
02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a sweet spot.</v>

2900
02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2901
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:36.760
<v Speaker 1>this is overall mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you parse this out by disease?</v>

2902
02:09:36.970 --> 02:09:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when it gets really interesting.</v>

2903
02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:41.140
<v Speaker 1>So cancer's curve looks like this.</v>

2904
02:09:42.710 --> 02:09:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2905
02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:49.180
<v Speaker 1>But Alzheimer's curve looks like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease curve looks like this.</v>

2906
02:09:52.490 --> 02:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>So describe that to people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>

2907
02:09:54.170 --> 02:09:56.060
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

2908
02:09:56.061 --> 02:10:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's disease and heart disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an almost monotonic reduction in</v>

2909
02:10:00.651 --> 02:10:02.930
<v Speaker 1>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As igf gets higher and higher and</v>

2910
02:10:02.931 --> 02:10:05.660
<v Speaker 1>higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only cancer that seems to have that</v>

2911
02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:08.600
<v Speaker 1>uptick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're risk starts to actually rise once</v>

2912
02:10:08.601 --> 02:10:11.480
<v Speaker 1>you cross past the call at 70th</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>

2913
02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:14.690
<v Speaker 1>And so when you integrate all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>curves together,</v>

2914
02:10:14.691 --> 02:10:18.140
<v Speaker 1>that's why you see this slight uptick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now again,</v>

2915
02:10:18.141 --> 02:10:20.600
<v Speaker 1>this is epidemiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one has to take this with a grain of</v>

2916
02:10:20.601 --> 02:10:22.850
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is to me,</v>

2917
02:10:22.851 --> 02:10:25.400
<v Speaker 1>when I saw this graph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Bob put together,</v>

2918
02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while ago I was like,</v>

2919
02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:30.290
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't jive with my preconceived</v>

2920
02:10:30.291 --> 02:10:34.940
<v Speaker 1>notion of like growth hormone is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This warrants way further exploration.</v>

2921
02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:40.370
<v Speaker 1>And so what that basically turned into</v>
<v Speaker 1>is now an enormous internal project that</v>

2922
02:10:40.371 --> 02:10:44.480
<v Speaker 1>will take us probably a year to complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll constantly be updated.</v>

2923
02:10:44.481 --> 02:10:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Like we did this already with</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone two years ago.</v>

2924
02:10:47.031 --> 02:10:51.230
<v Speaker 1>We put together like a 40 page white</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper on the topic and then at least</v>

2925
02:10:51.231 --> 02:10:55.330
<v Speaker 1>once every two weeks it gets updated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time a new paper comes out and</v>

2926
02:10:55.460 --> 02:10:58.430
<v Speaker 1>basically asking the question like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is testosterone replacement beneficial</v>

2927
02:10:58.431 --> 02:11:01.880
<v Speaker 1>or harmful and under what situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>should it be considered versus not?</v>

2928
02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:05.010
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal is to do this and emotionally,</v>

2929
02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:10.480
<v Speaker 1>and that's hard to do because for</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons I'm not entirely clear on</v>

2930
02:11:11.090 --> 02:11:13.880
<v Speaker 1>basically everyone's kind of just</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional about this stuff.</v>

2931
02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Well there are emotional about steroids</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of all the press about Barry</v>

2932
02:11:17.111 --> 02:11:21.050
<v Speaker 3>bonds and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the different baseball players that</v>

2933
02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:21.990
<v Speaker 3>got caught with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is,</v>

2934
02:11:21.991 --> 02:11:22.824
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it getting,</v>

2935
02:11:23.050 --> 02:11:25.420
<v Speaker 3>is it the cheating aspect of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>

2936
02:11:25.450 --> 02:11:26.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2937
02:11:26.351 --> 02:11:30.820
<v Speaker 3>I think that's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people consider taking any kind</v>

2938
02:11:30.821 --> 02:11:32.920
<v Speaker 3>of hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's growth hormone or</v>

2939
02:11:32.921 --> 02:11:36.580
<v Speaker 3>testosterone as cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're talking about older</v>

2940
02:11:36.581 --> 02:11:38.500
<v Speaker 3>people that take it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2941
02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:39.400
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2942
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.590
<v Speaker 3>looking at one of those ads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2943
02:11:41.591 --> 02:11:44.530
<v Speaker 3>they have those ads for hormone</v>
<v Speaker 3>replacement that is really old looking,</v>

2944
02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Jeffry life I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that his name?</v>

2945
02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Doctor Life Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's fucking,</v>

2946
02:11:49.301 --> 02:11:51.940
<v Speaker 3>he's got a full six pack controlled like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gorilla.</v>

2947
02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:53.343
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2948
02:11:53.410 --> 02:11:54.700
<v Speaker 3>my friend was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2949
02:11:54.701 --> 02:11:55.720
<v Speaker 3>that can't be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2950
02:11:55.721 --> 02:11:58.030
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>

2951
02:11:58.420 --> 02:12:00.700
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think a 70 year old dude is</v>

2952
02:12:00.701 --> 02:12:01.750
<v Speaker 3>supposed to look like?</v>

2953
02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:03.970
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to be knocking on</v>
<v Speaker 3>death's door.</v>

2954
02:12:04.090 --> 02:12:07.150
<v Speaker 3>That guy looks like he could fuck his</v>
<v Speaker 3>way through a building full of teenage</v>

2955
02:12:07.151 --> 02:12:08.290
<v Speaker 3>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2956
02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:11.140
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say teenage 20 year old,</v>

2957
02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:16.440
<v Speaker 3>21 or 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks like a man who's really fit and</v>

2958
02:12:17.261 --> 02:12:19.900
<v Speaker 3>healthy with an old guy's head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2959
02:12:20.050 --> 02:12:22.090
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2960
02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:23.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's not healthy,</v>

2961
02:12:23.561 --> 02:12:25.930
<v Speaker 3>then what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's not healthy,</v>

2962
02:12:25.931 --> 02:12:26.171
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2963
02:12:26.171 --> 02:12:28.150
<v Speaker 3>he's going to die of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to die of a heart attack.</v>

2964
02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:30.430
<v Speaker 3>He's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Period.</v>

2965
02:12:30.670 --> 02:12:32.980
<v Speaker 3>If you look at his head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much time would you give him?</v>

2966
02:12:32.981 --> 02:12:35.380
<v Speaker 3>I gave you a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I gave you a bet,</v>

2967
02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:37.840
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have $1 million bet.</v>

2968
02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:41.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you an over under of 10 years.</v>

2969
02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:42.820
<v Speaker 3>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many years are you going to give</v>

2970
02:12:42.821 --> 02:12:44.800
<v Speaker 3>this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to give him 20.</v>

2971
02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:45.900
<v Speaker 3>You gonna give them,</v>

2972
02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:46.241
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2973
02:12:46.241 --> 02:12:48.460
<v Speaker 1>you're moving the over under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said I had the only,</v>

2974
02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I had a 10 year window on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2975
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:52.450
<v Speaker 1>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to tell you take over.</v>

2976
02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:54.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll take over on the tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2977
02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

2978
02:12:56.710 --> 02:12:59.140
<v Speaker 1>how many years would give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to know if,</v>

2979
02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:01.120
<v Speaker 1>am I allowed to talk to him first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2980
02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:02.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no fucking clue.</v>

2981
02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:04.150
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at a magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2982
02:13:04.210 --> 02:13:04.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2983
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:06.220
<v Speaker 1>no I can't because I got to know his</v>
<v Speaker 1>family history.</v>

2984
02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean honestly they of course your</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents will tell me more about how long</v>

2985
02:13:09.641 --> 02:13:14.641
<v Speaker 1>you'll live then what you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 in America is basically death's door.</v>

2986
02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:16.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think today.</v>

2987
02:13:16.330 --> 02:13:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a complicated question</v>

2988
02:13:17.951 --> 02:13:19.690
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually prompts another</v>

2989
02:13:19.691 --> 02:13:22.150
<v Speaker 1>analysis who just kicked off in the 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>year range.</v>

2990
02:13:22.210 --> 02:13:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2991
02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:23.391
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2992
02:13:23.391 --> 02:13:25.240
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends how you ask the question.</v>

2993
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:29.080
<v Speaker 1>So the question is what is the average</v>
<v Speaker 1>life expectancy of a man and a woman</v>

2994
02:13:29.081 --> 02:13:30.160
<v Speaker 1>today in the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2995
02:13:30.161 --> 02:13:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to correct me,</v>

2996
02:13:31.861 --> 02:13:33.930
<v Speaker 1>so I feel like it doesn't matter what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

2997
02:13:34.110 --> 02:13:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 79 and 81 respectively for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man and a woman today.</v>

2998
02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:41.070
<v Speaker 1>But the more interesting question is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>

2999
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:42.720
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what year were you born?</v>

3000
02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:47.900
<v Speaker 1>67 okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in 1967 what was the annual life</v>

3001
02:13:48.301 --> 02:13:51.030
<v Speaker 1>expectancy or the average life</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectancy of a man and a woman?</v>

3002
02:13:51.090 --> 02:13:53.730
<v Speaker 1>And we could look that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm guessing it would have been.</v>

3003
02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life expectancy has been going up at 0.3</v>

3004
02:13:56.311 --> 02:13:59.550
<v Speaker 1>to 0.6% per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could back out that kegger and let's</v>

3005
02:13:59.551 --> 02:14:04.551
<v Speaker 1>just say for shits and giggles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the number was 60 69 or 73 or</v>

3006
02:14:05.071 --> 02:14:07.680
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise you,</v>

3007
02:14:07.681 --> 02:14:09.000
<v Speaker 1>you are going to live longer than that.</v>

3008
02:14:09.450 --> 02:14:11.530
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>67 67 all right,</v>

3009
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.590
<v Speaker 1>so do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would I take the bet that you're going</v>

3010
02:14:14.591 --> 02:14:18.690
<v Speaker 1>to live longer than 67 even though that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the median life expectancy the year</v>

3011
02:14:18.691 --> 02:14:20.430
<v Speaker 1>you were born?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>

3012
02:14:20.431 --> 02:14:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we're actually putting,</v>

3013
02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:27.060
<v Speaker 1>this isn't just a dumb analysis we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know why we're doing this.</v>

3014
02:14:27.061 --> 02:14:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we just do dumb shit that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bearing.</v>

3015
02:14:29.250 --> 02:14:34.250
<v Speaker 1>But what I want to do is create a graph</v>
<v Speaker 1>of actual life expectancy as realized</v>

3016
02:14:35.101 --> 02:14:38.370
<v Speaker 1>versus projected life expectancy in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>year of birth.</v>

3017
02:14:38.550 --> 02:14:41.550
<v Speaker 1>My hypothesis is that is always a</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive number.</v>

3018
02:14:41.730 --> 02:14:44.550
<v Speaker 1>What I want to know is what's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>derivative on it?</v>

3019
02:14:44.551 --> 02:14:49.551
<v Speaker 1>Is it increasing or decreasing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that science is accelerating</v>

3020
02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>our longevity and that that's one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>proof points is that we are constantly</v>

3021
02:14:57.930 --> 02:15:00.420
<v Speaker 1>underestimating how long we can live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3022
02:15:01.170 --> 02:15:05.220
<v Speaker 1>on the other end of that spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not one of these futurists who</v>

3023
02:15:05.221 --> 02:15:07.170
<v Speaker 1>thinks like there's in mortality out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3024
02:15:07.530 --> 02:15:09.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be,</v>

3025
02:15:10.050 --> 02:15:12.690
<v Speaker 1>if right now I could sign a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper that would say,</v>

3026
02:15:12.691 --> 02:15:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you willing to commit to a lifespan</v>

3027
02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:17.010
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're willing to acknowledge that if</v>

3028
02:15:17.011 --> 02:15:19.140
<v Speaker 1>there's some major breakthrough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll miss out on it.</v>

3029
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:22.770
<v Speaker 1>But I guarantee you this duration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what would you take right now if I</v>

3030
02:15:22.771 --> 02:15:23.460
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

3031
02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:27.990
<v Speaker 1>you can be a hundred and and be fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>functional at a hundred so when you're a</v>

3032
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:29.460
<v Speaker 1>hundred you're going to get run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3033
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be like a fit 60 year</v>

3034
02:15:32.731 --> 02:15:34.950
<v Speaker 1>old at a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're still working out.</v>

3035
02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:37.470
<v Speaker 1>You're still shooting pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3036
02:15:37.471 --> 02:15:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Would you take it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3037
02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:41.760
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to bet that by the time</v>

3038
02:15:41.761 --> 02:15:42.594
<v Speaker 1>we get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3039
02:15:42.610 --> 02:15:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Because when it's over it's over anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3040
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean to me I think most people have</v>

3041
02:15:49.351 --> 02:15:54.351
<v Speaker 1>a greater sense of confidence about</v>
<v Speaker 1>where technology goes now that I think</v>

3042
02:15:54.811 --> 02:15:57.810
<v Speaker 1>they're really only been a handful of</v>
<v Speaker 1>step function changes in longevity.</v>

3043
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:59.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3044
02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:01.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the production of infant mortality was</v>

3045
02:16:01.891 --> 02:16:03.720
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like once we actually figured out how</v>

3046
02:16:03.721 --> 02:16:06.120
<v Speaker 1>the fuck to deliver babies and not kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>moms,</v>

3047
02:16:06.510 --> 02:16:11.430
<v Speaker 1>like that was a big deal that had a step</v>
<v Speaker 1>function improvement in human longevity.</v>

3048
02:16:12.180 --> 02:16:15.930
<v Speaker 1>The next one was really sanitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like once we figured out that like don't</v>

3049
02:16:15.931 --> 02:16:19.790
<v Speaker 1>shit where you drink huge improvement in</v>
<v Speaker 1>human mortality.</v>

3050
02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

3051
02:16:21.121 --> 02:16:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we take that shit for granted now.</v>

3052
02:16:22.711 --> 02:16:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the third one was basically</v>

3053
02:16:25.411 --> 02:16:27.120
<v Speaker 1>germ theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3054
02:16:27.150 --> 02:16:30.370
<v Speaker 1>starting with lister and going all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to Fleming when we figured out like,</v>

3055
02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:32.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

3056
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:37.030
<v Speaker 1>if you cut open a cadaver and then go</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deliver a baby,</v>

3057
02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:38.530
<v Speaker 1>that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3058
02:16:38.710 --> 02:16:41.140
<v Speaker 1>because there were these microscopic</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that none of us anticipate,</v>

3059
02:16:41.141 --> 02:16:43.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't had a step function</v>

3060
02:16:43.091 --> 02:16:45.550
<v Speaker 1>improvement in mortality and nearly a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years.</v>

3061
02:16:46.570 --> 02:16:48.640
<v Speaker 1>So what's next?</v>

3062
02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Now I think there were a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentials for that,</v>

3063
02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:55.150
<v Speaker 1>but what I don't know as if like they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen in my lifetime,</v>

3064
02:16:55.151 --> 02:16:57.910
<v Speaker 1>in your lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to buy the optionality to</v>

3065
02:16:57.911 --> 02:17:01.420
<v Speaker 1>stick around for it by doing all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>incremental little shit.</v>

3066
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:06.990
<v Speaker 1>It will these three plus papers a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the options are increasing.</v>

3067
02:17:07.530 --> 02:17:09.590
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just seems to me that it's,</v>

3068
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:11.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3069
02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:12.040
<v Speaker 1>The trend is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you,</v>

3070
02:17:12.041 --> 02:17:14.350
<v Speaker 1>as you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an increase of longevity,</v>

3071
02:17:14.351 --> 02:17:15.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a huge increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3072
02:17:16.170 --> 02:17:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our understanding of the human body</v>

3073
02:17:18.970 --> 02:17:20.350
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3074
02:17:20.410 --> 02:17:23.080
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be pretty radically</v>
<v Speaker 1>improving,</v>

3075
02:17:24.090 --> 02:17:26.860
<v Speaker 1>especially in terms of nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutritional absorption and the</v>

3076
02:17:26.861 --> 02:17:30.370
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms behind nutrition on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

3077
02:17:30.371 --> 02:17:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on some level I still feel like</v>

3078
02:17:32.171 --> 02:17:36.140
<v Speaker 1>we're in the dark ages because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize the potential or you know?</v>

3079
02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:37.053
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think,</v>

3080
02:17:37.290 --> 02:17:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm just humbled by how hard it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to actually take care of people.</v>

3081
02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so I was about,</v>

3082
02:17:44.650 --> 02:17:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm about as good or responder is you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to carbohydrate reduction.</v>

3083
02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So doing something as simple as just not</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating carbs and not eating sugar,</v>

3084
02:17:52.361 --> 02:17:57.361
<v Speaker 1>like completely changed my health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at 40 if you compare the 40 year</v>

3085
02:17:57.581 --> 02:18:02.581
<v Speaker 1>old me to the 30 year old me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the 40 year old is like literally</v>

3086
02:18:02.951 --> 02:18:07.780
<v Speaker 1>twice as healthy as the 30 year old me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was through something as simple</v>

3087
02:18:07.810 --> 02:18:11.420
<v Speaker 1>conceptually simple as making this</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical dietary shifts.</v>

3088
02:18:11.530 --> 02:18:14.890
<v Speaker 1>And by what standards are you saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're twice as healthy at 40 than</v>

3089
02:18:14.891 --> 02:18:18.370
<v Speaker 1>30 how will you now 45 and but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>

3090
02:18:18.890 --> 02:18:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking a bit glibly even let's</v>

3091
02:18:22.691 --> 02:18:23.810
<v Speaker 1>just talk objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3092
02:18:23.811 --> 02:18:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what would be my lip had levels,</v>

3093
02:18:25.571 --> 02:18:29.200
<v Speaker 1>what would be my triglyceride levels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much body fat do I have?</v>

3094
02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:32.710
<v Speaker 1>What's my vo two Max like by all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those metrics,</v>

3095
02:18:32.711 --> 02:18:35.230
<v Speaker 1>like everything was just so much better</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 40.</v>

3096
02:18:35.630 --> 02:18:36.463
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3097
02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:37.901
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3098
02:18:37.901 --> 02:18:42.901
<v Speaker 1>and so I've split yet I've seen a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients where you take the carbs out of</v>

3099
02:18:43.451 --> 02:18:44.620
<v Speaker 1>their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

3100
02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:45.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3101
02:18:45.231 --> 02:18:46.910
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you felt that you,</v>

3102
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:48.460
<v Speaker 1>you make them fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do this,</v>

3103
02:18:48.461 --> 02:18:50.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that you just can't fix</v>

3104
02:18:50.260 --> 02:18:52.690
<v Speaker 1>some of the underlying metabolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

3105
02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of problems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3106
02:18:54.551 --> 02:18:59.551
<v Speaker 1>I think some people are just so insulin</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistant that it becomes really hard to</v>

3107
02:19:00.191 --> 02:19:03.220
<v Speaker 1>fix them without doing draconian stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3108
02:19:03.221 --> 02:19:07.750
<v Speaker 1>I have one patient who he's really now I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think going to in many ways become the</v>

3109
02:19:07.751 --> 02:19:10.750
<v Speaker 1>poster child for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely the toughest case I've</v>

3110
02:19:10.751 --> 02:19:15.751
<v Speaker 1>ever had and why he's such an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy is he was actually able to do</v>

3111
02:19:15.851 --> 02:19:19.360
<v Speaker 1>something that's really hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is stick to something with</v>

3112
02:19:19.361 --> 02:19:21.550
<v Speaker 1>complete blind faith in me.</v>

3113
02:19:21.850 --> 02:19:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Even when it didn't feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when I knew it would take a long</v>

3114
02:19:24.461 --> 02:19:26.950
<v Speaker 1>time to see the results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

3115
02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:32.170
<v Speaker 1>he's probably five foot eight ways to 35</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the start.</v>

3116
02:19:32.271 --> 02:19:35.090
<v Speaker 1>So five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight to 35 metabolic syndrome,</v>

3117
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:40.100
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of fatty liver disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the typical patient in my</v>

3118
02:19:40.101 --> 02:19:41.960
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of my patients are kind of young,</v>

3119
02:19:41.961 --> 02:19:43.950
<v Speaker 1>healthy people who want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3120
02:19:43.970 --> 02:19:46.760
<v Speaker 1>want this and mortality thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3121
02:19:47.090 --> 02:19:51.770
<v Speaker 1>this is someone who doesn't fit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>description probably 70 years old,</v>

3122
02:19:52.980 --> 02:19:53.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on like,</v>

3123
02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:54.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for drugs,</v>

3124
02:19:54.501 --> 02:19:57.560
<v Speaker 1>for blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 gregory heavy for a seven year old.</v>

3125
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

3126
02:19:58.310 --> 02:19:58.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3127
02:19:58.911 --> 02:20:00.740
<v Speaker 1>and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just had a hip replacement.</v>

3128
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:02.660
<v Speaker 1>You basically couldn't walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3129
02:20:02.661 --> 02:20:06.200
<v Speaker 1>everything was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had tried carbohydrate</v>

3130
02:20:06.201 --> 02:20:08.120
<v Speaker 1>restricting him before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't work.</v>

3131
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:09.770
<v Speaker 1>And part of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he just,</v>

3132
02:20:09.771 --> 02:20:11.540
<v Speaker 1>it was hard for him to stick to it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go about,</v>

3133
02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:12.351
<v Speaker 1>so I just said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3134
02:20:12.351 --> 02:20:14.870
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to try something completely</v>

3135
02:20:14.871 --> 02:20:19.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking extreme and I want to try it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months,</v>

3136
02:20:19.970 --> 02:20:22.340
<v Speaker 1>every five days per me.</v>

3137
02:20:22.430 --> 02:20:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Every month you're going to spend the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first five days eating 500 calories a</v>

3138
02:20:26.151 --> 02:20:29.870
<v Speaker 1>day of a ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's basically just going to be like</v>

3139
02:20:29.871 --> 02:20:30.780
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>

3140
02:20:30.781 --> 02:20:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Like you're basically eating a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>salad and then for the next 25 days</v>

3141
02:20:34.521 --> 02:20:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do a time restricted</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic diet where you're only going</v>

3142
02:20:37.821 --> 02:20:41.990
<v Speaker 1>to eat in that eight hour window and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to repeat that every</v>

3143
02:20:41.991 --> 02:20:44.660
<v Speaker 1>month for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

3144
02:20:44.661 --> 02:20:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I won't be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3145
02:20:46.611 --> 02:20:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3146
02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:50.180
<v Speaker 1>It seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you will be able to do it</v>

3147
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:53.090
<v Speaker 1>because remember all that time that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not eating,</v>

3148
02:20:53.450 --> 02:20:55.460
<v Speaker 1>your body's going to have to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating itself.</v>

3149
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

3150
02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving you a grossly over simplified</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of what we did,</v>

3151
02:21:01.221 --> 02:21:02.780
<v Speaker 1>but it was much more complicated than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3152
02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:05.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of other stuff that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to do to manage it as well.</v>

3153
02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3154
02:21:07.101 --> 02:21:09.380
<v Speaker 1>he just sent me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were in touch all the way</v>

3155
02:21:09.381 --> 02:21:11.270
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was clear that this was working,</v>

3156
02:21:11.271 --> 02:21:15.050
<v Speaker 1>but it was just kind of amazing to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture from him two weeks ago as we</v>

3157
02:21:15.051 --> 02:21:18.770
<v Speaker 1>just past that six month mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he weighs a buck 75 whoa,</v>

3158
02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:22.070
<v Speaker 1>that's 60 pounds in six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

3159
02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:23.660
<v Speaker 1>His liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3160
02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:26.240
<v Speaker 1>and that's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not nearly as interesting to me is</v>

3161
02:21:26.241 --> 02:21:30.440
<v Speaker 1>the fact that his trans amylases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the enzymes that the liver</v>

3162
02:21:30.441 --> 02:21:33.350
<v Speaker 1>makes in response to how much fat is</v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulating.</v>

3163
02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:36.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal is like less than 40.</v>

3164
02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:39.050
<v Speaker 1>He was like in the hundreds and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3165
02:21:39.051 --> 02:21:41.450
<v Speaker 1>the ultrasound showed it was just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of fat and he doesn't drink</v>

3166
02:21:41.451 --> 02:21:43.370
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we knew it was fatty liver,</v>

3167
02:21:43.371 --> 02:21:44.780
<v Speaker 1>nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3168
02:21:44.781 --> 02:21:47.510
<v Speaker 1>now he's in the twenties and thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3169
02:21:47.540 --> 02:21:48.890
<v Speaker 1>blood pressures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous diet.</v>

3170
02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:51.110
<v Speaker 1>What was he eating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standing normal dude.</v>

3171
02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to say he wasn't a particularly</v>

3172
02:21:52.521 --> 02:21:53.600
<v Speaker 1>junk food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3173
02:21:53.601 --> 02:21:55.940
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't a junkie guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is he was metabolically</v>

3174
02:21:55.941 --> 02:21:57.860
<v Speaker 1>broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll come back to why I felt like</v>

3175
02:21:57.861 --> 02:22:01.250
<v Speaker 1>this was unnecessary intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite how draconian it was.</v>

3176
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on a treadmill 30 minutes a day</v>

3177
02:22:04.881 --> 02:22:06.230
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't walk before.</v>

3178
02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take 60 pounds off the treadmill.</v>

3179
02:22:08.601 --> 02:22:10.610
<v Speaker 1>You mean walking in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She walks on a treadmill now.</v>

3180
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't really recently once you get</v>

3181
02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:14.950
<v Speaker 1>the hip replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3182
02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just,</v>

3183
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:19.410
<v Speaker 1>it's basically reprogrammed him and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3184
02:22:19.411 --> 02:22:23.150
<v Speaker 1>and so the reason I have occasionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled that trick out,</v>

3185
02:22:23.330 --> 02:22:27.390
<v Speaker 1>although it hasn't always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is based on this case study I read</v>

3186
02:22:27.391 --> 02:22:28.760
<v Speaker 1>that's very famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some,</v>

3187
02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be someone in this show</v>

3188
02:22:30.361 --> 02:22:32.130
<v Speaker 1>who's talked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

3189
02:22:32.131 --> 02:22:36.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paper was published in either the</v>

3190
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:38.550
<v Speaker 1>early seventies or late sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the longest ever medically</v>

3191
02:22:38.551 --> 02:22:39.450
<v Speaker 1>supervised fast.</v>

3192
02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:43.110
<v Speaker 1>So it was this guy who weighed somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>between 375 and 400 pounds.</v>

3193
02:22:43.410 --> 02:22:48.410
<v Speaker 1>He did a 382 day inpatient medical fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he had only water and minerals.</v>

3194
02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:51.810
<v Speaker 1>At the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 382 days,</v>

3195
02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:56.610
<v Speaker 1>he was down from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call it 400 to a buck 65 this paper was</v>

3196
02:22:56.611 --> 02:23:01.260
<v Speaker 1>published seven years later he weighed</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a buck 70 a buck 75 the crazy thing</v>

3197
02:23:01.261 --> 02:23:03.300
<v Speaker 1>about that guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's skin track to,</v>

3198
02:23:03.410 --> 02:23:05.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he didn't have that problem that a</v>

3199
02:23:05.671 --> 02:23:08.460
<v Speaker 1>lot of people have when they lose a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weight where they have all this extra</v>

3200
02:23:08.461 --> 02:23:11.850
<v Speaker 1>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his skin went along with his body.</v>

3201
02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder if that's just due to</v>

3202
02:23:14.071 --> 02:23:15.390
<v Speaker 1>genetic elasticity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3203
02:23:15.391 --> 02:23:16.980
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know,</v>

3204
02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know if he had stretch marks</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it shrank.</v>

3205
02:23:19.730 --> 02:23:20.880
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3206
02:23:20.881 --> 02:23:23.280
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never tried to figure out like</v>

3207
02:23:23.281 --> 02:23:24.630
<v Speaker 1>whatever came of that patient.</v>

3208
02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine he'd be alive now</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3209
02:23:26.311 --> 02:23:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I know he was young at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

3210
02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:33.160
<v Speaker 1>the part that interested me was that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't regain all the weight seven years</v>

3211
02:23:33.361 --> 02:23:35.850
<v Speaker 1>later and that suggested that there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

3212
02:23:36.270 --> 02:23:38.070
<v Speaker 1>like it was a reprogram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3213
02:23:38.071 --> 02:23:39.900
<v Speaker 1>you've got the blue screen of death on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the computer.</v>

3214
02:23:39.910 --> 02:23:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Did the hard reset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be a new person again because</v>

3215
02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not of the camp that thinks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy got to be 400 pounds just</v>

3216
02:23:47.581 --> 02:23:51.930
<v Speaker 1>because he was a glutton and a slot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something fundamentally broke in</v>

3217
02:23:51.931 --> 02:23:55.800
<v Speaker 1>that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what broke was he basically lost the</v>

3218
02:23:55.801 --> 02:23:58.650
<v Speaker 1>ability to partition fueled correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3219
02:23:58.770 --> 02:24:01.230
<v Speaker 1>could food play a role in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3220
02:24:01.290 --> 02:24:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Certainly if you eat enough shit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can happen.</v>

3221
02:24:03.770 --> 02:24:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's more complicated than</v>

3222
02:24:05.521 --> 02:24:06.930
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it can be epigenetic,</v>

3223
02:24:07.230 --> 02:24:09.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not outright genetic but probably</v>

3224
02:24:09.121 --> 02:24:10.170
<v Speaker 1>more epigenetic.</v>

3225
02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm interested in this idea of</v>

3226
02:24:13.921 --> 02:24:16.380
<v Speaker 1>how do you reset people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3227
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:18.420
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all kind of long winded way of</v>

3228
02:24:18.421 --> 02:24:22.530
<v Speaker 1>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the advantages of practicing</v>

3229
02:24:22.531 --> 02:24:25.680
<v Speaker 1>medicine is you get to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say humble because every,</v>

3230
02:24:25.681 --> 02:24:27.570
<v Speaker 1>every time you think you're smart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3231
02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I got this shit figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3232
02:24:29.490 --> 02:24:31.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like some patient who's got a</v>

3233
02:24:31.501 --> 02:24:34.440
<v Speaker 1>problem that you can't figure out and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just drives you nuts.</v>

3234
02:24:34.830 --> 02:24:37.170
<v Speaker 1>But you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even just today,</v>

3235
02:24:37.171 --> 02:24:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a patient,</v>

3236
02:24:38.731 --> 02:24:41.430
<v Speaker 1>but I mean my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just going through like this</v>

3237
02:24:41.431 --> 02:24:43.830
<v Speaker 1>devastating health situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been,</v>

3238
02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:46.110
<v Speaker 1>he has seen every doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been to mass general,</v>

3239
02:24:46.111 --> 02:24:48.120
<v Speaker 1>he's been to Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been to hopkins,</v>

3240
02:24:48.121 --> 02:24:49.920
<v Speaker 1>he's been to the best hospitals in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

3241
02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:53.340
<v Speaker 1>They can't fucking come close to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what's wrong with this guy.</v>

3242
02:24:54.450 --> 02:24:59.450
<v Speaker 1>And so as bad as that is for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that level of humility is</v>

3243
02:24:59.641 --> 02:25:02.520
<v Speaker 1>actually good for the profession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to what is going on with him</v>

3244
02:25:02.521 --> 02:25:04.950
<v Speaker 1>that they can't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's having these horrible neurologic</v>

3245
02:25:04.951 --> 02:25:07.860
<v Speaker 1>symptoms where he gets these for</v>
<v Speaker 1>circulations and muscle weakness.</v>

3246
02:25:07.861 --> 02:25:11.890
<v Speaker 1>And obviously the big concern about six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago when this started was he,</v>

3247
02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:14.010
<v Speaker 1>he was presenting like he had Lou</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gehrig's disease,</v>

3248
02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:17.340
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously is about as bad a fade as you</v>

3249
02:25:17.341 --> 02:25:18.930
<v Speaker 1>can have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3250
02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:23.010
<v Speaker 1>luckily that has been ruled out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done a million muscle biopsies</v>

3251
02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:25.720
<v Speaker 1>and all these other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know what's going on.</v>

3252
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Has He altered his tie and he's taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3253
02:25:29.220 --> 02:25:30.730
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what's going on.</v>

3254
02:25:31.540 --> 02:25:33.790
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is certainly far outside of my area</v>

3255
02:25:33.791 --> 02:25:34.601
<v Speaker 1>of expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3256
02:25:34.601 --> 02:25:36.070
<v Speaker 1>what we talked about today was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3257
02:25:36.071 --> 02:25:38.560
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all we really need to be doing is fixing</v>

3258
02:25:38.561 --> 02:25:39.580
<v Speaker 1>your symptoms at this point.</v>

3259
02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:41.890
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's understanding what's causing</v>

3260
02:25:41.891 --> 02:25:43.750
<v Speaker 1>this and then managing the symptoms</v>
<v Speaker 1>around it.</v>

3261
02:25:44.050 --> 02:25:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I think the smartest people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country had figured out,</v>

3262
02:25:46.031 --> 02:25:47.770
<v Speaker 1>they have no goddamn clue what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3263
02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's now figure out how to manage your</v>
<v Speaker 1>symptoms,</v>

3264
02:25:50.081 --> 02:25:51.700
<v Speaker 1>your energy levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mood,</v>

3265
02:25:51.701 --> 02:25:53.020
<v Speaker 1>all of these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has,</v>

3266
02:25:53.021 --> 02:25:54.880
<v Speaker 1>what has he done for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3267
02:25:54.881 --> 02:25:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I told him today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3268
02:25:55.871 --> 02:25:56.920
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to send you a kit.</v>

3269
02:25:56.921 --> 02:25:59.740
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do a certain blood test</v>
<v Speaker 1>on you and a certain urine test on you,</v>

3270
02:25:59.741 --> 02:26:03.260
<v Speaker 1>and I want to just figure out what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with your four hormone systems.</v>

3271
02:26:03.261 --> 02:26:06.820
<v Speaker 1>There's basically four hormone systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>play a pretty big role in how we feel</v>

3272
02:26:07.150 --> 02:26:09.940
<v Speaker 1>and adjusting those dozen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced it necessarily makes</v>

3273
02:26:09.941 --> 02:26:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can certainly make you live</v>

3274
02:26:11.591 --> 02:26:13.660
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to kind of understand.</v>

3275
02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I suspect he's not firing on all</v>
<v Speaker 1>cylinders on that dimension.</v>

3276
02:26:18.430 --> 02:26:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a result of whatever is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on that nobody can figure out or</v>

3277
02:26:21.491 --> 02:26:23.980
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'd rather focus on something that I</v>

3278
02:26:23.981 --> 02:26:26.320
<v Speaker 1>think we can fix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3279
02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:29.560
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the change in diet thing with that guy</v>

3280
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:34.060
<v Speaker 1>where he went and fasted for 360 plus</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

3281
02:26:34.390 --> 02:26:37.450
<v Speaker 1>what did he eat when he got back on</v>
<v Speaker 1>food?</v>

3282
02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know the answer now.</v>

3283
02:26:40.061 --> 02:26:41.320
<v Speaker 1>That might be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just,</v>

3284
02:26:41.350 --> 02:26:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't recall that being in the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it wasn't,</v>

3285
02:26:46.541 --> 02:26:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anybody did the follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

3286
02:26:48.191 --> 02:26:50.230
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that's the interesting question to</v>

3287
02:26:50.490 --> 02:26:52.900
<v Speaker 1>kind of feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he got his life back,</v>

3288
02:26:52.901 --> 02:26:53.734
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3289
02:26:54.010 --> 02:26:55.630
<v Speaker 1>and my recollection is he was a young</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3290
02:26:55.660 --> 02:26:57.100
<v Speaker 1>He was in his late twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3291
02:26:57.250 --> 02:26:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I remember that as well.</v>

3292
02:26:58.840 --> 02:26:59.673
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3293
02:27:00.010 --> 02:27:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I would like to find out what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating now to keep his weight at the</v>

3294
02:27:03.221 --> 02:27:04.054
<v Speaker 1>same level.</v>

3295
02:27:04.450 --> 02:27:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must just be so thankful.</v>

3296
02:27:06.311 --> 02:27:07.450
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be like,</v>

3297
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that are pretty</v>

3298
02:27:10.781 --> 02:27:15.730
<v Speaker 1>overweight and one that died pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently who was really big and he just</v>

3299
02:27:15.731 --> 02:27:18.520
<v Speaker 1>had this feeling when he would meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3300
02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked about it a little bit,</v>

3301
02:27:20.441 --> 02:27:24.220
<v Speaker 1>it was just obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just this thing where you're</v>

3302
02:27:24.221 --> 02:27:25.001
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3303
02:27:25.001 --> 02:27:28.540
<v Speaker 1>look at this enormous fat guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to go from that to,</v>

3304
02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:29.793
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy,</v>

3305
02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:31.520
<v Speaker 1>there's normal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3306
02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:33.820
<v Speaker 1>that's just a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 168 pound guy.</v>

3307
02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No difference between the hand.</v>

3308
02:27:35.940 --> 02:27:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I gotta Tell Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know we,</v>

3309
02:27:38.071 --> 02:27:40.930
<v Speaker 1>we love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love to beat up on fat people.</v>

3310
02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:43.390
<v Speaker 1>We love to turn it into a character</v>
<v Speaker 1>defect.</v>

3311
02:27:43.391 --> 02:27:47.800
<v Speaker 1>But I gotta tell you virtually every fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>person that I know or that I've taken</v>

3312
02:27:47.801 --> 02:27:50.950
<v Speaker 1>care of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not disproportionately eating</v>

3313
02:27:50.951 --> 02:27:53.230
<v Speaker 1>more than their peers in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3314
02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:55.480
<v Speaker 1>but not unbalanced it.</v>

3315
02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:00.250
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that they simply do</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything incorrectly,</v>

3316
02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:01.930
<v Speaker 1>metabolically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3317
02:28:01.931 --> 02:28:05.200
<v Speaker 1>so their body is functioning correctly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

3318
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:07.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a genetic component.</v>

3319
02:28:07.630 --> 02:28:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I think there are dietary exacerbations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think certainly not exercising makes</v>

3320
02:28:11.261 --> 02:28:13.060
<v Speaker 1>things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are lots of predisposing</v>

3321
02:28:13.061 --> 02:28:14.500
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day what's</v>

3322
02:28:14.501 --> 02:28:17.920
<v Speaker 1>happening is when you and I eat like</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

3323
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:21.350
<v Speaker 1>let's take a meal that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like if you had pancakes and</v>

3324
02:28:21.351 --> 02:28:23.450
<v Speaker 1>scrambled eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be like a really good mix of,</v>

3325
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:25.550
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a third carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a third protein,</v>

3326
02:28:25.551 --> 02:28:27.980
<v Speaker 1>a third fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a shit ton of nutrient,</v>

3327
02:28:27.981 --> 02:28:30.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you or I ate that,</v>

3328
02:28:30.650 --> 02:28:32.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably wouldn't be that good for</v>

3329
02:28:32.091 --> 02:28:33.170
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like we,</v>

3330
02:28:33.210 --> 02:28:34.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say we just finished a workout or</v>

3331
02:28:34.971 --> 02:28:39.140
<v Speaker 1>something like we're going to partition</v>
<v Speaker 1>such that that glycogen will first and</v>

3332
02:28:39.141 --> 02:28:43.340
<v Speaker 1>foremost go to replace the muscle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>liver stores of glycogen because we have</v>

3333
02:28:43.341 --> 02:28:45.860
<v Speaker 1>bigger muscles and our muscles are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>insulin sensitive.</v>

3334
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:49.400
<v Speaker 1>We can actually disproportionately put</v>
<v Speaker 1>more glycogen into our muscles,</v>

3335
02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:51.170
<v Speaker 1>into the leg muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you'll have done that,</v>

3336
02:28:51.171 --> 02:28:52.370
<v Speaker 1>run up the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3337
02:28:52.970 --> 02:28:54.770
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then furthermore,</v>

3338
02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:59.720
<v Speaker 1>when we want to recruit energy again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have the ability to actually go</v>

3339
02:28:59.721 --> 02:29:01.040
<v Speaker 1>back and get fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially,</v>

3340
02:29:01.090 --> 02:29:01.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

3341
02:29:01.641 --> 02:29:06.641
<v Speaker 1>break down fat at lower atp demands than</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily always going to glycogen.</v>

3342
02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:09.620
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we partition fuel in a smarter way.</v>

3343
02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And these patients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can measure this clinically</v>

3344
02:29:12.591 --> 02:29:16.430
<v Speaker 1>using something called rer and of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing other blood tests,</v>

3345
02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:18.380
<v Speaker 1>like they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

3346
02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:22.280
<v Speaker 1>they can't break down their own fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their body is essentially broken in</v>

3347
02:29:22.281 --> 02:29:24.710
<v Speaker 1>that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can be fixed with,</v>

3348
02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:27.740
<v Speaker 1>with diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard problem because the way I</v>

3349
02:29:27.741 --> 02:29:31.190
<v Speaker 1>explain it to people is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so clinically I'm not interested in</v>

3350
02:29:31.191 --> 02:29:32.060
<v Speaker 1>weight loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3351
02:29:32.061 --> 02:29:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm much more interested in longevity</v>

3352
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:37.550
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes weight loss comes with that,</v>

3353
02:29:37.551 --> 02:29:41.000
<v Speaker 1>but I like if I ever get stuck doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight loss,</v>

3354
02:29:41.001 --> 02:29:41.834
<v Speaker 1>like I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

3355
02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing the wrong thing for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

3356
02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:46.190
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I say to people when they want</v>

3357
02:29:46.191 --> 02:29:47.300
<v Speaker 1>to lose weight is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3358
02:29:47.301 --> 02:29:48.890
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to lose fat.</v>

3359
02:29:49.070 --> 02:29:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be very clear on our semantics.</v>

3360
02:29:51.860 --> 02:29:53.840
<v Speaker 1>It weight is irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3361
02:29:53.841 --> 02:29:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're a cyclist or some athlete</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whom the actual scale means</v>

3362
02:29:57.141 --> 02:29:57.900
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for,</v>

3363
02:29:57.900 --> 02:29:59.870
<v Speaker 1>for people like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you want to lose fat,</v>

3364
02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:01.760
<v Speaker 1>not wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you say you want to lose</v>

3365
02:30:01.761 --> 02:30:02.990
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean in English?</v>

3366
02:30:03.950 --> 02:30:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want fewer fat cells or do you</v>

3367
02:30:05.901 --> 02:30:09.590
<v Speaker 1>want each fat cell to be smaller?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are totally different questions.</v>

3368
02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:11.930
<v Speaker 1>If you want fewer fat cells have</v>
<v Speaker 1>liposuction,</v>

3369
02:30:12.890 --> 02:30:14.780
<v Speaker 1>but we know that that doesn't fix you</v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolically.</v>

3370
02:30:14.781 --> 02:30:17.870
<v Speaker 1>So if you want fewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be less fat,</v>

3371
02:30:17.900 --> 02:30:22.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to have smaller fat cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now at fat cell conceptually has two</v>

3372
02:30:22.731 --> 02:30:23.900
<v Speaker 1>inputs and one output.</v>

3373
02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:27.020
<v Speaker 1>So now I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's reframe the question.</v>

3374
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:28.960
<v Speaker 1>You've got a room with a hundred people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

3375
02:30:28.961 --> 02:30:32.330
<v Speaker 1>You want fewer people in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has to happen?</v>

3376
02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:35.000
<v Speaker 1>More people have to leave the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then enter the room.</v>

3377
02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:37.700
<v Speaker 1>So similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a fat cell and you want it</v>

3378
02:30:37.701 --> 02:30:40.100
<v Speaker 1>to be less fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get more fat out of it.</v>

3379
02:30:40.101 --> 02:30:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Then enters it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that exits the cell exits</v>

3380
02:30:43.191 --> 02:30:47.240
<v Speaker 1>via a process called lipolysis and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inputs to a fat cell or something called</v>

3381
02:30:47.241 --> 02:30:50.180
<v Speaker 1>De Novo Lipogenesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is turning carbohydrates into fat.</v>

3382
02:30:50.420 --> 02:30:53.000
<v Speaker 1>And Reyes tariffs location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is turning fat,</v>

3383
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:56.420
<v Speaker 1>like in a free fatty acid into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>triglyceride back into a fat cell.</v>

3384
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Each of those three doors is controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>by hormones.</v>

3385
02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:05.800
<v Speaker 1>And so the purpose of nutrition or</v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting or exercise or drugs or hormones</v>

3386
02:31:06.951 --> 02:31:10.610
<v Speaker 1>or all these things is to manipulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>those hormones in the direction of what</v>

3387
02:31:10.611 --> 02:31:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I call negative fat flux or what would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be referred to in the literature as fat</v>

3388
02:31:15.051 --> 02:31:16.580
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative fat balance.</v>

3389
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 1>And the hormones that drive that are are</v>
<v Speaker 1>insulin,</v>

3390
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:21.840
<v Speaker 1>hormone sensitive lipase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>

3391
02:31:21.841 --> 02:31:25.110
<v Speaker 1>estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortisol being the five most important</v>

3392
02:31:25.111 --> 02:31:26.400
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3393
02:31:26.430 --> 02:31:28.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe someone will disagree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think those are the five that</v>

3394
02:31:28.741 --> 02:31:30.240
<v Speaker 1>ruled the roost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

3395
02:31:30.930 --> 02:31:33.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you manipulate those?</v>

3396
02:31:33.570 --> 02:31:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insulin seems to be the most important</v>

3397
02:31:35.611 --> 02:31:40.080
<v Speaker 1>of the five and there's no better way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower insulin than to not eat.</v>

3398
02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:45.980
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that happened to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude who went 382 days without anything</v>

3399
02:31:46.681 --> 02:31:50.910
<v Speaker 1>but water and minerals is he basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>had very low insulin levels.</v>

3400
02:31:51.420 --> 02:31:53.820
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once he got into raging Ketosis,</v>

3401
02:31:53.821 --> 02:31:58.821
<v Speaker 1>which he got into by about day seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his insulin came up only to prevent him</v>

3402
02:31:59.161 --> 02:32:03.360
<v Speaker 1>from going into Ketoacidosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was what would happen if he had no</v>

3403
02:32:03.361 --> 02:32:04.560
<v Speaker 1>insulin response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

3404
02:32:04.561 --> 02:32:07.470
<v Speaker 1>if he was a type one diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have died if ketoacidosis,</v>

3405
02:32:07.770 --> 02:32:11.640
<v Speaker 1>because he wouldn't have had the insulin</v>
<v Speaker 1>to regulate the uptick of ketones.</v>

3406
02:32:11.850 --> 02:32:14.220
<v Speaker 1>But if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this because we have a normal</v>

3407
02:32:14.221 --> 02:32:17.550
<v Speaker 1>pancreas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would actually remake just enough</v>

3408
02:32:17.551 --> 02:32:22.551
<v Speaker 1>insulin to suppress key to genesis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep that Beta hydroxy butyrate level in</v>

3409
02:32:22.561 --> 02:32:23.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3410
02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:27.270
<v Speaker 1>kind of in the neighborhood of probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven or eight millimolar as opposed to</v>

3411
02:32:27.271 --> 02:32:30.270
<v Speaker 1>getting north of 12 to 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is when you get into trouble.</v>

3412
02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:32.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3413
02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:36.870
<v Speaker 1>how do you manipulate insulin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nutrition is the first way.</v>

3414
02:32:36.871 --> 02:32:39.570
<v Speaker 1>If you can't fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next best thing is to reduce</v>

3415
02:32:39.571 --> 02:32:41.340
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carbohydrates,</v>

3416
02:32:41.341 --> 02:32:43.560
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're the most insulinogenic</v>
<v Speaker 1>of food,</v>

3417
02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:45.900
<v Speaker 1>although protein can be quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>insulinogenic as well.</v>

3418
02:32:45.901 --> 02:32:48.180
<v Speaker 1>It has a different response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3419
02:32:48.510 --> 02:32:50.700
<v Speaker 1>and then that's when you start to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about these other things.</v>

3420
02:32:50.701 --> 02:32:53.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen patients where they just can't</v>

3421
02:32:53.581 --> 02:32:56.070
<v Speaker 1>lose weight and I watch what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and they're doing everything</v>

3422
02:32:56.071 --> 02:32:58.050
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just can't lose weight.</v>

3423
02:32:58.350 --> 02:33:00.600
<v Speaker 1>But then you notice their cortisol</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels through the roof.</v>

3424
02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:03.930
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get rid of fat when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have lots of cortisol.</v>

3425
02:33:03.931 --> 02:33:08.931
<v Speaker 1>Cortisol is a very anabolic hormone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat and a very catabolic hormone to</v>

3426
02:33:09.601 --> 02:33:11.340
<v Speaker 1>muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the exact opposite of what we</v>

3427
02:33:11.341 --> 02:33:12.690
<v Speaker 1>want to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The drone,</v>

3428
02:33:12.691 --> 02:33:16.770
<v Speaker 1>of course is the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Testosterone is catabolic to fat but</v>

3429
02:33:16.771 --> 02:33:19.440
<v Speaker 1>anabolic to muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3430
02:33:19.620 --> 02:33:20.820
<v Speaker 1>and then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3431
02:33:20.821 --> 02:33:23.670
<v Speaker 1>women have a harder time because once</v>
<v Speaker 1>women go through menopause,</v>

3432
02:33:24.210 --> 02:33:26.490
<v Speaker 1>they lose all the estrogen and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

3433
02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:30.420
<v Speaker 1>And so now they lose two hormones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>play a very important role in regulating</v>

3434
02:33:30.421 --> 02:33:32.880
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for these people that are having the</v>

3435
02:33:32.881 --> 02:33:37.030
<v Speaker 1>issue with cortisol levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exacerbated by stress.</v>

3436
02:33:37.031 --> 02:33:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stress actually exacerbates your</v>

3437
02:33:40.921 --> 02:33:42.390
<v Speaker 1>weight gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3438
02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:47.370
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to a whole bunch of other</v>

3439
02:33:47.371 --> 02:33:49.710
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally eat the same diet and gain</v>

3440
02:33:49.711 --> 02:33:51.150
<v Speaker 1>more weight because of stress.</v>

3441
02:33:51.210 --> 02:33:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3442
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones are what's driving fuel</v>

3443
02:33:55.921 --> 02:33:57.390
<v Speaker 1>partitioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3444
02:33:57.630 --> 02:34:00.120
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for what you put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mouth,</v>

3445
02:34:00.510 --> 02:34:04.140
<v Speaker 1>but in many ways at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the hormones take over and decide</v>

3446
02:34:04.141 --> 02:34:06.480
<v Speaker 1>where it's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3447
02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:08.790
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you yourself,</v>

3448
02:34:08.820 --> 02:34:10.230
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your diet like?</v>

3449
02:34:10.260 --> 02:34:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you told me you only eat once a day,</v>

3450
02:34:12.061 --> 02:34:14.520
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one one meal a day or sometimes two</v>

3451
02:34:14.521 --> 02:34:16.560
<v Speaker 1>meals a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many calories you're taking in,</v>

3452
02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:19.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere near what I used to.</v>

3453
02:34:19.601 --> 02:34:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I just don't train that much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3454
02:34:21.131 --> 02:34:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I kind of lift three days a week and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I,</v>

3455
02:34:24.070 --> 02:34:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I ride like a stationary bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Peloton or I prefer this thing</v>

3456
02:34:27.881 --> 02:34:30.310
<v Speaker 1>called a Whoa who kicker where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually put your bike on it.</v>

3457
02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:32.080
<v Speaker 1>So I'll do that three or four times a</v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

3458
02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would guess when I sit down to throw</v>

3459
02:34:36.161 --> 02:34:37.990
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably 3000 calories</v>

3460
02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:40.720
<v Speaker 1>in one meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3461
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the problem is I'm a fucking</v>

3462
02:34:42.761 --> 02:34:44.950
<v Speaker 1>pig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm kinda discussed and like I can</v>

3463
02:34:44.951 --> 02:34:45.751
<v Speaker 1>eat a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3464
02:34:45.751 --> 02:34:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I gross people out of how much I</v>

3465
02:34:47.681 --> 02:34:49.040
<v Speaker 1>can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty,</v>

3466
02:34:49.570 --> 02:34:53.680
<v Speaker 1>for me to only eat 3000 calories in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting is like tame.</v>

3467
02:34:54.010 --> 02:34:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3468
02:34:54.610 --> 02:34:54.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3469
02:34:54.971 --> 02:34:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I have an eating disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

3470
02:34:56.980 --> 02:35:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean I sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have disordered eating.</v>

3471
02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3472
02:35:01.470 --> 02:35:04.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm seems like you just enjoy it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it once a day.</v>

3473
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:06.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under any circumstance.</v>

3474
02:35:06.271 --> 02:35:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Like I stress eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>

3475
02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I do get a dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't get a dopamine high from</v>

3476
02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:18.840
<v Speaker 1>gambling or alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't like those things are not</v>

3477
02:35:20.111 --> 02:35:23.530
<v Speaker 1>things that I can abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I'm really in a shitty place</v>

3478
02:35:23.531 --> 02:35:25.420
<v Speaker 1>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

3479
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I sued and punish myself with food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people do.</v>

3480
02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:32.950
<v Speaker 1>So you could relate and as a thin man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3481
02:35:32.951 --> 02:35:35.860
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking to people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>large and have the same issue,</v>

3482
02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:38.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing to know its toll.</v>

3483
02:35:38.410 --> 02:35:40.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely understand what these</v>

3484
02:35:40.451 --> 02:35:43.690
<v Speaker 1>people are going through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least in as much as what the,</v>

3485
02:35:44.410 --> 02:35:46.600
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the physiologic desire for it.</v>

3486
02:35:46.601 --> 02:35:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously they will experience something</v>

3487
02:35:48.551 --> 02:35:51.190
<v Speaker 1>even worse because there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I can like,</v>

3488
02:35:51.191 --> 02:35:53.110
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have abs on,</v>

3489
02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't have veins in my abs anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

3490
02:35:55.660 --> 02:35:57.400
<v Speaker 1>when I was in a ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3491
02:35:57.401 --> 02:36:00.040
<v Speaker 1>7% body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was completely ripped.</v>

3492
02:36:00.190 --> 02:36:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ripped anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3493
02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:04.030
<v Speaker 1>relative to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of bugs me.</v>

3494
02:36:04.031 --> 02:36:05.350
<v Speaker 1>But like nobody really knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3495
02:36:05.351 --> 02:36:08.470
<v Speaker 1>nobody really gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can still like look like a super</v>

3496
02:36:08.471 --> 02:36:10.540
<v Speaker 1>healthy dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a super lean dude,</v>

3497
02:36:10.541 --> 02:36:12.430
<v Speaker 1>even if I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3498
02:36:12.970 --> 02:36:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when Shit's going wrong,</v>

3499
02:36:15.911 --> 02:36:19.390
<v Speaker 1>like I want to eat some of the worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods that have ever been created.</v>

3500
02:36:20.650 --> 02:36:21.100
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3501
02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Why is that instinct there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is the instinct that when you're not</v>

3502
02:36:24.551 --> 02:36:27.880
<v Speaker 1>feeling like for me it's tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm tired,</v>

3503
02:36:27.881 --> 02:36:30.070
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm coming home from a Gig and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's two o'clock in the morning,</v>

3504
02:36:30.071 --> 02:36:32.410
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for me to drive past</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday's,</v>

3505
02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:34.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to Wendy's and Reno.</v>

3506
02:36:35.150 --> 02:36:36.700
<v Speaker 1>That could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be a course that could be an</v>

3507
02:36:36.701 --> 02:36:39.010
<v Speaker 1>adrenal issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of times we'll see when people</v>

3508
02:36:39.700 --> 02:36:43.570
<v Speaker 1>either turn to sugar or salt in times of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fatigue,</v>

3509
02:36:43.571 --> 02:36:45.110
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3510
02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the right level of free</v>

3511
02:36:47.051 --> 02:36:50.500
<v Speaker 1>cortisol at that moment in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always feel it's a willpower issue</v>

3512
02:36:50.570 --> 02:36:53.510
<v Speaker 1>because if I could just get home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll cook something healthy and then I</v>

3513
02:36:53.511 --> 02:36:55.610
<v Speaker 1>have victory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3514
02:36:57.550 --> 02:36:59.800
<v Speaker 1>cause if I get home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've got healthy food at home,</v>

3515
02:36:59.801 --> 02:37:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I eat something really good and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as good.</v>

3516
02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:05.650
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about also there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you doing something,</v>

3517
02:37:05.651 --> 02:37:06.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't do,</v>

3518
02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:09.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a little weird little charge</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3519
02:37:09.461 --> 02:37:10.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

3520
02:37:10.271 --> 02:37:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's different for different</v>

3521
02:37:11.831 --> 02:37:13.180
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for me,</v>

3522
02:37:13.570 --> 02:37:15.560
<v Speaker 1>if I'm really going to be brutally about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3523
02:37:15.561 --> 02:37:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it's that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3524
02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes just want to punish myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

3525
02:37:18.831 --> 02:37:22.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eating bad food is like when you're</v>

3526
02:37:22.881 --> 02:37:24.060
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat bad food,</v>

3527
02:37:24.090 --> 02:37:26.720
<v Speaker 1>you give yourself a cheat day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3528
02:37:27.350 --> 02:37:28.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3529
02:37:28.191 --> 02:37:29.930
<v Speaker 1>not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3530
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I think these days and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got kids,</v>

3531
02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:34.670
<v Speaker 1>so you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheat Day is just present themselves</v>

3532
02:37:34.671 --> 02:37:37.580
<v Speaker 1>often enough or other reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately,</v>

3533
02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I think for me the cheat meals are a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times cleaning up a kid's plate or</v>

3534
02:37:41.871 --> 02:37:43.100
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3535
02:37:43.101 --> 02:37:44.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3536
02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing is I just,</v>

3537
02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know why I just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty food.</v>

3538
02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Like I like macaroni and cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3539
02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:51.860
<v Speaker 1>if they don't eat their macaroni and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheese,</v>

3540
02:37:51.861 --> 02:37:54.110
<v Speaker 1>I got to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids asked me to make them peanut</v>

3541
02:37:54.111 --> 02:37:56.090
<v Speaker 1>butter and jelly the other day and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

3542
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:58.970
<v Speaker 1>each is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking fantastic.</v>

3543
02:37:58.971 --> 02:38:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Especially with the glass of milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't need the crusts.</v>

3544
02:38:01.881 --> 02:38:02.361
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3545
02:38:02.361 --> 02:38:03.350
<v Speaker 1>he's crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't go.</v>

3546
02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happens in Africa.</v>

3547
02:38:05.661 --> 02:38:08.210
<v Speaker 1>That shit eat that crow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I ate the Krug and I thought about</v>

3548
02:38:08.211 --> 02:38:10.430
<v Speaker 1>all the bread with peanut butter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jelly.</v>

3549
02:38:10.431 --> 02:38:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I ate in those cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically had a fucking sandwich.</v>

3550
02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm pretending that I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating a little,</v>

3551
02:38:15.921 --> 02:38:17.450
<v Speaker 1>cried a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worse than you,</v>

3552
02:38:17.451 --> 02:38:18.380
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I would've done in that</v>

3553
02:38:18.381 --> 02:38:19.940
<v Speaker 1>situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've been like peanut butter</v>

3554
02:38:19.941 --> 02:38:22.280
<v Speaker 1>jellies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I would have started by saying</v>

3555
02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:25.220
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough peanut butter and jam</v>
<v Speaker 1>on these crusts too.</v>

3556
02:38:25.230 --> 02:38:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't have the right ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would have like got out of the</v>

3557
02:38:27.101 --> 02:38:29.330
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter and the jam and dip the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crust in there and like,</v>

3558
02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:30.500
<v Speaker 1>and then I would've probably made a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich.</v>

3559
02:38:30.530 --> 02:38:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm just happy that I didn't need a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwich.</v>

3560
02:38:32.151 --> 02:38:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm of my own as well as their cross</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I probably cook once,</v>

3561
02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:40.760
<v Speaker 1>once the fucking gates are open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I'm out there making spaghetti and</v>

3562
02:38:40.761 --> 02:38:41.900
<v Speaker 1>meatballs like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3563
02:38:41.930 --> 02:38:43.880
<v Speaker 1>let's get some fucking ice cream in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hispanics too.</v>

3564
02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:46.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a Merde fucking off?</v>

3565
02:38:46.590 --> 02:38:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you,</v>

3566
02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:50.570
<v Speaker 1>what do you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you sit down for these 3000</v>

3567
02:38:50.571 --> 02:38:51.880
<v Speaker 1>calorie meals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3568
02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:54.860
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm in control of the meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I usually am and I'm,</v>

3569
02:38:54.861 --> 02:38:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm super boring dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

3570
02:38:56.871 --> 02:38:59.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to have a salad in a bowl.</v>

3571
02:38:59.081 --> 02:39:01.140
<v Speaker 1>It's larger than my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3572
02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:03.140
<v Speaker 1>so I was referred to that as a manly</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl.</v>

3573
02:39:03.170 --> 02:39:07.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the definition of a manly bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's gotta be like a staggering</v>

3574
02:39:07.041 --> 02:39:10.010
<v Speaker 1>amount of salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my salad is the same every freaking</v>

3575
02:39:10.011 --> 02:39:11.540
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Romaine lettuce,</v>

3576
02:39:11.570 --> 02:39:12.403
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3577
02:39:12.410 --> 02:39:13.430
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>

3578
02:39:13.431 --> 02:39:15.170
<v Speaker 1>cucumbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrots.</v>

3579
02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:17.510
<v Speaker 1>And then the dressing is just extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>virgin olive oil,</v>

3580
02:39:17.511 --> 02:39:21.320
<v Speaker 1>freshly squeezed lemon salt and pepper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty bland salad in that</v>

3581
02:39:21.321 --> 02:39:22.154
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

3582
02:39:22.370 --> 02:39:24.170
<v Speaker 1>I can eat that all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

3583
02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And then it's a serving of protein and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually cycle through salmon,</v>

3584
02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:31.340
<v Speaker 1>pork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steak,</v>

3585
02:39:31.610 --> 02:39:33.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some Gamey meat,</v>

3586
02:39:33.710 --> 02:39:36.620
<v Speaker 1>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sort of cycled through that and</v>

3587
02:39:36.621 --> 02:39:39.620
<v Speaker 1>then I usually have some sort of starchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetable to go with it.</v>

3588
02:39:39.710 --> 02:39:41.330
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3589
02:39:41.540 --> 02:39:43.040
<v Speaker 1>potato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rice.</v>

3590
02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:44.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lately the last couple of weeks I've</v>

3591
02:39:44.901 --> 02:39:48.980
<v Speaker 1>been skipping the starch and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainlining extra salad and extra</v>

3592
02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:51.050
<v Speaker 1>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3593
02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:53.720
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3594
02:39:53.730 --> 02:39:56.420
<v Speaker 1>but that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm in San Diego where I</v>

3595
02:39:56.421 --> 02:39:58.160
<v Speaker 1>have control over what I eat more in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

3596
02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:01.640
<v Speaker 1>I never eat in my apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just never cook,</v>

3597
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:05.990
<v Speaker 1>so I always go out and there it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little less regulated.</v>

3598
02:40:05.991 --> 02:40:06.621
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3599
02:40:06.621 --> 02:40:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I just love Indian food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Persian food.</v>

3600
02:40:08.511 --> 02:40:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I love food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That unfortunately is,</v>

3601
02:40:10.730 --> 02:40:13.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got more carbs in it then I'm probably</v>

3602
02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:15.870
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I try to modify.</v>

3603
02:40:15.871 --> 02:40:20.871
<v Speaker 1>So like last week I had um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Bob who's actually one of my,</v>

3604
02:40:21.260 --> 02:40:22.650
<v Speaker 1>my head analyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives in Boston.</v>

3605
02:40:22.651 --> 02:40:24.060
<v Speaker 1>He came down to New York for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

3606
02:40:24.061 --> 02:40:26.130
<v Speaker 1>We were doing some work and we went out</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

3607
02:40:26.131 --> 02:40:29.400
<v Speaker 1>he loves Indiana and I live in and so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>went out for Indian one night and we</v>

3608
02:40:29.401 --> 02:40:33.960
<v Speaker 1>hadn't eaten all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we ordered I think seven or eight</v>

3609
02:40:33.970 --> 02:40:37.260
<v Speaker 1>entrees and the waiter is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3610
02:40:37.650 --> 02:40:39.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

3611
02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:41.670
<v Speaker 1>no you ordered seven or eight entrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3612
02:40:41.671 --> 02:40:42.240
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3613
02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:43.073
<v Speaker 1>we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got it,</v>

3614
02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:43.973
<v Speaker 1>we're good.</v>

3615
02:40:44.130 --> 02:40:44.881
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3616
02:40:44.881 --> 02:40:48.270
<v Speaker 1>we sort of skipped the non or maybe had</v>
<v Speaker 1>one non to split instead of,</v>

3617
02:40:48.271 --> 02:40:51.510
<v Speaker 1>normally I would've had like four nuns</v>
<v Speaker 1>and only had one bowl of rice.</v>

3618
02:40:51.930 --> 02:40:54.060
<v Speaker 1>But still a lot of carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

3619
02:40:54.061 --> 02:40:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3620
02:40:54.540 --> 02:40:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Naan bread is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily babied more of it than I did and</v>

3621
02:40:58.021 --> 02:41:00.990
<v Speaker 1>he's way more jacked than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he can get away with eating way more</v>

3622
02:41:01.260 --> 02:41:03.060
<v Speaker 1>non than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3623
02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:04.350
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that night,</v>

3624
02:41:04.380 --> 02:41:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean also those sauces are like so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fatty.</v>

3625
02:41:07.470 --> 02:41:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sure that was a 4,000 calorie</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw down.</v>

3626
02:41:10.890 --> 02:41:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I'm,</v>

3627
02:41:12.970 --> 02:41:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty good about is when I'm done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

3628
02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:19.140
<v Speaker 1>So that's the other thing about time</v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted feeding that I think I get</v>

3629
02:41:19.141 --> 02:41:22.950
<v Speaker 1>away with more because like when I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to my apartment,</v>

3630
02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I will rarely have another bite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I wake up in the morning,</v>

3631
02:41:26.941 --> 02:41:28.650
<v Speaker 1>it's like black coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3632
02:41:28.651 --> 02:41:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sneaking little shit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the day.</v>

3633
02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas if I'm not fasting,</v>

3634
02:41:33.810 --> 02:41:37.480
<v Speaker 1>it's just too easy for me to just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>skip stuff.</v>

3635
02:41:37.700 --> 02:41:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in my office,</v>

3636
02:41:39.811 --> 02:41:44.280
<v Speaker 1>like I shared my office in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I share with another doctor who is his</v>

3637
02:41:44.281 --> 02:41:44.821
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

3638
02:41:44.821 --> 02:41:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I kind of sublet an office there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I've never seen more shit in my</v>

3639
02:41:48.661 --> 02:41:50.640
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like then the stuff patients bring for</v>

3640
02:41:50.641 --> 02:41:55.641
<v Speaker 1>him to eat and patients bring him shitty</v>
<v Speaker 1>food nonstop doctor.</v>

3641
02:41:56.100 --> 02:41:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Of course they're trying to torture him</v>
<v Speaker 1>for torture and now,</v>

3642
02:41:58.651 --> 02:42:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I dunno maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

3643
02:42:00.361 --> 02:42:02.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are drug reps will bring stuff by or</v>

3644
02:42:02.341 --> 02:42:03.270
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just like,</v>

3645
02:42:03.330 --> 02:42:05.760
<v Speaker 1>there's an endless barrage of bad food</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat,</v>

3646
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:07.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's like good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad food.</v>

3647
02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they were bringing like Oreos</v>

3648
02:42:09.541 --> 02:42:12.780
<v Speaker 1>that actually wouldn't tempt me despite</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monkey homecooked Brownie.</v>

3649
02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:13.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3650
02:42:14.060 --> 02:42:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Like I forget the name of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3651
02:42:17.431 --> 02:42:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name of some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these bakeries up there,</v>

3652
02:42:19.561 --> 02:42:20.394
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3653
02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:24.630
<v Speaker 1>there's like some ridiculous shit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows up and every once in a while like</v>

3654
02:42:25.320 --> 02:42:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3655
02:42:26.100 --> 02:42:27.930
<v Speaker 1>the fastest breaking at four o'clock</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

3656
02:42:28.650 --> 02:42:29.730
<v Speaker 1>give me one of those scones.</v>

3657
02:42:31.050 --> 02:42:33.450
<v Speaker 1>But as long as you do it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderation,</v>

3658
02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:35.760
<v Speaker 1>you think you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3659
02:42:35.761 --> 02:42:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Except that my motto in life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderation is the only thing worth doing</v>

3660
02:42:38.731 --> 02:42:41.910
<v Speaker 1>in moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is once I start like,</v>

3661
02:42:42.810 --> 02:42:45.090
<v Speaker 1>it's usually the wheels come off the bus</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty quick.</v>

3662
02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you try to mitigate that with</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise?</v>

3663
02:42:47.221 --> 02:42:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Like do you say that went off the rails</v>
<v Speaker 1>today?</v>

3664
02:42:49.230 --> 02:42:52.110
<v Speaker 1>So let's hit the gym and go hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's less that it's usually I</v>

3665
02:42:52.150 --> 02:42:54.680
<v Speaker 1>anticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like so.</v>

3666
02:42:54.910 --> 02:42:58.620
<v Speaker 1>So last week a buddy of mine went to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the David Bowie exhibit.</v>

3667
02:42:58.621 --> 02:42:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Did you see it by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Brooklyn?</v>

3668
02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:01.770
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a Bowie fan at all?</v>

3669
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>

3670
02:43:03.181 --> 02:43:06.480
<v Speaker 1>It's there until mid June or July</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn at the Brooklyn Museum.</v>

3671
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:09.810
<v Speaker 1>It is clean a couple of weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was only there for two days for</v>

3672
02:43:09.811 --> 02:43:11.530
<v Speaker 1>the UFC and I had a show out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3673
02:43:12.190 --> 02:43:14.560
<v Speaker 1>so probably one of the best shows I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in my life.</v>

3674
02:43:14.830 --> 02:43:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

3675
02:43:16.610 --> 02:43:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it closed at 11:00 PM and</v>

3676
02:43:19.601 --> 02:43:20.890
<v Speaker 1>they'd just didn't have the heart to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me.</v>

3677
02:43:20.891 --> 02:43:24.220
<v Speaker 1>So I was there until midnight before</v>
<v Speaker 1>they finally came and escorted me out of</v>

3678
02:43:24.221 --> 02:43:24.930
<v Speaker 1>the building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3679
02:43:24.930 --> 02:43:25.541
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

3680
02:43:25.541 --> 02:43:28.630
<v Speaker 1>We closed an hour ago and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn sorry man.</v>

3681
02:43:28.940 --> 02:43:31.750
<v Speaker 1>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an exhibit of all of his art,</v>

3682
02:43:31.751 --> 02:43:33.420
<v Speaker 1>all of his music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of,</v>

3683
02:43:33.490 --> 02:43:34.780
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done.</v>

3684
02:43:35.110 --> 02:43:37.690
<v Speaker 1>You know when you go to museums and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the headphones on you and you have</v>

3685
02:43:37.691 --> 02:43:39.220
<v Speaker 1>to like push the button to hear the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3686
02:43:39.221 --> 02:43:42.250
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whatever you stand near,</v>

3687
02:43:42.340 --> 02:43:46.720
<v Speaker 1>you get the music associated with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus or minus and narrative as</v>

3688
02:43:46.721 --> 02:43:50.950
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like,</v>

3689
02:43:50.951 --> 02:43:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I've never like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they had every one of his</v>

3690
02:43:53.861 --> 02:43:55.450
<v Speaker 1>costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3691
02:43:55.610 --> 02:43:57.070
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was epic.</v>

3692
02:43:57.220 --> 02:44:00.580
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that night I knew we were going to go</v>

3693
02:44:00.581 --> 02:44:04.750
<v Speaker 1>out for a killer dinner before in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn before we went to the show.</v>

3694
02:44:05.770 --> 02:44:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And so normally I exercise in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

3695
02:44:08.171 --> 02:44:09.490
<v Speaker 1>but that day I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3696
02:44:10.090 --> 02:44:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your muscles will be a little bit more</v>

3697
02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:16.630
<v Speaker 1>insulin sensitive if you can exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 30 minutes before you eat.</v>

3698
02:44:16.631 --> 02:44:20.800
<v Speaker 1>That's probably about the sweet spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I were to ride at like eight in</v>

3699
02:44:20.801 --> 02:44:23.470
<v Speaker 1>the morning and then not eat until seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night,</v>

3700
02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:25.990
<v Speaker 1>I Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would still eventually get the</v>

3701
02:44:25.991 --> 02:44:27.850
<v Speaker 1>glycogen there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't be quite as easy.</v>

3702
02:44:27.851 --> 02:44:28.960
<v Speaker 1>It would require a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>insulin.</v>

3703
02:44:29.050 --> 02:44:31.780
<v Speaker 1>So in that case I just modified my day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was like,</v>

3704
02:44:31.781 --> 02:44:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made my schedule such that I could ride</v>

3705
02:44:33.971 --> 02:44:38.380
<v Speaker 1>at 5:00 PM in anticipation of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also wrote a little longer and a</v>

3706
02:44:38.381 --> 02:44:41.980
<v Speaker 1>little harder just you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's really crush this session so</v>

3707
02:44:41.981 --> 02:44:44.350
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go and enjoy dinner a little bit</v>

3708
02:44:44.351 --> 02:44:45.160
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

3709
02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Well it sounds like you enjoy a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3710
02:44:47.531 --> 02:44:49.500
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got your,</v>

3711
02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:52.960
<v Speaker 1>your medical practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have all these different things you</v>

3712
02:44:52.961 --> 02:44:57.490
<v Speaker 1>participated in as far as athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing and swimming and cycling.</v>

3713
02:44:58.510 --> 02:45:02.350
<v Speaker 1>What jazzes you up now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you like,</v>

3714
02:45:02.351 --> 02:45:04.330
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you obviously have a mind that requires</v>

3715
02:45:04.331 --> 02:45:05.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot of stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

3716
02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:08.080
<v Speaker 1>what keeps you going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3717
02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this longevity thing is the</v>

3718
02:45:11.891 --> 02:45:15.850
<v Speaker 1>perfect culmination of all of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous lives in terms of professional</v>

3719
02:45:15.851 --> 02:45:18.550
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean I used to be an engineer and</v>

3720
02:45:18.551 --> 02:45:23.551
<v Speaker 1>then I went into surgery and then I left</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and went into management consulting</v>

3721
02:45:24.131 --> 02:45:26.770
<v Speaker 1>and it was a hundred like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had nothing to do with medicine for</v>

3722
02:45:26.771 --> 02:45:29.170
<v Speaker 1>several years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just worked in credit risk modeling.</v>

3723
02:45:29.740 --> 02:45:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And so in many ways like when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>combine medicine with engineering,</v>

3724
02:45:33.671 --> 02:45:37.240
<v Speaker 1>with risk management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what longevity is all about.</v>

3725
02:45:37.270 --> 02:45:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>practitioners,</v>

3726
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:43.000
<v Speaker 1>you know the roll up your sleeves</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach that that's what it is.</v>

3727
02:45:43.001 --> 02:45:47.440
<v Speaker 1>So I think that scratches that itch but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think for me like I have to be</v>

3728
02:45:47.441 --> 02:45:50.440
<v Speaker 1>sort of mastering something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where archery and race car</v>

3729
02:45:50.441 --> 02:45:53.710
<v Speaker 1>driving today become just total</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessions.</v>

3730
02:45:53.711 --> 02:45:56.080
<v Speaker 1>And like when we were talking earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like yeah,</v>

3731
02:45:56.081 --> 02:45:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know that I'll ever go</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt because I don't know that I want to</v>

3732
02:45:58.481 --> 02:46:00.370
<v Speaker 1>spend three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3733
02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:02.980
<v Speaker 1>taking 10 shots when I could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending,</v>

3734
02:46:02.981 --> 02:46:06.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three days taking 300 shots in my</v>

3735
02:46:06.641 --> 02:46:08.050
<v Speaker 1>backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in the end,</v>

3736
02:46:08.051 --> 02:46:13.051
<v Speaker 1>I think what I really just obsess over</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trying to get better at something.</v>

3737
02:46:13.370 --> 02:46:16.130
<v Speaker 1>And the nice thing when you start things</v>
<v Speaker 1>late in life,</v>

3738
02:46:16.131 --> 02:46:20.150
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't get my racing license till</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years ago and I only picked up</v>

3739
02:46:20.151 --> 02:46:22.520
<v Speaker 1>archery two years ago or maybe a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

3740
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Like when you suck so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the opportunity to get better is</v>

3741
02:46:26.271 --> 02:46:30.410
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the bigger itch for me is not</v>

3742
02:46:30.411 --> 02:46:33.290
<v Speaker 1>intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like tinkering.</v>

3743
02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:35.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like figuring out how to do shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

3744
02:46:36.350 --> 02:46:37.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3745
02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I share a similar interest and things I</v>
<v Speaker 1>suck at and that's what one of the</v>

3746
02:46:41.361 --> 02:46:43.580
<v Speaker 1>things that was so compelling to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about archery.</v>

3747
02:46:44.300 --> 02:46:48.860
<v Speaker 1>When did you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>2013?</v>

3748
02:46:48.861 --> 02:46:51.170
<v Speaker 1>I think I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I bought a bow before that,</v>

3749
02:46:51.171 --> 02:46:52.860
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't really use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3750
02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:56.390
<v Speaker 1>2013 I think is right when I got pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious about it.</v>

3751
02:46:57.260 --> 02:46:59.360
<v Speaker 1>You had John Dudley on your show once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't you?</v>

3752
02:46:59.420 --> 02:47:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple times.</v>

3753
02:47:01.070 --> 02:47:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't skipping Bhutan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that shot through the handle of</v>

3754
02:47:05.931 --> 02:47:08.150
<v Speaker 1>the kettle bell was that a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>yards?</v>

3755
02:47:08.180 --> 02:47:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a little more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

3756
02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

3757
02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:14.510
<v Speaker 1>that's one of my favorite things in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3758
02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:18.230
<v Speaker 1>He's helped me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a remarkable archery coach and it</v>

3759
02:47:18.231 --> 02:47:21.260
<v Speaker 1>just a great person to just a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One saw on Instagram,</v>

3760
02:47:21.261 --> 02:47:23.840
<v Speaker 1>him and Jocko and the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bumped into each other in an</v>

3761
02:47:23.841 --> 02:47:26.570
<v Speaker 1>airport and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so like I saw Jocko like two days</v>

3762
02:47:26.571 --> 02:47:30.110
<v Speaker 1>later we had coffee one day to be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jocko head tea.</v>

3763
02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I had coffee draco's a tea guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

3764
02:47:33.021 --> 02:47:34.790
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you know John Dudley</v>

3765
02:47:34.791 --> 02:47:36.070
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

3766
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:39.020
<v Speaker 1>He just grabbed me in the airport and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

3767
02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:39.980
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3768
02:47:39.980 --> 02:47:41.870
<v Speaker 1>there's shot too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see this.</v>

3769
02:47:42.450 --> 02:47:47.450
<v Speaker 1>He did it with a lighted nock let knock</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't have any idea how great it</v>

3770
02:47:51.450 --> 02:47:54.860
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cannot fathom what he just did.</v>

3771
02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I've seen him do some regular shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker when it comes to</v>

3772
02:48:00.231 --> 02:48:01.220
<v Speaker 1>archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

3773
02:48:01.221 --> 02:48:02.510
<v Speaker 1>And he's helped me.</v>

3774
02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does he live?</v>

3775
02:48:04.370 --> 02:48:07.640
<v Speaker 1>He lives in Iowa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He moved to Iowa just so he can kill big</v>

3776
02:48:07.641 --> 02:48:11.120
<v Speaker 1>giant deer because he literally bought a</v>
<v Speaker 1>farm in Iowa,</v>

3777
02:48:12.050 --> 02:48:15.980
<v Speaker 1>giant chunk of land and raises it for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has,</v>

3778
02:48:15.981 --> 02:48:20.000
<v Speaker 1>he does do some farming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but essentially what he does is raises</v>

3779
02:48:20.001 --> 02:48:21.920
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't raise him like there's no,</v>

3780
02:48:21.950 --> 02:48:23.110
<v Speaker 1>there's no fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3781
02:48:23.130 --> 02:48:26.120
<v Speaker 1>It makes it very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it favorable for them to be there.</v>

3782
02:48:26.450 --> 02:48:28.820
<v Speaker 1>He has food plots that he grows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

3783
02:48:28.821 --> 02:48:30.320
<v Speaker 1>I hunted on this place a couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

3784
02:48:30.321 --> 02:48:31.154
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3785
02:48:31.210 --> 02:48:33.410
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredible place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves it.</v>

3786
02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I bought my bow,</v>

3787
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:37.220
<v Speaker 1>like I just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3788
02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:39.960
<v Speaker 1>went into the arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like performance archery in San Diego is</v>

3789
02:48:39.961 --> 02:48:41.000
<v Speaker 1>like a place to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3790
02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went in there and it was like,</v>

3791
02:48:42.381 --> 02:48:43.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I want to do.</v>

3792
02:48:43.281 --> 02:48:43.881
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

3793
02:48:43.881 --> 02:48:44.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to do it.</v>

3794
02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:45.441
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3795
02:48:45.441 --> 02:48:47.630
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember when I got all my</v>

3796
02:48:47.631 --> 02:48:49.280
<v Speaker 1>kit and my setup and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3797
02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:52.820
<v Speaker 1>you gotta go to knock on like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta just watch this dude's videos.</v>

3798
02:48:52.821 --> 02:48:56.090
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's literally the best.</v>

3799
02:48:56.091 --> 02:48:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3800
02:48:57.811 --> 02:48:59.240
<v Speaker 1>the average person who is interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3801
02:48:59.241 --> 02:49:01.850
<v Speaker 1>and he's got a great podcast about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock on podcast,</v>

3802
02:49:01.851 --> 02:49:06.290
<v Speaker 1>but he gets so geeky and technical and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his descriptions and his understanding</v>

3803
02:49:06.291 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 1>of it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he constantly obsesses</v>

3804
02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:11.610
<v Speaker 3>about form and structure and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3805
02:49:11.611 --> 02:49:14.070
<v Speaker 3>archery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me,</v>

3806
02:49:14.130 --> 02:49:18.090
<v Speaker 3>my history as a martial artist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really jives with me.</v>

3807
02:49:18.091 --> 02:49:19.770
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you could do,</v>

3808
02:49:19.860 --> 02:49:23.970
<v Speaker 3>you could muscle things and do them</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong and develop bad habits and you'll</v>

3809
02:49:23.971 --> 02:49:28.971
<v Speaker 3>never reach your full potential or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could do things correctly and be very,</v>

3810
02:49:29.611 --> 02:49:33.440
<v Speaker 3>very disciplined and focused and</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the what,</v>

3811
02:49:33.450 --> 02:49:37.560
<v Speaker 3>why you're doing something and then re</v>
<v Speaker 3>really actually reach your full</v>

3812
02:49:37.561 --> 02:49:39.750
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's really no other way.</v>

3813
02:49:39.751 --> 02:49:43.590
<v Speaker 3>And with archery specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so satisfying.</v>

3814
02:49:43.591 --> 02:49:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Like as we were saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do pull it off and you know you</v>

3815
02:49:47.041 --> 02:49:50.820
<v Speaker 3>do execute that perfect shot with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>rhomboids and the hand goes over the</v>

3816
02:49:50.821 --> 02:49:54.900
<v Speaker 3>back shoulder and you watch that Arrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>schunk go right into that bullseye.</v>

3817
02:49:54.901 --> 02:49:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Like yes,</v>

3818
02:49:56.080 --> 02:50:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I have my daughter come out and do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow mo shot of me from behind.</v>

3819
02:50:00.431 --> 02:50:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I've got like a hundred of these dumb</v>
<v Speaker 1>things on my phone and it's just like I</v>

3820
02:50:04.361 --> 02:50:06.310
<v Speaker 1>can watch them all day and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I do it that I do it?</v>

3821
02:50:06.340 --> 02:50:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not there.</v>

3822
02:50:07.260 --> 02:50:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh sweet.</v>

3823
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:12.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of his elbow position to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>height of the elbow.</v>

3824
02:50:12.971 --> 02:50:15.040
<v Speaker 1>The elbow has to be in line with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrow,</v>

3825
02:50:15.550 --> 02:50:17.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes people are polling but</v>

3826
02:50:17.261 --> 02:50:20.290
<v Speaker 1>they're pulling in their elbows up here</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of way back here.</v>

3827
02:50:20.330 --> 02:50:21.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3828
02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:24.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an interesting point</v>

3829
02:50:24.041 --> 02:50:25.210
<v Speaker 1>about certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3830
02:50:25.211 --> 02:50:26.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to me,</v>

3831
02:50:26.861 --> 02:50:31.861
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I like about our tree</v>
<v Speaker 1>and race car driving is you have to</v>

3832
02:50:32.051 --> 02:50:36.310
<v Speaker 1>learn some emotional discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get pissed off and work your</v>

3833
02:50:36.311 --> 02:50:39.250
<v Speaker 1>way through either of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sort of get pissed off on the</v>

3834
02:50:39.251 --> 02:50:42.520
<v Speaker 1>bike and it can actually charge you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not to say that cycling doesn't</v>

3835
02:50:42.521 --> 02:50:45.280
<v Speaker 1>have technique in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it plays a much smaller role.</v>

3836
02:50:45.281 --> 02:50:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl factor can out trumpet,</v>

3837
02:50:47.980 --> 02:50:52.980
<v Speaker 1>but you can't grow your way out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty shot and you cannot in a car.</v>

3838
02:50:53.681 --> 02:50:55.240
<v Speaker 1>If you start getting pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

3839
02:50:56.260 --> 02:50:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing can be said for a lot of</v>

3840
02:50:59.201 --> 02:51:00.910
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think pool is one of them.</v>

3841
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:02.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Golf,</v>

3842
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:04.000
<v Speaker 1>which I don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

3843
02:51:04.300 --> 02:51:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3845
02:51:07.091 --> 02:51:09.490

<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that it's two 30</v>

3846
02:51:11.190 --> 02:51:15.010
<v Speaker 1>and that crazy places at a time warp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

3847
02:51:15.290 --> 02:51:15.771
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
