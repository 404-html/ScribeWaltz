<v Speaker 1>They're way too hot.</v>

11
00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:19.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair because men will agree with them just to hope that they will say</v>

00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just that it's just a festival of ignorance.</v>

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>like really just to Zap the American mind.</v>

123
00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

125
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

126
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

127
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

128
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

129
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

130
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.503
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

131
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.791
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

132
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that it is.</v>

133
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe,</v>

134
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I think I tend to think that it's more in competence than Dan and his conspiracy</v>

135
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>ratings.</v>

136
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't actually care about the news.</v>

137
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>They only care about ratings.</v>

138
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>They don't care about the news,</v>

139
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>but I think in general,</v>

140
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:21.631
<v Speaker 1>like even the most of what we think of as being this big gigantic conspiracy</v>

141
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:26.941
<v Speaker 1>with our government and the media is more in competence and Horesh behavior than</v>

142
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>anything just to prostitutes.</v>

143
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>They prostituted themselves out because that's the way they got the good</v>

144
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.351
<v Speaker 1>assignments.</v>

145
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>They got to the good places.</v>

146
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>They've got the big ratings.</v>

147
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

148
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to that point.</v>

149
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to that job unless you've proved yourself a faithful foot soldier</v>

150
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>to whatever their messages generally,</v>

151
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.203
<v Speaker 1>you know they're not,</v>

152
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get hired on there.</v>

153
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

154
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>And even guys that used to be kind of like rebels,</v>

155
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>like Geraldo Rivera for other Rivera was kind of a rebel at one point.</v>

156
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Dad,</v>

157
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>he was the guy that had Dick Gregory on TV and showed the Zapruder film for the</v>

159
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:57.754
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>

160
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I had a fistfight at a KKK rally,</v>

161
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I think on a shelf.</v>

162
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Someone hit him in the head with a chair.</v>

163
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>They might not even been trying to hit him.</v>

164
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 1>It was just a melee and I think a chairman flying and he got his nose broken and</v>

165
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:08.831
<v Speaker 1>he was fucked up.</v>

166
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>But that he was so excited,</v>

167
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.851
<v Speaker 1>so excited,</v>

168
00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>yet an actual cut on his face.</v>

169
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm a tough guy.</v>

170
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

171
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

172
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to box frank Stallone or something crazy like that too.</v>

173
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>How long time ago?</v>

174
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

175
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.511
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

176
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>they might have actually done it.</v>

177
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.783
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

178
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.541
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure,</v>

179
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but he's a wild dude,</v>

180
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>or at least he was a wild dude.</v>

181
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

182
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>and now he's just like Fox News puppet.</v>

183
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>It's weird when you see the ones that actually stick to their guns.</v>

184
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>They don't last long.</v>

185
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean Cenk Yoga lasted two months at Msnbc before he went,</v>

186
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>before he needed to leave.</v>

187
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Amber Lyon is another one that left because her Bahrain story actually he</v>

188
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:42.364
<v Speaker 1>mentioned by rain,</v>

189
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

190
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>CNN,</v>

191
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 1>she brought it back to them and said,</v>

192
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 1>this is what's going on about rain.</v>

193
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 1>But they were doing ads talking about how great Bahrain was and they wouldn't</v>

194
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>play her segment.</v>

195
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

196
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.741
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

197
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

198
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.570
<v Speaker 1>she's been on the podcast before and she explained it all to us and it's,</v>

199
00:04:53.571 --> 00:04:58.571
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to believe that what we consider to be like shining revered</v>

200
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>institution of news,</v>

201
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:00.934
<v Speaker 1>like CNN,</v>

202
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 1>it was just a bullshit propaganda wing that they,</v>

203
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 1>that they're capable of that kind of behavior.</v>

204
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>If she's telling the truth.</v>

205
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

206
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.103
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there.</v>

207
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I assume she is.</v>

208
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>She seems very honest.</v>

209
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody else's side on the other side.</v>

210
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:12.781
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

211
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck is really going on.</v>

212
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>So I probably shouldn't comment on what CNN did or didn't do,</v>

213
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:20.750
<v Speaker 1>but I know for a fact they're not reporting a lot of shit that's going on and</v>

214
00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>now we're putting a lot of shit.</v>

215
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like all of these networks,</v>

216
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>that mainstream media,</v>

217
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a very small box of accepted thought that is allowed on them.</v>

218
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

219
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

220
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to go either fairly far to aid to either side or outside that</v>

221
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>

222
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

223
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not really the news.</v>

224
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the more interesting things about the internet is because of</v>

225
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>the Internet now there's all these sources that are like more real news.</v>

226
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Like they're telling you about shit that's going on that you might not have</v>

227
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:47.914
<v Speaker 1>known.</v>

228
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.570
<v Speaker 1>So we get Anal Fox News girls,</v>

229
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:50.840
<v Speaker 1>why they're so hot it,</v>

230
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>those girls are so God damn hot.</v>

231
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to marry them.</v>

232
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have relationships with them.</v>

233
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 1>But if I was a single man,</v>

234
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 1>I would be very attracted to those angry bitches</v>

235
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>or the weathermen in La.</v>

236
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.321
<v Speaker 1>I just think there's,</v>

237
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

238
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>there's so like aggressive,</v>

239
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if they're so strong,</v>

240
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.670
<v Speaker 1>like there's so stern in their opinion.</v>

241
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

242
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 3>Most of them are not dumb.</v>

243
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.160
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to do with dumb.</v>

244
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.820
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

245
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>It says about those mean bitches.</v>

246
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Just because I'm a glutton for punishment.</v>

248
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

249
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

250
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 1>like when you're on that show,</v>

251
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:20.651
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

252
00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:20.871

00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>what does it like when you were in that studio,</v>

254
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:23.181
<v Speaker 1>does it feel weird?</v>

255
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like,</v>

256
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.511
<v Speaker 3>well that's the thing.</v>

257
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:26.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like all of them just seem like they're doing their job.</v>

258
00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:26.731
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

259
00:06:26.731 --> 00:06:26.881
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

260
00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:27.960
<v Speaker 3>they went for the evil empire,</v>

261
00:06:27.961 --> 00:06:28.710
<v Speaker 3>but they don't,</v>

262
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.330
<v Speaker 3>they're just like whatever gets them through the day.</v>

263
00:06:30.331 --> 00:06:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh I need to say this thing and this thing.</v>

264
00:06:31.861 --> 00:06:33.480
<v Speaker 3>And then where we know we wrap for the day.</v>

265
00:06:33.481 --> 00:06:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

266
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.780
<v Speaker 3>so I had to remind myself why it was important for me to do that.</v>

267
00:06:36.781 --> 00:06:37.191
<v Speaker 3>I like read,</v>

268
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:39.390
<v Speaker 3>read an article about how a million people died in Iraq.</v>

269
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean this was,</v>

270
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.150
<v Speaker 3>this was several years back and uh,</v>

271
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.223
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

272
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.700
<v Speaker 3>cause you don't want to fuck up the show.</v>

273
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt like I needed to do it and I only want it to be on there once.</v>

274
00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:48.961
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

275
00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:49.950
<v Speaker 3>if they're having me on,</v>

276
00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.210
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a one time thing.</v>

277
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.253
<v Speaker 3>This is yet</v>

278
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.531
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

279
00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:54.690
<v Speaker 1>It was if you were like a publicity whore and I know you're not,</v>

280
00:06:54.691 --> 00:06:55.830
<v Speaker 1>but that be an awesome move.</v>

281
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean it worked out</v>

282
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.010
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

283
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.590
<v Speaker 3>I never thought it was 7:00 AM on a Saturday.</v>

284
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I truly thought the only people,</v>

285
00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:02.620
<v Speaker 3>and this is four or five years ago,</v>

286
00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:02.981
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>

287
00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:04.720
<v Speaker 3>everything on the news went online.</v>

288
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

289
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.830
<v Speaker 3>I truly thought the only people seeing it would fox news fans at 7:00 AM on a</v>

290
00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Saturday and instead it went up online and viral and all that shit.</v>

291
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:12.480
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

292
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.430
<v Speaker 1>if you got something relevant to say the Internet,</v>

293
00:07:14.431 --> 00:07:15.060
<v Speaker 1>we'll catch it.</v>

294
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

295
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.110
<v Speaker 1>they'll find it and they'll put it out there to go back to that girl like</v>

296
00:07:19.111 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>standing,</v>

297
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.910
<v Speaker 1>sitting there with her legs open.</v>

298
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.150
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>

299
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.300
<v Speaker 1>I just want to point something out of how we are so weird like as a culture that</v>

300
00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.790
<v Speaker 1>this is a part of like normal everyday office life.</v>

301
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.151
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

302
00:07:33.151 --> 00:07:34.470
<v Speaker 1>we've got to make some decisions here.</v>

303
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

304
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

305
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.263
<v Speaker 1>look at this woman.</v>

306
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.150
<v Speaker 1>She's showing everything but her vagina.</v>

307
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean her knee is just strategically blocking her.</v>

308
00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:43.734
<v Speaker 1>Lavia.</v>

309
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Her legs are wide open and she's hot as fuck.</v>

310
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.981
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

311
00:07:46.981 --> 00:07:47.371
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

312
00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:50.700
<v Speaker 3>If you put the Kyron right in front of the vagina,</v>

313
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.230
<v Speaker 3>then everybody would know the news.</v>

314
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.213
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

315
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.230
<v Speaker 3>We'd be a very informed country</v>

316
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.340
<v Speaker 1>and women would get angry at you if you knew the news.</v>

317
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

318
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 1>you were looking at her vagina and you read the fucking news.</v>

319
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:00.754
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

320
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Like she like,</v>

321
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.820
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird that they get to dress like that.</v>

322
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Like she's completely wearing come fuck me.</v>

323
00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Pumps could back that up again.</v>

324
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:08.111
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

325
00:08:08.111 --> 00:08:09.400
<v Speaker 1>let's dissect this.</v>

326
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Look at her like her shoes.</v>

327
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Those are like,</v>

328
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.900
<v Speaker 1>I want to go out and get sexy shoes.</v>

329
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a not comfortable by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

330
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.400
<v Speaker 1>They show most of your foot.</v>

331
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:18.730
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

332
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:18.940
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

333
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.010
<v Speaker 1>almost her entire legs are exposed.</v>

334
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

335
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if a guy was sitting there like that.</v>

336
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how bizarre that would be if there was a show where a guy was</v>

337
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:28.150
<v Speaker 1>sitting there in a tiny,</v>

338
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:33.151
<v Speaker 1>tiny kilt and you know that you could bear if he moves his left knee an inch to</v>

339
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:33.701
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>

340
00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:35.500
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see his cock for sure.</v>

341
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.870
<v Speaker 3>And they also have like an ejection button that slings them into the</v>

342
00:08:39.871 --> 00:08:43.660
<v Speaker 3>stratosphere once they hit 35 hit an age limit.</v>

343
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Aw,</v>

344
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.603
<v Speaker 1>poor girls.</v>

345
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 1>That's sad.</v>

346
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 1>It's actually has some kind of irritation down there.</v>

347
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

348
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.290
<v Speaker 1>well I think Sarah Pailin brought the dumb milf back so maybe uh,</v>

349
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe will move in that direction,</v>

350
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think she actually brought it back.</v>

351
00:08:57.031 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 1>She brought it back for a little bit.</v>

352
00:08:57.991 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 1>But now Pete pro like cotton,</v>

353
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:00.290
<v Speaker 1>you say too much crazy shit.</v>

354
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.373
<v Speaker 1>Guelph,</v>

355
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Guelph,</v>

356
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>if we're getting the grandma right,</v>

357
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:03.301
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

358
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:04.134
<v Speaker 1>She's guilt.</v>

359
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to say that though.</v>

360
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:06.451
<v Speaker 1>Cause that'll fuck with you.</v>

361
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:06.691
<v Speaker 1>Dig.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

364

<v Speaker 1>MILF is okay,</v>

365
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 1>but Guelph not so much.</v>

366
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird that we have these odd standards of,</v>

367
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>of sexual attire in the workplace and not just in the workplace,</v>

368
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 1>but on television,</v>

369
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 1>like on television.</v>

370
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:25.641
<v Speaker 1>Promoting this to strange propaganda machine and just really hot girls with</v>

371

00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>hanging out explosions and hot girls.</v>

373
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:29.641

374
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I can't pay attention.</v>

375
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.291
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck.</v>

376
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:32.124
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

385
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're lonely and you know you're not married or anything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

434
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.260
<v Speaker 1>especially like if you're married and you know when you're trying to be</v>

435
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:49.434
<v Speaker 1>monogamous,</v>

436
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.450
<v Speaker 1>you're going to look at sex in a different way because you look at like a girl</v>

446
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.173
<v Speaker 1>maybe this could happen.</v>

447
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's a different thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's something inside the most loser of guys.</v>

457
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:20.010

464
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:32.131
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

465
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe she goes to the car shop cause her wipers broken and she wants to try to</v>

466
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:36.661
<v Speaker 1>fix it herself.</v>

467
00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:37.500
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

468
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I get to impress her by my knowledge of windshield wipers and she realized I'm</v>

469
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 1>just a regular guy and sometimes girls,</v>

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.393
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

480
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.130
<v Speaker 3>it just seems like a perfect posture.</v>

481
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.780
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like going back to when you were like really young looking at like,</v>

482
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.840
<v Speaker 3>like JC Penny's lingerie catalogs and you wonder why people that Watch Fox News</v>

483
00:12:06.301 --> 00:12:06.870
<v Speaker 3>are idiots.</v>

484

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

485
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.820
<v Speaker 3>not that a lot of network time,</v>

486
00:12:08.821 --> 00:12:09.451
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

487
00:12:09.451 --> 00:12:11.340
<v Speaker 3>they did that study that people that watch Fox News,</v>

488
00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:12.540
<v Speaker 3>no less about what's happening in the world.</v>

489
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:13.860
<v Speaker 3>The people are watching no news at all.</v>

490
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:14.610
<v Speaker 3>I believe that.</v>

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.033
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

494
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.951
<v Speaker 1>It'd be no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They certainly should,</v>

535
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.450
<v Speaker 1>but it shouldn't be exclusively pretty girls telling you about important shit.</v>

536
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.890
<v Speaker 1>We of course were too week.</v>

537
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.210
<v Speaker 1>We're not paying attention to the message.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

546
00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:28.750
<v Speaker 3>She fought her way to the top.</v>

547
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.390
<v Speaker 1>There's something about,</v>

548
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

549
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:31.531
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

550
00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:31.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

551
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.431
<v Speaker 1>like what I said,</v>

552
00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:35.730
<v Speaker 1>like those Fox News women that like the one you were talking about before the</v>

553
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:36.360
<v Speaker 1>show started,</v>

554
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.450
<v Speaker 1>who argued with someone about Santa Claus being white.</v>

555
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Megan Kelly apparently as it said very authoritatively that Santa Claus is</v>

556
00:13:43.861 --> 00:13:44.430
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

557
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

558
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.930
<v Speaker 1>she's very authoritative.</v>

559
00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:46.764
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A lot of those gals are.</v>

561
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.730
<v Speaker 1>But there's something like four Beta men,</v>

562
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.910
<v Speaker 1>especially for men that are weak and beaten down by life.</v>

563
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.980
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate fantasy is that this woman accepts you the ultimate fantasies that</v>

564
00:13:58.981 --> 00:13:59.761
<v Speaker 1>she's impressed by you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's so obviously beautiful,</v>

567
00:14:02.881 --> 00:14:05.100
<v Speaker 1>but also so hard ass that there's this,</v>
