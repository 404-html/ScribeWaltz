172
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>whether it's with healthy foods and snacks like hemp force protein bars,</v>

173
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>which are delicious and guilt free protein bars.</v>

176
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.770

177
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>And if that's the case,</v>

178
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.871
<v Speaker 1>hey fucker,</v>

179
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:15.704
<v Speaker 1>it's not our fault,</v>

180
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not that guy or gal,</v>

181
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>hem forest protein bars are the shit you'll love him.</v>

182
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>I also love the hemp force protein powder.</v>

183
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

184
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>we buy the finest protein powder from Canada,</v>

185
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>the highest in protein and the finest meaning like,</v>

186
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean just fine,</v>

187
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>like it's the most awesome,</v>

188
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually a finer blend of,</v>

189
00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:35.251
<v Speaker 1>of protein.</v>

190
00:06:35.251 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's much easier to digest.</v>

191
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

192
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.420
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

193
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 1>it's more expensive to do it that way,</v>

194
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>but what we're trying to do it on it is just provide the very best things that</v>

195
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>we can find,</v>

00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>We try to find the highest quality stuff and sell you that.</v>

200
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Another new thing that we have is warrior bars.</v>

201
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.700

202
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 1>added hormones.</v>

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>they cure them with or secure them,</v>

208
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:14.290
<v Speaker 1>preserve them with cranberries.</v>

209
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.900

<v Speaker 2>I just saw some girl.</v>

307
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 2>It's almost as annoying as having a hyphenated last name.</v>

308
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:46.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like nobody cares.</v>

313
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Those people were pathetic.</v>

314
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Those dudes who changed their name for the girl and then they make their name a</v>

315
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 2>hyphenated name.</v>

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

331
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Can you,</v>

332
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 2>can you be an Alpha female and just be,</v>

333
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.833
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

334
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 2>just a woman who's heterosexual,</v>

335
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 2>but she just likes to be the boss.</v>

336
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 2>So possible if course,</v>

337
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.110
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

338
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 2>of course everybody has their breaking point.</v>

339
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:41.850
<v Speaker 2>If you've been paying attention to this ban bossy campaign,</v>

340
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 2>they've been paying attention to that.</v>

341
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.321
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

342
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:44.154
<v Speaker 2>I just got in town.</v>

343
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:46.933
<v Speaker 2>That's my answer.</v>

344
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

345
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 2>some feminists are trying to ban the word boss,</v>

346
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Dan.</v>

347
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was like band was one guy in Boston,</v>

348
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.333
<v Speaker 2>another and they were like,</v>

349
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.013
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

350
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to sound like real like for council member.</v>

351
00:10:59.250 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

352
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to ban the term bossy.</v>

353
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

354
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:02.911
<v Speaker 2>They think that,</v>

355
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

356
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.820
<v Speaker 2>that word,</v>

357
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.720
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing wrong with,</v>

358
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm super bossy and so is blank.</v>

359
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

360
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.610
<v Speaker 2>I think bossy is blanches her dog.</v>

361
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I think bossy is kind of a silly word.</v>

362
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:11.821
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

363
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:11.911
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

364
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 2>you beat all Bossy,</v>

365
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.180
<v Speaker 2>it's not like would he be a cunt?</v>

367
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

368
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:16.981
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

369
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:17.091
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

370
00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 2>if somebody's in a meeting,</v>

371
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:18.320
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>

372
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:18.591
<v Speaker 2>Eliza,</v>

373
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:19.360
<v Speaker 2>you're being bossy.</v>

374
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

375
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 2>it'd be funny if you said that in a corporate setting.</v>

376
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a real problem with,</v>

377
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

378
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.760
<v Speaker 2>the sexes,</v>

379
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.680
<v Speaker 2>with the battle between the men and the women.</v>

380
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 2>And one of the big problems is that a lot of people are just shitheads and it's</v>

381
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:36.090
<v Speaker 2>just like making concessions to deal with shitheads,</v>

382
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.680
<v Speaker 2>whether it's male or female.</v>

383
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I think that's across the board for not even for me,</v>

384
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 2>it's for race,</v>

385
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:42.090
<v Speaker 2>for socioeconomic things,</v>

386
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:42.470
<v Speaker 2>for everything.</v>

387
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just concession.</v>

388
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.490
<v Speaker 2>I think you're totally right.</v>

389
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's just dealing with a lot of shitheads,</v>

390
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.060
<v Speaker 2>but then there's like things that just throw you so out of whack,</v>

391
00:11:51.061 --> 00:11:52.260
<v Speaker 2>like ban Bossy,</v>

392
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:52.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

393
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.081
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

394
00:11:53.081 --> 00:11:53.651
<v Speaker 2>you gotta go,</v>

395
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

396
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 2>You being so you guys are so crazy.</v>

397
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 2>You were making the whole thing a parody.</v>

398
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 2>It takes away the legitimacy from anything else that you have a problem with.</v>

399
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I can understand if bitch,</v>

400
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.653
<v Speaker 2>I hate that word.</v>

401
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 2>And that my biggest defense,</v>

402
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:08.080
<v Speaker 2>if I ever get into a real argument,</v>

403
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 2>if you ladies,</v>

404
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:11.260
<v Speaker 2>for the three of you listening a while,</v>

405
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:14.250
<v Speaker 2>you're at Jiu Jitsu black belt.</v>

406
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 2>If you call a guy bitchy before he can call you bitchy,</v>

407
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 2>you win there because there's no coming back from that.</v>

408
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Once you've like emasculated someone and you've been like,</v>

409
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 2>you're being a bitch,</v>

410
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:23.561
<v Speaker 2>then they're like,</v>

411
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

412
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I got news for you.</v>

413
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 2>If you can say you're being a bitch to a guy in your emasculating him,</v>

414
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.370
<v Speaker 2>he was lost from the start.</v>

415
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 2>If a girl calls me a bitch,</v>

416
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

417
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:32.981
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

418
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:33.251
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

419
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:34.084
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

420
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

421
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it will stop me dead hanging out with her.</v>

422
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.733
<v Speaker 2>That's fair enough.</v>

423
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.573
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing?</v>

424
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 2>But if you're having an argument,</v>

425
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:41.990
<v Speaker 2>like if for whatever,</v>

426
00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I think if you were in the audience and you told someone quit being a bitch,</v>

427
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 2>but am I pointing for their platform?</v>

428
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:48.221
<v Speaker 2>If they had said,</v>

429
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:52.360
<v Speaker 2>stop using the word bitchy or let's stop using other derogatory female words,</v>

430
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:52.661
<v Speaker 2>that's fine,</v>

431
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:56.080
<v Speaker 2>but bossy makes them sound like a bunch of fourth graders that want to run for</v>

432
00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 2>class president.</v>

433
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:56.981
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

434
00:12:56.981 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like what they're trying to do is just take away any even mildly</v>

435
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:06.541
<v Speaker 2>derogatory or mildly negative terms that could be applied to women that aren't</v>

436
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.820
<v Speaker 2>going to be applied to men because bossy doesn't seem,</v>

437
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.670
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem like you would use that in a master once.</v>

438
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:12.371
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say that.</v>

439
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.511
<v Speaker 2>It's totally not,</v>

441
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:14.500
<v Speaker 2>it's just for girls,</v>

442
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's also for little girls.</v>

443
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Like I would never describe a woman as bossy.</v>

444
00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I'd say.</v>

445
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably just say she was bitchy to be quite frank.</v>

446
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.311
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

447
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:23.500
<v Speaker 2>it's not for guys because men are already bossy.</v>

448
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.440
<v Speaker 2>So I guess there in lies the problem.</v>

449
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

450
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 2>If you had like a woman who was a boss,</v>

451
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.920
<v Speaker 2>like if she was the boss,</v>

452
00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:30.760
<v Speaker 2>like a strong black woman,</v>

453
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 2>a strong black woman,</v>

454
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.011
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

455
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:33.311
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

456
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:33.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

457
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 2>how was Shinya?</v>

458
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Is she a good boss?</v>

459
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Speaker 2>And you'd be like,</v>

460
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 2>she's a good boss,</v>

461
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:40.010
<v Speaker 2>but a tad Bossar right.</v>

462
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.920
<v Speaker 2>It's two totally different things.</v>

463
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:41.763
<v Speaker 2>That's how the ball,</v>

464
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.751
<v Speaker 2>it's a tad ball.</v>

465
00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Say she's a dominant woman,</v>

466
00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:45.820
<v Speaker 2>but a Tom Bossert smells her shit.</v>

467
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.030
<v Speaker 2>She's good at her job per Todd bullshit.</v>

468
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 2>When I think Bossy,</v>

469
00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:50.260
<v Speaker 2>I think micromanage.</v>

470
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I think of my mom at like Thanksgiving who like she brings an excel spreadsheet</v>

471
00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:55.060
<v Speaker 2>to plan out thanksgiving.</v>

472
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

473
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.680
<v Speaker 2>and some people does.</v>

474
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:57.783
<v Speaker 2>That's where you get it from.</v>

475
00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:58.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that organized.</v>

476
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.150
<v Speaker 2>I go the other way.</v>

477
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I in the quietest way when I visit my family because my mom's like go,</v>

478
00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:06.281
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

479
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:06.431
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

480
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:07.264
<v Speaker 2>Here's what we're doing.</v>

481
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 2>She'll ask me months in advance about plane tickets.</v>

482
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 2>I shut down.</v>

483
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I turned into like the biggest stoner attitude without partners.</v>

484
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I dunno man,</v>

485
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 2>whatever happens cause she's so bossy that you can't,</v>

486
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 2>you have no option but to go the other way or you will explode.</v>

487
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny how you see kids?</v>

488
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:27.100
<v Speaker 2>That there's a direct result of rebelling against their parents that's shaped</v>

489
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:27.934
<v Speaker 2>her personality?</v>

490
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Lot of kids like that?</v>

491
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

492
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Whether,</v>

493
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:31.811
<v Speaker 2>whether you mean to or not.</v>

494
00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think my mom's great but I just,</v>

495
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I think also like energy wise,</v>

496
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 2>like if you're an Alpha but you meet someone that's a super alpha,</v>

497
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 2>like you can only have one super alpha.</v>

498
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Like I've met girls that are like,</v>

499
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

500
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of Bossy and I'm very like in control,</v>

501
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.720
<v Speaker 2>but when I meet other girls that are like,</v>

502
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.100
<v Speaker 2>that's all their personality,</v>

503
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I just get very quiet.</v>

504
00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:49.631
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

505
00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I'll just do whatever you want when you don't rip my tits</v>

506
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.053
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

507
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.730
<v Speaker 3>Does that annoy you though?</v>

508
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't it annoy you when someone's Super Alpha or Super Bossy?</v>

509
00:14:59.160 --> 00:14:59.790
<v Speaker 3>If I don't,</v>

510
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 3>if I don't mind what we're doing.</v>

511
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:04.190
<v Speaker 3>Like I went to a wedding and there was this girl who was just like running shit</v>

512
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.160
<v Speaker 3>and she was telling everyone to do and I've been like one wedding ever so I was</v>

513
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 3>fine to just do whatever she said because it's not my domain.</v>

514
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.730
<v Speaker 3>If it were something where I felt that I should be in charge than it would be</v>

515
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:14.360
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

516
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.480
<v Speaker 3>Was this girl that bridesmaid or the sister of the bride or,</v>

517
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I think she was just one of the bridesmaids.</v>

518
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 3>She was just a good run.</v>

519
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 3>But I think part of being a comic also are being a human is identifying what</v>

520
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 3>someone is and fully respecting that and rather than go against them sometimes</v>

521
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:29.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

522
00:15:29.391 --> 00:15:30.800
<v Speaker 3>then you find out why they're like that.</v>

523
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 3>She was dealing with some personal things.</v>

524
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:34.930
<v Speaker 3>So I was glad that I went with it versus butted up buddy.</v>

525
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm against her because it would've just,</v>

526
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.570
<v Speaker 3>it would've been a fight for no reason.</v>

527
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:39.404
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

528
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 3>So fight for no reason is a good way to put it because that's what a lot of</v>

529
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:43.011
<v Speaker 3>people engage in.</v>

530
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:43.940
<v Speaker 3>They engage in these fights.</v>

531
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Like I've had conversations with friends where they'll tell me,</v>

532
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.830
<v Speaker 3>oh this fucking God said this and I was like,</v>

533
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:49.664
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

534
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 3>And I fucking told him like,</v>

535
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.160
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're doing is passive aggressive bullshit is not going away.</v>

536
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.740
<v Speaker 3>And like at the end of the day,</v>

537
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:54.981
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

538
00:15:54.981 --> 00:15:55.820
<v Speaker 3>what do you care?</v>

539
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.130
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean it's not going to change?</v>

540
00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:58.431
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

541
00:15:58.431 --> 00:15:59.930
<v Speaker 3>he said nothing was accomplished,</v>

542
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:00.710
<v Speaker 3>nothing was accomplished.</v>

543
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.101
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>

544
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:01.970
<v Speaker 3>Especially as an adult,</v>

545
00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:02.631
<v Speaker 3>like no one's gonna be like,</v>

546
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:04.320
<v Speaker 3>you really made me review my behavior.</v>

547
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:05.883
<v Speaker 3>She can,</v>

548
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.210
<v Speaker 3>but most of the times you can without going fuck you.</v>

549
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Most of the times you can by just talking to them and say,</v>

550
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:11.241
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

551
00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:11.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

552
00:16:11.481 --> 00:16:12.261
<v Speaker 3>I respect too,</v>

553
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:14.990
<v Speaker 3>but this is how you're coming off to me.</v>

554
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:15.760
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

555
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.280
<v Speaker 3>I had a thing recently was someone and I sent them an email and the best thing</v>

556
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:20.114
<v Speaker 3>to do is start out with,</v>

557
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.530
<v Speaker 3>if I've done something to offend you,</v>

558
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:22.364
<v Speaker 3>please let me know.</v>

559
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 3>You start out like showing them your pink soft under belly.</v>

560
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.710
<v Speaker 3>And then that gives them a space to be like,</v>

561
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:28.280
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

562
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.091
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry.</v>

563
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:29.871
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean to do it.</v>

564
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Like if you come from a place of contrition,</v>

565
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:32.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

566
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.220
<v Speaker 3>versus around playing yesterday,</v>

567
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.810
<v Speaker 3>you know when you get on a plane and you're like,</v>

568
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.350
<v Speaker 3>oops,</v>

569
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize how drunk I was until I landed.</v>

570
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd get on the plane drunk from the night before where you really helped</v>

571
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 3>getting her party on it.</v>

572
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.500
<v Speaker 3>They're on the road was one of those nights.</v>

573
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:46.970
<v Speaker 3>It's just like escalated very quickly.</v>

574
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.833
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

575
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 3>I just went out in Tampa with just some friends and I don't know why we were</v>

576
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:51.770
<v Speaker 3>drinking so much.</v>

577
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened.</v>

578
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.253

582
00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.663
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm a plane.</v>

583
00:16:58.890 --> 00:16:59.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

586
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:00.650
<v Speaker 3>This is really bothered me.</v>

587
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.160
<v Speaker 3>And I'm in the fact that I was in first class is not the point of the story,</v>

588
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 3>but I was in boarding group one and they bought it all the like one came</v>

<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

595
00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:11.811

00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:13.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not global service.</v>

597
00:17:13.071 --> 00:17:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in any elite group.</v>

598
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:14.841
<v Speaker 3>I'm just in first class.</v>

599
00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:15.674
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

600
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:15.951
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

601
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:17.210
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to first class too.</v>

602
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.080
<v Speaker 3>There's only 12 of us.</v>

603
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:18.470
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

604
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:19.310
<v Speaker 3>just go ahead of me.</v>

605
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.941
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

606
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:20.510
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

607
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 3>And this guy from behind me goes,</v>

608
00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:23.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

609
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about anyone else.</v>

610
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking do whatever you want to do.</v>

611
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.610
<v Speaker 3>And I thought he was joking,</v>

612
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:31.700
<v Speaker 3>like he was so angry and I was so buzz that like,</v>

613
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:32.391
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't sure,</v>

614
00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:32.750
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

615
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.650
<v Speaker 3>am I seeing things?</v>

616
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.641
<v Speaker 3>So I get on the plane,</v>

617
00:17:34.641 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 3>I sit down and this guy made a point to when he walked on the plane to be</v>

618
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 3>shaking his head at me when he got on the plane and every time I looked over to</v>

619
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:44.120
<v Speaker 3>like make sure he was real,</v>

620
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 3>he would be shaking his head like I had done something and being a comic I then</v>

621
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:54.170
<v Speaker 3>the next three hours crafting the perfect comeback for when we got up cause I</v>

622
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:58.590
<v Speaker 3>was sure we were going to butt heads and like it was going to go down and the</v>

623
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 3>plane landed and he got up and he walked off and I never got a chance to say</v>

624
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:02.710
<v Speaker 3>anything to him.</v>

625
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.870
<v Speaker 1>That's something not to get worked up about.</v>

626
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird one to get worked up about like letting someone go in front of</v>

627
00:18:07.811 --> 00:18:07.961
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

628
00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:09.540
<v Speaker 1>being polite and [inaudible].</v>

629
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Although people,</v>

630
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I think there's like a dark cloud over my head.</v>

631
00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Like I just attract like negative energy.</v>

632
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.183
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

633
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:16.023
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen it.</v>

634
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.890
<v Speaker 1>If there was a dark cloud over your head,</v>

635
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I think I want to notice that.</v>

636
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I think people just randomly like who gets,</v>

637
00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:21.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

638
00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:21.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe I just,</v>

639
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.211
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

640
00:18:22.211 --> 00:18:22.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

641
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.270
<v Speaker 1>you're very strong personality and I mean that in a good way.</v>

642
00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:29.050
<v Speaker 1>That's why you and I are such good friends because we're both strong</v>

643
00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.730
<v Speaker 1>personalities because you,</v>

644
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you always say that about me,</v>

645
00:18:32.081 --> 00:18:33.190
<v Speaker 1>but you're not like,</v>

646
00:18:33.191 --> 00:18:34.630
<v Speaker 1>but like you're super cool about it.</v>

647
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

648
00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.093
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

649
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not offended by it.</v>

650
00:18:37.361 --> 00:18:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I think some people are intimidated by,</v>

651
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:43.210
<v Speaker 1>well there's men that are certainly intimidated by women who were smart and</v>

652
00:18:43.211 --> 00:18:44.920
<v Speaker 1>quick and have a strong personality.</v>

653
00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

654
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Well I've sent it to you before.</v>

655
00:18:47.531 --> 00:18:47.681
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

656
00:18:47.681 --> 00:18:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what you do when you date.</v>

657
00:18:49.001 --> 00:18:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Like it's gotta be rough out there for a chick like you.</v>

658
00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>

659
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.600
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot,</v>

660
00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:53.381
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

661
00:18:53.381 --> 00:18:54.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

662
00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.210
<v Speaker 1>unusual attributes.</v>

663
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.580
<v Speaker 1>You're very smart and you're also very quick.</v>

664
00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Like when I talk to you sometimes,</v>

665
00:18:59.021 --> 00:19:02.170
<v Speaker 1>like I don't think I talk as quick as you most of the time.</v>

666
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.093
<v Speaker 1>And you're always like,</v>

667
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:04.873
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

668
00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.190
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a Gremlin eating.</v>

669
00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:06.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

670
00:19:06.641 --> 00:19:07.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's like when,</v>

671
00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:09.070
<v Speaker 1>when we have conversations with like,</v>

672
00:19:09.071 --> 00:19:09.341
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

673
00:19:09.341 --> 00:19:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I've got to pick up the pace here alive,</v>

674
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.083
<v Speaker 1>throwing heat.</v>

675
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:12.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

676
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:14.140
<v Speaker 1>like you're so excited to talk to you.</v>

677
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:14.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

678
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:14.891
<v Speaker 1>you were always,</v>

679
00:19:14.891 --> 00:19:15.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

680
00:19:15.161 --> 00:19:15.821
<v Speaker 1>you're fired up.</v>

681
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:16.750
<v Speaker 1>You're fired up person.</v>

682
00:19:16.751 --> 00:19:18.130
<v Speaker 1>So fired up that.</v>

683
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.190
<v Speaker 1>But I think some men don't want that.</v>

684
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.170
<v Speaker 1>They want to check to just lay back.</v>

685
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

686
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.790
<v Speaker 1>But take it.</v>

687
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that is?</v>

688
00:19:25.641 --> 00:19:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that men are scared of competition?</v>

689
00:19:27.881 --> 00:19:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they're not secure in themselves so they don't like someone</v>

690
00:19:30.671 --> 00:19:32.680
<v Speaker 1>who they might judge themselves against and go,</v>

691
00:19:32.681 --> 00:19:33.071
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

692
00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I think my fucking girlfriends faster than me and she's smarter than me.</v>

693
00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:37.211
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

694
00:19:37.211 --> 00:19:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's for guys or girls,</v>

695
00:19:38.771 --> 00:19:40.120
<v Speaker 1>like nobody wants to feel threatened.</v>

696
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.280
<v Speaker 1>But I also think there's just different types of guys and there's secure guys</v>

697
00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:46.330
<v Speaker 1>and there's insecure guys and some people also don't,</v>

698
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:46.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

699
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone's a little insecure just as a human being mean.</v>

700
00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:50.560
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we're vulnerable,</v>

701
00:19:50.561 --> 00:19:51.191
<v Speaker 1>we're going to die.</v>

702
00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:51.881
<v Speaker 1>We get diseases,</v>

703
00:19:51.881 --> 00:19:53.310
<v Speaker 1>we get hit in the head by asteroids.</v>

704
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.071
<v Speaker 1>Shit happens.</v>

705
00:19:54.071 --> 00:19:54.251
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

706
00:19:54.251 --> 00:19:55.084
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's a little,</v>

707
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.830
<v Speaker 1>little bit insecure.</v>

708
00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

709
00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.570
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

710
00:19:58.571 --> 00:19:59.980
<v Speaker 1>there's levels of that shit.</v>

711
00:19:59.981 --> 00:20:01.750
<v Speaker 1>And I think that a girl who's just,</v>

712
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.040
<v Speaker 1>you don't look,</v>

713
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.023
<v Speaker 1>you have your dog,</v>

714
00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you don't need anybody for love.</v>

715
00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.460
<v Speaker 1>If you have a great career,</v>

716
00:20:06.461 --> 00:20:07.780
<v Speaker 1>you don't need anybody for money,</v>

717
00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:08.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

718
00:20:08.381 --> 00:20:08.891
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty,</v>

719
00:20:08.891 --> 00:20:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you can meet other guys.</v>

720
00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got a lot of things that would fuck with a dude's head and you're</v>

721
00:20:12.971 --> 00:20:13.870
<v Speaker 1>smart and fast.</v>

722
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.720
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be tricky.</v>

723
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.033
<v Speaker 1>That'd be tricky.</v>

724
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:18.873
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

725
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

726
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.990
<v Speaker 3>And the older I get,</v>

727
00:20:20.991 --> 00:20:21.730
<v Speaker 3>the more like I,</v>

728
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.510
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're in your 20s and you date,</v>

729
00:20:23.511 --> 00:20:24.301
<v Speaker 3>you don't really think about it.</v>

730
00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:27.350
<v Speaker 3>And now that I'm 31 I'm kind of looking back in hindsight and I'm like,</v>

731
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:27.531
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

732
00:20:27.531 --> 00:20:29.240
<v Speaker 3>maybe they did have an issue.</v>

733
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Like what starts off as not being an issue.</v>

734
00:20:31.401 --> 00:20:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I think in the end becomes an issue for them.</v>

735
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.400
<v Speaker 3>But I don't,</v>

736
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.810
<v Speaker 3>any guy that I date is like very supportive because I don't date comics either.</v>

737
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.200
<v Speaker 3>So they're very supportive and they really respect what I do and I in turn</v>

738
00:20:42.201 --> 00:20:43.100
<v Speaker 3>respect what they do.</v>

739
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:43.431
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

740
00:20:43.431 --> 00:20:45.350
<v Speaker 3>you really have to respect what somebody else does.</v>

741
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:45.561
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

742
00:20:45.561 --> 00:20:46.040
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

743
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I could never date a that's sucked.</v>

744
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Even if he was a great person.</v>

745
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Because if you have a job and you are bad at your job,</v>

746
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.420
<v Speaker 2>like you actively bad at your job,</v>

747
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 2>then it means that you're delusional.</v>

748
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

749
00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.930
<v Speaker 2>That means you're crazy.</v>

750
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.600
<v Speaker 2>And it's like if you don't like my stand,</v>

751
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.031
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing.</v>

752
00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 2>But there are plenty of people that do versus I'm a musician,</v>

753
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 2>I had can't get a record deal.</v>

754
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.800
<v Speaker 2>My is always out of tune and like this is my passion.</v>

755
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:08.051
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

756
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:08.231
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

757
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 2>well then you take your passion,</v>

758
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.350
<v Speaker 2>you can go to the third tree,</v>

759
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.100
<v Speaker 2>prominent author because I keys.</v>

760
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.630
<v Speaker 2>That means there are other areas in your life where that where you being that</v>

761
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:19.750
<v Speaker 2>inept is gonna is gonna do is going to harm you.</v>

762
00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:20.681
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

763
00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 2>And I think that people that are really bad at something and don't realize that</v>

764
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:26.560
<v Speaker 2>they're really bad at something that's a sign of,</v>

765
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

766
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:27.843
<v Speaker 2>there's like a,</v>

767
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.020
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong.</v>

768
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like a pathology there,</v>

769
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

770
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.430
<v Speaker 2>But I also think they're lucky in a weird way,</v>

771
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.140
<v Speaker 2>like ignorance is bliss.</v>

772
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Like they're just super hot.</v>

773
00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Like people are so happy.</v>

774
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that shit.</v>

775
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy it at all.</v>

776
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:40.360
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

777
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

778
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

779
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:41.771
<v Speaker 2>There's no bliss.</v>

780
00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:42.700
<v Speaker 2>There's failure.</v>

781
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.350
<v Speaker 2>They're nothing but failure.</v>

782
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:45.490
<v Speaker 2>They can never get it together.</v>

783
00:21:45.491 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just the opposite of being lucky.</v>

784
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.920
<v Speaker 2>Think people are happy or think they're really good when they're not good.</v>

785
00:21:50.921 --> 00:21:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I think that was probably one of the worst things that could ever befall a human</v>

786
00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:56.300
<v Speaker 2>being because you think they secretly know they might.</v>

787
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they do know.</v>

788
00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Even if they don't know.</v>

789
00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.730
<v Speaker 2>I have a conversation with comics.</v>

790
00:21:59.731 --> 00:22:02.440
<v Speaker 2>I think they're good and I know they fucking suck.</v>

791
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I know they suck and they think they're good and you'll talk to them about sets</v>

792
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.770
<v Speaker 2>and they bombed and they'll tell you that it went great.</v>

793
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.450
<v Speaker 2>What are you about that?</v>

794
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Because I've had that happen where a lot to like a friend.</v>

795
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

796
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Or he'll be like,</v>

797
00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:15.610
<v Speaker 2>I crushed it.</v>

798
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:16.480
<v Speaker 2>And then someone else would be like,</v>

799
00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:16.601
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

800
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:16.871
<v Speaker 2>I saw.</v>

801
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:17.680
<v Speaker 2>I said it was,</v>

802
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.311
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible.</v>

803
00:22:18.311 --> 00:22:18.910
<v Speaker 2>So then you're,</v>

804
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:19.743
<v Speaker 2>you're faced with,</v>

805
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:20.411
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

806
00:22:20.411 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 2>who's the crazy person here?</v>

807
00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Are you lying to me or are you delusional?</v>

808
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>

809
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.040
<v Speaker 2>do you know that you suck but you deep down or do you really deep down think</v>

810
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:33.040
<v Speaker 2>you're really good but you had to be like what's going on and why am I the only</v>

811
00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:33.580
<v Speaker 2>one seeing it?</v>

812
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 2>You see it's just like we were talking about before,</v>

813
00:22:35.471 --> 00:22:39.370
<v Speaker 2>that type of personality can manifest itself in a bunch of different ways and</v>

814
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:41.070
<v Speaker 2>this is just one example of it there.</v>

815
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.660
<v Speaker 2>It'll show up in a bunch of different parts of their life.</v>

816
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that,</v>

817
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:47.200
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it is revisionist history.</v>

818
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:51.700
<v Speaker 2>They'll Dell have a bad set and then go back over their head and find things</v>

819
00:22:51.701 --> 00:22:55.060
<v Speaker 2>about the set that were good and then convince themselves that it was good.</v>

820
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.660
<v Speaker 2>See I wish I had that ability cause I'll have a good set.</v>

821
00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.503
<v Speaker 2>So here's why.</v>

822
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Because all have a good set and I'll go back and I'll find all the bad things.</v>

823
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.871
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>

824
00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 2>that was horrible.</v>

825
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.450
<v Speaker 2>That's because you're an artist,</v>

826
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 2>an artist.</v>

827
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.600
<v Speaker 2>That's what's called someone who is care.</v>

828
00:23:08.601 --> 00:23:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So wouldn't it be nice to give yourself a break once in a while?</v>

829
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:11.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

830
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:11.281
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

831
00:23:11.281 --> 00:23:12.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like you get better.</v>

832
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.150
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree.</v>

833
00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I'm playing this like passive passive hippie role.</v>

834
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I just deal with it.</v>

835
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

836
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:17.651
<v Speaker 2>I look,</v>

837
00:23:17.651 --> 00:23:18.490
<v Speaker 2>I can crush,</v>

838
00:23:18.491 --> 00:23:21.700
<v Speaker 2>I can have a standing ovation and I'll fuck up one joke and then she will haunt</v>

839
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:25.930
<v Speaker 2>me for days for Denver and every comic knows like the one guy in the front row</v>

840
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.130
<v Speaker 2>who's mentally damaged.</v>

841
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:27.851
<v Speaker 2>That can't laugh,</v>

842
00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:29.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's sitting in the front row and you don't know that they're retarded till</v>

843
00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:30.431
<v Speaker 2>later and you're like,</v>

844
00:23:30.431 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't laughing.</v>

845
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:31.781
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

846
00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:32.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't pay attention to that.</v>

847
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.480
<v Speaker 2>That I don't pay attention.</v>

848
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:35.171
<v Speaker 2>If you don't laugh,</v>

849
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:36.004
<v Speaker 2>that's on you.</v>

850
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.010
<v Speaker 2>You could choose not to laugh at a lot of things in life,</v>

851
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.083
<v Speaker 2>but what I,</v>

852
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.740
<v Speaker 2>it's like at this stage in my life,</v>

853
00:23:41.741 --> 00:23:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I know when I'm out of tune and I've been out of tune before and I fucking hate</v>

854
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 2>that feeling and that shit will drive me crazy.</v>

855
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 2>But I always feel like I get better because of that.</v>

856
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:50.054
<v Speaker 2>If I have a,</v>

857
00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:50.451
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

858
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:52.460
<v Speaker 2>if I have a moment where I'm out of tune and it haunts me,</v>

859
00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 2>it makes me work harder.</v>

860
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 2>It makes me go back to the notebooks.</v>

861
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:55.840
<v Speaker 2>It makes me go back to the,</v>

862
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:56.350
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

863
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:57.170
<v Speaker 2>to the keyboard.</v>

864
00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.850
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing for like comics,</v>

865
00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.350
<v Speaker 2>if it was comics listening,</v>

866
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.573
<v Speaker 2>I always have,</v>

867
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.230
<v Speaker 2>cause I always come up and they was asking you,</v>

868
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.450
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

869
00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:05.750
<v Speaker 2>What's the secret of what do you do?</v>

870
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:07.430
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like you need to stop talking to me.</v>

871
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.540
<v Speaker 2>And did you get on stage?</v>

872
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.360
<v Speaker 2>You need to stop writing and like doing your act in the mirror.</v>

873
00:24:11.361 --> 00:24:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Like you need to get onstage and fail and fail and fail.</v>

874
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:15.830
<v Speaker 2>And when that joke sucks 10 times in a row,</v>

875
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 2>do it 10 more times in a row.</v>

876
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.650
<v Speaker 2>It's repetition.</v>

877
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:21.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just like being an athlete and people don't get that right.</v>

878
00:24:21.891 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 2>When this is what,</v>

879
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 2>just what we were talking about,</v>

880
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:25.100
<v Speaker 2>the people that don't see it,</v>

881
00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 2>the nurses,</v>

882
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:26.511
<v Speaker 2>bliss people,</v>

883
00:24:26.511 --> 00:24:27.920
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to get those lessons.</v>

884
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:28.101
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

885
00:24:28.101 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 2>there'll be terrible for sure.</v>

886
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Forever.</v>

887
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.613
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I said that.</v>

888
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.250
<v Speaker 2>What you just trying to alleviate a little bit of the tension that find some</v>

889
00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.093
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>

890
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

891
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.583
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

892
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

893
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.413
<v Speaker 2>but we can't,</v>

894
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 2>there's comfort in discomfort.</v>

895
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:42.980
<v Speaker 2>You can learn from them.</v>

896
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:44.150
<v Speaker 2>That's the good place.</v>

897
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:45.470
<v Speaker 2>I like being uncomfortable.</v>

898
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I think some of the best moments on stage or when you ignore,</v>

899
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:48.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

900
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 2>and audiences love it when something bombs and you're like,</v>

901
00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:51.704
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

902
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.330
<v Speaker 2>you guys deserved a better ending than that.</v>

903
00:24:53.331 --> 00:24:54.164
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sorry,</v>

904
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I came at you with that you paid taking home,</v>

905
00:24:56.991 --> 00:24:58.940
<v Speaker 2>you're free improv glasses and I shouldn't have.</v>

906
00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the best ways to get through a new bit and you go like,</v>

907
00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 2>that bit is not done.</v>

908
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.211
<v Speaker 2>It needs work.</v>

909
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:06.410
<v Speaker 2>That's a trick that we all do.</v>

910
00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:06.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

911
00:25:06.681 --> 00:25:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Or I've said that the other day I did a whole bit and it had this great</v>

912
00:25:09.771 --> 00:25:11.030
<v Speaker 2>crescendo and everything and there,</v>

913
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.310
<v Speaker 2>right where there should have been like the killer punch line.</v>

914
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.143
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

915
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.160
<v Speaker 2>this bit needs were.</v>

916
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.001
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

917
00:25:17.001 --> 00:25:18.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I took you on that journey,</v>

918
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.460
<v Speaker 2>but wasn't it fun?</v>

919
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny though that the only way to really work on those bits besides the</v>

920
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 2>writing and the stuff that you do by herself,</v>

921
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 2>as you got to do it in front of people and tweak it in front of people,</v>

922
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.671
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

923
00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:30.200
<v Speaker 2>you got to get up and you gotta just do it.</v>

924
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.561
<v Speaker 2>There is no right.</v>

925
00:25:31.561 --> 00:25:32.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can write all you want.</v>

926
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.410
<v Speaker 2>We'll are,</v>

927
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.500
<v Speaker 2>we have the one of the weirdest art forms because it's one of the only art forms</v>

928
00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:40.100
<v Speaker 2>that comes to life and develops in front of people.</v>

929
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:44.060
<v Speaker 2>You could develop a killer fucking song by yourself and you can say,</v>

930
00:25:44.061 --> 00:25:44.241
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

931
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:45.390
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this song and you play it.</v>

932
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.233
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>

933
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:46.641
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

934
00:25:46.641 --> 00:25:47.420
<v Speaker 2>you could play it for me.</v>

935
00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:47.781
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be like,</v>

936
00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:48.471
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

937
00:25:48.471 --> 00:25:49.700
<v Speaker 2>that's a great fucking song.</v>

938
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.860
<v Speaker 2>But it's kind of rare.</v>

939
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.150
<v Speaker 2>It happens occasionally.</v>

940
00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:56.390
<v Speaker 2>There's some bits that just write themselves and then they're done right out of</v>

941
00:25:56.391 --> 00:25:57.140
<v Speaker 2>the gate.</v>

942
00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:57.500
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

943
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.760
<v Speaker 2>most of the time they,</v>

944
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.690
<v Speaker 2>they come alive in front of people and then you edit them in front of people and</v>

945
00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:03.500
<v Speaker 2>you change them.</v>

946
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.161
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

947
00:26:04.161 --> 00:26:05.270
<v Speaker 2>you love those two show,</v>

948
00:26:05.271 --> 00:26:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Friday two shows Saturday week.</v>

949
00:26:06.781 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 2>So you're really good.</v>

950
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.510
<v Speaker 2>By the time the late show,</v>

951
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Saturday rolls around,</v>

952
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.090
<v Speaker 2>you've got a good sense of how that bit works.</v>

953
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:12.410
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

954
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:12.860
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

955
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.190
<v Speaker 2>it's also because it's ever evolving and it's a living thing.</v>

956
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.001
<v Speaker 2>And the bit,</v>

957
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could have a bit that you said like it's pretty,</v>

958
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.691
<v Speaker 2>I won't say perfect,</v>

959
00:26:20.691 --> 00:26:21.920
<v Speaker 2>but it is the way it is.</v>

960
00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:25.340
<v Speaker 2>You've been doing the same but it's ever changing and you're always tweaking it.</v>

961
00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:26.420
<v Speaker 2>You're always fixing a little bit.</v>

962
00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 2>It's never perfect,</v>

963
00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:29.810
<v Speaker 2>which is what makes it frustrating but also so fun.</v>

964
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:30.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

965
00:26:30.261 --> 00:26:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you said that.</v>

966
00:26:31.241 --> 00:26:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's how I always describe it.</v>

967
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I always describe comedy as like a living art form.</v>

968
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.810
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

969
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:36.680
<v Speaker 2>it's like alive.</v>

970
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 2>It's alive and it's like a little animal.</v>

971
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I like taking her exam.</v>

972
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.581
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

973
00:26:40.581 --> 00:26:41.540
<v Speaker 2>most things a little animals,</v>

974
00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:42.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's right in front of,</v>

975
00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.680
<v Speaker 2>and it's different with each audience.</v>

976
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:44.370
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

977
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.121
<v Speaker 3>I say that some of the other day,</v>

978
00:26:45.121 --> 00:26:47.730
<v Speaker 3>what's weird about comedy is that if you were looking at it scientifically,</v>

979
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.380
<v Speaker 3>there is no control group.</v>

980
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.760
<v Speaker 3>There's never a point where you're like,</v>

981
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 3>this joke existed in this perfect vacuum and here's how it should be.</v>

982
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.980
<v Speaker 3>And then you test it on different audiences.</v>

983
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult to tame because it's different every single time and your</v>

984
00:26:59.101 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 3>variables change every time.</v>

985
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

986
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:03.720
<v Speaker 1>But that's cause you're good people that are not good.</v>

987
00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:04.670
<v Speaker 1>We've all seen them.</v>

988
00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.470
<v Speaker 3>They start out the same way every night.</v>

989
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.820
<v Speaker 3>They end the same way every night.</v>

990
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.171
<v Speaker 3>They press play,</v>

991
00:27:09.171 --> 00:27:09.411
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>

992
00:27:09.411 --> 00:27:09.860
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>

993
00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.360
<v Speaker 3>and they have an act.</v>

994
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

995
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.580
<v Speaker 3>To just play that act,</v>

996
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.430
<v Speaker 3>it was the hardest lesson I had to learn at the beginning when I would do the</v>

997
00:27:16.431 --> 00:27:20.990
<v Speaker 3>comedy store because I have a very energetic act and so whatever I had for the</v>

998
00:27:20.991 --> 00:27:21.740
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>

999
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.540
<v Speaker 3>whatever 20 minutes I had when I first started,</v>

1000
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I would do that and I would just pound the audience with it.</v>

1001
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Not giving sound.</v>

1002
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.680
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I'm talking about this room,</v>

1003
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.220
<v Speaker 3>but not giving it a chance to breathe.</v>

1004
00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:31.791
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

1005
00:27:31.791 --> 00:27:32.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1006
00:27:32.031 --> 00:27:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Tommy at the comedy store,</v>

1007
00:27:33.111 --> 00:27:33.861
<v Speaker 3>like I sound like him.</v>

1008
00:27:33.861 --> 00:27:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1009
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:34.863
<v Speaker 3>Why does he say that?</v>

1010
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1011
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna get your Bates Ryan Chi.</v>

1012
00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.060
<v Speaker 3>It's a living.</v>

1013
00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:38.630
<v Speaker 3>You have to,</v>

1014
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:39.463
<v Speaker 3>you have to.</v>

1015
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:40.280
<v Speaker 3>You don't talking about,</v>

1016
00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.260
<v Speaker 3>I know he doesn't ever talk to me about,</v>

1017
00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:44.900
<v Speaker 3>I haven't talked to him in seven years,</v>

1018
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.020
<v Speaker 3>but even back then he doesn't talk to me about a comma.</v>

1019
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:48.291
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1020
00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:50.450
<v Speaker 3>And he wouldn't be doing it now for sure.</v>

1021
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.190
<v Speaker 3>He imparts this wisdom anyway,</v>

1022
00:27:52.191 --> 00:27:53.750
<v Speaker 3>but he w I W I can't.</v>

1023
00:27:53.751 --> 00:27:55.100
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is he was right in that.</v>

1024
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.473
<v Speaker 3>You got to</v>

1025
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

1026
00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1027
00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.020
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fine wine.</v>

1028
00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.291
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1029
00:27:59.291 --> 00:28:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Missy knows and I know how to tell people.</v>

1030
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.910
<v Speaker 1>You build a lot of prey,</v>

1031
00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:04.640
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

1032
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.281
<v Speaker 3>you get up there,</v>

1033
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:06.630
<v Speaker 3>you got to let the audience,</v>

1034
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.650
<v Speaker 3>you got to gauge them.</v>

1035
00:28:07.651 --> 00:28:08.484
<v Speaker 3>Give it a second.</v>

1036
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.361
<v Speaker 3>Like I had to learn.</v>

1037
00:28:09.361 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 3>I can't just go on stage and be like,</v>

1038
00:28:10.651 --> 00:28:11.251
<v Speaker 3>how's everybody doing?</v>

1039
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:12.120
<v Speaker 3>So pizza.</v>

1040
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1041
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.760
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you can sometimes,</v>

1042
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:15.061
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1043
00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you cannot.</v>

1044
00:28:15.901 --> 00:28:19.590
<v Speaker 3>And when you find that connection with the audience and then you ride that wave.</v>

1045
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I was on the plane coming home from Orlando and I listened to something that I'm</v>

1046
00:28:23.131 --> 00:28:24.710
<v Speaker 1>going to recommend that every comedian,</v>

1047
00:28:24.711 --> 00:28:26.210
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fucking bad ass.</v>

1048
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1049
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a laugh.com thing.</v>

1050
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1051
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:34.370
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a woody Allen standup bit and a or a standup album.</v>

1052
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:34.821
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1053
00:28:34.821 --> 00:28:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1054
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1055
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen a few pieces of woody Allen stuff.</v>

1056
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I really haven't listened to a much of his comedy.</v>

1057
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.343
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1058
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm incredibly fascinated by him as a human being just because all of the above.</v>

1059
00:28:47.571 --> 00:28:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's a creeper.</v>

1060
00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's talented as well because he,</v>

1062
00:28:50.891 --> 00:28:51.860
<v Speaker 1>he's really funny.</v>

1063
00:28:51.861 --> 00:28:52.370
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

1064
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.400
<v Speaker 1>and I listened to some of his old stuff and it was really like hypersexual and I</v>

1065
00:28:55.401 --> 00:28:55.641
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1066
00:28:55.641 --> 00:28:55.941
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1067
00:28:55.941 --> 00:28:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I never really noticed how sexual it was.</v>

1068
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.071
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1069
00:28:58.071 --> 00:28:59.450
<v Speaker 1>no wonder why he's such a fucking purse.</v>

1070
00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.410
<v Speaker 1>But it's woody Allen on comedy and it's from laugh.com.</v>

1071
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.300
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucking old.</v>

1072
00:29:05.301 --> 00:29:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be from before he was even doing movies because there's no</v>

1073
00:29:10.191 --> 00:29:15.050
<v Speaker 1>mention of movies and it's mentioned of like Jack Benny and Jackie Gleason and</v>

1074
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.450
<v Speaker 1>old school comics that I've never heard of before.</v>

1075
00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:17.961
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>

1076
00:29:17.961 --> 00:29:18.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1077
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.390
<v Speaker 1>his voice sounds really young.</v>

1078
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.230
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1079
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.860
<v Speaker 1>I listen to that.</v>

1080
00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.930
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because it's just,</v>

1081
00:29:23.931 --> 00:29:24.764
<v Speaker 1>it's not comedy.</v>

1082
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just a question and answer piece on.</v>

1083
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.310
<v Speaker 1>That's it right there.</v>

1084
00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Woody Allen on comedy and um,</v>

1085
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1086
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.680
<v Speaker 1>if you're a cop,</v>

1087
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:32.840
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1088
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.300
<v Speaker 1>it's got 1203 reviews,</v>

1089
00:29:35.301 --> 00:29:36.134
<v Speaker 1>five star reviews.</v>

1090
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.310
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucking good.</v>

1091
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1092
00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1093
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I just looked on,</v>

1094
00:29:39.141 --> 00:29:39.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1095
00:29:39.411 --> 00:29:43.240
<v Speaker 1>the Google play store or Amazon MP3 store and just downloaded it.</v>

1096
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking for something woody Allen on a whim and a listen to it for</v>

1097
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:48.700
<v Speaker 1>the first time this weekend.</v>

1098
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.140
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucking interesting because first of all he's dead on the money</v>

1099
00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:53.951
<v Speaker 1>about a lot of shit,</v>

1100
00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:58.030
<v Speaker 1>but he's really honest too about like hacks and about how some people can like</v>

1101
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 1>really kill but the audience takes nothing from it.</v>

1102
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.530
<v Speaker 1>And then someone else might have like a little less of an impact like laugh</v>

1103
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:05.891
<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>

1104
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:10.060
<v Speaker 1>But the audience walks away and they're like really intrigued and feel touched</v>

1105
00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:12.310
<v Speaker 1>and connected by what that person said.</v>

1106
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:12.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1107
00:30:12.821 --> 00:30:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I can think of a perfect example of that is like Bill Hicks.</v>

1108
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some people that think bill Hicks is the most hilarious guy ever.</v>

1109
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I completely disagree.</v>

1110
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.371
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1111
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:24.040
<v Speaker 1>he's one of my all time favorite comedians without a doubt.</v>

1112
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:25.150
<v Speaker 1>And one of my all time,</v>

1113
00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 1>most influential people that I've ever seen perform and that I've ever listened</v>

1114
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:30.880
<v Speaker 1>to and a hero of mine for sure.</v>

1115
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.130
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think he's the funniest guy ever.</v>

1116
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.113
<v Speaker 1>I don't even need,</v>

1117
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.990
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1118
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.670
<v Speaker 3>I feel that way about bill burr,</v>

1119
00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:39.040
<v Speaker 3>who I think is a genius and I think he's hilarious.</v>

1120
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.560
<v Speaker 3>But when I listen to his stuff,</v>

1121
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.311
<v Speaker 3>it's less than,</v>

1122
00:30:42.311 --> 00:30:44.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean this in and from the highest light.</v>

1123
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's less than me laughing out loud,</v>

1124
00:30:46.641 --> 00:30:46.731
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

1125
00:30:46.731 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 3>more me going like,</v>

1126
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.310
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1127
00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:48.870
<v Speaker 3>that is such a good,</v>

1128
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that's cause you're a comic because you like,</v>

1129
00:30:50.621 --> 00:30:50.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1130
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate the craft of his comics.</v>

1131
00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.780
<v Speaker 1>He makes me laugh my fucking ass off.</v>

1132
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1133
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:56.221
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1134
00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I love bill because he's a,</v>

1135
00:30:57.721 --> 00:30:58.620
<v Speaker 1>from where I'm from,</v>

1136
00:30:58.621 --> 00:30:59.431
<v Speaker 1>he's old school.</v>

1137
00:30:59.431 --> 00:31:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Boston.</v>

1138
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to know like what's a Boston style of comedy?</v>

1140
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.550
<v Speaker 1>His style was more Boston even than mine.</v>

1141
00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1142
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like hyper observational in your face.</v>

1143
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:10.640
<v Speaker 3>I would just call it east coast.</v>

1144
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1145
00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.013
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1146
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.840
<v Speaker 3>cause then you have someone like on the other end of the spectrum like Pablo</v>

1147
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:14.841
<v Speaker 3>Francisco,</v>

1148
00:31:14.841 --> 00:31:16.490
<v Speaker 3>who I fucking worship.</v>

1149
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.721
<v Speaker 3>And that's not,</v>

1150
00:31:17.721 --> 00:31:18.800
<v Speaker 3>you don't walk away from that.</v>

1151
00:31:18.801 --> 00:31:19.011
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1152
00:31:19.011 --> 00:31:19.101
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1153
00:31:19.101 --> 00:31:19.731
<v Speaker 3>that's a real thinker.</v>

1154
00:31:19.731 --> 00:31:20.451
<v Speaker 3>That's true for a bit.</v>

1155
00:31:20.451 --> 00:31:22.220
<v Speaker 3>But God was that fucking funny.</v>

1156
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:22.911
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1157
00:31:22.911 --> 00:31:23.960
<v Speaker 3>he's all noises,</v>

1158
00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:24.770
<v Speaker 3>silliness.</v>

1159
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 3>I love his own eyes,</v>

1160
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Pablo and person too,</v>

1161
00:31:28.251 --> 00:31:29.900
<v Speaker 1>to really appreciate the madness.</v>

1162
00:31:29.901 --> 00:31:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1163
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1164
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.180
<v Speaker 1>seem Pablo on television.</v>

1165
00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:33.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's like you don't,</v>

1166
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out what my next special,</v>

1167
00:31:36.741 --> 00:31:37.371
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>

1168
00:31:37.371 --> 00:31:38.204
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1169
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:43.330
<v Speaker 1>get a live performance to translate directly into a DVD or a CD.</v>

1170
00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And I think the best way when I'm going to do my next one,</v>

1171
00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna do it in a comedy club,</v>

1172
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.440
<v Speaker 1>a real small,</v>

1173
00:31:48.441 --> 00:31:50.060
<v Speaker 1>like 300 seat comedy club.</v>

1174
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Because I've been doing these 2000 seat venues and it's not the same man man</v>

1175
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.840
<v Speaker 3>doing those huge venues.</v>

1176
00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.681
<v Speaker 3>It's just not the same.</v>

1177
00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:57.880
<v Speaker 3>The connection with the crowd,</v>

1178
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:58.390
<v Speaker 3>not as intimate.</v>

1179
00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.750
<v Speaker 3>I've always wanted to do a double released DVD.</v>

1180
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to do not the same set,</v>

1181
00:32:03.701 --> 00:32:06.070
<v Speaker 3>but like you'd tell them together and one would be the big venue,</v>

1182
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 3>like a theater and then one would be something like,</v>

1183
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.120
<v Speaker 3>not a Largo but something more intimate.</v>

1184
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:11.950
<v Speaker 3>And you could is Largo seat?</v>

1185
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:13.301
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1186
00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:14.620
<v Speaker 3>I've never been allowed in uh,</v>

1187
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.121
<v Speaker 3>like a hundred.</v>

1188
00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:16.331
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1189
00:32:16.331 --> 00:32:16.471
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1190
00:32:16.471 --> 00:32:16.991
<v Speaker 3>it's small.</v>

1191
00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:21.040
<v Speaker 3>It's smaller than have in Margo got a club.</v>

1192
00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:21.893
<v Speaker 3>Is that a click?</v>

1193
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like super cool.</v>

1194
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:24.243
<v Speaker 3>Is it super cool?</v>

1195
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not super cool though.</v>

1196
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're a band,</v>

1197
00:32:26.381 --> 00:32:27.340
<v Speaker 3>but we don't play music.</v>

1198
00:32:27.341 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 3>We just write down the notes and then we fax them like,</v>

1199
00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:30.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1200
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Well it's a part of the alternative comedy movement.</v>

1201
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Tis but perform there.</v>

1202
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.700
<v Speaker 3>But I've always wanted to sell to DVDs.</v>

1203
00:32:36.701 --> 00:32:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Just almost just to showcase your range as a comic.</v>

1204
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.231
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1205
00:32:39.231 --> 00:32:39.381
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1206
00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I can do an intimate</v>

1207
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.140
<v Speaker 2>room or dominate with a big room.</v>

1208
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1209
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.111
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1210
00:32:44.111 --> 00:32:45.770
<v Speaker 2>that it's a totally different style comedy,</v>

1211
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:45.951
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1212
00:32:45.951 --> 00:32:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Holy cause you can't come out,</v>

1213
00:32:47.481 --> 00:32:49.340
<v Speaker 2>you can't be in everyone's face in a small room.</v>

1214
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:50.840
<v Speaker 2>It's all you have to connect with the audience.</v>

1215
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1216
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:52.970
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's two different animals.</v>

1217
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.030
<v Speaker 2>There's that feeling that you get to when you're in a comedy club,</v>

1218
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:56.750
<v Speaker 2>like uh,</v>

1219
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.830
<v Speaker 2>when you're in the back of the room,</v>

1220
00:32:57.831 --> 00:32:59.990
<v Speaker 2>like the smile is very contagious.</v>

1221
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:04.991
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're overwhelmed by the positive energy of the room when it's doing</v>

1222
00:33:05.001 --> 00:33:08.210
<v Speaker 2>well and like to like to the laugh factory or not the laugh factor,</v>

1223
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:10.220
<v Speaker 2>whether the ice house is my favorite example,</v>

1224
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.233
<v Speaker 2>the ice house,</v>

1225
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.920
<v Speaker 2>that main room is only seats when it's stuffed to the gills and only gets 190</v>

1226
00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>people in there.</v>

1227
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.380
<v Speaker 2>It's tiny and it just,</v>

1228
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.570
<v Speaker 2>it just lights up.</v>

1229
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:25.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just on fire when you're in the middle of that versus being on a stage</v>

1230
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:26.660
<v Speaker 2>that's far away from them.</v>

1231
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

1232
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.790
<v Speaker 2>if I had my job,</v>

1233
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.870
<v Speaker 2>if I can make a living doing my comedy is very loud and in your face and</v>

1234
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.510
<v Speaker 2>energetic so it lends itself to a larger room.</v>

1235
00:33:35.511 --> 00:33:38.360
<v Speaker 2>But I really enjoy my small alternative venues.</v>

1236
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:42.050
<v Speaker 2>I love doing them cause that you get that connectivity and you write the most</v>

1237
00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:43.550
<v Speaker 2>and you get a chance to be like,</v>

1238
00:33:43.551 --> 00:33:44.121
<v Speaker 2>was that funny?</v>

1239
00:33:44.121 --> 00:33:44.954
<v Speaker 2>Did you like that?</v>

1240
00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:48.950
<v Speaker 2>And like you can see the disgust on their face and right up close.</v>

1241
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever do the little stage of the Ice House?</v>

1242
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:51.760
<v Speaker 2>The the stage two?</v>

1243
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 2>That place is the shit.</v>

1245
00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I like 85 90 seats or something.</v>

1246
00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I've done that when I've done your show and that's cool.</v>

1247
00:33:58.671 --> 00:33:59.121
<v Speaker 2>I just just,</v>

1248
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:03.230
<v Speaker 2>it's just a different kind of writing and I think a good comic can go from one</v>

1249
00:34:03.231 --> 00:34:03.651
<v Speaker 2>to the other,</v>

1250
00:34:03.651 --> 00:34:04.760
<v Speaker 2>can run off and go do it.</v>

1251
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.630
<v Speaker 2>300 person show at the Improv and then run to that small stage and adjust</v>

1252
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:09.464
<v Speaker 2>accordingly.</v>

1253
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.481
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1254
00:34:11.481 --> 00:34:15.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's a really interesting thing and news parallels I think in all</v>

1255
00:34:15.621 --> 00:34:16.251
<v Speaker 2>art forms,</v>

1256
00:34:16.251 --> 00:34:18.140
<v Speaker 2>whether it's in music or in painting or anything,</v>

1257
00:34:18.141 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 2>everyone that I've talked to that's an artist about creating the creative</v>

1258
00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 2>process and it seems to be all about just like focusing on it,</v>

1259
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.600
<v Speaker 2>the intensity and the focus and the dedication you have to whatever you're</v>

1260
00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:29.961
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

1261
00:34:29.961 --> 00:34:30.794
<v Speaker 2>whether it's uh,</v>

1262
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.150
<v Speaker 2>completing a set,</v>

1263
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:34.120
<v Speaker 2>writing a joke or making a sculpture,</v>

1264
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.720
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

1265
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:39.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like getting out of the way and focusing on it,</v>

1266
00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:42.530
<v Speaker 2>but yet getting yourself out of the way and letting that thing become whatever</v>

1267
00:34:42.531 --> 00:34:43.364
<v Speaker 2>the fuck it is.</v>

1268
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:43.820
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1269
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.653
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1270
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a process and it also takes time to even learn that process.</v>

1271
00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Like joke aside,</v>

1272
00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:51.680
<v Speaker 2>like to know I need to let this breathe or I need to think about this.</v>

1273
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.181
<v Speaker 2>Like there's just,</v>

1274
00:34:52.181 --> 00:34:54.740
<v Speaker 2>and there's no right or wrong way to do it.</v>

1275
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.250
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you're lost in a comedy forest and you've got to like figure</v>

1276
00:34:58.251 --> 00:35:00.710
<v Speaker 2>out your own way back when you have,</v>

1277
00:35:00.711 --> 00:35:03.380
<v Speaker 2>when you're onstage and you've got this like list of jokes that you're trying to</v>

1278
00:35:03.381 --> 00:35:06.290
<v Speaker 2>work out or the beats and there's no right way to put that set list and an</v>

1279
00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:06.561
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

1280
00:35:06.561 --> 00:35:08.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like a weird science.</v>

1281
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 2>And it's a weird science and no one can fucking teach you.</v>

1283
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.950
<v Speaker 2>You cannot be taught.</v>

1284
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 2>That's my other thing.</v>

1285
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.180
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who's a comedy coach and she's hilarious.</v>

1286
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.830
<v Speaker 2>So she is the exception to this rule.</v>

1287
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.741
<v Speaker 2>But in general,</v>

1288
00:35:19.741 --> 00:35:22.700
<v Speaker 2>like that's why most people that like teach comedy classes,</v>

1289
00:35:22.701 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 2>it's like you've never heard them have them because those who can't do and those</v>

1290
00:35:26.091 --> 00:35:26.870
<v Speaker 2>who can't teach,</v>

1291
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.703
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1292
00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:28.881
<v Speaker 2>because we can do,</v>

1293
00:35:28.881 --> 00:35:29.714
<v Speaker 2>and those who can't teach,</v>

1294
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.850
<v Speaker 2>but you can't be taught all these comedy classes,</v>

1295
00:35:31.851 --> 00:35:32.541
<v Speaker 2>comedy lectures,</v>

1296
00:35:32.541 --> 00:35:33.374
<v Speaker 2>comedy seminars,</v>

1297
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.191
<v Speaker 2>and even right now,</v>

1298
00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:35.420
<v Speaker 2>like you can listen to us all you want,</v>

1299
00:35:35.421 --> 00:35:36.111
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>

1300
00:35:36.111 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 2>if you don't get up tonight and do</v>

1301
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.690
<v Speaker 1>like those three minutes that scare you,</v>

1302
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to be anything.</v>

1303
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you wholeheartedly,</v>

1304
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:46.860
<v Speaker 1>but I think where it benefits is someone who's listening to this can get the</v>

1305
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Eliza slessinger take on on comedy and apply it,</v>

1306
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 1>learn from their own real career,</v>

1307
00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:55.563
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1308
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:56.940
<v Speaker 1>put it in their database.</v>

1309
00:35:56.941 --> 00:35:59.760
<v Speaker 1>And like I was saying about Woody Allen on comedy,</v>

1310
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:00.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1311
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing comedy for 20 fucking something years and listening to Woody</v>

1312
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.161
<v Speaker 1>Allen on comedy,</v>

1313
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1314
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1315
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:06.570
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1316
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.403
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

1317
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 1>You should listen to everyone.</v>

1318
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:09.091
<v Speaker 1>You should take notes.</v>

1319
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:10.650
<v Speaker 1>You should watch comics that you like.</v>

1320
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day,</v>

1321
00:36:11.551 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 1>if you don't practice yes that it's worthless.</v>

1322
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Blogger comedy blogger,</v>

1323
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 1>will the,</v>

1324
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen people that raped my DVD?</v>

1325
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.713
<v Speaker 1>Just saying random.</v>

1326
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a comedy?</v>

1327
00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Bloggers try to go on stage and they think they're cute.</v>

1328
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.461
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1329
00:36:26.461 --> 00:36:28.560
<v Speaker 1>but he plays a shit of course.</v>

1330
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.191
<v Speaker 1>And then you want to be like,</v>

1331
00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:31.310
<v Speaker 1>let me review your performance asshole,</v>

1332
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 1>who we started out where you can finish them weaker.</v>

1333
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1334
00:36:34.411 --> 00:36:36.660
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where you can't,</v>

1335
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.480
<v Speaker 1>there's no shortcuts to doing stand up.</v>

1336
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 1>No one can teach you how to do it.</v>

1337
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:42.330
<v Speaker 1>But what we can show catch,</v>

1338
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:44.760
<v Speaker 1>you can get a horrible show and then you can sell out arenas.</v>

1339
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:45.080
<v Speaker 1>The rest of,</v>

1340
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 1>there's no shortcuts.</v>

1341
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.451
<v Speaker 1>When you go up there,</v>

1342
00:36:46.451 --> 00:36:49.350
<v Speaker 1>you still eat shit that's even more frightening.</v>

1343
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the Michael Richard Scenario.</v>

1344
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.040
<v Speaker 1>When you were a hugely famous,</v>

1345
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:55.140
<v Speaker 1>very successful world,</v>

1346
00:36:55.141 --> 00:36:59.460
<v Speaker 1>loved math and then you go on stage and eat plates of Shit.</v>

1347
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Well he was saying the n word because he was,</v>

1348
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.100
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1349
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I called,</v>

1350
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he was coked up.</v>

1351
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.420
<v Speaker 1>And I say this is a person who's never done coke.</v>

1352
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:13.200
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really totally know the coke attitude other than like watching it</v>

1353
00:37:13.201 --> 00:37:14.034
<v Speaker 1>from afar.</v>

1354
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:14.760
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1355
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.370
<v Speaker 1>you've been blanche up to the microphone is not,</v>

1356
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.990
<v Speaker 1>you can't keep her away from you for just a few minutes.</v>

1357
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:19.771
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1358
00:37:19.771 --> 00:37:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I speaking</v>

1359
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.140
<v Speaker 1>she's a little sweetie.</v>

1360
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1361
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Michael Richards was at the comedy store before he had his famous meltdown that</v>

1362
00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:31.470
<v Speaker 1>night at the laugh factor.</v>

1363
00:37:31.471 --> 00:37:35.160
<v Speaker 1>He had two sets that night and Brent Ernst came up to me,</v>

1364
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:35.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1365
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.430
<v Speaker 1>after the laugh factory one.</v>

1366
00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1367
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.840
<v Speaker 1>he came over to the stores.</v>

1368
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.061
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1369
00:37:39.061 --> 00:37:39.391
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1370
00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I just saw the craziest shit cause he was there.</v>

1371
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.530
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1372
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1373
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.670
<v Speaker 1>that fucking Michael Richards guy goes on stage,</v>

1374
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.150
<v Speaker 1>the laugh factory is eating shit.</v>

1375
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.680
<v Speaker 1>These black guys started heckle him.</v>

1376
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.480
<v Speaker 1>He starts tossing around the end bomb.</v>

1377
00:37:51.481 --> 00:37:51.751
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1378
00:37:51.751 --> 00:37:52.584
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1379
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.041
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1380
00:37:53.041 --> 00:37:53.491
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1381
00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:53.940
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1382
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.230
<v Speaker 1>look there's a nigger.</v>

1383
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:58.740
<v Speaker 1>And he starts pointing at them and sang it and Brent Arts is saying this and</v>

1384
00:37:58.741 --> 00:37:59.910
<v Speaker 1>we're like holding her face.</v>

1385
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.730
<v Speaker 1>The of out of the store were like no he didn't.</v>

1386
00:38:02.731 --> 00:38:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I guess he did but I thought it was going to end there and then someone fucking,</v>

1387
00:38:06.541 --> 00:38:09.000
<v Speaker 1>it was like one of the very first time someone filmed something with their</v>

1388
00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:09.834
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>

1389
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.520
<v Speaker 1>But we watched Michael Richards have these really tough sets and it was really</v>

1390
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:19.521
<v Speaker 1>weird because he's this guy super famous and he would go onstage and just</v>

1391
00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:21.570
<v Speaker 1>fucking bomb.</v>

1392
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:22.404
<v Speaker 1>He had nothing.</v>

1393
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.040
<v Speaker 1>He was an open miker me,</v>

1394
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.720
<v Speaker 1>he was an open mic or that was super confident and he would get these big rounds</v>

1395
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:29.700
<v Speaker 1>of applause when he'd get on the stage.</v>

1396
00:38:29.701 --> 00:38:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody be so excited.</v>

1397
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:33.860
<v Speaker 1>And then he would like to prat falls and it,</v>

1398
00:38:33.861 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 1>but it would never translate without the rest</v>

1399
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 2>of the cast without a writer.</v>

1400
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1401
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a thing about sitcoms.</v>

1402
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like a re sitcom writers are some of the most undervalued and</v>

1403
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.340
<v Speaker 2>underappreciated people in the world of like making those stars.</v>

1404
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a whole slew of people that are,</v>

1405
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:52.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1406
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:52.570
<v Speaker 2>they may,</v>

1407
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 2>might not ever be great comics themselves,</v>

1408
00:38:55.001 --> 00:38:59.910
<v Speaker 2>but they know how to craft material for a guy like Richard was.</v>

1409
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Is it Ray Romano or is it Jerry Seinfeld that's someone says,</v>

1410
00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I think about like how you're given that x amount of minutes when you get</v>

1411
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:09.460
<v Speaker 2>onstage,</v>

1412
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.350
<v Speaker 2>when you're someone phases.</v>

1413
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1414
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.620
<v Speaker 2>they give you,</v>

1415
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.530
<v Speaker 2>they give you that and that's what the applause on the courtesy labs because</v>

1416
00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:15.850
<v Speaker 2>they're waiting for something good.</v>

1417
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:20.050
<v Speaker 2>I've seen plenty of comics who are movie stars maybe started as comics and then</v>

1418
00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:21.790
<v Speaker 2>became something else and they go back and you're like,</v>

1419
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:22.690
<v Speaker 2>this is horrible.</v>

1420
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Or I was talking about this with somebody last night.</v>

1421
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll have people that I think are very funny.</v>

1422
00:39:27.731 --> 00:39:30.040
<v Speaker 2>And then on Twitter it doesn't translate.</v>

1423
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:34.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think a versatile comic that he was between a standup comedian and a funny</v>

1424
00:39:34.601 --> 00:39:38.740
<v Speaker 2>person is somebody that is able to be ver to do it on any platform.</v>

1425
00:39:38.741 --> 00:39:43.540
<v Speaker 2>You can be funny in person or in the writing or 140 characters or on a script.</v>

1426
00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Like that's when you have comedy in you man,</v>

1427
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:50.920
<v Speaker 2>your performer versus muscle that you're kind of comedy like some,</v>

1428
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 2>some kinds of comedy just do not translate in the written form.</v>

1429
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:55.631
<v Speaker 2>Some don't.</v>

1430
00:39:55.631 --> 00:39:56.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's the example.</v>

1431
00:39:56.891 --> 00:39:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Like here's Michael Richards.</v>

1432
00:39:57.851 --> 00:39:58.870
<v Speaker 2>You're not a standup comic.</v>

1433
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Maybe did it at one point,</v>

1434
00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 2>but people think,</v>

1435
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:02.380
<v Speaker 2>and this is not about him,</v>

1436
00:40:02.381 --> 00:40:04.660
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's where ego gets into it cause you're like,</v>

1437
00:40:04.661 --> 00:40:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1438
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking funny.</v>

1439
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:06.670
<v Speaker 2>When people write my stuff down,</v>

1440
00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I could do this.</v>

1441
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:12.430
<v Speaker 2>So many people and it drives me to take my art form that I hold near and dear to</v>

1442
00:40:12.431 --> 00:40:13.390
<v Speaker 2>me and that standup comedy.</v>

1443
00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:13.780
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1444
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.613
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>

1445
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:14.771
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1446
00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing standup now.</v>

1447
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1448
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:16.923
<v Speaker 2>Oh are you?</v>

1449
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Or is it doing you?</v>

1450
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:19.391
<v Speaker 2>Oh are,</v>

1451
00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:19.481
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1452
00:40:19.481 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to give it a whirl.</v>

1453
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:21.611
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1454
00:40:21.611 --> 00:40:21.971
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

1455
00:40:21.971 --> 00:40:22.660
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

1456
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.770
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like it's my,</v>

1457
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.620
<v Speaker 2>it's my craft and very protective of,</v>

1458
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.930
<v Speaker 2>of all that it entailed.</v>

1459
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Use exclusive like to tell in a,</v>

1460
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 2>do you feel like exclusionary like that?</v>

1461
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you think like what do you mean?</v>

1462
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:36.064
<v Speaker 2>Like I have the tea,</v>

1463
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 2>the totally opposite attitude.</v>

1464
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone says a,</v>

1465
00:40:39.441 --> 00:40:40.420
<v Speaker 2>I think I could do that.</v>

1466
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do standup comedy.</v>

1467
00:40:41.471 --> 00:40:41.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1468
00:40:41.711 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 2>you could do it.</v>

1469
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can do it.</v>

1470
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:43.810
<v Speaker 2>You can do it.</v>

1471
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can do it.</v>

1472
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:45.580
<v Speaker 2>You just have to figure it out.</v>

1473
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.660
<v Speaker 2>If your objective,</v>

1474
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.513
<v Speaker 2>you can figure it out.</v>

1475
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't begrudge anyone the,</v>

1476
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.010
<v Speaker 2>and I want them to go up there and be funny.</v>

1477
00:40:51.011 --> 00:40:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I love funny people.</v>

1478
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:56.260
<v Speaker 2>I think my thing is people say it as if like I'm going to take a pottery</v>

1479
00:40:56.261 --> 00:40:56.770
<v Speaker 2>workshop,</v>

1480
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.320
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to give standup oral and it's almost this,</v>

1481
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.120
<v Speaker 2>I've had friends or I've known people that have done it and they eat shit that</v>

1482
00:41:04.121 --> 00:41:05.860
<v Speaker 2>they thought they did a good job or they're like,</v>

1483
00:41:05.861 --> 00:41:06.970
<v Speaker 2>this is part of my thing.</v>

1484
00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:07.361
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1485
00:41:07.361 --> 00:41:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I want these jokes to be weird.</v>

1486
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:09.390
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

1487
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.881
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

1488
00:41:09.881 --> 00:41:11.140
<v Speaker 2>So what just happened was the,</v>

1489
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:14.710
<v Speaker 2>you just killed the energy that I've got to go dig myself out of a fucking hole.</v>

1490
00:41:14.711 --> 00:41:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Now my four year old does that.</v>

1491
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Like she'll fall down and go,</v>

1492
00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:18.154
<v Speaker 2>I meant to do that.</v>

1493
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.023
<v Speaker 2>I meant to do that.</v>

1494
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:23.950
<v Speaker 2>The quicker you get over the fact that everyone falls and you should never lie</v>

1495
00:41:23.951 --> 00:41:25.420
<v Speaker 2>because everyone knows that you fell.</v>

1496
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Moral is don't be a liar.</v>

1497
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Don't try to trick people to make yourself feel better because it doesn't ever</v>

1498
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:31.091
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

1499
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:32.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like name dropping that shit.</v>

1500
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.363
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>

1501
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.920
<v Speaker 2>no one never has never will.</v>

1502
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:38.480
<v Speaker 2>It just makes you look like a fucking idiot,</v>

1503
00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:38.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1504
00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:38.960
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1505
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.171
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1506
00:41:39.171 --> 00:41:39.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1507
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 2>we're hanging out with David Copperfield the other night and like no one,</v>

1508
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.160
<v Speaker 2>no one gives a fuck.</v>

1509
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives us,</v>

1510
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.020
<v Speaker 2>not only do they not give a fuck,</v>

1511
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:47.960
<v Speaker 2>they respect you less for namedropping the old and what is tough,</v>

1512
00:41:47.961 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 2>I will say this on the rare occasion that I'm with somebody that is famous or</v>

1513
00:41:51.351 --> 00:41:52.520
<v Speaker 2>that is like cool.</v>

1514
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.360
<v Speaker 2>I almost,</v>

1515
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 2>because I was so painfully sell for,</v>

1516
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:55.580
<v Speaker 2>I preface it with,</v>

1517
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to sound like a jerk,</v>

1518
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.000
<v Speaker 2>like whatever Brad Pitt is not the guy in the store,</v>

1519
00:41:59.001 --> 00:42:00.020
<v Speaker 2>but Brad Pitt was there.</v>

1520
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him.</v>

1521
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:01.881
<v Speaker 2>He was at the party.</v>

1522
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Here's the rest of the story.</v>

1523
00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.090
<v Speaker 2>It's letting you know that like we don't hang out,</v>

1524
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.410
<v Speaker 2>but I was next to bribery.</v>

1525
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:08.120
<v Speaker 2>You being aware,</v>

1526
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.690
<v Speaker 2>being aware of how Douchey it could sound to name drop Brad Pitt,</v>

1527
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.610
<v Speaker 2>whereas a person who's unaware,</v>

1528
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.280
<v Speaker 2>unaware people are really frustrating to me.</v>

1529
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Like people are just lucky.</v>

1530
00:42:17.541 --> 00:42:18.374
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kidding.</v>

1531
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:23.120
<v Speaker 2>The frustrating goofiness of being unaware is it's very,</v>

1532
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.160
<v Speaker 2>to me it bothers me because,</v>

1533
00:42:25.161 --> 00:42:25.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1534
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I think that all comics in WWE in some way or form or kind of chameleons,</v>

1535
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I think we sort of,</v>

1536
00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:31.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1537
00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:31.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1538
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.270
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1539
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:34.220
<v Speaker 2>we sort of absorb a lot of,</v>

1540
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.600
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of who I am.</v>

1541
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:35.991
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

1542
00:42:35.991 --> 00:42:39.290
<v Speaker 2>what makes me like a comic is like a lot of funny people that I knew,</v>

1543
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:40.850
<v Speaker 2>people that I grew up with,</v>

1544
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 2>people that I ran into that said funny things.</v>

1545
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:44.263
<v Speaker 2>And I've sort of like,</v>

1546
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:45.930
<v Speaker 2>I think all of us sponge,</v>

1547
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just even the most unique personality ever uses the English</v>

1548
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:53.870
<v Speaker 2>language and uses it in a form that people have used for thousands of years.</v>

1549
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like even the combination of words that you use that are</v>

1550
00:42:56.481 --> 00:42:57.470
<v Speaker 2>particularly unique,</v>

1551
00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.790
<v Speaker 2>you use it because you've sort of seen a million different examples of how other</v>

1552
00:43:01.791 --> 00:43:05.660
<v Speaker 2>people use the English language and you've kind of like taking a little bit of</v>

1553
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:09.080
<v Speaker 2>this and added a little bit of that and always a combination of Jackie Gleason</v>

1554
00:43:09.081 --> 00:43:10.500
<v Speaker 2>and Sam Kennison and you know,</v>

1555
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:15.170
<v Speaker 2>I think that hyper awareness kind of takes the wonder out of,</v>

1556
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.820
<v Speaker 2>or it's always takes the mystery out of people.</v>

1557
00:43:16.821 --> 00:43:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Like even if we were to like talk about like even in the dating world,</v>

1558
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:21.470
<v Speaker 2>some guy walks in and he's got like,</v>

1559
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:22.760
<v Speaker 2>like a Johnny Depp thing,</v>

1560
00:43:22.761 --> 00:43:25.480
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like a bunch of necklaces and like a shirt open.</v>

1561
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.821
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1562
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:28.640
<v Speaker 2>you purposefully put on all those necklaces,</v>

1563
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:29.930
<v Speaker 2>you're not a pirate.</v>

1564
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 2>When I see like punk rockers and they've got like a Mohawk and I'm like,</v>

1565
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm just imagining this super tough punk rock or sitting there with hair putty</v>

1566
00:43:37.191 --> 00:43:42.050
<v Speaker 2>for four hours sculpting this and it just takes the mystique out of all of it.</v>

1567
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Cause you have to think about it.</v>

1568
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:43.881
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

1569
00:43:43.881 --> 00:43:44.780
<v Speaker 2>No one is original.</v>

1570
00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Everything is horrible.</v>

1571
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Can I?</v>

1572
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Well you can be original or you can be uniquely you,</v>

1573
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.380
<v Speaker 2>but you're not a hundred percent original.</v>

1574
00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:55.310
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>

1575
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.011
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>

1576
00:43:56.011 --> 00:44:00.290
<v Speaker 2>And so we come from a culture that has existed for hundreds of years and it's a</v>

1577
00:44:00.291 --> 00:44:01.490
<v Speaker 2>part of a civilization,</v>

1578
00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:04.010
<v Speaker 2>human civilization that's existed for thousands of years.</v>

1579
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.660
<v Speaker 2>And there's just no getting away from that.</v>

1580
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.710
<v Speaker 2>You can't get out of your roots.</v>

1581
00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:08.720
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be wholly and completely unique.</v>

1582
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:09.221
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1583
00:44:09.221 --> 00:44:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I actually am working on,</v>

1584
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:11.360
<v Speaker 2>this is also a comic thing,</v>

1585
00:44:11.361 --> 00:44:13.400
<v Speaker 2>like prefacing it with working on a bit about,</v>

1586
00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:15.950
<v Speaker 2>but girls and men do it too obviously.</v>

1587
00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:20.060
<v Speaker 2>But like girls have this when you are part of a homogeneous mixture of people,</v>

1588
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:20.241
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1589
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:21.690
<v Speaker 2>and when you go to high school where everyone's blonde,</v>

1590
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:22.260
<v Speaker 2>everyone's chill,</v>

1591
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.520
<v Speaker 2>everything's says girls always find that,</v>

1592
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.740
<v Speaker 2>have this desire to set themselves apart.</v>

1593
00:44:27.741 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's always something like I'm one 18th Cherokee,</v>

1594
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 2>my mom</v>

1595
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.710
<v Speaker 3>was Spanish and it's just like you are white.</v>

1596
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares.</v>

1597
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.540
<v Speaker 3>And it's this desire to set ourselves apart.</v>

1598
00:44:38.541 --> 00:44:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Cause we're always told that we're special and we're different.</v>

1599
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1600
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:42.061
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1601
00:44:42.061 --> 00:44:42.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1602
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 3>or even like,</v>

1603
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.171
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1604
00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:44.850
<v Speaker 3>your last name is whatever.</v>

1605
00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:45.420
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1606
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.051
<v Speaker 3>Oh Donald.</v>

1607
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:46.411
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

1608
00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:46.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1609
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Irish pride.</v>

1610
00:44:47.671 --> 00:44:48.600
<v Speaker 3>And it's like your great,</v>

1611
00:44:48.601 --> 00:44:49.860
<v Speaker 3>great grandmother was Irish.</v>

1612
00:44:49.861 --> 00:44:50.521
<v Speaker 3>Like that's it.</v>

1613
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:52.490
<v Speaker 3>You've never been nothing about use,</v>

1614
00:44:52.491 --> 00:44:53.460
<v Speaker 3>particularly Irish.</v>

1615
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.170
<v Speaker 3>I can drink just as much as you like.</v>

1616
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 3>People love that.</v>

1617
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 3>They'll look to their heritage to separate them.</v>

1618
00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.430
<v Speaker 3>And when that doesn't do it,</v>

1619
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 3>they'll look to where they were born or where they were conceived.</v>

1620
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 3>Anything to set them apart.</v>

1621
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.450
<v Speaker 1>My friend Marcus Davis,</v>

<v Speaker 4>One more time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>who's a,</v>

1657
00:45:43.431 --> 00:45:44.040
<v Speaker 1>an English man,</v>

1658
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.280
<v Speaker 1>a real English might like from England and uh,</v>

1659
00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Dan Hardee was mocking him,</v>

1660
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.080
<v Speaker 1>calling him a fake Irishman,</v>

1661
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:50.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1662
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.781
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1663
00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:51.950
<v Speaker 1>he's like half Irish,</v>

1664
00:45:51.951 --> 00:45:52.680
<v Speaker 1>like claiming I,</v>

1665
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.280
<v Speaker 1>and he just mocked him the entire campus.</v>

1666
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Fager and by the time they got into the cage together,</v>

1667
00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.810
<v Speaker 1>he was so angry.</v>

1668
00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.740
<v Speaker 1>He was so pissed at Dan because Dan was calling him a fake.</v>

1669
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Marcus was just out of his head.</v>

1670
00:46:05.091 --> 00:46:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Like he didn't,</v>

1671
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:08.600
<v Speaker 1>didn't fight up to his potential just because he was so emotional.</v>

1672
00:46:08.601 --> 00:46:09.380
<v Speaker 1>He didn't use it.</v>

1673
00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:10.280
<v Speaker 1>While he just couldn't,</v>

1674
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:10.791
<v Speaker 1>well it's not,</v>

1675
00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:11.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know.</v>

1676
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:12.620
<v Speaker 1>The Irish aren't very bright.</v>

1677
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.280
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1678
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.920
<v Speaker 4>that's totally the things I said.</v>

1679
00:46:15.921 --> 00:46:16.940
<v Speaker 4>That's the one we were like,</v>

1680
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.391
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1681
00:46:17.391 --> 00:46:19.010
<v Speaker 4>please don't think that we have a thing against the Irish.</v>

1682
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Emotions are your enemy.</v>

1683
00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:22.780
<v Speaker 1>And when it comes to fighting,</v>

1684
00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:23.770
<v Speaker 1>when you a,</v>

1685
00:46:23.771 --> 00:46:26.110
<v Speaker 1>when you get too vested in,</v>

1686
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:26.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1687
00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:26.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1688
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.480
<v Speaker 1>the pressure of kicking someone's ass,</v>

1689
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:29.583
<v Speaker 1>it just can be,</v>

1690
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.513
<v Speaker 1>it's too much.</v>

1691
00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.220
<v Speaker 1>It makes it,</v>

1692
00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:31.910
<v Speaker 1>it makes it,</v>

1693
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:32.800
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine,</v>

1694
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.210
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had a little hair puller?</v>

1695
00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.770
<v Speaker 1>A fucking no.</v>

1696
00:46:35.771 --> 00:46:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I went to college.</v>

1697
00:46:36.791 --> 00:46:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get people in college fight.</v>

1698
00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I think if you are not a real fighter,</v>

1699
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm want,</v>

1700
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:41.920
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1701
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking to women.</v>

1702
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:45.010
<v Speaker 1>It is the ultimate white trash move to get in a fight.</v>

1703
00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1704
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:46.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1705
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.610
<v Speaker 3>Because that means my words that I use to make a living and feed my dog have</v>

1706
00:46:50.611 --> 00:46:51.990
<v Speaker 3>exhausted me and um,</v>

1707
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:52.891
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1708
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:54.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to resort to violence.</v>

1709
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.190
<v Speaker 3>How much you've gotten me.</v>

1710
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand that mentality.</v>

1711
00:46:58.501 --> 00:46:59.281
<v Speaker 3>If you're a real fire,</v>

1712
00:46:59.281 --> 00:47:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's different cause that's what you would go to.</v>

1713
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Or probably if you're real far do,</v>

1714
00:47:03.031 --> 00:47:05.820
<v Speaker 3>you would never find anyone randomly because you have too much to lose and you</v>

1715
00:47:05.821 --> 00:47:06.654
<v Speaker 3>could probably kill them.</v>

1716
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Well also you realize how dumb it is.</v>

1717
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1718
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:09.561
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1719
00:47:09.561 --> 00:47:10.310
<v Speaker 1>it's dumb,</v>

1720
00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:10.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1721
00:47:10.551 --> 00:47:11.384
<v Speaker 1>would fighting,</v>

1722
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.860
<v Speaker 1>well not fighting.</v>

1723
00:47:12.861 --> 00:47:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Let me fight with fighting.</v>

1724
00:47:13.761 --> 00:47:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Really is is like what fighting is with animals.</v>

1725
00:47:15.921 --> 00:47:18.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just like it's combat,</v>

1726
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:21.680
<v Speaker 1>but when you're thinking about martial arts,</v>

1727
00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:22.480
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>

1728
00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:22.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1729
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.720
<v Speaker 1>the last person that you would expect to see in a fight as a martial artist,</v>

1730
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:27.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1731
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>A smart martial artists would be able to figure out way out of the situation</v>

1732
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.420
<v Speaker 2>long before it ever escalated.</v>

1733
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Most likely,</v>

1734
00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.370
<v Speaker 2>unless you're just in the worst case scenario with the worst aggressive drunks</v>

1735
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:38.740
<v Speaker 2>and dangerous people and you've got to defend yourself.</v>

1736
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:39.821
<v Speaker 2>Two things.</v>

1737
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:40.121
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1738
00:47:40.121 --> 00:47:43.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm slightly obsessed with Ronda Rousey and I follow her and slightly every time</v>

1739
00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:44.261
<v Speaker 2>I see you,</v>

1740
00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:44.561
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1741
00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I got to be right because she is like,</v>

1742
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.920
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm pretty tough girl,</v>

1743
00:47:47.921 --> 00:47:49.060
<v Speaker 2>but like she takes it to a hold of,</v>

1744
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:50.560
<v Speaker 2>she'll make you uncomfortable.</v>

1745
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:51.371
<v Speaker 2>She's so cool,</v>

1746
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:53.230
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like we'll be best friends anyway.</v>

1747
00:47:53.231 --> 00:47:54.220
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a bit about her.</v>

1748
00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Did you look it up?</v>

1749
00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.320
<v Speaker 2>How about the next time you come on I'll bring Rhonda.</v>

1750
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I really want that because I have so many things to tell her.</v>

1751
00:48:02.081 --> 00:48:02.914
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1752
00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:05.990
<v Speaker 2>I think she's really pretty and I follow Instagram and I'm really excited that</v>

1753
00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:07.213
<v Speaker 2>careers,</v>

1754
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.983
<v Speaker 2>the back of your hair,</v>

1755
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 2>you will never see a fight or get taken down quicker than if she tried to kiss</v>

1756
00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:13.480
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1757
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 2>you would take her down on the rousing.</v>

1758
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:16.654
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm saying,</v>

1759
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:17.760
<v Speaker 2>she know.</v>

1760
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Why would she kiss me just to fucking dominate,</v>

1761
00:48:20.141 --> 00:48:20.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1762
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.640
<v Speaker 2>just to go Alfon you know you're a really strong chick and think it works that</v>

1763
00:48:23.641 --> 00:48:26.590
<v Speaker 2>way for women gets bigger right here.</v>

1764
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh my fucking God.</v>

1765
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Long Gates like</v>

1766
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.790
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to listen to it anyway.</v>

1767
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.160
<v Speaker 2>The guy from fear factor.</v>

1768
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I love that show.</v>

1769
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:37.511
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that?</v>

1770
00:48:37.511 --> 00:48:40.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean is the female Hyena actually fake penis?</v>

1771
00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:42.350
<v Speaker 2>They have a pho penis,</v>

1772
00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.510
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it all start as a vagina and then it grows into a vignette like China.</v>

1773
00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.520
<v Speaker 2>The wrestler has like a giant sort of,</v>

1774
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:50.200
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying is very similar.</v>

1775
00:48:50.201 --> 00:48:52.670
<v Speaker 2>We all what it is is we all start out as females.</v>

1776
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Human beings do it.</v>

1777
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1778
00:48:54.161 --> 00:48:55.180
<v Speaker 2>That's why men have nipples.</v>

1779
00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1780
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:57.623
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1781
00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:58.623
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1782
00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:02.410
<v Speaker 2>I had another point before we start talking about eight clutter clutter.</v>

1783
00:49:02.411 --> 00:49:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I were talking about hyenas.</v>

1784
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.780
<v Speaker 2>No we were not.</v>

1785
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.500
<v Speaker 2>You were talking about drowsy.</v>

1786
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:08.943
<v Speaker 2>You made it weird.</v>

1787
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Won't say Rhonda would grow at giant fake dig if she's around you just to</v>

1788
00:49:12.081 --> 00:49:12.820
<v Speaker 2>dominate you.</v>

1789
00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1790
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.420
<v Speaker 2>I just want to meet her cause I think we'd be like best friends and I just want</v>

1791
00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 2>to like maybe like train with her one day but not have anyone touch me at the</v>

1792
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:20.170
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>

1793
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.190
<v Speaker 2>But she would show you some moves.</v>

1794
00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:22.330
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't roll with her.</v>

1795
00:49:22.331 --> 00:49:23.290
<v Speaker 2>But she moves.</v>

1796
00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:25.380
<v Speaker 2>She's so cool.</v>

1797
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm glad you love her.</v>

1798
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1799
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.250
<v Speaker 2>she's a really unique person.</v>

1800
00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like Dana White and I were having this conversation once and he was like,</v>

1801
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.690
<v Speaker 2>she's just a once in a lifetime person.</v>

1802
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1803
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:35.921
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1804
00:49:35.921 --> 00:49:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I go more than that.</v>

1805
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:37.361
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1806
00:49:37.361 --> 00:49:38.530
<v Speaker 2>she's a once ever.</v>

1807
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.951
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1808
00:49:38.951 --> 00:49:41.320
<v Speaker 2>there's never would think about how many lifetimes people have lived.</v>

1809
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.570
<v Speaker 2>What's the other Ronda Rousey's you can bring it up.</v>

1810
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.170
<v Speaker 2>So if I were a girl that if I were a fire,</v>

1811
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:48.720
<v Speaker 2>if I did like ultimate fighting like her,</v>

1812
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 2>I would be scared shitless.</v>

1813
00:49:50.201 --> 00:49:51.730
<v Speaker 2>She just dominates consistently.</v>

1814
00:49:51.731 --> 00:49:52.900
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't lose.</v>

1815
00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:56.860
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at a picture on her Instagram and it's who she fighting a fight</v>

1816
00:49:56.861 --> 00:49:58.540
<v Speaker 2>coming up in like in May and let us Davis.</v>

1817
00:49:58.650 --> 00:49:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1818
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 2>and like the picture like Rhonda,</v>

1819
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:02.830
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's like she's a star now and she's got like a makeup team and her,</v>

1820
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.960
<v Speaker 2>she's got her heavyweight belt and her hair is done.</v>

1821
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.630
<v Speaker 2>The other girls didn't like a sports bra from like a big five,</v>

1822
00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.170
<v Speaker 2>like no team around her,</v>

1823
00:50:11.171 --> 00:50:12.004
<v Speaker 2>no lighting.</v>

1824
00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:13.720
<v Speaker 2>She does have a theme.</v>

1825
00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Davis is a very talented fighter.</v>

1826
00:50:15.341 --> 00:50:16.151
<v Speaker 2>She's really good.</v>

1827
00:50:16.151 --> 00:50:16.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a good fight.</v>

1828
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:17.773
<v Speaker 2>I beat my Rhonda.</v>

1829
00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I liked to fight though because Davis has a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</v>

1830
00:50:21.041 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 2>She's got real good Moy Tai,</v>

1831
00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.290
<v Speaker 2>great leg kicks.</v>

1832
00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.620
<v Speaker 2>She's very technically sound,</v>

1833
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:25.463
<v Speaker 2>say all of us,</v>

1834
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.980
<v Speaker 2>but Rhonda has just,</v>

1835
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.640
<v Speaker 2>she's such a fucking beast.</v>

1836
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.270
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

1837
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:32.240
<v Speaker 2>she's a weird combination because she's absolutely beautiful,</v>

1838
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:33.350
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>

1839
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.590
<v Speaker 2>she's just so fucking physically dominant,</v>

1840
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:36.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1841
00:50:36.891 --> 00:50:40.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not just pretty but with great technique and you know,</v>

1842
00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 2>wins but looks like a girl.</v>

1843
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Like she's got this weird thing going on where she like crosses back and forth</v>

1844
00:50:45.981 --> 00:50:46.814
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>

00:50:58.550 --> 00:50:59.450
<v Speaker 2>she's able to do it.</v>

1853
00:50:59.500 --> 00:50:59.870
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

1854
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:00.250

1858
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:08.240
<v Speaker 2>she also owns who she is and she owns it.</v>

1859
00:51:08.241 --> 00:51:08.481
<v Speaker 2>Hook,</v>

1860
00:51:08.481 --> 00:51:09.320
<v Speaker 2>line and sinker.</v>

00:51:19.131 --> 00:51:21.440

1870
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:25.940
<v Speaker 2>She's been given the blessing of getting to be herself in her career so early on</v>

1871
00:51:25.941 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 2>versus trying to be something else.</v>

1872
00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:28.141
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1873

00:51:29.841 --> 00:51:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Her mother was one of the very first medalists in,</v>

1875
00:51:32.481 --> 00:51:32.910

<v Speaker 2>in judo and she was a world championship level judo player.</v>

1877
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Her mom was exactly the same.</v>

1878
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:40.603
<v Speaker 2>Her family,</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's good.</v>

1921
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:32.090
<v Speaker 2>She probably is.</v>

1922
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 2>She's probably one of those that's like everything she like bake a pie wall.</v>

1923
00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:41.030
<v Speaker 2>Don't style opening the door.</v>

1924
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:42.303
<v Speaker 2>Oven door.</v>

1925
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if she got on stage and fucking kill that would really</v>

1926
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:46.101
<v Speaker 2>devastate,</v>

1927
00:52:46.101 --> 00:52:46.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1928
00:52:46.881 --> 00:52:48.110
<v Speaker 2>just one home and write jokes?</v>

1929
00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1930
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.880
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1931
00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I would know because I would,</v>

1932
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:51.703
<v Speaker 2>I would just be like,</v>

1933
00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I would solidify my desire to be best friends with her.</v>

1934
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.440
<v Speaker 2>If you were on an island together,</v>

1935
00:52:57.441 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 2>do you think you'd go lesbian with her?</v>

1936
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.820
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1937
00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.653
<v Speaker 2>She would eat me,</v>

1938
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.473
<v Speaker 2>eat my face,</v>

1939
00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.150
<v Speaker 2>and she would pick my teeth with her arms.</v>

1940
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.640
<v Speaker 2>What if you were like a,</v>

1941
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:06.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1942
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:08.660
<v Speaker 2>an island with a lot of good food?</v>

1943
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.040
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fish.</v>

1944
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:10.341
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1945
00:53:10.341 --> 00:53:10.941
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a dude,</v>

1946
00:53:10.941 --> 00:53:14.120
<v Speaker 2>so my desire to fuck is not as intense as a man's.</v>

1947
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:14.901
<v Speaker 2>My thing would be like,</v>

1948
00:53:14.901 --> 00:53:17.600
<v Speaker 2>I need to stay alive and eat versus like,</v>

1949
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.751
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1950
00:53:17.751 --> 00:53:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I got to fuck someone.</v>

1951
00:53:18.951 --> 00:53:19.310
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1952
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:20.180
<v Speaker 2>other woman,</v>

1953
00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.140
<v Speaker 2>let's do it now.</v>

1954
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.313
<v Speaker 2>I would not.</v>

1955
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.600
<v Speaker 2>But you would like to opinion ship.</v>

1956
00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>At least I think the</v>

1957
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 1>desire would become an family.</v>

1958
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:28.793
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1959
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.720
<v Speaker 1>but the desire to like be touched.</v>

1960
00:53:30.721 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 1>It's very universal,</v>

1961
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:32.723
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1962
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:33.840
<v Speaker 1>It's so universal.</v>

1963
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 1>I definitely,</v>

1964
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:36.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1965
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:37.220
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1966
00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:37.650
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1967
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about it this weekend.</v>

1968
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I definitely made someone give me a back rub quite in backrub.</v>

1969
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.380
<v Speaker 1>It will also just a hug.</v>

1970
00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Just someone giving you a hug if you haven't been hugged in a while.</v>

1971
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.860
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1972
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 1>to the guys listening,</v>

1973
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 1>don't hug girls that don't want to be hugged.</v>

1974
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1975
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:50.821
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

1976
00:53:50.821 --> 00:53:51.440
<v Speaker 1>That's creepy.</v>

1977
00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1978
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1979
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.510
<v Speaker 1>especially girls because a guy hugging a girl,</v>

1980
00:53:54.511 --> 00:53:55.344
<v Speaker 1>it's such an,</v>

1981
00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:59.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a risky scenario for the girl on,</v>

1982
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.451
<v Speaker 1>well not always,</v>

1983
00:54:00.451 --> 00:54:01.560
<v Speaker 1>but the pot,</v>

1984
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:05.580
<v Speaker 1>the potential is there and it's just a risky scenario that you're going to let</v>

1985
00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:07.500
<v Speaker 1>this guy hold your body.</v>

1986
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.150
<v Speaker 1>And then also it's like,</v>

1987
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 1>then it escalates with a lot of people.</v>

1988
00:54:11.461 --> 00:54:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Then it moves to like creepier and creepier and creepier is,</v>

1989

1996
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:21.360

2007
00:54:34.951 --> 00:54:35.371
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but like just cause I did one show with you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>ugh.</v>

2016
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.360
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't want to hug you.</v>

2017
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:48.450
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't want to get a physical connection with you fucking I don't,</v>

2018
00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.373
<v Speaker 3>I don't know you.</v>

2019
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.050
<v Speaker 3>My thing is after shows and this is always wearing me out.</v>

2020
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:53.281
<v Speaker 3>I've had definitely,</v>

2021
00:54:53.281 --> 00:54:55.350
<v Speaker 3>I've got all kinds of fans,</v>

2022
00:54:55.351 --> 00:54:56.131
<v Speaker 3>a lot of creepy ones,</v>

2023
00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:56.791
<v Speaker 3>a lot of lonely ones.</v>

2024
00:54:56.791 --> 00:54:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's super cool.</v>

2025
00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:02.100
<v Speaker 3>I've never had an issue with a male fan being aggressive even if they're like</v>

2026
00:55:02.101 --> 00:55:02.934
<v Speaker 3>wasted.</v>

2027
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.810
<v Speaker 3>But I've definitely had girls that get out of control like Lesbos style.</v>

2028
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.291
<v Speaker 3>Like I had a girl,</v>

2029
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:08.400
<v Speaker 3>she kept kissing my face.</v>

2030
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:12.150
<v Speaker 3>Like she kept kissing my cheek and like a security guide intervene.</v>

2031
00:55:12.151 --> 00:55:16.110
<v Speaker 3>Like I could definitely take care of myself cause she wasn't Ronda Rousey but</v>

2032
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.770
<v Speaker 3>it's always weird like girls step over that line more than guys do but they</v>

2033
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:20.700
<v Speaker 3>definitely like touch you.</v>

2034
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:23.370
<v Speaker 3>We're like on your side and they want to see like are you fat under that t</v>

2035
00:55:23.371 --> 00:55:23.701
<v Speaker 3>shirt?</v>

2036
00:55:23.701 --> 00:55:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Like girls do that guys,</v>

2037
00:55:24.751 --> 00:55:25.584
<v Speaker 3>you had to like there's,</v>

2038
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.640
<v Speaker 3>when you take a picture,</v>

2039
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:29.700
<v Speaker 3>they put their arm around your waist and I'm just like hyper aware of the fact</v>

2040
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:33.510
<v Speaker 3>that there is a very thin fabric separating like my naked body from this guy's</v>

2041
00:55:33.511 --> 00:55:35.940
<v Speaker 3>hand and you're wondering when is he going to go back and be like,</v>

2042
00:55:35.941 --> 00:55:36.181
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2043
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:37.530
<v Speaker 3>she wasn't as fit as I thought.</v>

2044
00:55:37.531 --> 00:55:38.910
<v Speaker 3>She'd be like,</v>

2045
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:41.280
<v Speaker 3>you just all these thoughts and meanwhile they're just drunk and like I gotta</v>

2046
00:55:41.281 --> 00:55:41.860
<v Speaker 3>get Outta here.</v>

2047
00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:42.550
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2048
00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:45.640
<v Speaker 1>but you attach all these things to it course touching my body.</v>

2049
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:46.900
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird thing where you,</v>

2050
00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:48.190
<v Speaker 1>where people hug girls.</v>

2051
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Like hugging a girl is like pretty standard.</v>

2052
00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:50.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2053
00:55:50.801 --> 00:55:52.090
<v Speaker 1>if you know a girl and you see her like,</v>

2054
00:55:52.091 --> 00:55:52.271
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2055
00:55:52.271 --> 00:55:52.571
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

2056
00:55:52.571 --> 00:55:53.020
<v Speaker 1>You hugging it.</v>

2057
00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like if as a dude that I knew the same amount,</v>

2058
00:55:55.871 --> 00:55:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't shake his hand,</v>

2059
00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:59.440
<v Speaker 1>but you'd hug like you're a good guy friends.</v>

2060
00:55:59.441 --> 00:55:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2061
00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2062
00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I have all my friends.</v>

2063
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:02.583
<v Speaker 1>I hugged every life.</v>

2064
00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:03.550
<v Speaker 1>If I see Joey Diaz,</v>

2065
00:56:03.551 --> 00:56:03.911
<v Speaker 1>I hug him.</v>

2066
00:56:03.911 --> 00:56:04.744
<v Speaker 1>Every time I see him</v>

2067
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:05.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2068
00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:06.910
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain line you cross.</v>

2069
00:56:06.911 --> 00:56:08.140
<v Speaker 3>And then once you become huggers,</v>

2070
00:56:08.141 --> 00:56:09.240
<v Speaker 3>you must maintain hugging.</v>

2071
00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:09.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2072
00:56:09.611 --> 00:56:10.450
<v Speaker 3>You can't like hug,</v>

2073
00:56:10.451 --> 00:56:10.721
<v Speaker 3>hug,</v>

2074
00:56:10.721 --> 00:56:11.021
<v Speaker 3>hug.</v>

2075
00:56:11.021 --> 00:56:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2076
00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:13.240
<v Speaker 3>nice to meet you and shake your hand or nice to see.</v>

2077
00:56:13.241 --> 00:56:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2078
00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big hugger with some of my,</v>

2079
00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:19.060
<v Speaker 3>most with my closest girlfriends we don't hug cause we're just not like that.</v>

2080
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:22.330
<v Speaker 3>I tend to hug girls that I know less because it lets them know like look,</v>

2081
00:56:22.331 --> 00:56:22.661
<v Speaker 3>I'm a girl.</v>

2082
00:56:22.661 --> 00:56:23.940
<v Speaker 3>Like right.</v>

2083
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:24.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2084
00:56:24.851 --> 00:56:25.511
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean.</v>

2085
00:56:25.511 --> 00:56:26.021
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean.</v>

2086
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:31.021
<v Speaker 2>Like you're almost like like throwing up a flag of peace and friendship and it's</v>

2087
00:56:32.111 --> 00:56:33.190
<v Speaker 2>also a good way like,</v>

2088
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:33.581
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2089
00:56:33.581 --> 00:56:35.380
<v Speaker 2>to break the ice after if you go to like a party,</v>

2090
00:56:35.381 --> 00:56:36.460
<v Speaker 2>like it was nice meeting you.</v>

2091
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:36.761
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2092
00:56:36.761 --> 00:56:37.001
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2093
00:56:37.001 --> 00:56:37.834
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2094
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:39.430
<v Speaker 2>It's just a human thing to do.</v>

2095
00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Like to solidify that the,</v>

2096
00:56:40.961 --> 00:56:45.520
<v Speaker 2>it was a fun sort of like put a cap on it that it was a good interaction.</v>

2097
00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 2>But I've definitely done like this weird autism thing where like all hug,</v>

2098
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 2>like three of the four people in the forest one just be like,</v>

2099
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.351
<v Speaker 2>I do that too.</v>

2100
00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:55.420
<v Speaker 2>If I don't know the other person where sometimes they'll go,</v>

00:56:56.231 --> 00:56:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Let's all hug group hug.</v>

2104
00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.081
<v Speaker 2>Really what I'm,</v>

2105
00:56:59.081 --> 00:56:59.950

2106
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:00.850

2108
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:02.591
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2109
00:57:02.591 --> 00:57:04.240
<v Speaker 2>So what did that one person,</v>

2110
00:57:04.241 --> 00:57:05.021
<v Speaker 2>that shit will haunt them?</v>

2111
00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:06.370
<v Speaker 2>Like you stumbling on a joke,</v>

2112
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.060
<v Speaker 2>a fourth person that you didn't hug.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

2115
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to this thing.</v>

2116
00:57:11.211 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 2>It was a talk once that this guy was giving about,</v>

2117
00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:14.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2118
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.041
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2119
00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:18.490
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of different psychological disorders in one of them was a theory that</v>

2120
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.800
<v Speaker 2>they had had at one point in time about schizophrenia,</v>

2121
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia being,</v>

2122
00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.113
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2123
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 2>having something to do with smells.</v>

2124
00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:27.710
<v Speaker 2>And that will,</v>

2125
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:29.380
<v Speaker 2>that you give off certain,</v>

2126
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:33.880
<v Speaker 2>that it's a form for mono will issue that you give off a certain smell and then</v>

2127
00:57:33.881 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 2>people respond to that smell and they go,</v>

2128
00:57:36.671 --> 00:57:36.821
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2129
00:57:36.821 --> 00:57:37.720
<v Speaker 2>this guy's weird.</v>

2130
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:38.680
<v Speaker 2>And then you go,</v>

2131
00:57:38.681 --> 00:57:39.101
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2132
00:57:39.101 --> 00:57:40.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking weird.</v>

2133
00:57:40.091 --> 00:57:43.180
<v Speaker 2>And then it starts this chain reaction that makes you weird,</v>

2134
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:47.170
<v Speaker 2>that makes you yourself pheromones upset someone else.</v>

2135
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2136
00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Because you're,</v>

2137
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:52.690
<v Speaker 2>your reality becomes defined by people avoiding you and freaking out by you and</v>

2138
00:57:52.691 --> 00:57:54.120
<v Speaker 2>you can get kind of crazy because of that.</v>

2139
00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.600
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like you need to be sensitive,</v>

2140
00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.250
<v Speaker 2>right people and even be more secure in who they are.</v>

2141
00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:58.091
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2142
00:57:58.091 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 2>look at you.</v>

2143
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:59.583
<v Speaker 2>Fucking take that.</v>

2144
00:57:59.830 --> 00:57:59.981
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2145
00:57:59.981 --> 00:58:00.460
<v Speaker 2>we all,</v>

2146
00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.920
<v Speaker 2>we all start from different places.</v>

2147
00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Allows us this last year some people had shitty homes without organized parents</v>

2148
00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:05.734
<v Speaker 2>like you.</v>

2149
00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I fair enough.</v>

2150
00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I think the schizophrenia,</v>

2151
00:58:08.111 --> 00:58:09.700
<v Speaker 2>I think the pheromone thing is huge.</v>

2152
00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:10.871
<v Speaker 2>I have dated,</v>

2153
00:58:10.871 --> 00:58:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I remember dating someone,</v>

2154
00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 2>we didn't really have anything in common,</v>

2155
00:58:13.841 --> 00:58:18.841
<v Speaker 2>but we couldn't stop smelling each other well went to a bar and I just buried my</v>

2156
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:21.160
<v Speaker 2>face in his neck and I just like,</v>

2157
00:58:21.161 --> 00:58:21.701
<v Speaker 2>I can't stop.</v>

2158
00:58:21.701 --> 00:58:22.480
<v Speaker 2>There was something,</v>

2159
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.670
<v Speaker 2>some people just smell like home for some reason.</v>

2160
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.841
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily your home,</v>

2161
00:58:25.841 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 2>but like you get a very comfortable feeling.</v>

2162
00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:30.160
<v Speaker 2>He's turned out to be a nightmare.</v>

2163
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:32.770
<v Speaker 2>But on a fairly low level.</v>

2164
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:35.290
<v Speaker 2>It was so he was a nightmare.</v>

2165
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 2>A nightmare psychologically.</v>

2166
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:38.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

2167
00:58:38.021 --> 00:58:39.400
<v Speaker 2>we just didn't work out and that's fine.</v>

2168
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 2>But I remember just sitting there and I was just like,</v>

2169
00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I cannot stop doing this.</v>

2170
00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Was He the nightmare where you uh,</v>

2171
00:58:45.071 --> 00:58:45.851
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about off the air.</v>

2172
00:58:45.851 --> 00:58:46.684
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely,</v>

2173
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.740
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely not me.</v>

2174
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say what it was because I wasn't listening to happens to know</v>

2175
00:58:50.381 --> 00:58:50.830
<v Speaker 2>when we'll be like,</v>

2176
00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2177
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.660
<v Speaker 2>but it was right,</v>

2178
00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:52.860
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2179
00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2180
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:55.480
<v Speaker 2>I will share with you a story if you want to hear these please,</v>

2181
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.940
<v Speaker 2>because this is really everything.</v>

2182
00:58:56.950 --> 00:59:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And I shared this for the first time in Tampa this weekend and I hadn't told the</v>

2183
00:59:00.201 --> 00:59:01.450
<v Speaker 2>to scoot on up to the microphone,</v>

2184
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:02.323
<v Speaker 2>let us know.</v>

2185
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:03.873
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2186
00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:05.261
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2187
00:59:05.261 --> 00:59:06.700
<v Speaker 2>this is just a crazy night wearing the headphones.</v>

2188
00:59:06.701 --> 00:59:07.690
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm letting people know,</v>

2189
00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:08.524
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

2190
00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:09.670
<v Speaker 2>when you move away,</v>

2191
00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:11.350
<v Speaker 2>left into the right of these things,</v>

2192
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:12.550
<v Speaker 2>it changes the volume.</v>

2193
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it really matters if you put it left or right?</v>

2194
00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:15.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2195
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:15.933
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't matter.</v>

2196
00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:20.050
<v Speaker 2>But if we look at for blanche that was looking for the volume,</v>

2197
00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:20.900
<v Speaker 2>it's up here.</v>

2198
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:21.320

2205
00:59:26.901 --> 00:59:27.320

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2210
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:32.323
<v Speaker 2>Jimi Hendrix.</v>

2211
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't eat looking at the Predator thing.</v>

2212
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I had a sandwich or won't be able to look at that and eat.</v>

2213
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:38.263
<v Speaker 2>It grosses me out.</v>

2214
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:39.590
<v Speaker 2>It's just a mask.</v>

2215
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Halloween costumes grossed me out like the smell of latex and like that's</v>

2216
00:59:43.101 --> 00:59:43.940
<v Speaker 2>actually hard.</v>

2217
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:44.631
<v Speaker 2>That's like a,</v>

2218
00:59:44.631 --> 00:59:46.820
<v Speaker 2>a model that was made by special effects guy.</v>

2219
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.650
<v Speaker 2>It was looking at it cause he's so scary.</v>

2220
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:50.330
<v Speaker 2>But like that thing couldn't eat you.</v>

2221
00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2222
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:53.200
<v Speaker 2>you sure it could look a small mouth,</v>

2223
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:54.063
<v Speaker 2>it would rip you apart.</v>

2224
00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Small mouth.</v>

2225
00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:54.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2226
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:56.000
<v Speaker 2>But it would chew chunks of you.</v>

2227
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

2228
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:59.210
<v Speaker 2>and those other things act as teeth to just pull some meat off.</v>

2229
00:59:59.211 --> 00:59:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2230
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.690
<v Speaker 2>But it depends on how it can articulate and just trying to make them human.</v>

2231
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I think he would appreciate that.</v>

2232
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2233
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:05.991
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2234
01:00:05.991 --> 01:00:06.591
<v Speaker 2>So here's my story.</v>

2235
01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:07.424
<v Speaker 2>I hear please.</v>

2236
01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.190
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about relationship the beginning.</v>

2237
01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.960
<v Speaker 3>So I went through a breakup like a month and a half ago,</v>

2238
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.830
<v Speaker 3>maybe two months ago.</v>

2239
01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.640
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you'll have you of all people will appreciate this story and I'll</v>

2240
01:00:18.641 --> 01:00:19.750
<v Speaker 3>give you the abridged version.</v>

2241
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2242
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.730
<v Speaker 3>give me the juicy details.</v>

2243
01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:24.670
<v Speaker 3>So basically I met this guy a year,</v>

2244
01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:25.630
<v Speaker 3>two years,</v>

2245
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:26.351
<v Speaker 3>not this thanksgiving,</v>

2246
01:00:26.351 --> 01:00:28.210
<v Speaker 3>the last one on the plane.</v>

2247
01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:33.660
<v Speaker 3>And we hit it off and he told me his name and he said he went to Yale and he</v>

2248
01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:36.430
<v Speaker 3>worked in,</v>

2249
01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:36.761
<v Speaker 3>we'll say,</v>

2250
01:00:36.761 --> 01:00:37.690
<v Speaker 3>well he worked in finances,</v>

2251
01:00:37.691 --> 01:00:38.524
<v Speaker 3>we'll just leave it at that.</v>

2252
01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:40.180
<v Speaker 3>And so I knew him for a year,</v>

2253
01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.590
<v Speaker 3>never wanted to date him.</v>

2254
01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.840
<v Speaker 3>And eventually we dated,</v>

2255
01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:47.560
<v Speaker 3>we dated for for three months and during the time we were dating,</v>

2256
01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:48.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2257
01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:49.660
<v Speaker 3>before we'd started dating,</v>

2258
01:00:49.661 --> 01:00:52.510
<v Speaker 3>he told me he bought a house and I never wanted to see the house because I</v>

2259
01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.281
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2260
01:00:53.281 --> 01:00:53.891
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't dating him,</v>

2261
01:00:53.891 --> 01:00:54.724
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care.</v>

2262
01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:56.770
<v Speaker 3>So we start dating and the whole time we're dating,</v>

2263
01:00:56.771 --> 01:00:58.150
<v Speaker 3>things start getting weird.</v>

2264
01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Like we get along perfectly.</v>

2265
01:01:00.581 --> 01:01:03.970
<v Speaker 3>But there are certain aspects of his personal life that are like not checking</v>

2266
01:01:03.971 --> 01:01:04.804
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2267
01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Like I told my mom,</v>

2268
01:01:07.151 --> 01:01:07.481
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2269
01:01:07.481 --> 01:01:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh hey,</v>

2270
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:09.430
<v Speaker 3>this is his name and this is where he works.</v>

2271
01:01:09.431 --> 01:01:11.320
<v Speaker 3>So she googled him because that's what moms do,</v>

2272
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:11.890
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2273
01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:15.490
<v Speaker 3>And his work bio says that he graduated from uh,</v>

2274
01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.050
<v Speaker 3>from a different college,</v>

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:20.501
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2280
01:01:20.501 --> 01:01:21.101
<v Speaker 3>why does it say that?</v>

2281
01:01:21.101 --> 01:01:21.341
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2282
01:01:21.341 --> 01:01:22.174
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2283
01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.100
<v Speaker 3>they've cut and pasted the wrong bio.</v>

2284
01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:24.701
<v Speaker 3>It's a mess up.</v>

2285
01:01:24.701 --> 01:01:25.491
<v Speaker 3>My company's a mess.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I get wrong buyers all the time.</v>

2288
01:01:27.371 --> 01:01:28.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I totally get it.</v>

2289
01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:28.931
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2290
01:01:28.931 --> 01:01:29.890
<v Speaker 3>I want to send you a present,</v>

2291
01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:30.880
<v Speaker 3>what's your address?</v>

2292
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.570
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2293
01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:32.590
<v Speaker 3>oh just send it to my work.</v>

2294
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:33.461
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2295
01:01:33.461 --> 01:01:33.611
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2296
01:01:33.611 --> 01:01:34.600
<v Speaker 3>I want to send it to your house.</v>

2297
01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.220
<v Speaker 3>So he gives me this address.</v>

2298
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:37.930
<v Speaker 3>So I sent him a gift and he gets it.</v>

2299
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:40.780
<v Speaker 3>And then one day I'm out with my friend Laura and we're at lunch and we start to</v>

2300
01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:44.980
<v Speaker 3>build a case about why we think this guy is a liar as a joke at first cause</v>

2301
01:01:44.981 --> 01:01:45.820
<v Speaker 3>nothing's checking out.</v>

2302
01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:46.661
<v Speaker 3>So Laura's like,</v>

2303
01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:47.680
<v Speaker 3>let's drive by his house.</v>

2304
01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.620
<v Speaker 3>And I remember what the house looked like from the picture he'd sent me,</v>

2305
01:01:50.621 --> 01:01:52.360
<v Speaker 3>cause like six months before we were dating,</v>

2306
01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:52.841

2307
01:01:52.841 --> 01:01:53.860
<v Speaker 3>check out this house that I bought.</v>

2308
01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.990
<v Speaker 3>So I go to the house and it's not a house,</v>

2309
01:01:55.991 --> 01:01:56.824
<v Speaker 3>it's an apartment.</v>

2310
01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:00.700
<v Speaker 3>And Laura goes up to the door and she's like looking in and all of a sudden the</v>

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I met them on once and every single time after I met her once,</v>

2377
01:03:07.331 --> 01:03:10.300
<v Speaker 3>like the first week we started dating and every time after that I'd be like,</v>

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:10.900
<v Speaker 3>let me take,</v>

2379

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:12.371
<v Speaker 3>I've got free time.</v>

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Could never make it happen.</v>

2387
01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to brunch with your mom.</v>

2388
01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:19.391
<v Speaker 3>Let me do something.</v>

2389
01:03:19.391 --> 01:03:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Let me take her somewhere.</v>

2390
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:20.521
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2391
01:03:20.521 --> 01:03:21.450
<v Speaker 2>When you met the mom,</v>

2392
01:03:21.451 --> 01:03:23.730
<v Speaker 2>did her illness ever come up in conversation?</v>

2393
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:23.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2394
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:25.590
<v Speaker 2>because I thought that would be tactless for me to be like,</v>

2395
01:03:25.591 --> 01:03:26.250
<v Speaker 2>how's your cancer?</v>

2396
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:26.431
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2397
01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:27.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean if she brought it up,</v>

2398
01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 2>never brought her up,</v>

2399
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2400
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:29.641
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2401
01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:30.300
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2402
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.530
<v Speaker 2>They came with me to the craft store.</v>

2403
01:03:31.531 --> 01:03:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I had to buy stuff for Christmas party.</v>

2404
01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2405
01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:34.653
<v Speaker 3>we didn't say much,</v>

2406
01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:35.890
<v Speaker 3>but I never,</v>

2407
01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:37.390
<v Speaker 3>so weeks are going by and I'm like,</v>

2408
01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.411
<v Speaker 3>I just want to hang out.</v>

2409
01:03:38.411 --> 01:03:39.430
<v Speaker 3>Like if you love me.</v>

2410
01:03:39.431 --> 01:03:40.960
<v Speaker 3>And he always talked about getting married,</v>

2411
01:03:40.961 --> 01:03:41.351
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2412
01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:41.501
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2413
01:03:41.501 --> 01:03:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I should probably meet this woman more than once.</v>

2414
01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.460
<v Speaker 3>So he gives me,</v>

2415
01:03:45.461 --> 01:03:46.630

<v Speaker 3>none of my friends that went to Yale know who he is and every time I ask him</v>

2509
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:46.241
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

2510
01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:47.500
<v Speaker 3>like the answer is super simple.</v>

2511
01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:48.311
<v Speaker 3>Like if I asked you where you live,</v>

2512
01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:49.810
<v Speaker 3>you just tell me to just roll off your tongue.</v>

2513
01:05:49.811 --> 01:05:52.390
<v Speaker 3>And that's everything was so I go to that house,</v>

2514
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.650
<v Speaker 3>like I let a couple of weeks go by,</v>

2515
01:05:53.651 --> 01:05:54.730

2517
01:05:55.331 --> 01:05:56.164
<v Speaker 3>my birthday,</v>

2518
01:05:56.610 --> 01:06:00.220
<v Speaker 3>and it's a day before I'm leaving for San Antonio to go play this comedy club.</v>

2519
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.820
<v Speaker 3>And I go to his house with my friend and it's not his house,</v>

2520
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.960
<v Speaker 3>it's like some other woman lives.</v>

2521
01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.040
<v Speaker 3>They're like an old woman lives there.</v>

2522
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:07.510
<v Speaker 3>It's not as mom's house.</v>

2523
01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:08.710
<v Speaker 3>And he sees like my mom,</v>

2524
01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.400
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2525
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.770
<v Speaker 3>my mom bought the house from me to keep my cash liquid.</v>

2526
01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:12.760
<v Speaker 3>The title's not in her name.</v>

2527
01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:13.871
<v Speaker 3>I call him.</v>

2528
01:06:13.871 --> 01:06:14.704
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2529
01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:19.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm walking out of your life because you're lying about something.</v>

2530
01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:22.330
<v Speaker 3>And it all came crashing down at 7:00 AM he texts me,</v>

2531
01:06:22.331 --> 01:06:23.080
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

2532
01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I never went to Yale.</v>

2533
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:25.180
<v Speaker 3>I never bought a house.</v>

2534
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:27.310
<v Speaker 3>I've been lying to you for over a year.</v>

2535
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.700
<v Speaker 3>And so it was just one of those.</v>

2536
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:34.990
<v Speaker 3>And then so you start going back and then you start wondering if you're crazy</v>

2537
01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:35.891
<v Speaker 3>and then you're like,</v>

2538
01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:38.110
<v Speaker 3>does your mom even if cancer did you,</v>

2539
01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.880
<v Speaker 3>are you really in this moment cancer?</v>

2540
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.500

2541
01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.700
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's really weird that I met her once and then like I was like,</v>

2542
01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 3>what's the name of the doctor at the hospital where she is?</v>

2543
01:06:47.951 --> 01:06:48.191
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2544
01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:49.024
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2545
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.370
<v Speaker 3>like very like wouldn't give any information.</v>

2546
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.233
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2547
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:54.850
<v Speaker 3>and so yesterday I wrote an email,</v>

2549
01:06:55.871 --> 01:06:56.920
<v Speaker 3>but this is very funny to me.</v>

2550
01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.091
<v Speaker 3>I wrote everybody,</v>

2551

<v Speaker 3>I hate you.</v>

2557
01:07:06.311 --> 01:07:09.400
<v Speaker 3>But like then there's like the dark shit that you don't write and I wrote an</v>

2558
01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:10.900
<v Speaker 3>email that I almost,</v>

2559
01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:11.381
<v Speaker 3>I won't do it,</v>

2560
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:15.490
<v Speaker 3>but I almost want to post online as like a template for any girl that ever wants</v>

2561
01:07:15.491 --> 01:07:17.290
<v Speaker 3>to like enrage her next boyfriend.</v>

2562
01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:20.170
<v Speaker 3>And I just lost my shit and it felt so good.</v>

2563
01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.131
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck.</v>

2564
01:07:21.131 --> 01:07:21.964
<v Speaker 3>Having tact.</v>

2565
01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Like it just was the best thing ever.</v>

2566
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Well it sounds like you gave him every possible every possible scenario for him</v>

2567
01:07:31.571 --> 01:07:32.770
<v Speaker 2>to be truthful.</v>

2568
01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Like you gave him every possible like well maybe he's this and maybe it's that</v>

2569
01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:40.660
<v Speaker 2>you gave a lot of leeway.</v>

2570
01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.700
<v Speaker 2>So much so and then every day I'd be like,</v>

2571
01:07:42.701 --> 01:07:43.211
<v Speaker 2>if you're lying,</v>

2572
01:07:43.211 --> 01:07:43.991
<v Speaker 2>please just tell me.</v>

2573
01:07:43.991 --> 01:07:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Or just tell anyone,</v>

2574
01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:45.790
<v Speaker 2>look me in the eye and be like,</v>

2575
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:46.624
<v Speaker 2>I'm not lying.</v>

2576
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Which makes me think if we ever got married,</v>

2577
01:07:48.821 --> 01:07:50.230
<v Speaker 2>we would go on a boat and he would kill me.</v>

2578
01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:51.580
<v Speaker 2>But the whole never know.</v>

2579
01:07:51.581 --> 01:07:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2580
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:53.470
<v Speaker 2>You never tell that shit happens.</v>

2581
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:57.610
<v Speaker 2>You find out he's got a life insurance policy on you and I accidentally signed</v>

2582
01:07:57.611 --> 01:07:57.880
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2583
01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Did you find out where he worked?</v>

2584
01:07:59.171 --> 01:08:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Did he actually have the job that he had?</v>

2585
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.620
<v Speaker 2>He had left the company and all of these things are weird.</v>

2586
01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:06.370
<v Speaker 2>Like he left the company and like a weird way and he started his own so that</v>

2587
01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:06.960
<v Speaker 2>like I just,</v>

2588
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.050
<v Speaker 3>it's at some point it's not up to you to piece together what's real and what</v>

2589
01:08:10.051 --> 01:08:10.710
<v Speaker 3>isn't.</v>

2590
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:13.230
<v Speaker 3>I told this story on the radio in Tampa and when I got off the air,</v>

2591
01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:15.770
<v Speaker 3>all of these people had sent me tweets with Yale</v>

2592
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:19.790
<v Speaker 2>and somebody sent me a picture of someone running the Boston marathon in a</v>

2593
01:08:19.791 --> 01:08:20.571
<v Speaker 2>yellow shirt and they're like,</v>

2594
01:08:20.571 --> 01:08:22.460
<v Speaker 2>is your ex boyfriend running the Boston marathon?</v>

2595
01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh that poor bastard.</v>

2596
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:28.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you don't say his name publicly shame him because the poor fuck is</v>

2597
01:08:28.101 --> 01:08:28.880
<v Speaker 2>already a mess.</v>

2598
01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.990
<v Speaker 2>I told him he's fucking lucky.</v>

2599
01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:30.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2600
01:08:30.261 --> 01:08:31.610
<v Speaker 2>you're I think on that show I did,</v>

2601
01:08:31.611 --> 01:08:32.240
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't.</v>

2602
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I've never say the last name.</v>

2603
01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Well he is lucky you could make them a part of your act with his actual name.</v>

2604
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.120
<v Speaker 2>It's so be a killer bit.</v>

2605
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:45.170
<v Speaker 2>If I could think of unrelatable the whole like the exact amount of lying and</v>

2606
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:49.710
<v Speaker 2>cheating thing saying I thought man you meant like as a bit right.</v>

2607
01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very relatable.</v>

2608
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:52.490
<v Speaker 2>I think I will get around to it.</v>

2609
01:08:52.491 --> 01:08:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I think eventually it'll stop.</v>

2610
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I'll stop being,</v>

2611
01:08:55.270 --> 01:08:56.240
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm not sad anymore,</v>

2612
01:08:56.241 --> 01:08:59.810
<v Speaker 2>but my email pretty much included cause like obviously,</v>

2613
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.120
<v Speaker 2>you know if you break up with someone you don't want to hear about people</v>

2614
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:02.954
<v Speaker 2>they're sleeping with.</v>

2615
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2616
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:06.410
<v Speaker 2>He got upset because I posted a picture when I was in Saint Martin of</v>

2617
01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:09.380
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] topless beach with two friends in front of me.</v>

2618
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:10.400
<v Speaker 2>So you can't see anything.</v>

2619
01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:11.211
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

2620
01:09:11.211 --> 01:09:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I felt that you posted that picture and it was directed at me,</v>

2621
01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:15.680
<v Speaker 2>which it wasn't like I posted like a hot picture.</v>

2622
01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.380
<v Speaker 2>And so I just unleashed on this email and I was like,</v>

2623
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:19.370
<v Speaker 2>it's none of your fucking business.</v>

2624
01:09:19.371 --> 01:09:19.881
<v Speaker 2>What I do.</v>

2625
01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:20.361
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

2626
01:09:20.361 --> 01:09:21.194
<v Speaker 2>when I was in Saint Martin,</v>

2627
01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I hooked up with a guy when he went down on me for 20 minutes and it was fucking</v>

2628
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:25.303
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

2629
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I will never talk to you.</v>

2630
01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2631
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:30.380
<v Speaker 2>That's dark.</v>

2632
01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.213
<v Speaker 2>It felt so good.</v>

2633
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:32.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2634
01:09:32.181 --> 01:09:33.260
<v Speaker 2>the act makes you cringe.</v>

2635
01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.420
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of not around.</v>

2636
01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:34.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2637
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:34.971
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2638
01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:35.181
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2639
01:09:35.181 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 2>The act doesn't make me cringe at all.</v>

2640
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Were you writing that email and say,</v>

2641
01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:40.780
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2642
01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:41.571
<v Speaker 2>I'm a guy and he went down.</v>

2643
01:09:41.571 --> 01:09:42.340
<v Speaker 2>He ate my pleasure.</v>

2644
01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I did not say that.</v>

2645
01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say anything.</v>

2646
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Same thing you said it.</v>

2647
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Here's the question though.</v>

2648
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.510
<v Speaker 2>At what point are you as a human being allowed to just unleash and be like,</v>

2649
01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:51.344
<v Speaker 2>that's it?</v>

2650
01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2651
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:52.963
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2652
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.631
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

2653
01:09:53.631 --> 01:09:55.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that guy's worth your effort,</v>

2654
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:56.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2655
01:09:56.181 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 1>making more tension with him.</v>

2656
01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:59.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

2657
01:09:59.211 --> 01:10:00.350
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy person.</v>

2658
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.450
<v Speaker 1>That guy's fabricating and existence.</v>

2659
01:10:02.451 --> 01:10:03.920
<v Speaker 1>He fabricated his education.</v>

2660
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:04.550
<v Speaker 1>He fabric.</v>

2661
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:07.010
<v Speaker 1>He may have fabricated his mother being sick.</v>

2662
01:10:07.011 --> 01:10:10.760
<v Speaker 1>He fabricated where he lived twice or three times.</v>

2663
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Three times.</v>

2664
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:12.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2666
01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:13.064
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

2667
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.710
<v Speaker 1>he's probably pathological.</v>

2668
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:16.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2669
01:10:16.221 --> 01:10:18.260
<v Speaker 1>there are people that just can't stop lying.</v>

2670
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:18.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2671
01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it before when,</v>

2672
01:10:20.781 --> 01:10:21.614
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2673
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:23.450
<v Speaker 1>you're living in Hollywood,</v>

2674
01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:23.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2675
01:10:23.751 --> 01:10:24.830
<v Speaker 1>if you live around here,</v>

2676
01:10:24.831 --> 01:10:25.130
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2677
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:26.480
<v Speaker 1>you'll meet people that are,</v>

2678
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:26.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2679
01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:30.050
<v Speaker 1>fake it til you make it type people that will tell you stories that just don't</v>

2680
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:30.980
<v Speaker 1>add up.</v>

2681
01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:34.010
<v Speaker 1>And in the old days you used to just have to kind of accept people at those</v>

2682
01:10:34.011 --> 01:10:34.844
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

2683
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:37.910
<v Speaker 1>But now your mom can just Google them and find out anything</v>

2684
01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:39.083
<v Speaker 2>she got on it.</v>

2685
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2686
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you're on and got on it.</v>

2687
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.331
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2688
01:10:42.331 --> 01:10:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Your mom's awesome.</v>

2689
01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Good for her.</v>

2690
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:44.783
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2691
01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.020
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this,</v>

2692
01:10:46.021 --> 01:10:46.561
<v Speaker 1>cause this is,</v>

2693
01:10:46.561 --> 01:10:47.394
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2694
01:10:47.970 --> 01:10:52.110
<v Speaker 1>this is the difference between a man and a woman because you could tell me that</v>

2695
01:10:52.111 --> 01:10:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you went to pierce college or you went to a high school and you dropped out when</v>

2696
01:10:56.611 --> 01:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>you were 16.</v>

2697
01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:58.700
<v Speaker 1>And if you're,</v>

2698
01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:00.060
<v Speaker 1>you and I like you,</v>

2699
01:11:00.061 --> 01:11:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't care at all.</v>

2700
01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:02.340
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean anything to me.</v>

2701
01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you're a nurse.</v>

2702
01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you're a doctor.</v>

2703
01:11:05.821 --> 01:11:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you're a brain surgeon or a girl who works in a clothing store.</v>

2704
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2705
01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:12.570
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter to me who would care if I do not care,</v>

2706
01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>do not care if</v>

2707
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:15.840
<v Speaker 2>someone's fun and nice to be around.</v>

2708
01:11:15.841 --> 01:11:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I do not care.</v>

2709
01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:17.550
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

2710
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:18.211
<v Speaker 2>I never have.</v>

2711
01:11:18.211 --> 01:11:19.044
<v Speaker 2>I never will.</v>

2712
01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2713
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:21.330
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's,</v>

2714
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.380
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2715
01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.960
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference between a man and a woman,</v>

2716
01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:29.040
<v Speaker 2>like women desire men to be successful.</v>

2717
01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2718
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.511
<v Speaker 2>And that's a whole,</v>

2719
01:11:30.511 --> 01:11:32.730
<v Speaker 2>that's an evolution thing and that's a protective thing.</v>

2720
01:11:32.731 --> 01:11:33.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2721
01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.313
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

2722
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I don't want to date like a homeless person.</v>

2723
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.943
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2724
01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 2>What killed nor does,</v>

2725
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:39.740
<v Speaker 2>nor do I.</v>

2726
01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2727
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2728
01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't want someone who can't feed themselves does,</v>

2729
01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:44.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2730
01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.033
<v Speaker 2>it's about quality.</v>

2731
01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.060
<v Speaker 2>What kills me is that those things genuinely don't matter.</v>

2732
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:50.550
<v Speaker 2>And he chose to judge me ahead of time,</v>

2733
01:11:50.551 --> 01:11:54.570
<v Speaker 2>or maybe he's got a chemical imbalance from the day I met him on the plane.</v>

2734
01:11:54.571 --> 01:11:55.404
<v Speaker 2>I went to Yale.</v>

2735
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with lying to a stranger or a pretty girl on a plane.</v>

2736
01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't care where there is something wrong with Kenya.</v>

2737
01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:00.930
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

2738
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:03.510
<v Speaker 2>there's no ramifications for lying to a stranger if you never see them again.</v>

2739
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2740
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:04.290
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2741
01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2742
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:05.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2743
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:06.630
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't bother me.</v>

2744
01:12:06.631 --> 01:12:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you own a house so it irks it.</v>

2745
01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:11.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a shame because you lied about two things.</v>

2746
01:12:11.041 --> 01:12:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's just too and you ruined a perfectly good relationship.</v>

2747
01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:16.050
<v Speaker 2>If it's just those two things in your insecure.</v>

2748
01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:17.251
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go to Harvard.</v>

2749
01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:18.061
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a road scholar.</v>

2750
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you went to Yale,</v>

2751
01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:20.730
<v Speaker 2>how long did you guys date for him?</v>

2752
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:23.310
<v Speaker 2>I knew him for over a year and we dated for about three months.</v>

2753
01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:27.480
<v Speaker 2>And what was it about his personality that was attractive to you?</v>

2754
01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Does a whizzer a unique thing you could define?</v>

2755
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:32.243
<v Speaker 2>Truthfully,</v>

2756
01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:34.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean as friends he was very smart.</v>

2757
01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:35.941
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

2758
01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:39.480
<v Speaker 2>for me intelligence is a huge thing and very in a little like funniest,</v>

2759
01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:40.230
<v Speaker 2>snobby way,</v>

2760
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:43.020
<v Speaker 2>like a little con and I kind of liked that and he's very smart,</v>

2761
01:12:43.021 --> 01:12:43.261
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2762
01:12:43.261 --> 01:12:44.070
<v Speaker 2>very smart,</v>

2763
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.851
<v Speaker 2>a little Dorky,</v>

2764
01:12:44.851 --> 01:12:45.684
<v Speaker 2>very smart.</v>

2765
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.490
<v Speaker 2>But when he,</v>

2766
01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:49.680
<v Speaker 2>when we were friends and when he called me and was like,</v>

2767
01:12:49.681 --> 01:12:52.950
<v Speaker 2>we can't go on this trip to the skull and bones thing because my mom has cancer.</v>

2768
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:54.241
<v Speaker 2>I got a chance.</v>

2769
01:12:54.241 --> 01:12:54.900
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be weird.</v>

2770
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if,</v>

2771
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I think only women will relate to this for the whole time we knew each other.</v>

2772
01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:00.600
<v Speaker 2>He put me on this pedestal,</v>

2773
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.891
<v Speaker 2>always asking,</v>

2774
01:13:01.891 --> 01:13:02.461
<v Speaker 2>can you please,</v>

2775
01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:03.211
<v Speaker 2>can we please date?</v>

2776
01:13:03.211 --> 01:13:03.841
<v Speaker 2>Can I have the kids?</v>

2777
01:13:03.841 --> 01:13:04.740
<v Speaker 2>Will you be my girlfriend?</v>

2778
01:13:04.741 --> 01:13:05.161
<v Speaker 2>And I were like,</v>

2779
01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:05.851
<v Speaker 2>we would hang out.</v>

2780
01:13:05.851 --> 01:13:06.301
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2781
01:13:06.301 --> 01:13:06.781
<v Speaker 2>stop it.</v>

2782
01:13:06.781 --> 01:13:07.614
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not into this.</v>

2783
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:10.530
<v Speaker 2>So no one wants to be on a pedestal because there's nothing for you to do.</v>

2784
01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:11.701
<v Speaker 2>His mom had cancer.</v>

2785
01:13:11.701 --> 01:13:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2786
01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:12.821
<v Speaker 2>I can take care of you.</v>

2787
01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:14.580
<v Speaker 2>And now like you've been nothing but sweet to me.</v>

2788
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Now let me take care of you.</v>

2789
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.640
<v Speaker 2>And in getting to take care of him,</v>

2790
01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:21.390
<v Speaker 2>I started to like him cause I had like an active role.</v>

2791
01:13:21.490 --> 01:13:22.650
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>

2792
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:24.870
<v Speaker 2>Um Wow.</v>

2793
01:13:24.871 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

2794
01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:25.831
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2795
01:13:25.831 --> 01:13:27.000
<v Speaker 2>those things didn't matter.</v>

2796
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:30.820
<v Speaker 2>So is that like the maternal instincts that you have is like the,</v>

2797
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:32.910
<v Speaker 2>the taking care of instincts,</v>

2798
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:33.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2799
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:36.180
<v Speaker 2>because some women have those instincts sort of built in those?</v>

2800
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:36.661
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2801
01:13:36.661 --> 01:13:38.160
<v Speaker 2>But I think it was also just,</v>

2802
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:42.510
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing for me to do to have an active role in our relationship as</v>

2803
01:13:42.511 --> 01:13:42.901
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

2804
01:13:42.901 --> 01:13:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Like he had a lot of money and a lot of time and he could do nice things like he</v>

2805
01:13:47.581 --> 01:13:47.940
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

2806
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.190
<v Speaker 2>did he really have a lot of money because they have a lot of money.</v>

2807
01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:51.001
<v Speaker 2>Well how's that possible?</v>

2808
01:13:51.001 --> 01:13:52.050
<v Speaker 2>He has a fucking roommate.</v>

2809
01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:53.401
<v Speaker 2>So the roommate,</v>

2810
01:13:53.401 --> 01:13:53.650
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2811
01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:54.720
<v Speaker 2>if the answer was he goes,</v>

2812
01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:56.160
<v Speaker 2>I have my lease was up in Santa Monica.</v>

2813
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:56.971
<v Speaker 2>I was going to buy a house.</v>

2814
01:13:56.971 --> 01:13:58.380
<v Speaker 2>But then I decided I thought it was going to move.</v>

2815
01:13:58.410 --> 01:13:58.920
<v Speaker 2>He goes again.</v>

2816
01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Then you and I started dating.</v>

2817
01:13:59.791 --> 01:14:00.570
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to move.</v>

2818
01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I moved in with a friend to help her pay her rent cause he's never home and he's</v>

2819
01:14:04.081 --> 01:14:04.171
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2820
01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:07.410
<v Speaker 2>so I just leave my stuff there but how can you even trust that I couldn't,</v>

2821
01:14:07.411 --> 01:14:11.220
<v Speaker 2>he did send me a picture of his bank account to like why he was a human being.</v>

2822
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:12.011
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

2823
01:14:12.011 --> 01:14:12.844
<v Speaker 2>I didn't ask for it.</v>

2824
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:14.530
<v Speaker 2>He sent you the numbers in his bag.</v>

2825
01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.270
<v Speaker 2>He sent me like a screen grab of it.</v>

2826
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.410
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker doctored his bank account,</v>

2827
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Photoshop the shit out of his bank account.</v>

2828
01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2829
01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:21.391
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2830
01:14:21.391 --> 01:14:21.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2831
01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.500
<v Speaker 2>I saw the way he lived in the way he,</v>

2832
01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean I do think the money thing is real.</v>

2833
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:26.921
<v Speaker 2>We did,</v>

2834
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:27.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe it may,</v>

2835
01:14:27.791 --> 01:14:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I may or may not have done a background check.</v>

2836
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.380
<v Speaker 2>So I definitely know when he came from.</v>

2837
01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.153

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Ivy League.</v>

2850
01:14:51.311 --> 01:14:51.551

01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:54.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2854
01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:55.031
<v Speaker 3>and then he would sit in,</v>

2855
01:14:55.031 --> 01:14:57.890
<v Speaker 3>my cousin went to Yale and they would have a conversation and he would talk</v>

2856
01:14:57.891 --> 01:14:58.724
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2857
01:14:58.770 --> 01:14:59.300
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2858
01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2859
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Poor bet you're ripping paper over there for you.</v>

2861
01:15:02.951 --> 01:15:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And she's going crazy.</v>

2863
01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:06.130
<v Speaker 2>It's just so like the Tucker,</v>

2864
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.541
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2865
01:15:06.541 --> 01:15:06.961
<v Speaker 2>not even that.</v>

2866
01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:07.794
<v Speaker 2>Every time</v>

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:10.350
<v Speaker 3>what clues did I miss?</v>

2870
01:15:10.351 --> 01:15:10.951
<v Speaker 3>What am I,</v>

2871
01:15:10.951 --> 01:15:11.191

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.350
<v Speaker 3>what am I realizing now?</v>

2874
01:15:13.351 --> 01:15:15.030
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm trying to like put the dot,</v>

2875
01:15:15.031 --> 01:15:15.870
<v Speaker 3>like connect the dots.</v>

2876
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:17.280
<v Speaker 3>The day I met him,</v>

2877
01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.500
<v Speaker 3>I went on Twitter and I followed him and his Twitter handle an had a Yale</v>

2878
01:15:22.501 --> 01:15:23.334
<v Speaker 3>reference in it.</v>

2879
01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:25.110
<v Speaker 3>And I asked him like when we broke up,</v>

2880
01:15:25.111 --> 01:15:25.351
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2881
01:15:25.351 --> 01:15:26.880
<v Speaker 3>even your Twitter was about Yale.</v>

2882
01:15:26.881 --> 01:15:27.271
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

2883
01:15:27.271 --> 01:15:28.830
<v Speaker 3>I made up my Twitter account the day I met you.</v>

2884
01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2885
01:15:30.461 --> 01:15:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Just because he met you and he wanted,</v>

2886
01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.670
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2887
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:35.201
<v Speaker 2>he didn't.</v>

2888
01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:35.741
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he lied.</v>

2889
01:15:35.741 --> 01:15:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he changed the name.</v>

2890
01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh Wow.</v>

2891
01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:39.400
<v Speaker 2>What a psycho.</v>

2892
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:40.510
<v Speaker 2>And every time I tell the story,</v>

2893
01:15:40.511 --> 01:15:42.490
<v Speaker 2>like I think about different things that I missed.</v>

2894
01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.950
<v Speaker 2>So Jesus Christ,</v>

2895
01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.710
<v Speaker 2>the good news is when something that weird happens to you,</v>

2896
01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 2>there's no lesson to be learned.</v>

2897
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:50.494
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

2898
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:50.831
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2899
01:15:50.831 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was cheating.</v>

2900
01:15:51.731 --> 01:15:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a normal thing.</v>

2901
01:15:52.721 --> 01:15:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Like this is not something I'll take into another relationship.</v>

2902
01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not,</v>

2903
01:15:56.270 --> 01:16:01.240
<v Speaker 2>you kind of do because you guys do lie about their past to become more</v>

2904
01:16:01.241 --> 01:16:02.500
<v Speaker 2>impressive to a girl.</v>

2905
01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:03.011
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2906
01:16:03.011 --> 01:16:03.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is really,</v>

2907
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:04.870
<v Speaker 2>it's super common,</v>

2908
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.823
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2909
01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:10.840
<v Speaker 2>And now you'll sort of recognize those sort of bullshit signs maybe quicker.</v>

2910
01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:12.731
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2911
01:16:12.731 --> 01:16:14.800
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's like when a guy throws that out there,</v>

2912
01:16:14.801 --> 01:16:16.300
<v Speaker 2>like makes a big deal out of it.</v>

2913
01:16:16.301 --> 01:16:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe that's when you look.</v>

2914
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:18.783
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

2915
01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.100
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

2916
01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean some people like it wasn't really online.</v>

2917
01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:25.790
<v Speaker 3>Some people take pride in not really being online a lot that,</v>

2918
01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Internet helps.</v>

2919
01:16:26.641 --> 01:16:26.941
<v Speaker 3>Like and when,</v>

2920
01:16:26.941 --> 01:16:27.450
<v Speaker 3>if you can,</v>

2921
01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:30.240
<v Speaker 3>I went on a date last night and you could Google the guy and everything about</v>

2922
01:16:30.241 --> 01:16:31.074
<v Speaker 3>him is there</v>

2923
01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.793
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

2924
01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.300
<v Speaker 2>me and this guy had no friends in common.</v>

2925
01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Like the email I wrote him was so,</v>

2926
01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:43.360
<v Speaker 2>I guess so pointed it to me.</v>

2927
01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:43.901
<v Speaker 2>I'll send it,</v>

2928
01:16:43.901 --> 01:16:44.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll show it to you right after this.</v>

2929
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:47.290
<v Speaker 2>I went online and he deleted his Twitter account.</v>

2930
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:47.651
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2931
01:16:47.651 --> 01:16:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I think I made this motherfucker leave cyberspace.</v>

2932
01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:51.281
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2933
01:16:51.281 --> 01:16:51.731
<v Speaker 2>it's bad.</v>

2934
01:16:51.731 --> 01:16:52.481
<v Speaker 2>Well you should.</v>

2935
01:16:52.481 --> 01:16:54.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's for him.</v>

2936
01:16:54.071 --> 01:16:58.150
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be some people just do that over and over and over again though.</v>

2937
01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:02.290
<v Speaker 2>My friend Eddie met this guy and this guy,</v>

2938
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:03.183
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2939
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.620
<v Speaker 2>he was working on,</v>

2940
01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:07.960
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to put him in some project.</v>

2941
01:17:07.961 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 2>He was doing some television and</v>

2942
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:14.690
<v Speaker 1>he claimed that he had these studios and he was working with all these networks</v>

2943
01:17:14.691 --> 01:17:15.524
<v Speaker 1>and this and that.</v>

2944
01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.050
<v Speaker 1>But where we found out that he was full of Shit,</v>

2945
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.640
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was full of Shit right away.</v>

2946
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.301
<v Speaker 1>I told Eddie,</v>

2947
01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Alec,</v>

2948
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the way this guy talks.</v>

2949
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:23.060
<v Speaker 1>He named jobs too much.</v>

2950
01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:23.271
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2951
01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a bullshitter.</v>

2952
01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:25.101
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

2953
01:17:25.101 --> 01:17:27.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain thing that people do when they bullshit when they talk about</v>

2954
01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:28.300
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2955
01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I've got a project going on with Steven Spielberg and this,</v>

2956
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:33.050
<v Speaker 1>there's just no fucking way Tom Cruise is passing on the project.</v>

2957
01:17:33.051 --> 01:17:33.831
<v Speaker 1>We want to bring it to you.</v>

2958
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:34.664
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2959
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2960
01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:36.771
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2961
01:17:36.771 --> 01:17:37.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of those things.</v>

2962
01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2963
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.630
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2964

01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2967
01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.001

2968
01:17:41.001 --> 01:17:41.834

2970
01:17:42.711 --> 01:17:44.030
<v Speaker 1>but Eddie was interacting with this guy.</v>

2971
01:17:44.031 --> 01:17:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm like any of that guy's a bullshitter.</v>

2972
01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:46.213

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2978
01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean zero experience in Jujitsu and then calls Eddie after doing Jujitsu for</v>

2979
01:17:58.521 --> 01:17:58.880

<v Speaker 1>maybe two days.</v>

2982
01:18:01.551 --> 01:18:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's talking about catching people and triangles and all these different</v>

2983
01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:05.780
<v Speaker 1>submissions that he pulled off,</v>

2984
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:08.390
<v Speaker 1>which is never going to happen.</v>

2985
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just not going to happen unless,</v>

2986
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:14.480
<v Speaker 1>unless you're doing it with someone who is absolutely physically competent.</v>

2987
01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:15.350
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

2988
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:16.460
<v Speaker 1>when you first start out,</v>

2989
01:18:16.461 --> 01:18:17.480
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you're doing,</v>

2990
01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't learn that day one.</v>

2991
01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:19.071
<v Speaker 1>We'll also,</v>

2992
01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:20.090
<v Speaker 1>he's not a stud.</v>

2993
01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:21.170
<v Speaker 1>The guy wasn't like,</v>

2994
01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:22.210
<v Speaker 1>there's certain guys like it,</v>

2995
01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:22.721
<v Speaker 1>you can take a guy,</v>

2996
01:18:22.721 --> 01:18:26.450
<v Speaker 1>he's like a pro basketball player who's just a fucking athlete and maybe he</v>

2997
01:18:26.451 --> 01:18:29.330
<v Speaker 1>loves MMA and maybe he's never taken a Jujitsu classes life,</v>

2998
01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:33.260
<v Speaker 1>but he's seen a few fights and if he recognizes the position that you teach it</v>

2999
01:18:33.261 --> 01:18:33.680
<v Speaker 1>to him,</v>

3000
01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.570
<v Speaker 1>he could maybe pull it off on someone who sucks.</v>

3001
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3002
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:37.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's an advanced move,</v>

3003
01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:38.990
<v Speaker 1>like setting up a triangle,</v>

3004
01:18:38.991 --> 01:18:39.651
<v Speaker 1>finishing it.</v>

3005
01:18:39.651 --> 01:18:40.790
<v Speaker 1>It's an advanced move.</v>

3006
01:18:40.791 --> 01:18:41.624
<v Speaker 1>And this guy was like,</v>

3007
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I got three triangles today and practice and to armbars when we were like,</v>

3008
01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:44.871
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

3009
01:18:44.871 --> 01:18:45.560
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3010
01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.071
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

3011
01:18:46.071 --> 01:18:48.290
<v Speaker 1>I told you he's a bullshitter.</v>

3012
01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:49.430
<v Speaker 1>And then he go,</v>

3013
01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:50.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3014
01:18:50.241 --> 01:18:52.100
<v Speaker 1>he did actually go to class.</v>

3015
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.830
<v Speaker 1>He did not ever tap anyone ever.</v>

3016
01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:56.570
<v Speaker 1>He is physically in competent.</v>

3017
01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.151
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

3018
01:18:57.151 --> 01:18:58.070
<v Speaker 1>if you see him,</v>

3019
01:18:58.220 --> 01:18:59.240
<v Speaker 1>you look at his body,</v>

3020
01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:03.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like this guy is lucky if he can brush his teeth like this isn't a fucking</v>

3021
01:19:03.501 --> 01:19:04.520
<v Speaker 1>athlete at all.</v>

3022
01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:05.354
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was just like,</v>

3023
01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:06.920
<v Speaker 1>it was a gumby.</v>

3024
01:19:06.921 --> 01:19:10.400
<v Speaker 1>He was a guy who essentially had never worked out his whole life and then all of</v>

3025
01:19:10.401 --> 01:19:12.440
<v Speaker 1>a sudden he's claiming he's tapping people out in Jujitsu.</v>

3026
01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.850
<v Speaker 1>But that was just confirmation.</v>

3027
01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:14.211
<v Speaker 1>Then ed,</v>

3028
01:19:14.211 --> 01:19:15.044
<v Speaker 1>he looked into his,</v>

3029
01:19:15.170 --> 01:19:18.220
<v Speaker 1>his whole situation and found out the guy was just a total complete liar.</v>

3030
01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Broke it down with them over the phone.</v>

3031
01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.130
<v Speaker 1>There's another one I've got is a guy,</v>

3032
01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:22.521
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3033
01:19:22.521 --> 01:19:23.354
<v Speaker 1>his name,</v>

3034
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:28.730
<v Speaker 1>his real name was Ralph and he was telling us that his name was Rafael Tori.</v>

3035
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3036
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:30.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3037
01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:34.340
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that he was a black belt in Jujitsu as friends or like how did</v>

3038
01:19:34.341 --> 01:19:34.670
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3039
01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:36.260
<v Speaker 1>well this guy I'm telling us,</v>

3040
01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:41.690
<v Speaker 1>he was his friend and he was a journalist for a mixed martial arts magazine,</v>

3041
01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.220
<v Speaker 1>an online magazine.</v>

3042
01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.550
<v Speaker 1>And so he would go to these events and uh,</v>

3043
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>and he would do,</v>

3044
01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:48.861
<v Speaker 1>Eddie was a,</v>

3045
01:19:48.861 --> 01:19:50.600
<v Speaker 1>one of the commentators for the king of the cage,</v>

3046
01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:52.460
<v Speaker 1>which is a smaller mixed martial arts,</v>

3047
01:19:52.461 --> 01:19:56.400
<v Speaker 1>a organization familiar with King and again and uh,</v>

3048
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:57.110
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

3049
01:19:57.110 --> 01:20:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Rafael Tory actually had a fake fight.</v>

3050
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:00.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

3051
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:02.720
<v Speaker 1>he said that he was a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.</v>

3052
01:20:02.721 --> 01:20:03.890
<v Speaker 1>He was not at all.</v>

3053
01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Eddie rolled with them and Eddie is a black belt and at the time I don't think</v>

3054
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:07.441
<v Speaker 1>was a black,</v>

3055
01:20:07.441 --> 01:20:09.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think Eddie was a brown belt and he just smashed him,</v>

3056
01:20:09.851 --> 01:20:10.890
<v Speaker 1>just tapped him left and right.</v>

3057
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.480
<v Speaker 1>And he was like confused.</v>

3058
01:20:12.481 --> 01:20:12.811
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

3059
01:20:12.811 --> 01:20:13.360
<v Speaker 1>well maybe they,</v>

3060
01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:16.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe it wasn't really trying or like I don't get it cause he was a bigger guy</v>

3061
01:20:16.651 --> 01:20:16.930
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3062
01:20:16.930 --> 01:20:19.200
<v Speaker 1>It was like way too easy for Eddie to tap them.</v>

3063
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:20.081
<v Speaker 1>So Eddie there,</v>

3064
01:20:20.081 --> 01:20:23.040
<v Speaker 1>there was a few like red flags that popped up there.</v>

3065
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3066
01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.170
<v Speaker 1>long story short,</v>

3067
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.560
<v Speaker 1>the guy never digits before it,</v>

3068
01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:30.870
<v Speaker 1>it was a complete fake would disappear and here's a good one.</v>

3069
01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Went away.</v>

3070
01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3071
01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:34.080
<v Speaker 1>It told his friend to drop him off,</v>

3072
01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:36.390
<v Speaker 1>like pulled up to this a wooded area,</v>

3073
01:20:36.391 --> 01:20:37.350
<v Speaker 1>told his friend to drop him off.</v>

3074
01:20:37.351 --> 01:20:40.170
<v Speaker 1>He had a duffle bag with them filled with some shit,</v>

3075
01:20:40.171 --> 01:20:40.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3076
01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:41.251
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

3077
01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:41.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3078
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:42.301
<v Speaker 1>dropped me off here.</v>

3079
01:20:42.301 --> 01:20:47.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fight in this no rules karate tournament out in the woods and then</v>

3080
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I'll be back in two days.</v>

3081
01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:49.921
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3082
01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:53.540
<v Speaker 1>So his friend comes back in two days and now he doesn't have the duffle bag in.</v>

3083
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:58.340
<v Speaker 1>My buddy has a trophy that's the same size as the fucking duffle bag one.</v>

3084
01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:00.180
<v Speaker 1>This no rules karate tournament.</v>

3085
01:21:00.181 --> 01:21:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3086
01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:01.501
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like,</v>

3087
01:21:01.501 --> 01:21:01.891
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

3088
01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:02.724
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

3089
01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3090
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:07.200
<v Speaker 1>so the guy completely made up is martial arts background completely made up.</v>

3091
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:11.430
<v Speaker 1>He also went to Thailand for a fight and got a guy in a twister.</v>

3092
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Twister is a very complex move that involves not just getting on top of Oh God,</v>

3093
01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:19.560
<v Speaker 1>but getting on top of guy inside control,</v>

3094
01:21:19.561 --> 01:21:24.260
<v Speaker 1>lacing one leg with your two legs rolling on your shoulders.</v>

3095
01:21:24.261 --> 01:21:25.410
<v Speaker 1>So you go behind him,</v>

3096
01:21:25.411 --> 01:21:26.244
<v Speaker 1>take his back,</v>

3097
01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:28.410
<v Speaker 1>you wrap his arm around your head,</v>

3098
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:31.200
<v Speaker 1>grab his head and Torque his spine.</v>

3099
01:21:31.201 --> 01:21:33.570
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredibly complex maneuver.</v>

3100
01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.050
<v Speaker 1>This guy just learned it and he started pulling it off on people in,</v>

3101
01:21:37.051 --> 01:21:38.790
<v Speaker 1>in a fucking no holds barred fight.</v>

3102
01:21:38.791 --> 01:21:40.200
<v Speaker 1>So there was all these things.</v>

3103
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:40.920
<v Speaker 1>So Eddie,</v>

3104
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Eddie cuts the guy off and he's like,</v>

3105
01:21:42.241 --> 01:21:43.074
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

3106
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:44.130
<v Speaker 1>you're bullshit artists.</v>

3107
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I know you're full of shit.</v>

3108
01:21:45.211 --> 01:21:46.500
<v Speaker 1>You're not a fucking black belt.</v>

3109
01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:48.840
<v Speaker 1>You're not fighting in these fucking fights.</v>

3110
01:21:48.841 --> 01:21:49.860
<v Speaker 1>He just wanted to be near it.</v>

3111
01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3112
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:50.431
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3113
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I know that your fight.</v>

3114
01:21:51.451 --> 01:21:53.850
<v Speaker 1>But Eddie had been friends with this guy for months and months and months,</v>

3115
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:55.740
<v Speaker 1>just slowly piled on the bullshit.</v>

3116
01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:56.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3117
01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:57.810
<v Speaker 1>just not trying to investigate a guy,</v>

3118
01:21:57.811 --> 01:21:59.340
<v Speaker 1>just thinking he's a cool guy.</v>

3119
01:21:59.341 --> 01:22:01.350
<v Speaker 1>He was already in the mix before Eddie got there.</v>

3120
01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:03.990
<v Speaker 1>He was already deepen with these mixed martial arts guy.</v>

3121
01:22:03.991 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 1>So he just assumed that a guy's legit.</v>

3122

<v Speaker 1>killed him,</v>

3132
01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.770
<v Speaker 1>and then was driving the guy's car,</v>

3133
01:22:31.771 --> 01:22:32.521
<v Speaker 1>Rau witnesses,</v>

<v Speaker 1>saw him drive the guy's car around and,</v>

3135
01:22:34.890 --> 01:22:35.723
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3136
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:40.760
<v Speaker 1>had a gun that he gave to my friend Gerald and told Gerald to hide it.</v>

3137
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 1>And then Gerald,</v>

3138
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3139

3140
01:22:45.571 --> 01:22:46.141
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

01:22:46.141 --> 01:22:46.710
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3142

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3147
01:22:51.751 --> 01:22:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And then the cops called me because Gerald had apparently been,</v>

3148
01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:56.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3149
01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:00.930

01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:36.761
<v Speaker 3>I'm gone.</v>

3267
01:25:36.761 --> 01:25:37.421
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of,</v>

3268
01:25:37.421 --> 01:25:37.721
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3269
01:25:37.721 --> 01:25:40.350
<v Speaker 3>But did you think about like keeping a Morag?</v>

3270
01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:40.810
<v Speaker 3>Could it?</v>

3271
01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:44.200
<v Speaker 3>No way I couldn't because like you have to take yourself,</v>

3272
01:25:44.201 --> 01:25:44.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3273
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:44.831
<v Speaker 3>I even,</v>

3274
01:25:44.831 --> 01:25:45.360
<v Speaker 3>I knew this,</v>

3275
01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.330
<v Speaker 3>you have to take yourself out of like you,</v>

3276
01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.030
<v Speaker 3>your hurt and your heart's broken.</v>

3277
01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:50.530
<v Speaker 3>You're allowed to let that heal.</v>

3278
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.570
<v Speaker 3>But getting back with someone like that is not,</v>

3279
01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:52.931
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3280
01:25:52.931 --> 01:25:56.980
<v Speaker 3>I lose respect from my all my friends and family and it also like you can't</v>

3281
01:25:56.981 --> 01:25:57.814
<v Speaker 3>trust that person.</v>

3282
01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.630
<v Speaker 3>The end game for you is that you'd be dating someone you couldn't trust however.</v>

3283
01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3284
01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.171
<v Speaker 3>but I as you know,</v>

3285
01:26:02.171 --> 01:26:02.930
<v Speaker 3>and he just,</v>

3286
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:03.440
<v Speaker 3>and never,</v>

3287
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.041
<v Speaker 3>that's the other thing.</v>

3288
01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:05.060
<v Speaker 3>And I said in the email,</v>

3289
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.601
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3290
01:26:05.601 --> 01:26:05.831
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3291
01:26:05.831 --> 01:26:07.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't have all the answers from him.</v>

3292
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:07.911
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

3293
01:26:07.911 --> 01:26:12.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to trade my lack of closure for the privilege of never having to</v>

3294
01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:13.424
<v Speaker 3>talk to you again.</v>

3295
01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:15.140
<v Speaker 3>So I will write my own closure.</v>

3296
01:26:15.141 --> 01:26:16.190
<v Speaker 3>I'll draw my own conclusions.</v>

3297
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:17.450
<v Speaker 3>I won't defend you to anyone.</v>

3298
01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.330
<v Speaker 3>And he went down on me for 20 minutes</v>

3299
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.193
<v Speaker 3>outside,</v>

3300
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:27.260
<v Speaker 3>outside to danger pussy.</v>

3301
01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:30.070
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy that,</v>

3302
01:26:30.071 --> 01:26:30.191
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3303
01:26:30.191 --> 01:26:32.160
<v Speaker 1>that the lack of closure thing is a big thing.</v>

3304
01:26:32.161 --> 01:26:32.341
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3305
01:26:32.341 --> 01:26:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause you'll stay up late,</v>

3306
01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:34.830
<v Speaker 1>try to figure it out.</v>

3307
01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you like find yourself like during the day,</v>

3308
01:26:37.291 --> 01:26:38.860
<v Speaker 1>like just driving around and trying to piece it</v>

3309
01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:39.210
<v Speaker 3>together?</v>

3310
01:26:39.210 --> 01:26:39.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3311
01:26:39.490 --> 01:26:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Where did,</v>

3312
01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:41.290
<v Speaker 3>I was sitting on the plane yesterday.</v>

3313
01:26:41.291 --> 01:26:42.124
<v Speaker 3>And like it,</v>

3314
01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:43.900
<v Speaker 3>especially when you just go through a breakup,</v>

3315
01:26:43.901 --> 01:26:44.230
<v Speaker 3>like you're,</v>

3316
01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:44.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3317
01:26:44.411 --> 01:26:45.520
<v Speaker 3>you think about that person,</v>

3318
01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:46.360
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3319
01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:47.380
<v Speaker 3>And the hard thing is not,</v>

3320
01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:48.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm past that phase.</v>

3321
01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:49.100
<v Speaker 3>There's no I,</v>

3322
01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:49.960
<v Speaker 3>the number's blocked.</v>

3323
01:26:49.961 --> 01:26:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't call him or anything.</v>

3324
01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.271
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3325
01:26:52.271 --> 01:26:54.790
<v Speaker 3>you sit there and you go back over things and then I start like,</v>

3326
01:26:54.791 --> 01:26:57.430
<v Speaker 3>here's a weird piece of the puzzle if you want to know what I was thinking.</v>

3327
01:26:58.060 --> 01:26:58.893
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3328
01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.460
<v Speaker 3>when before we were dating,</v>

3329
01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.670
<v Speaker 3>he invited me to go to England for the skull and bones thing and obviously not</v>

3330
01:27:03.671 --> 01:27:04.121
<v Speaker 3>in skull and bones.</v>

3331
01:27:04.121 --> 01:27:04.954
<v Speaker 3>You didn't go to Yale.</v>

3332
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:06.340
<v Speaker 3>And even after this all happened,</v>

3333
01:27:06.341 --> 01:27:06.521
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

3334
01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:06.611
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3335
01:27:06.611 --> 01:27:07.990
<v Speaker 3>my dad was in skull and bones and I'm like,</v>

3336
01:27:07.991 --> 01:27:09.790
<v Speaker 3>your dad went to Yale Grad school,</v>

3337
01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:10.690
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

3338
01:27:10.930 --> 01:27:12.010
<v Speaker 3>What's Your Dad's name?</v>

3339
01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.420
<v Speaker 3>Dad's dead in real life.</v>

3340
01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:14.350
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean that for.</v>

3341
01:27:14.410 --> 01:27:15.570
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3342
01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:16.990
<v Speaker 3>he invited me to go to England,</v>

3343
01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:22.080
<v Speaker 3>so I was going to go separate rooms and I went out to dinner with a friend who</v>

3344
01:27:22.630 --> 01:27:23.890
<v Speaker 3>has a body that I really liked.</v>

3345
01:27:23.891 --> 01:27:28.240
<v Speaker 3>So I took a picture of my drink and in the background was my friend's body.</v>

3346
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:29.200
<v Speaker 3>He's like a big guy,</v>

3347
01:27:29.530 --> 01:27:30.910
<v Speaker 3>so the point of the picture was to be like,</v>

3348
01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:33.810
<v Speaker 3>look at this hot thing I'm having a drink with not so much to be like,</v>

3349
01:27:33.811 --> 01:27:34.644
<v Speaker 3>look at the drink.</v>

3350
01:27:35.290 --> 01:27:39.010
<v Speaker 3>I think he saw that picture because I don't remember if it was before or after,</v>

3351
01:27:39.011 --> 01:27:41.170
<v Speaker 3>but that was the night he called me and said,</v>

3352
01:27:41.230 --> 01:27:42.011
<v Speaker 3>we can't go to England.</v>

3353
01:27:42.011 --> 01:27:42.844
<v Speaker 3>My mom has cancer.</v>

3354
01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.240
<v Speaker 3>I think he saw that picture on Instagram and he was like,</v>

3355
01:27:46.241 --> 01:27:48.850
<v Speaker 3>I got to do something to shake this up if the,</v>

3356
01:27:48.851 --> 01:27:50.110
<v Speaker 3>if the mom doesn't have cancer.</v>

3357
01:27:50.111 --> 01:27:52.090
<v Speaker 3>It's odd that that was the night of all nights.</v>

3358
01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So you were friends only up until that point.</v>

3359
01:27:55.530 --> 01:27:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3360
01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>

3361
01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.120
<v Speaker 1>There's friends and there's friends with an agenda and you and I are friends.</v>

3362
01:28:02.671 --> 01:28:03.990
<v Speaker 1>We will never have sex.</v>

3363
01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that right now.</v>

3364
01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm married,</v>

3365
01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:06.390
<v Speaker 1>we're friends.</v>

3366
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to let it happen.</v>

3367
01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Eliza stopped with those eyes,</v>

3368
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.901
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

3369
01:28:12.901 --> 01:28:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Like we're legitimate friends.</v>

3370
01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Amy Schumer's another one.</v>

3371
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.490
<v Speaker 1>She's my legitimate friends and I,</v>

3372
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3373
01:28:17.971 --> 01:28:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important to like have men and women like that,</v>

3374
01:28:21.751 --> 01:28:22.770
<v Speaker 1>that are friends like that.</v>

3375
01:28:22.771 --> 01:28:25.110
<v Speaker 1>There's like a line that will never be crossed.</v>

3376
01:28:25.170 --> 01:28:26.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't,</v>

3377
01:28:26.490 --> 01:28:29.520
<v Speaker 1>but there's guys who are really never your fucking friend.</v>

3378
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:30.091
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>

3379
01:28:30.091 --> 01:28:30.451
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

3380
01:28:30.451 --> 01:28:30.781
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

3381
01:28:30.781 --> 01:28:31.171

<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

3383
01:28:31.501 --> 01:28:32.220
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

3384
01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.080
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was a lie from the beginning.</v>

3385
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I knew that like I'm not dumb and he had said that to me.</v>

3386
01:28:37.371 --> 01:28:37.571
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3387
01:28:37.571 --> 01:28:39.160
<v Speaker 3>goes over your friend but you,</v>

3388
01:28:39.161 --> 01:28:40.390

3389
01:28:40.450 --> 01:28:40.780
<v Speaker 3>we had,</v>

3390
01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:44.110
<v Speaker 3>we hung out and we had a really nice like relationship his friends and</v>

3391
01:28:44.111 --> 01:28:46.150
<v Speaker 3>definitely I would get drunk once in a while and I'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>

3407
01:29:04.331 --> 01:29:05.011
<v Speaker 3>I also said,</v>

3408
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:05.850
<v Speaker 3>I would say to him,</v>

3409
01:29:05.970 --> 01:29:06.271
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3410
01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:07.680
<v Speaker 3>look at any point,</v>

3411
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.000
<v Speaker 3>and I'm very upfront on us.</v>

3412
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:11.820
<v Speaker 3>I'd say at any point we can stop hanging out.</v>

3413
01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:12.091
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

3414
01:29:12.091 --> 01:29:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to date you.</v>

3415
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 3>You need to know that.</v>

3416
01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:15.300
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

3417
01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:15.750
<v Speaker 3>meanwhile,</v>

3418
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:17.430
<v Speaker 3>you dated him eventually,</v>

3419
01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:17.830
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3420
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:18.610
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3421
01:29:18.610 --> 01:29:19.470
<v Speaker 3>but my point is,</v>

3422
01:29:19.890 --> 01:29:20.850
<v Speaker 3>the whole time we were dating,</v>

3423
01:29:20.851 --> 01:29:21.511
<v Speaker 3>I was honest.</v>

3424
01:29:21.511 --> 01:29:21.751
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3425
01:29:21.751 --> 01:29:23.030
<v Speaker 3>I have no intention of dating you.</v>

3426
01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3427
01:29:23.210 --> 01:29:24.900
<v Speaker 3>but you kissed him ton.</v>

3428
01:29:25.230 --> 01:29:26.130
<v Speaker 3>You can walk away.</v>

3429
01:29:26.131 --> 01:29:28.380
<v Speaker 3>I didn't chain him to the wall and I was like,</v>

3430
01:29:28.381 --> 01:29:29.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to date other guys.</v>

3431
01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:31.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have other guys be my boy.</v>

3432
01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:32.850
<v Speaker 3>Like not when I was kissing him,</v>

3433
01:29:32.851 --> 01:29:33.420
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

3434
01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:34.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably never going to date you.</v>

3435
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:35.603
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3436
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.630
<v Speaker 3>And he hung around.</v>

3437
01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:37.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3438
01:29:37.001 --> 01:29:37.141
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3439
01:29:37.141 --> 01:29:38.320
<v Speaker 1>and I understand that.</v>

3440
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:39.183
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3441
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.791
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3442
01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:41.980
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely a silly man for hanging around,</v>

3443
01:29:41.981 --> 01:29:43.870
<v Speaker 1>but not because he eventually got to fuck you.</v>

3444
01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:44.860
<v Speaker 1>So he wins,</v>

3445
01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.353
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

3446
01:29:46.630 --> 01:29:47.463
<v Speaker 3>I don't think really.</v>

3447
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.741
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3448
01:29:47.741 --> 01:29:48.010
<v Speaker 3>neat.</v>

3449
01:29:48.010 --> 01:29:48.221
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3450
01:29:48.221 --> 01:29:48.790
<v Speaker 3>listen again,</v>

3451
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:49.623
<v Speaker 3>because you're a girl.</v>

3452
01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:49.961
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3453
01:29:49.961 --> 01:29:50.740
<v Speaker 3>you kissed him.</v>

3454
01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:50.991
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

3455
01:29:50.991 --> 01:29:52.150
<v Speaker 3>you tongued him.</v>

3456
01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:54.130
<v Speaker 3>And he eventually got in there.</v>

3457
01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:57.220
<v Speaker 3>But you're telling me that every girl you've brought prior to being married,</v>

3458
01:29:57.221 --> 01:29:59.620
<v Speaker 3>every girl you ever like drunk made out with that meant something to you?</v>

3459
01:29:59.690 --> 01:29:59.891
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3460
01:29:59.891 --> 01:30:00.041
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3461
01:30:00.041 --> 01:30:00.300
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3462
01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:03.610
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's a difference between you saying to someone,</v>

3463
01:30:03.611 --> 01:30:04.000
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3464
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:04.511
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3465
01:30:04.511 --> 01:30:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm a man.</v>

3466
01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.000
<v Speaker 1>When a man drunkenly makes out with a girl,</v>

3467
01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:08.300
<v Speaker 1>he absolutely wants to fuck her.</v>

3468
01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.810
<v Speaker 1>If a girl drunkenly makes out with a guy,</v>

3469
01:30:10.811 --> 01:30:12.280
<v Speaker 1>she can do it just to be silly,</v>

3470
01:30:12.281 --> 01:30:12.791
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

3471
01:30:12.791 --> 01:30:14.140
<v Speaker 1>And then just shut the door and go in.</v>

3472
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3473
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Guys don't ever do that.</v>

3474
01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:16.540
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

3475
01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:18.520
<v Speaker 1>If a guide drunkenly makes out with a girl,</v>

3476
01:30:18.521 --> 01:30:20.800
<v Speaker 1>it's almost always because he eventually,</v>

3477
01:30:20.801 --> 01:30:22.090
<v Speaker 1>ultimately wants to have sex with her.</v>

3478
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:23.120
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3479
01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:23.301
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3480
01:30:23.301 --> 01:30:23.481
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3481
01:30:23.481 --> 01:30:24.314
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

3482
01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.390
<v Speaker 3>that's how guys are and that's not how girls are.</v>

3483
01:30:26.391 --> 01:30:28.820
<v Speaker 3>And I think all any girl would relate to that.</v>

3484
01:30:28.821 --> 01:30:29.271
<v Speaker 3>Like you get,</v>

3485
01:30:29.271 --> 01:30:29.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3486
01:30:29.571 --> 01:30:30.404
<v Speaker 3>or you're just,</v>

3487
01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:31.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3488
01:30:31.431 --> 01:30:33.170
<v Speaker 3>you're drunk and you want to,</v>

3489
01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.820
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you just want to make out with someone.</v>

3490
01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:36.710
<v Speaker 3>And that's the God's honest truth.</v>

3491
01:30:36.711 --> 01:30:38.930
<v Speaker 3>Like we all get horny and I don't feel like having that goes x.</v>

3492
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Here's my point though.</v>

3493
01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:43.460
<v Speaker 3>No matter what relationship you're conducting,</v>

3494
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:46.190
<v Speaker 3>even like even if you feel I'm throwing mixed signals,</v>

3495
01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:48.140
<v Speaker 3>you at any point are allowed to walk away.</v>

3496
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:49.340
<v Speaker 3>At no point was I like,</v>

3497
01:30:49.341 --> 01:30:49.791
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>

3498
01:30:49.791 --> 01:30:50.660
<v Speaker 3>Please stay.</v>

3499
01:30:50.661 --> 01:30:51.381
<v Speaker 3>It was me being like,</v>

3500
01:30:51.381 --> 01:30:52.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make out with you.</v>

3501
01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:53.720
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll take my shirt off.</v>

3502
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:54.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to date you.</v>

3503
01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll go take my shirt off.</v>

3504
01:30:58.670 --> 01:31:00.050
<v Speaker 3>But this one,</v>

3505
01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.380
<v Speaker 3>the whole time they will.</v>

3506
01:31:01.381 --> 01:31:04.550
<v Speaker 3>I started from day one so it isn't as if like they came into play later,</v>

3507
01:31:04.551 --> 01:31:07.820
<v Speaker 3>like the whole time and then I think what he was like,</v>

3508
01:31:07.821 --> 01:31:09.830
<v Speaker 3>what happened is I lied and I know what to do.</v>

3509
01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:10.071
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3510
01:31:10.071 --> 01:31:10.851
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think we would date.</v>

3511
01:31:10.851 --> 01:31:12.230
<v Speaker 3>You always told us and told me we wouldn't.</v>

3512
01:31:12.231 --> 01:31:12.891
<v Speaker 3>And then we did.</v>

3513
01:31:12.891 --> 01:31:13.131
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3514
01:31:13.131 --> 01:31:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what to do.</v>

3515
01:31:14.061 --> 01:31:14.894
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3516
01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:15.501
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>

3517
01:31:15.501 --> 01:31:16.334
<v Speaker 3>it's on you.</v>

3518
01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Well that's definitely on him and the lies are unacceptable.</v>

3519
01:31:19.411 --> 01:31:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3520
01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.920
<v Speaker 1>all I'm trying to do is as your friend breakdown though the mindset and try to</v>

3521
01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:28.470
<v Speaker 1>figure out like how someone says,</v>

3522
01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:31.770
<v Speaker 1>I will tongue you and kiss you and take my shirt off.</v>

3523
01:31:31.771 --> 01:31:33.960
<v Speaker 1>But we're never going to have sex for a guy that's like,</v>

3524
01:31:33.961 --> 01:31:35.250
<v Speaker 1>if we're getting that close,</v>

3525
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.650
<v Speaker 1>if your tits are coming out and my tongue's in your mouth.</v>

3526
01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3527
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Jets.</v>

3528
01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:39.590
<v Speaker 3>I was joking about the shirt thing.</v>

3529
01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:39.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3530
01:31:39.730 --> 01:31:40.280
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3531
01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:41.113
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3532
01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:41.661
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

3533
01:31:41.661 --> 01:31:42.680
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody's been there.</v>

3534
01:31:42.681 --> 01:31:46.040
<v Speaker 3>Words like a drunk make out to the end of the night and you're just like,</v>

3535
01:31:46.041 --> 01:31:46.401
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3536
01:31:46.401 --> 01:31:47.870
<v Speaker 3>I feel like making out.</v>

3537
01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:49.100
<v Speaker 3>And so you do like,</v>

3538
01:31:49.101 --> 01:31:51.160
<v Speaker 3>you like I know this person and this is fine and they're like,</v>

3539
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:53.040
<v Speaker 3>I ever totally support</v>

3540
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:53.700
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3541
01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:58.020
<v Speaker 1>your right to make out with people and you're drunk and have like a very</v>

3542
01:31:58.021 --> 01:32:00.490
<v Speaker 1>specific boundary where it's not going to go any further than this.</v>

3543
01:32:00.491 --> 01:32:02.020
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to date and not,</v>

3544
01:32:02.021 --> 01:32:02.920
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to make out,</v>

3545
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll make out with you right now.</v>

3546
01:32:03.911 --> 01:32:04.511
<v Speaker 1>But that's it.</v>

3547
01:32:04.511 --> 01:32:05.110
<v Speaker 1>And then that's it.</v>

3548
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:06.520
<v Speaker 1>That's your prerogative.</v>

3549
01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:07.960

<v Speaker 1>you dated him for three months and he turned out to be a complete total</v>

3610
01:33:25.261 --> 01:33:25.631

<v Speaker 1>What if it was,</v>

3613
01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:28.620
<v Speaker 1>you knew him for a year,</v>

3614
01:33:28.710 --> 01:33:31.620
<v Speaker 1>you date him for three months and he turned out to be a fucking psychopath and</v>

3615
01:33:31.621 --> 01:33:32.920
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know the whole time you were date.</v>

3616
01:33:32.921 --> 01:33:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Well it sort of right,</v>

3617
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:34.080
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

3618
01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.310
<v Speaker 1>what if it's the whole time you were dating,</v>

3619
01:33:35.311 --> 01:33:37.110
<v Speaker 1>he was raping girls while you weren't around.</v>

3620
01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3621
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:41.340
<v Speaker 1>that's just as possible as him faking Yale.</v>

3622
01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:44.550
<v Speaker 1>He could have been a serial rapist or house right now with a gun.</v>

3623
01:33:44.551 --> 01:33:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Like he could be a total fucking,</v>

3624
01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3625
01:33:46.090 --> 01:33:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3626
01:33:46.890 --> 01:33:47.521
<v Speaker 1>Did he have a key?</v>

3627
01:33:47.521 --> 01:33:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't at any point in time</v>

3628
01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:51.370

3629
01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.020
<v Speaker 3>because we'd known each other for a year.</v>

3630
01:33:53.021 --> 01:33:55.330
<v Speaker 3>So when you know someone for a year and then date,</v>

3631
01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.530
<v Speaker 3>it's a little,</v>

3632
01:33:56.531 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 3>you could take it a little bit faster because it isn't like you just started</v>

3633
01:33:58.961 --> 01:33:59.141
<v Speaker 3>dating.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'd love to move in.</v>

3637
01:34:02.111 --> 01:34:03.550
<v Speaker 3>Like what can we move in together?</v>

3693
01:35:12.801 --> 01:35:13.760
<v Speaker 2>but the physical thing,</v>

3694
01:35:13.761 --> 01:35:15.920
<v Speaker 2>I definitely pretty works on that.</v>

3695
01:35:15.921 --> 01:35:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's angry for me.</v>

3696
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:18.320
<v Speaker 2>I know saying,</v>

3697
01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was saying I'm,</v>

3698
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:21.470
<v Speaker 2>I work out and I'm angry,</v>

3699
01:35:21.710 --> 01:35:26.510
<v Speaker 2>but I definitely have a male friend that I have made out with and one time we</v>

3700
01:35:26.511 --> 01:35:28.010
<v Speaker 2>were making out and I,</v>

3701
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:32.150
<v Speaker 2>he's a giant person and I actually got scared just being under a body that big.</v>

3702
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:33.291
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3703
01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:34.370
<v Speaker 2>if your arms give out,</v>

3704
01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:35.233
<v Speaker 2>like I'm toast.</v>

3705
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Like it's done for me.</v>

3706
01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3707
01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.431
<v Speaker 2>you won't be able to breathe.</v>

3708
01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:40.190
<v Speaker 2>What if he has an aneurysm when he passed out on top of you and you suffocate?</v>

3709
01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:41.053
<v Speaker 2>That could happen.</v>

3710
01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Cause I sometimes I'll do that.</v>

3711
01:35:41.991 --> 01:35:42.811
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like laying on top of me.</v>

3712
01:35:42.811 --> 01:35:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I want to see if I can get you off of me.</v>

3713
01:35:44.151 --> 01:35:44.871
<v Speaker 2>You know what the key is?</v>

3714
01:35:44.871 --> 01:35:46.130
<v Speaker 2>You got to breathe through your stomach.</v>

3715
01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:47.390
<v Speaker 2>If a guy's on top of you,</v>

3716
01:35:47.391 --> 01:35:49.260
<v Speaker 2>this is what you do and they pass out on it,</v>

3717
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:50.510
<v Speaker 2>you can still breathe,</v>

3718
01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:51.800
<v Speaker 2>but you have to breathe through your stomach.</v>

3719
01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:52.730
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>

3720
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:53.660
<v Speaker 2>well this is the thing.</v>

3721
01:35:53.661 --> 01:35:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to be like this.</v>

3722
01:35:55.730 --> 01:35:56.690
<v Speaker 2>You want to breathe like that.</v>

3723
01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.040
<v Speaker 2>You can agree with diaphragm.</v>

3724
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.271
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

3725
01:35:58.271 --> 01:35:58.461
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3726
01:35:58.461 --> 01:35:59.870
<v Speaker 2>You can breathe from your diaphragm,</v>

3727
01:35:59.871 --> 01:36:03.290
<v Speaker 2>will you literally only move your stomach because it's doing anything for anyone</v>

3728
01:36:03.291 --> 01:36:04.124
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>

3729
01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.660
<v Speaker 2>listening to Joe Rogan,</v>

3730
01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:09.291
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>

3731
01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:11.050
<v Speaker 2>you can breathe with your stomach where your,</v>

3732
01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:14.690
<v Speaker 2>your chest doesn't expand and contract and it's very important when someone's</v>

3733
01:36:14.691 --> 01:36:16.460
<v Speaker 2>compressing you and someone's on top of you and they're,</v>

3734
01:36:16.730 --> 01:36:16.911
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3735
01:36:16.911 --> 01:36:17.750
<v Speaker 2>they're smashing you.</v>

3736
01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:19.790
<v Speaker 2>You have to learn how to stay calm.</v>

3737
01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:20.901
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to date someone,</v>

3738
01:36:20.901 --> 01:36:22.130
<v Speaker 2>learn how to breathe from your diaphragm.</v>

3739
01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:22.971
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3740
01:36:22.971 --> 01:36:24.160
<v Speaker 2>when you're getting choked too,</v>

3741
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:24.771
<v Speaker 2>it's a big one.</v>

3742
01:36:24.771 --> 01:36:28.100
<v Speaker 2>You have to learn how to relax and how to conserve your breath and how to</v>

3743
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:29.683
<v Speaker 2>control your heart rate.</v>

3744
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:30.711
<v Speaker 2>Breathing to my stomach,</v>

3745
01:36:30.711 --> 01:36:32.270
<v Speaker 2>like I feel like I can't take a big breath.</v>

3746
01:36:32.271 --> 01:36:33.104
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

3747
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.471
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

3748
01:36:33.471 --> 01:36:34.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole part of it.</v>

3749
01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.160
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to deal.</v>

3750
01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:35.301
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3751
01:36:35.301 --> 01:36:35.661
<v Speaker 2>you won't.</v>

3752
01:36:35.661 --> 01:36:35.871
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

3753
01:36:35.871 --> 01:36:36.710
<v Speaker 2>you'll be okay.</v>

3754
01:36:36.711 --> 01:36:40.100
<v Speaker 2>You just have to know which you have to do is you have to get comfortable with</v>

3755
01:36:40.101 --> 01:36:41.960
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you're not going to take a full breath.</v>

3756
01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:43.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get comfortable.</v>

3757
01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3758
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:46.070
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to get out from under this fucking big guy.</v>

3759
01:36:46.071 --> 01:36:48.620
<v Speaker 2>How big we're talking about 300 pounds is a big person.</v>

3760
01:36:48.621 --> 01:36:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3761
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:52.070
<v Speaker 2>300 pounds on top of you and you're a little bit low.</v>

3762
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3763
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:53.690
<v Speaker 2>To 80 and you're,</v>

3764
01:36:53.691 --> 01:36:54.261
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

3765
01:36:54.261 --> 01:36:56.300
<v Speaker 2>one 10 sure.</v>

3766
01:36:56.690 --> 01:36:57.500
<v Speaker 2>What do you weigh?</v>

3767
01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:57.741
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3768
01:36:57.741 --> 01:36:58.310
<v Speaker 2>forget it.</v>

3769
01:36:58.310 --> 01:37:03.080
<v Speaker 2>You're a a thin in shape woman who's about five four,</v>

3770
01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:03.973
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3771
01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:05.241
<v Speaker 2>Five five.</v>

3772
01:37:05.241 --> 01:37:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3773
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:07.560
<v Speaker 2>So this big giant gorilla guy,</v>

3774
01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:07.760
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3775
01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Could conceivably kill me.</v>

3776
01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3777
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Anytime he wants you think about that and you're like,</v>

3778
01:37:12.831 --> 01:37:12.891
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3779
01:37:12.891 --> 01:37:13.311
<v Speaker 2>this person.</v>

3780
01:37:13.311 --> 01:37:14.750
<v Speaker 2>So you really just never know.</v>

3781
01:37:14.751 --> 01:37:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's a ticking time bomb.</v>

3782
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.581
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3783
01:37:16.581 --> 01:37:17.990
<v Speaker 2>if you choose to snap right now,</v>

3784
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.231
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3785
01:37:18.231 --> 01:37:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I also have friends that are,</v>

3786
01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:22.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a friend a,</v>

3787
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:24.200
<v Speaker 2>and then there's friend a when he's drunk,</v>

3788
01:37:24.201 --> 01:37:25.280
<v Speaker 2>which I don't even know that guy.</v>

3789
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3790
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:26.120
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3791
01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:28.970
<v Speaker 2>there's people that get drunk and their eyes glaze over and they're like a</v>

3792
01:37:28.971 --> 01:37:29.870
<v Speaker 2>totally different person.</v>

3793
01:37:29.871 --> 01:37:32.870
<v Speaker 2>They say shit to people that you would never see them say when they're sober.</v>

3794
01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:33.980
<v Speaker 2>They get aggressive,</v>

3795
01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:34.641
<v Speaker 2>they get Douchey,</v>

3796
01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:36.710
<v Speaker 2>they start fights and utilize that make you mad.</v>

3797
01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:37.543
<v Speaker 2>You're like us.</v>

3798
01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.620
<v Speaker 2>You don't get the luxury of alcohol.</v>

3799
01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.040
<v Speaker 2>You can't control yourself and act like a person so you shouldn't be able to</v>

3800
01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:43.430
<v Speaker 2>drink.</v>

3801
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Well it's alcoholism is what it is and I've never understood alcoholism when I,</v>

3802
01:37:47.710 --> 01:37:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of ignorant in that way that I always,</v>

3803
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:52.263
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3804
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:53.510
<v Speaker 2>what's the best way to say this?</v>

3805
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3806
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 2>my own shortcomings.</v>

3807
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I F I thought that it was a weakness that people had and it was just simply a</v>

3808
01:37:59.611 --> 01:38:00.660
<v Speaker 2>matter of character.</v>

3809
01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:04.980
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't believe in a alcoholism as a disease,</v>

3810
01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:08.730
<v Speaker 2>but I have personally seen people wear their personality.</v>

3811
01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:12.690
<v Speaker 2>So radically change is under the influence of alcohol that I,</v>

3812
01:38:12.691 --> 01:38:14.490
<v Speaker 2>there's no other way to attribute it to that.</v>

3813
01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Like almost like an allergic reaction.</v>

3814
01:38:16.770 --> 01:38:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Like they become a different person.</v>

3815
01:38:18.481 --> 01:38:19.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're,</v>

3816
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:22.110
<v Speaker 2>their body is just not good with alcohol.</v>

3817
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:23.083
<v Speaker 2>That alcohol,</v>

3818
01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:23.730
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

3819
01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:24.541
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually asking,</v>

3820
01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:28.290
<v Speaker 2>it's not positing this just for funsies is it alcoholism?</v>

3821
01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:31.590
<v Speaker 2>If you know you're not drinking all the time and it's just when you have a drink</v>

3822
01:38:31.591 --> 01:38:32.311
<v Speaker 2>you at crazy.</v>

3823
01:38:32.311 --> 01:38:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Is that still alcoholism?</v>

3824
01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

3825
01:38:34.411 --> 01:38:35.071
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

3826
01:38:35.071 --> 01:38:36.120
<v Speaker 2>I think some people,</v>

3827
01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.470
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

3828
01:38:37.471 --> 01:38:39.000
<v Speaker 2>whether it's genetic and there are,</v>

3829
01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:43.140
<v Speaker 2>I think there's definitely a genetic mechanism to alcoholism as well.</v>

3830
01:38:43.141 --> 01:38:44.490
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know what it is.</v>

3831
01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3832
01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3833
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3834
01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:45.361
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3835
01:38:45.361 --> 01:38:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm not totally educated on it,</v>

3836
01:38:48.930 --> 01:38:52.020
<v Speaker 2>but there's some people were alcoholism runs in the family.</v>

3837
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.451
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3838
01:38:53.451 --> 01:38:54.211
<v Speaker 2>I'm like you,</v>

3839
01:38:54.211 --> 01:38:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I didn't grow up with any alcoholics.</v>

3840
01:38:55.561 --> 01:38:58.890
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in like a suburb where I think when you grow up somewhere like La,</v>

3841
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:00.360
<v Speaker 2>la in particular it,</v>

3842
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about this last night at dinner,</v>

3843
01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:03.840
<v Speaker 2>it sort of breathe,</v>

3844
01:39:03.841 --> 01:39:04.260
<v Speaker 2>it's this,</v>

3845
01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:04.501
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3846
01:39:04.501 --> 01:39:08.400
<v Speaker 2>environment where everyone is recovery and it's part of the conversation in</v>

3847
01:39:08.401 --> 01:39:09.234
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

3848
01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.760
<v Speaker 2>So you grow up very sensitive to those things and what alcohol is,</v>

3849
01:39:11.761 --> 01:39:14.280
<v Speaker 2>can do and what addicts behavior and mentality is.</v>

3850
01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I didn't grow up with any of that.</v>

3851
01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3852
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.290
<v Speaker 2>And I don't choose to be educated on it because I don't have to be part of that</v>

3853
01:39:19.291 --> 01:39:20.124
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3854
01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not putting them down or anything,</v>

3855
01:39:21.451 --> 01:39:24.150
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to date anyone with an addict mentality.</v>

3856
01:39:24.450 --> 01:39:25.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not surrounded by anyone with that.</v>

3857
01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:26.513
<v Speaker 2>It's not a,</v>

3858
01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.990
<v Speaker 2>it's not an education that I need.</v>

3859
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Would you avoid someone who had been to rehab and would you avoid someone who</v>

3860
01:39:31.891 --> 01:39:34.350
<v Speaker 2>used to have an alcohol or a drug problem?</v>

3861
01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.453
<v Speaker 2>I like drinking.</v>

3862
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I like to go out and have fun and I don't want to offend even there's</v>

3863
01:39:39.150 --> 01:39:40.710
<v Speaker 2>certain people that can drink and they're like,</v>

3864
01:39:40.711 --> 01:39:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you drink that,</v>

3865
01:39:41.751 --> 01:39:44.520
<v Speaker 2>that can't drink and they don't care if you drink around them because it's such</v>

3866
01:39:44.521 --> 01:39:45.900
<v Speaker 2>a big social aspect.</v>

3867
01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.460
<v Speaker 2>It would depend on the person.</v>

3868
01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3869
01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:49.610
<v Speaker 2>and it would also depend on what the eye,</v>

3870
01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:50.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not about judging them,</v>

3871
01:39:50.761 --> 01:39:54.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's are you the kind of person who has these triggers and it's going to be</v>

3872
01:39:54.721 --> 01:39:57.810
<v Speaker 2>an issue for the rest of your life or are you dealing with it but able to</v>

3873
01:39:57.811 --> 01:39:58.644
<v Speaker 2>function?</v>

3874
01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.360
<v Speaker 2>It really would just depend on the person.</v>

3875
01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:01.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3876
01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3877
01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:04.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have no problem with someone who gets her shit together and realizes</v>

3878
01:40:04.210 --> 01:40:05.820
<v Speaker 2>they had a problem and then pulls it out.</v>

3879
01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:06.511
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

3880
01:40:06.511 --> 01:40:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I think there really is some sort of a genetic component to alcoholism.</v>

3881
01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:11.483
<v Speaker 2>Well there is,</v>

3882
01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:13.373
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

3883
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.710
<v Speaker 2>I think I get irritated because when you're younger like,</v>

3884
01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:17.400
<v Speaker 2>and when you're in your twenties and we all have those friends,</v>

3885
01:40:17.401 --> 01:40:20.070
<v Speaker 2>like we would have friends that would just do weird shit when they would get</v>

3886
01:40:20.071 --> 01:40:20.820
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>

3887
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:22.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much the same person.</v>

3888
01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:23.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>

3889
01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:23.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3890
01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:24.720
<v Speaker 2>when I'm drunk,</v>

3891
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like a little bit looser,</v>

3892
01:40:26.101 --> 01:40:27.840
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not saying weird things.</v>

3893
01:40:27.841 --> 01:40:28.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not starting fights.</v>

3894
01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I remember everything.</v>

3895
01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3896
01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:34.470
<v Speaker 2>and when people can't act like humans when they get drunk,</v>

3897
01:40:34.471 --> 01:40:35.940
<v Speaker 2>I just choose to remove myself from that.</v>

3898
01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3899
01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.910
<v Speaker 2>The aggressive drunks are the weirdest ones to me.</v>

3900
01:40:38.911 --> 01:40:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm the opposite.</v>

3901
01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:40.741
<v Speaker 2>When I'm drunk,</v>

3902
01:40:40.741 --> 01:40:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm everyone's friend over.</v>

3903
01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.100
<v Speaker 2>The last thing I want to do is get in a fight when I'm drunk.</v>

3904
01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:45.240
<v Speaker 2>I just never gonna work out.</v>

3905
01:40:45.241 --> 01:40:46.080
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to wake and be like,</v>

3906
01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:46.561
<v Speaker 2>oh wow.</v>

3907
01:40:46.561 --> 01:40:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I really rocked all those people.</v>

3908
01:40:48.151 --> 01:40:51.570
<v Speaker 2>And one I came out unscathed and drove home.</v>

3909
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.111
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3910
01:40:52.111 --> 01:40:53.040
<v Speaker 2>there are people that can,</v>

3911
01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:53.771
<v Speaker 2>when they're drunk,</v>

3912
01:40:53.771 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 2>don't</v>

3913
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:54.760
<v Speaker 1>get confused.</v>

3914
01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:54.991
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

3915
01:40:54.991 --> 01:40:55.551
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking that,</v>

3916
01:40:55.551 --> 01:40:55.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3917
01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:56.351
<v Speaker 1>this guy's drunk,</v>

3918
01:40:56.351 --> 01:40:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I can kick his ass now guys.</v>

3919
01:40:58.451 --> 01:40:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Especially the retard strength.</v>

3920
01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3921
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3922
01:41:00.371 --> 01:41:03.100
<v Speaker 1>there's just some people that know how to fight and when they're drunk doesn't</v>

3923
01:41:03.101 --> 01:41:04.150
<v Speaker 1>really diminish that much.</v>

3924
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3925
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:05.623
<v Speaker 1>And they like it.</v>

3926
01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:06.910
<v Speaker 1>But I think for the most part,</v>

3927
01:41:06.911 --> 01:41:08.170
<v Speaker 1>people that get drunk and want to fight,</v>

3928
01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.720
<v Speaker 1>they're not skilled for every guy like that.</v>

3929
01:41:10.721 --> 01:41:12.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy like tank Abbott out there,</v>

3930
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:16.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a rare duty could drink a fucking gallon of vodka and beat the shit out</v>

3931
01:41:16.091 --> 01:41:17.560
<v Speaker 1>of a whole room full of bad asses.</v>

3932
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3933
01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:19.130
<v Speaker 1>There's guys like that out there.</v>

3934
01:41:19.410 --> 01:41:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Probably date him next.</v>

3935
01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:24.210
<v Speaker 3>And Abbott please.</v>

3936
01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:27.270

3937
01:41:27.530 --> 01:41:27.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3938
01:41:27.661 --> 01:41:28.494
<v Speaker 1>that sounds awful.</v>

3939
01:41:28.610 --> 01:41:28.860

<v Speaker 1>he's awesome.</v>

3941
01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Tank Abbott sounds awesome.</v>

3942
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:31.550
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome.</v>

3943
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3944
01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:32.371
<v Speaker 1>that's tank cabinet.</v>

3945
01:41:32.371 --> 01:41:33.204
<v Speaker 1>There he is.</v>

3946
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3947
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:35.381
<v Speaker 1>He's a bug.</v>

3948
01:41:35.381 --> 01:41:35.821
<v Speaker 1>An animal.</v>

3949
01:41:35.821 --> 01:41:37.090
<v Speaker 1>That Guy Gordon's fisherman,</v>

3950
01:41:37.091 --> 01:41:37.740
<v Speaker 1>but bloated.</v>

3951
01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:38.280
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3952
01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:42.870
<v Speaker 1>what I love about that guy is like he would fight anybody and you could call him</v>

3953
01:41:42.871 --> 01:41:44.910
<v Speaker 1>up a day before he'd be on a bar stool.</v>

3954
01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:46.170
<v Speaker 1>You can call him up and go tank.</v>

3955
01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to fight this weekend?</v>

3956
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:47.911
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

3957
01:41:47.911 --> 01:41:48.744
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

3958
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:50.660
<v Speaker 1>tell me where to be would show off.</v>

3959
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:52.500
<v Speaker 1>And he might not be in shape,</v>

3960
01:41:52.530 --> 01:41:52.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3961
01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.240
<v Speaker 1>because he wasn't training because he was drinking.</v>

3962
01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:56.460
<v Speaker 1>But he would try to fucking win with every ounce of his being.</v>

3963
01:41:56.461 --> 01:41:57.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you went out on his shield,</v>

3964
01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:00.960
<v Speaker 1>he went out on his shield and you catch him that night at the bar and you better</v>

3965
01:42:00.961 --> 01:42:03.000
<v Speaker 1>not start talking shit to him about how he lost,</v>

3966

3970
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:10.890
<v Speaker 1>He legitimately enjoyed fighting.</v>

3971
01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:14.070
<v Speaker 1>It takes every type of people to make this crazy world go around.</v>

3972
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:15.420
<v Speaker 1>There's people like that too.</v>

3973
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:17.070
<v Speaker 3>What about can I hit in the face?</v>

3974
01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:18.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what I always want to know about.</v>

3975
01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Like I would ask Rhonda,</v>

3976
01:42:19.531 --> 01:42:20.310
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like,</v>

3977
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:22.050
<v Speaker 3>aren't you afraid of getting hit in the face?</v>

3978
01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Well you can't be afraid of getting hit in the face if that's what you do for a</v>

3979
01:42:25.281 --> 01:42:25.551
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

3980
01:42:25.551 --> 01:42:28.220
<v Speaker 1>But getting hit in the face is not fun.</v>

3981
01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:28.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3982
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:29.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for you either.</v>

3983
01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:30.773
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3984
01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:31.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3985
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.861
<v Speaker 3>I did that.</v>

3986
01:42:31.861 --> 01:42:32.671
<v Speaker 3>To me it would,</v>

3987
01:42:32.671 --> 01:42:33.504
<v Speaker 3>it's not so much.</v>

3988
01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:34.111
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3989
01:42:34.111 --> 01:42:34.291
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3990
01:42:34.291 --> 01:42:34.861
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fight.</v>

3991
01:42:34.861 --> 01:42:36.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a physical fighter.</v>

3992
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:37.081
<v Speaker 3>I might be a tough girl.</v>

3993
01:42:37.081 --> 01:42:39.900
<v Speaker 3>But like the idea of like either hitting someone in the face or getting hit in</v>

3994
01:42:39.901 --> 01:42:40.734
<v Speaker 3>the face,</v>

3995
01:42:40.770 --> 01:42:41.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to lose a tooth.</v>

3996
01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:42.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3997
01:42:42.191 --> 01:42:42.791
<v Speaker 1>you're smart.</v>

3998
01:42:42.791 --> 01:42:46.570
<v Speaker 1>That's why some people don't have any idea what it's like to get hit in the</v>

3999
01:42:46.571 --> 01:42:46.901
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

4000
01:42:46.901 --> 01:42:47.711
<v Speaker 1>And so they like,</v>

4001
01:42:47.711 --> 01:42:49.480
<v Speaker 1>think of it like very nonchalantly.</v>

4002
01:42:49.610 --> 01:42:49.821
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4003
01:42:49.821 --> 01:42:52.220
<v Speaker 3>it's weird that you say that because I've had this conversation with,</v>

4004
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:54.110
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly my Italian male friends,</v>

4005
01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.760
<v Speaker 3>but he ain't trying to say,</v>

4006
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:57.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what road headquarters.</v>

4007
01:42:57.230 --> 01:42:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Italian one quarter Irish.</v>

4008
01:42:58.340 --> 01:42:58.581
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4009
01:42:58.581 --> 01:43:00.020
<v Speaker 3>well that explains a lot.</v>

4010
01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:01.813
<v Speaker 3>Just kidding.</v>

4011
01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4012
01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:03.740
<v Speaker 3>but there is that thing,</v>

4013
01:43:03.741 --> 01:43:05.210
<v Speaker 3>that mentality where,</v>

4014
01:43:05.211 --> 01:43:06.920
<v Speaker 3>and I think because I hang out with enough men,</v>

4015
01:43:07.130 --> 01:43:08.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm able to identify this.</v>

4016
01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:10.161
<v Speaker 3>There's certain,</v>

4017
01:43:10.161 --> 01:43:12.830
<v Speaker 3>there's like a certain attitude by guys who have never been hit in the face</v>

4018
01:43:12.831 --> 01:43:13.664
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

4019
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:14.840
<v Speaker 3>And it's not always,</v>

4020
01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:18.260
<v Speaker 3>but there's a certain cockiness where like no one knows what fear is.</v>

4021
01:43:18.261 --> 01:43:19.610
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever instilled fear on them.</v>

4022
01:43:19.730 --> 01:43:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4023
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:20.900
<v Speaker 3>So they're assholes and you're like,</v>

4024
01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:24.140
<v Speaker 3>what do you need to do is go out and have someone beat the fuck out of you so</v>

4025
01:43:24.141 --> 01:43:27.320
<v Speaker 3>you can show a little bit of humility and not be such a dick all the time.</v>

4026
01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Some people need to get beaten up.</v>

4027
01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:30.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not for girls,</v>

4028
01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:30.471
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>

4029
01:43:30.471 --> 01:43:31.011
<v Speaker 3>I need to get beaten up.</v>

4030
01:43:31.011 --> 01:43:34.910
<v Speaker 3>But some guys like just in the way that they address other men are the way that</v>

4031
01:43:34.911 --> 01:43:35.421
<v Speaker 3>they act.</v>

4032
01:43:35.421 --> 01:43:35.781
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

4033
01:43:35.781 --> 01:43:36.614
<v Speaker 3>you've never,</v>

4034
01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:39.410
<v Speaker 3>you've never been humiliated or taken down a peg ever.</v>

4035
01:43:39.710 --> 01:43:40.550
<v Speaker 3>You're totally right.</v>

4036
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:41.500
<v Speaker 3>That's the word.</v>

4037
01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what I think martial arts are very important for men growing up.</v>

4038
01:43:44.291 --> 01:43:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Not because they need to get beat up just because they need to control their</v>

4039
01:43:47.621 --> 01:43:47.981
<v Speaker 1>ego.</v>

4040
01:43:47.981 --> 01:43:51.470
<v Speaker 1>And one of the best ways to control your ego is to put yourself into incredibly</v>

4041
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 1>difficult</v>

4042
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.843
<v Speaker 2>situations,</v>

4043
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.170
<v Speaker 2>tests your character,</v>

4044
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:57.950
<v Speaker 2>and then you have confidence so you don't behave in that way in the first place.</v>

4045
01:43:58.010 --> 01:44:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of the way guys behave that sort of delusional behavior.</v>

4046
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:03.140
<v Speaker 2>It's almost a convinced themselves.</v>

4047
01:44:03.141 --> 01:44:07.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like this weird chest pub puffy thing and it comes out a lot of times when</v>

4048
01:44:07.401 --> 01:44:09.980
<v Speaker 2>they're drunk because they don't have confidence.</v>

4049
01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the real confidence that someone who's been tested and</v>

4050
01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:17.060
<v Speaker 2>understands their character and knows their limitations.</v>

4051
01:44:17.061 --> 01:44:17.894
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4052
01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I think there's two schools of thought because what you just said was you were</v>

4053
01:44:21.170 --> 01:44:23.180
<v Speaker 2>saying how they have to convince themselves.</v>

4054
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:23.961
<v Speaker 2>So there's almost,</v>

4055
01:44:23.961 --> 01:44:25.250
<v Speaker 2>there's like the way of the warrior,</v>

4056
01:44:25.251 --> 01:44:26.031
<v Speaker 2>which is the one you're talking about.</v>

4057
01:44:26.031 --> 01:44:28.160
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like the used car salesman where it's like,</v>

4058
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

4059
01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:32.370
<v Speaker 2>like ABC baby and I'm taking seminars and if I don't believe at first,</v>

4060
01:44:32.371 --> 01:44:33.230
<v Speaker 2>then who else will,</v>

4061
01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:38.000
<v Speaker 2>and it's almost like that like sort of unconscious delusional mentality where</v>

4062
01:44:38.001 --> 01:44:39.650
<v Speaker 2>like light it might like,</v>

4063
01:44:39.651 --> 01:44:40.800
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like if you lie to yourself,</v>

4064
01:44:40.801 --> 01:44:42.260
<v Speaker 2>then you can lie to others that works.</v>

4065
01:44:42.261 --> 01:44:43.300
<v Speaker 2>If you're on a plane,</v>

4066
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:46.730
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to pick up a check and then get into a relationship with her for a</v>

4067
01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:48.750
<v Speaker 2>year as a friend and then three months while you're fucking her.</v>

4068
01:44:48.751 --> 01:44:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean just that can work.</v>

4069
01:44:50.211 --> 01:44:51.044
<v Speaker 2>Go bulldogs.</v>

4070
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:54.800
<v Speaker 2>He just got to know how to sling it.</v>

4071
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4072
01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:56.233
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

4073
01:44:56.250 --> 01:44:57.830
<v Speaker 2>It does work on occasionally,</v>

4074
01:44:57.831 --> 01:44:58.664
<v Speaker 2>even with smart,</v>

4075
01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:01.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what's the most impressive thing about his accomplishment.</v>

4076
01:45:01.071 --> 01:45:01.904
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>

4077
01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:02.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4078
01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:04.280
<v Speaker 2>you're one of my smartest friends.</v>

4079
01:45:04.281 --> 01:45:04.910
<v Speaker 2>You're smart,</v>

4080
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:05.631
<v Speaker 2>you're very smart.</v>

4081
01:45:05.631 --> 01:45:06.464
<v Speaker 2>You're very quick.</v>

4082
01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:10.070
<v Speaker 2>And for a guy to trick you like that and a trick you over a long period of time</v>

4083
01:45:10.071 --> 01:45:10.904
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of,</v>

4084
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:11.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4085
01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:14.540
<v Speaker 2>a lot of questions along the way where you hit some bumps I guess.</v>

4086
01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:15.291
<v Speaker 2>But here's the other thing.</v>

4087
01:45:15.291 --> 01:45:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't even know if the word is trick and I'll,</v>

4088
01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean I totally fell for it.</v>

4089
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:19.743
<v Speaker 2>The shit out of you.</v>

4090
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:21.470
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

4091
01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I guess it is tricky,</v>

4092
01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:24.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's also one that he's like,</v>

4093
01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:26.270
<v Speaker 2>why would I question that in my life?</v>

4094
01:45:26.271 --> 01:45:28.550
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever lied about where they went to school that I knew of.</v>

4095
01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:32.210
<v Speaker 2>These are not lies that in society we're told to look out for.</v>

4096
01:45:32.211 --> 01:45:33.350
<v Speaker 2>It'd be one like everyone's like,</v>

4097
01:45:33.351 --> 01:45:34.250
<v Speaker 2>does he have another family?</v>

4098
01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think about like your school.</v>

4099
01:45:36.771 --> 01:45:37.401
<v Speaker 2>Like who cares?</v>

4100
01:45:37.401 --> 01:45:39.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like lying about your blood type and let's not just his,</v>

4101
01:45:39.710 --> 01:45:41.690
<v Speaker 2>he lied about where most likely,</v>

4102
01:45:41.691 --> 01:45:42.380
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest,</v>

4103
01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:45.890
<v Speaker 2>most likely lied about his mom having cancer because you were dating a big heart</v>

4104
01:45:45.891 --> 01:45:46.520
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

4105
01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:47.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4106
01:45:47.001 --> 01:45:48.680
<v Speaker 2>and he most likely lied.</v>

4107
01:45:48.710 --> 01:45:48.861
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4108
01:45:48.861 --> 01:45:52.220
<v Speaker 2>he definitely lied about the skeleton bones part about England.</v>

4109
01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:54.470
<v Speaker 2>He lied about his house twice.</v>

4110
01:45:54.471 --> 01:45:55.071
<v Speaker 2>He lied about,</v>

4111
01:45:55.071 --> 01:45:55.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4112
01:45:55.450 --> 01:45:58.360
<v Speaker 2>he sounds like a guy who just lies at a d.</v>

4113
01:45:58.410 --> 01:46:02.120
<v Speaker 2>It means probably gotten laid doing that his whole life.</v>

4114
01:46:02.210 --> 01:46:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's gotten late enough.</v>

4115
01:46:03.381 --> 01:46:04.370
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it was.</v>

4116
01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking about it.</v>

4117
01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:07.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4118
01:46:07.670 --> 01:46:08.600
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think it's,</v>

4119
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:11.750
<v Speaker 2>he's not like I totally got tricked.</v>

4120
01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not above admitting that.</v>

4121
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:15.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm also not above admitting that.</v>

4122
01:46:15.171 --> 01:46:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I think when you love someone,</v>

4123
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:18.740
<v Speaker 2>you're judgment is clouded and I didn't,</v>

4124
01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:21.170
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know the scope of what that could be.</v>

4125
01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:23.680
<v Speaker 2>I didn't in a billion years I wouldn't have thought that that was really,</v>

4126
01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a joke that like,</v>

4127
01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:25.131
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4128
01:46:25.131 --> 01:46:26.270
<v Speaker 2>we can't find his yell diploma,</v>

4129
01:46:26.271 --> 01:46:27.070
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

4130
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:28.880
<v Speaker 2>but you almost don't want it to be true.</v>

4131
01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:32.090
<v Speaker 2>There's the thing that's going to happen in our lifetimes,</v>

4132
01:46:32.091 --> 01:46:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I believe were lying is going to be a thing of the past.</v>

4133
01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:37.670
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe that we can't anymore.</v>

4134
01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I think technology is moving us along that trail where there's gonna come a</v>

4135
01:46:42.021 --> 01:46:45.290
<v Speaker 2>point in time where we're going to have a connection with each other.</v>

4136
01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.540
<v Speaker 2>That's not as simple as just talking.</v>

4137
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:49.650
<v Speaker 2>I think they're on the way.</v>

4138
01:46:49.651 --> 01:46:51.900
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that new Google thing that they came up with?</v>

4139
01:46:52.110 --> 01:46:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Their Google is working on a contact lens right now that monitors your glucose</v>

4140
01:46:57.181 --> 01:47:02.010
<v Speaker 2>levels for diabetics and does all kinds of weird shit like the same along the</v>

4141
01:47:02.011 --> 01:47:03.510
<v Speaker 2>same lines of Google glass,</v>

4142
01:47:03.511 --> 01:47:05.890
<v Speaker 2>but far more complex and,</v>

4143
01:47:05.891 --> 01:47:06.131
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4144
01:47:06.131 --> 01:47:10.920
<v Speaker 2>and analyzes your body when we're dealing with these kind of technological human</v>

4145
01:47:10.921 --> 01:47:14.100
<v Speaker 2>interfaces is symbiotic relationship with people and electronics.</v>

4146
01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.000
<v Speaker 2>We're event,</v>

4147
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.300
<v Speaker 2>it's eventually gonna make its way to communication and then I think that just</v>

4148
01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:18.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4149
01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:21.360
<v Speaker 2>the lines of communication and it's one of the things that they've been</v>

4150
01:47:21.361 --> 01:47:25.740
<v Speaker 2>speculating on that we're going to be able to read each other's minds.</v>

4151
01:47:25.741 --> 01:47:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

4152
01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:29.460
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be able to exchange thought through Wifi there.</v>

4153
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:30.120
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

4154
01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.210
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw something recently about that like telekinesis,</v>

4155
01:47:33.211 --> 01:47:36.600
<v Speaker 2>but like mind control and be able to move things just because,</v>

4156
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:39.210
<v Speaker 2>but if that contact lens can manage your glucose levels,</v>

4157
01:47:39.330 --> 01:47:40.800
<v Speaker 2>that means it can monitor other levels,</v>

4158
01:47:40.930 --> 01:47:42.480
<v Speaker 2>which means it could be a lie detector test.</v>

4159
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:42.811
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4160
01:47:42.811 --> 01:47:44.700
<v Speaker 2>That's a walking truth serum in your motherfucking,</v>

4161
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

4162
01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

4163
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

4164
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4165
01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:48.750
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to be able to see whether or not someone has it on or off.</v>

4166
01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:49.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

4167
01:47:49.201 --> 01:47:50.520
<v Speaker 2>You have your lie detector blocked,</v>

4168
01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:53.730
<v Speaker 2>like you'll be able to see like blocks almost like Facebook set to private.</v>

4169
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4170
01:47:54.450 --> 01:47:54.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4171
01:47:54.721 --> 01:47:55.890
<v Speaker 2>If they have is her Twitter back,</v>

4172
01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:58.410
<v Speaker 2>they have a big lock on their Twitter Twitter page.</v>

4173
01:47:58.450 --> 01:47:59.490
<v Speaker 2>That's also shit by the way,</v>

4174
01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:00.211
<v Speaker 2>like that's my other thing.</v>

4175
01:48:00.211 --> 01:48:00.900
<v Speaker 2>When people rights,</v>

4176
01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:02.010
<v Speaker 2>I tweet about this the other day.</v>

4177
01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:03.570
<v Speaker 2>People write something Shitty to you,</v>

4178
01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:05.790
<v Speaker 2>but then they have like a locked or private profile.</v>

4179
01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:09.120
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to erase that person mean like you don't get to have an opinion.</v>

4180
01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:09.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4181
01:48:09.361 --> 01:48:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I blocked them anyway.</v>

4182
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I blocked everyone who says anything even remotely Shitty,</v>

4183
01:48:13.050 --> 01:48:14.400
<v Speaker 2>if that's how you're trying to respond,</v>

4184
01:48:14.401 --> 01:48:15.240
<v Speaker 2>get me to respond.</v>

4185
01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Or are you just trolling or whatever you're trying to do is one thing.</v>

4186
01:48:17.851 --> 01:48:18.000
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>

4187
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.260
<v Speaker 2>you have a legitimate criticism.</v>

4188
01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate legitimate criticisms cause you know,</v>

4189
01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:23.820
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4190
01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:26.040
<v Speaker 2>even if I don't agree with their assessment,</v>

4191
01:48:26.041 --> 01:48:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that objectively it's,</v>

4192
01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:28.230
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4193
01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:30.480
<v Speaker 2>it's a very valuable asset,</v>

4194
01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:34.500
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're intelligent to hear and intelligent person's take on you,</v>

4195
01:48:34.530 --> 01:48:36.450
<v Speaker 2>even if it's negative and intelligent fan who wants to,</v>

4196
01:48:36.451 --> 01:48:37.380
<v Speaker 2>they just want to interact.</v>

4197
01:48:37.381 --> 01:48:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4198
01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:38.820
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

4199
01:48:38.821 --> 01:48:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I actually once in a while depend on people.</v>

4200
01:48:40.741 --> 01:48:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4201
01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge grammar stickler.</v>

4202
01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:44.580
<v Speaker 2>So when people write back and I'll make a mistake,</v>

4203
01:48:44.581 --> 01:48:45.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll write the wrong thing and they'll correct it.</v>

4204
01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll go back and I'll erase that tweet and repost it.</v>

4205
01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:48.640
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

4206
01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4207
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:50.520
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't bother me one bit and I'll say thanks.</v>

4208
01:48:51.090 --> 01:48:51.841
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for the heads up.</v>

4209
01:48:51.841 --> 01:48:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

4210
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:55.170
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times on my phone to my eyes are starting to go to shit too.</v>

4211
01:48:55.170 --> 01:48:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm 46 now and um,</v>

4212
01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4213
01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll wear reading glasses if I'm reading a book now over the last like year,</v>

4214
01:49:00.361 --> 01:49:01.230
<v Speaker 2>this is the new thing.</v>

4215
01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:03.300
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm looking at Twitter,</v>

4216
01:49:03.301 --> 01:49:03.900
<v Speaker 2>if uh,</v>

4217
01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:05.640
<v Speaker 2>like I'm on a plane or something like that,</v>

4218
01:49:05.641 --> 01:49:07.110
<v Speaker 2>if I'm looking at it on my phone,</v>

4219
01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.153
<v Speaker 2>it started like,</v>

4220
01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:10.410
<v Speaker 2>I can read this like loud and clear.</v>

4221
01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.460
<v Speaker 2>No problem whatsoever.</v>

4222
01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:15.510
<v Speaker 2>But weird little small things are starting to get blurry.</v>

4223
01:49:15.690 --> 01:49:17.610
<v Speaker 2>They're starting to get blurry in some weird way.</v>

4224
01:49:17.611 --> 01:49:19.010
<v Speaker 2>So I'll occasionally fuck up a word,</v>

4225
01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:20.610
<v Speaker 2>not realize it until I post it.</v>

4226
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:21.440
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

4227
01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.890
<v Speaker 2>God dammit the worst.</v>

4228
01:49:22.891 --> 01:49:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you'd like or on Instagram is the worst because you can edit it.</v>

4229
01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:26.701
<v Speaker 2>We deleted,</v>

4230
01:49:26.701 --> 01:49:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I did it the other day.</v>

4231
01:49:27.751 --> 01:49:28.920
<v Speaker 2>I wrote silly butch,</v>

4232
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:30.240
<v Speaker 2>but I meant silly bitch.</v>

4233
01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.330
<v Speaker 2>But my phone corrected it to silly butch.</v>

4234
01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

4235

<v Speaker 2>She said Shit a thousand times.</v>

4238
01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Why You keep riding shot?</v>

4239
01:49:39.991 --> 01:49:40.501
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4240
01:49:40.501 --> 01:49:40.801

4243
01:49:45.541 --> 01:49:45.871
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

4244
01:49:45.871 --> 01:49:49.840
<v Speaker 2>these are both legitimate words that are used often and it's just got this</v>

4245
01:49:49.841 --> 01:49:50.674
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

4250
01:49:54.450 --> 01:49:55.211
<v Speaker 2>I'm upset.</v>

4251
01:49:55.211 --> 01:49:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm so she'd,</v>

4252
01:49:56.370 --> 01:49:57.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm playing with it the entire time.</v>

4253
01:49:57.611 --> 01:49:57.850
<v Speaker 2>We're on the,</v>

4254
01:49:57.850 --> 01:49:58.060
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4255
01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:59.070
<v Speaker 2>I have not had it off.</v>

4256
01:49:59.130 --> 01:49:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4257
01:49:59.530 --> 01:50:00.281
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're doing.</v>

4258
01:50:00.281 --> 01:50:00.731
<v Speaker 2>If anybody,</v>

4259
01:50:00.731 --> 01:50:02.380
<v Speaker 2>but I can't read this far away by tweets.</v>

4260
01:50:02.381 --> 01:50:02.580
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

4261
01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:03.730
<v Speaker 2>you can't read these in the show.</v>

4262
01:50:03.731 --> 01:50:04.720
<v Speaker 2>I can't read from this far away.</v>

4263
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:05.583
<v Speaker 2>Are Your eyes going?</v>

4264
01:50:05.850 --> 01:50:06.683
<v Speaker 2>They were gone.</v>

4265
01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I had gone and I patch when I was a little,</v>

4266
01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:11.890
<v Speaker 2>you had to wear an eye patch and I have a one week I and it knows you're a</v>

4267
01:50:11.891 --> 01:50:12.724
<v Speaker 2>pirate.</v>

4268
01:50:12.850 --> 01:50:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

4269
01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Everything I could read.</v>

4270
01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:15.190
<v Speaker 2>If I do that,</v>

4271
01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I can read it.</v>

4272
01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:17.013
<v Speaker 2>Barely.</v>

4273
01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4274
01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:18.431
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

4275
01:50:18.431 --> 01:50:21.010
<v Speaker 2>I told you before the show that I wanted to talk to you about this video that I</v>

4276
01:50:21.011 --> 01:50:26.011
<v Speaker 2>saw because traditional male and female roles and the arguments,</v>

4277
01:50:26.171 --> 01:50:29.770
<v Speaker 2>the traditional male female arguments are so fucking stupid to me.</v>

4278
01:50:29.810 --> 01:50:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I get so upset when people get in.</v>

4279
01:50:32.831 --> 01:50:36.100
<v Speaker 2>These men do this and women want this.</v>

4280
01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Women why Comedy Act No.</v>

4281
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Like this comedy.</v>

4282
01:50:39.911 --> 01:50:40.744
<v Speaker 2>But then there's these,</v>

4283
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:45.750
<v Speaker 2>these generally's generalizations that one of the things that I hate about talk</v>

4284
01:50:45.851 --> 01:50:46.870
<v Speaker 2>shows or about,</v>

4285
01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:47.201
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4286
01:50:47.201 --> 01:50:47.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4287
01:50:47.501 --> 01:50:51.240
<v Speaker 2>one of those CNN things where they have people debate and I split screen the</v>

4288
01:50:51.241 --> 01:50:52.810
<v Speaker 2>split screen debates or God,</v>

4289
01:50:52.811 --> 01:50:54.910
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking five minutes or whatever they are.</v>

4290
01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.910
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get to the heart of any matter.</v>

4291
01:50:57.911 --> 01:51:02.911
<v Speaker 2>And most of the time there's a little bit of correctness on both sides.</v>

4292
01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Both sides have points,</v>

4293
01:51:05.590 --> 01:51:06.340
<v Speaker 2>both sides of,</v>

4294
01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:08.140
<v Speaker 2>and everyone's just trying to win.</v>

4295
01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:08.651
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>

4296
01:51:08.651 --> 01:51:10.690
<v Speaker 2>this video that I sent that Jamie,</v>

4297
01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:11.553
<v Speaker 2>you got that video right?</v>

4298
01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:12.880
<v Speaker 2>This videos?</v>

4299
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

4300
01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example of this.</v>

4301
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:16.001
<v Speaker 2>The weirdness.</v>

4302
01:51:16.001 --> 01:51:17.230
<v Speaker 2>You could see it up here and you'll hear it.</v>

4303
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:18.103
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] headphones.</v>

4304
01:51:18.130 --> 01:51:21.820
<v Speaker 2>The perfect example of the fucking weirdness that exists in,</v>

4305
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:26.830
<v Speaker 2>in human beings when it comes to male,</v>

4306
01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:31.250
<v Speaker 2>female relationships are women unhappier because of money.</v>

4307
01:51:31.251 --> 01:51:33.190
<v Speaker 2>And now this is the debate that these,</v>

4308
01:51:33.191 --> 01:51:33.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4309
01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:34.560
<v Speaker 2>these people were having</v>

4310
01:51:34.930 --> 01:51:39.930
<v Speaker 6>no study out today that says women become on happy as they get older.</v>

4311
01:51:39.931 --> 01:51:40.171
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4312
01:51:40.171 --> 01:51:41.370
<v Speaker 6>the flip side,</v>

4313
01:51:41.670 --> 01:51:44.100
<v Speaker 6>men get happier as life goes on.</v>

4314
01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Pause it for a second.</v>

4315
01:51:45.890 --> 01:51:46.723
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

4316
01:51:46.730 --> 01:51:47.241
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

4317
01:51:47.241 --> 01:51:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate studies.</v>

4318
01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:50.233
<v Speaker 2>Those kinds of stuff.</v>

4319
01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:51.291
<v Speaker 2>Study was from,</v>

4320
01:51:51.291 --> 01:51:51.741
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4321
01:51:51.741 --> 01:51:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind clinical studies on drugs and chemicals and you know,</v>

4322
01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:56.480
<v Speaker 2>those things make sense,</v>

4323
01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:00.340
<v Speaker 2>but study fine said women are sadder and men are happier.</v>

4324
01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Survey I conducted on the toilet this morning,</v>

4325
01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:06.530
<v Speaker 2>I find those things to be bullshit ways to start conversations about things and</v>

4326
01:52:06.531 --> 01:52:09.500
<v Speaker 2>provoke arguments that are designed to get ratings on fucking shitty talk show.</v>

4327
01:52:09.501 --> 01:52:09.770
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4328
01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:09.981
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

4329
01:52:09.981 --> 01:52:11.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what a lot of it is.</v>

4330
01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:11.990
<v Speaker 2>We are the word study and we're like,</v>

4331
01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

4332
01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:13.340
<v Speaker 2>scientifically legitimate.</v>

4333
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:13.521
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4334
01:52:13.521 --> 01:52:14.354
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

4335
01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:15.240
<v Speaker 2>who they talked to,</v>

4336
01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:15.831
<v Speaker 2>did they talk to you?</v>

4337
01:52:15.831 --> 01:52:17.280
<v Speaker 2>Eliza swessinger did not help to me.</v>

4338
01:52:17.281 --> 01:52:18.320
<v Speaker 2>He didn't talk to me either.</v>

4339
01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:19.221
<v Speaker 2>They didn't talk to anybody.</v>

4340
01:52:19.221 --> 01:52:23.420
<v Speaker 2>I know I fucking hate surveys because I think that surveys do not give you an</v>

4341
01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:27.230
<v Speaker 2>accurate assessment of what most people want or the belief they give you an</v>

4342
01:52:27.231 --> 01:52:31.130
<v Speaker 2>assessment of people dumb enough to answer surveys who were at like an outdoor</v>

4343
01:52:31.131 --> 01:52:31.590
<v Speaker 2>mall.</v>

4344
01:52:31.590 --> 01:52:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4345
01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:32.830
<v Speaker 2>like a dollar the answer yet.</v>

4346
01:52:32.831 --> 01:52:33.664
<v Speaker 2>And they're idiots.</v>

4347
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:35.720
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part you're dealing with dummies.</v>

4348
01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4349
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.420
<v Speaker 6>Couple of economists by the way.</v>

4350
01:52:38.421 --> 01:52:40.250
<v Speaker 6>They say it happens when we eat.</v>

4351
01:52:40.251 --> 01:52:43.670
<v Speaker 6>Christmas wig looks great and all of the major factors.</v>

4352
01:52:43.671 --> 01:52:46.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm coming down all about money now.</v>

4353
01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 6>What's that all about?</v>

4354
01:52:47.781 --> 01:52:49.280
<v Speaker 6>We're going to the faded mark.</v>

4355
01:52:49.281 --> 01:52:54.140
<v Speaker 6>Rudolph is a no nonsense man and Tracy burns are Fox business reporter joins me</v>

4356
01:52:54.141 --> 01:52:55.610
<v Speaker 6>to tell us what's really going on.</v>

4357
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:57.100
<v Speaker 7>Tracy.</v>

4358
01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:57.933
<v Speaker 7>This is true.</v>

4359
01:52:58.890 --> 01:52:59.760
<v Speaker 6>Come on.</v>

4360
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:00.841
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

4361
01:53:00.841 --> 01:53:01.674
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

4362
01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:03.630
<v Speaker 6>they know you've missed me,</v>

4363
01:53:03.631 --> 01:53:04.050
<v Speaker 6>mark.</v>

4364
01:53:04.050 --> 01:53:04.621
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

4365
01:53:04.621 --> 01:53:08.850
<v Speaker 6>this study was conducted by mostly men and when men conduct anything,</v>

4366
01:53:08.851 --> 01:53:12.420
<v Speaker 6>they talk about their finances because men judge themselves by this,</v>

4367
01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:14.370
<v Speaker 6>the size of their wallet.</v>

4368
01:53:14.371 --> 01:53:15.204
<v Speaker 6>Toys,</v>

4369
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:16.290
<v Speaker 6>dare I say</v>

4370
01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:16.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4371
01:53:16.730 --> 01:53:17.540
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

4372
01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:18.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4373
01:53:18.430 --> 01:53:20.140
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that when men do this,</v>

4374
01:53:20.141 --> 01:53:20.974
<v Speaker 1>men do that.</v>

4375
01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Not all men do that,</v>

4376
01:53:22.481 --> 01:53:23.020
<v Speaker 1>dummy.</v>

4377
01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:23.853
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that,</v>

4378
01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:24.631
<v Speaker 3>do you have to mean,</v>

4379
01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:24.841
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

4380
01:53:24.841 --> 01:53:25.320
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>

4381
01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:27.060
<v Speaker 3>if we harped on specifics,</v>

4382
01:53:27.061 --> 01:53:27.990
<v Speaker 3>we would never get any worse.</v>

4383
01:53:27.991 --> 01:53:30.420
<v Speaker 3>So it's not an incorrect generalization.</v>

4384
01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:32.650
<v Speaker 3>I do think men do.</v>

4385
01:53:32.651 --> 01:53:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean most see fortune 500 company Ceos are men and I do think that's a huge</v>

4386
01:53:37.141 --> 01:53:37.771
<v Speaker 3>thing for men.</v>

4387
01:53:37.771 --> 01:53:38.400
<v Speaker 3>That is how it it.</v>

4388
01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:41.300
<v Speaker 3>He because we can't fight with swords and shields anymore.</v>

4389
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Like that is a way that men judge each other.</v>

4390
01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:44.503
<v Speaker 1>They certainly do.</v>

4391
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:45.530
<v Speaker 1>And women do as well.</v>

4392
01:53:45.531 --> 01:53:46.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's this guy's point.</v>

4393
01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Some women do some.</v>

4394
01:53:48.730 --> 01:53:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4395
01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:53.810
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that this study was definitely done by men and it's judge judging</v>

4396
01:53:53.811 --> 01:53:54.350
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

4397
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:56.510
<v Speaker 1>The women are unhappy because they get older.</v>

4398
01:53:56.511 --> 01:53:56.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4399
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.890
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're judging.</v>

4400
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:58.161
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4401
01:53:58.161 --> 01:53:58.371
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

4402
01:53:58.371 --> 01:53:58.720
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

4403
01:53:58.720 --> 01:53:58.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4404
01:53:58.970 --> 01:53:59.701
<v Speaker 1>let's let it play out.</v>

4405
01:53:59.701 --> 01:54:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I just let it play out because it's,</v>

4406
01:54:01.011 --> 01:54:01.281
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4407
01:54:01.281 --> 01:54:02.114
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating</v>

4408
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:03.600
<v Speaker 6>and it's makes you happy.</v>

4409
01:54:03.601 --> 01:54:06.780
<v Speaker 6>If they were to ask other questions in this study about spirituality,</v>

4410
01:54:06.781 --> 01:54:09.810
<v Speaker 6>about the other aspects of our lives that women would have taken over.</v>

4411
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.291
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4412
01:54:10.291 --> 01:54:10.741
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

4413
01:54:10.741 --> 01:54:13.740
<v Speaker 6>a woman has her sexual prime at 35 things get much better for us.</v>

4414
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:14.091
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

4415
01:54:14.091 --> 01:54:16.110
<v Speaker 6>I made 35 this is good.</v>

4416
01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:18.013
<v Speaker 6>Alright.</v>

4417
01:54:18.630 --> 01:54:18.990
<v Speaker 6>Alright,</v>

4418
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:20.940
<v Speaker 6>go nuts cause I know you're going to go nuts.</v>

4419
01:54:22.050 --> 01:54:22.883
<v Speaker 7>Good one.</v>

4420
01:54:23.070 --> 01:54:23.280
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4421
01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:24.091
<v Speaker 7>Well first of all,</v>

4422
01:54:24.091 --> 01:54:28.080
<v Speaker 7>you're presuming that the unhappiness and women begins in middle age.</v>

4423
01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.900
<v Speaker 7>I'd say it starts when she's a little girl.</v>

4424
01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:34.380
<v Speaker 7>When she stopped that happiness derives from shoes,</v>

4425
01:54:34.381 --> 01:54:35.071
<v Speaker 7>jewelry,</v>

4426
01:54:35.071 --> 01:54:35.461
<v Speaker 7>Boob,</v>

4427
01:54:35.461 --> 01:54:35.941
<v Speaker 7>jobs,</v>

4428
01:54:35.941 --> 01:54:36.590
<v Speaker 7>and pedal.</v>

4429
01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:37.423
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4430
01:54:37.450 --> 01:54:38.180
<v Speaker 1>stop right there.</v>

4431
01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4432
01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:39.730
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking idiot too.</v>

4433
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:43.250
<v Speaker 1>That's an idiotic thing to say that they're unhappy from the time they're a</v>

4434
01:54:43.251 --> 01:54:43.880
<v Speaker 1>little girl.</v>

4435
01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:44.031
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4436
01:54:44.031 --> 01:54:44.211
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4437
01:54:44.211 --> 01:54:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are happy as fuck.</v>

4438
01:54:45.501 --> 01:54:46.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4439
01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:50.270
<v Speaker 1>he's weird generalizations to try to prove your point or to make like your</v>

4440
01:54:50.271 --> 01:54:50.721
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

4441
01:54:50.721 --> 01:54:51.650
<v Speaker 1>the correct one.</v>

4442
01:54:51.651 --> 01:54:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Like it's men versus women.</v>

4443
01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:53.930
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

4444
01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Versus all women.</v>

4445
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:56.390
<v Speaker 1>It's so dumb.</v>

4446
01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4447
01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:58.430
<v Speaker 1>First it drives me crazy.</v>

4448
01:54:58.460 --> 01:54:59.230
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4449
01:54:59.230 --> 01:55:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I disagree with you.</v>

4450
01:55:00.251 --> 01:55:01.590
<v Speaker 3>I do think we need generalizations.</v>

4451
01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:03.610
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't have comedy without generalizations.</v>

4452
01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:03.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4453
01:55:03.791 --> 01:55:06.460
<v Speaker 1>we have some generalizations for the sake of comedy,</v>

4454
01:55:06.490 --> 01:55:07.510
<v Speaker 1>but it comes up.</v>

4455
01:55:07.630 --> 01:55:10.600
<v Speaker 1>That guy's awful and that woman is off.</v>

4456
01:55:10.601 --> 01:55:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Like those people are horrible people.</v>

4457
01:55:12.611 --> 01:55:13.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a horrible yeah,</v>

4458
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.721
<v Speaker 3>Bay,</v>

4459
01:55:13.721 --> 01:55:14.860
<v Speaker 3>but they're horrible people.</v>

4460
01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4461
01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:18.720
<v Speaker 3>he is not wrong and it is,</v>

4462
01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4463
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:20.021
<v Speaker 3>he's not wrong.</v>

4464
01:55:20.021 --> 01:55:20.801
<v Speaker 3>It does start younger.</v>

4465
01:55:20.801 --> 01:55:25.801
<v Speaker 3>I do think girls are conditioned to be less happy with themselves and to compete</v>

4466
01:55:25.931 --> 01:55:28.750
<v Speaker 3>with each other in an unhealthy way from a very young age.</v>

4467
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:30.670
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think women are unhappy.</v>

4468
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:32.290
<v Speaker 3>But I do think that there are,</v>

4469
01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:33.673
<v Speaker 3>there are more,</v>

4470
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:36.730
<v Speaker 3>there's more variables that women have to deal with in terms of like body</v>

4471
01:55:36.731 --> 01:55:37.564
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>

4472
01:55:37.690 --> 01:55:38.411
<v Speaker 3>competition,</v>

4473
01:55:38.411 --> 01:55:39.244
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

4474
01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:40.780
<v Speaker 3>that originates from women.</v>

4475
01:55:40.781 --> 01:55:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Less about men.</v>

4476
01:55:41.711 --> 01:55:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Like we think we're always competing with men.</v>

4477
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 3>We're really competing</v>

4478
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.611
<v Speaker 2>with other women.</v>

4479
01:55:44.611 --> 01:55:46.380
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think he's wrong and saying that,</v>

4480
01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:47.550
<v Speaker 2>but he's saying there,</v>

4481
01:55:47.850 --> 01:55:48.061
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4482
01:55:48.061 --> 01:55:48.894
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely awful.</v>

4483
01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.640
<v Speaker 2>But they're saying that they're unhappy.</v>

4484
01:55:50.641 --> 01:55:51.870
<v Speaker 2>He's awful in these,</v>

4485
01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:52.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4486
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:53.570
<v Speaker 2>it's like these are the,</v>

4487
01:55:53.571 --> 01:55:55.080
<v Speaker 2>also these are such inflammatory,</v>

4488
01:55:55.081 --> 01:55:55.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4489
01:55:55.261 --> 01:55:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to judge any of these people because it's not a real conversation</v>

4490
01:55:58.150 --> 01:56:02.640
<v Speaker 2>that it's awful in these inflammatory bursts of information.</v>

4491
01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:05.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like at a certain point in time,</v>

4492
01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:06.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4493
01:56:06.151 --> 01:56:11.151
<v Speaker 2>you have to stop doing these fucking five minute conversations translates to the</v>

4494
01:56:11.311 --> 01:56:13.530
<v Speaker 2>carpet warehouse business.</v>

4495
01:56:13.531 --> 01:56:15.770
<v Speaker 2>We're here on Fox business trying to get to the heart of the matter.</v>

4496
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Why girls are unhappy.</v>

4497
01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4498
01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:19.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all garbage.</v>

4499
01:56:19.410 --> 01:56:19.771
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4500
01:56:19.771 --> 01:56:20.310
<v Speaker 2>most of this,</v>

4501
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:22.950
<v Speaker 2>all of this is just to to pay for advertising.</v>

4502
01:56:22.970 --> 01:56:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4503
01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:24.053
<v Speaker 2>Like a buzzfeed,</v>

4504
01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.400
<v Speaker 2>like top 10 top 10 brick colors.</v>

4505
01:56:26.401 --> 01:56:26.971
<v Speaker 2>You should see.</v>

4506
01:56:26.971 --> 01:56:29.400
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why Jennifer Aniston will never be happy.</v>

4507
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:30.263
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

4508
01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Press press play there,</v>

4509
01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

4510
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:33.610
<v Speaker 7>Interesting.</v>

4511
01:56:33.610 --> 01:56:33.911
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

4512
01:56:33.911 --> 01:56:34.391
<v Speaker 7>come on,</v>

4513
01:56:34.391 --> 01:56:35.224
<v Speaker 7>I'll Alexis.</v>

4514
01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:39.670
<v Speaker 7>And then you have boys who are taught that they're supposed to make girls happy.</v>

4515
01:56:39.730 --> 01:56:42.010
<v Speaker 7>I was on the radio two weeks ago in Greensboro,</v>

4516
01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:42.880
<v Speaker 7>North Carolina,</v>

4517
01:56:42.881 --> 01:56:45.130
<v Speaker 7>and the host related a story.</v>

4518
01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:47.680
<v Speaker 7>He overheard his son and daughter talking.</v>

4519
01:56:48.010 --> 01:56:50.080
<v Speaker 7>So brother goes to sister and says,</v>

4520
01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.640
<v Speaker 7>how come you always have money?</v>

4521
01:56:51.641 --> 01:56:52.474
<v Speaker 7>And I don't.</v>

4522
01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:53.500
<v Speaker 7>And she says,</v>

4523
01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:54.333
<v Speaker 7>that's simple.</v>

4524
01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:56.920
<v Speaker 7>I have a boyfriend and you have a girlfriend.</v>

4525
01:56:57.340 --> 01:56:58.660
<v Speaker 7>The fact of the matter is,</v>

4526
01:56:59.110 --> 01:56:59.480
<v Speaker 7>boy,</v>

4527
01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:00.110
<v Speaker 6>your pocket,</v>

4528
01:57:00.110 --> 01:57:01.520
<v Speaker 6>they're supposed to make women happy.</v>

4529
01:57:03.070 --> 01:57:04.490
<v Speaker 6>I mean the people that watch Fox,</v>

4530
01:57:05.190 --> 01:57:05.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4531
01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:07.090
<v Speaker 7>not living in the dark ages.</v>

4532
01:57:07.091 --> 01:57:07.871
<v Speaker 7>This is reality.</v>

4533
01:57:07.871 --> 01:57:10.990
<v Speaker 7>And if either of you women has ever dated women,</v>

4534
01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:12.640
<v Speaker 7>you would know what I'm talking about.</v>

4535
01:57:12.850 --> 01:57:15.110
<v Speaker 7>But you pretend that you don't know what I'm about.</v>

4536
01:57:15.590 --> 01:57:15.880
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

4537
01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:17.350
<v Speaker 7>What's happening in middle age,</v>

4538
01:57:17.890 --> 01:57:18.490
<v Speaker 7>what's happening?</v>

4539
01:57:18.490 --> 01:57:22.980
<v Speaker 7>What's happening in middle age here is that women who bring 70% of divorces are</v>

4540
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:25.780
<v Speaker 7>divorcing the men that they never wanted the marriage to begin with.</v>

4541
01:57:25.930 --> 01:57:28.060
<v Speaker 7>And so now that's what's making the men happy.</v>

4542
01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:31.120
<v Speaker 6>That's the green because we control the household spending,</v>

4543
01:57:31.121 --> 01:57:31.500
<v Speaker 6>don't we?</v>

4544
01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:33.310
<v Speaker 6>Cause we were working more than ever.</v>

4545
01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:33.580
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

4546
01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:34.850
<v Speaker 6>let's get back to the surveys.</v>

4547
01:57:35.150 --> 01:57:35.690
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4548
01:57:35.690 --> 01:57:40.330
<v Speaker 6>Because basically what they're saying is that we are happy here in our early</v>

4549
01:57:40.331 --> 01:57:45.331
<v Speaker 6>adult life and that women are more likely than men to fulfill their aspirations</v>

4550
01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:48.460
<v Speaker 6>earlier related to material goods and family.</v>

4551
01:57:48.850 --> 01:57:52.980
<v Speaker 6>That is true when you say true because you can't have a baby when you're 60 men</v>

4552
01:57:52.990 --> 01:57:54.670
<v Speaker 6>longer to figure out what they want to do in life.</v>

4553
01:57:54.770 --> 01:57:55.000
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4554
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.660
<v Speaker 6>I just think this whole notion of basing your happiness on material goods,</v>

4555
01:57:58.661 --> 01:57:59.650
<v Speaker 6>it's part of the problem.</v>

4556
01:57:59.830 --> 01:58:02.470
<v Speaker 6>Hence part of the reason that this thing was run by men in the first place.</v>

4557
01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.350
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm arguing,</v>

4558
01:58:03.730 --> 01:58:04.300
<v Speaker 6>she's right.</v>

4559
01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:05.133
<v Speaker 6>In some ways,</v>

4560
01:58:05.410 --> 01:58:06.210
<v Speaker 6>basing</v>

4561
01:58:06.210 --> 01:58:09.370
<v Speaker 2>your happiness on material possessions is pretty foolhardy,</v>

4562
01:58:09.790 --> 01:58:11.230
<v Speaker 2>but the whole men thing,</v>

4563
01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:13.060
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's run by men like no,</v>

4564
01:58:13.061 --> 01:58:15.520
<v Speaker 2>it's run by people that think in a silly way.</v>

4565
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.230
<v Speaker 2>You know this,</v>

4566
01:58:17.231 --> 01:58:19.120
<v Speaker 2>this men versus women argument,</v>

4567
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.680
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4568
01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:19.891
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4569
01:58:19.891 --> 01:58:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate those kinds of generalizations because you're railing against the</v>

4570
01:58:24.311 --> 01:58:26.770
<v Speaker 2>way that this debate was set up versus actual content.</v>

4571
01:58:26.890 --> 01:58:31.750
<v Speaker 2>While I'm reeling against these fucking squatters chickens squawking NHL that</v>

4572
01:58:33.010 --> 01:58:34.330
<v Speaker 2>she had a terrible host.</v>

4573
01:58:34.331 --> 01:58:34.641
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>

4574
01:58:34.641 --> 01:58:35.980
<v Speaker 2>The fact that I can't get a show,</v>

4575
01:58:35.981 --> 01:58:36.491
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>

4576
01:58:36.491 --> 01:58:38.200
<v Speaker 2>somebody gave this meat puppet.</v>

4577
01:58:38.230 --> 01:58:40.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you can't get a show Eliza slessinger.</v>

4578
01:58:40.361 --> 01:58:40.851
<v Speaker 2>You need a God.</v>

4579
01:58:40.851 --> 01:58:41.684
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

4580
01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:42.551
<v Speaker 2>That's what you need.</v>

4581
01:58:42.551 --> 01:58:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you do a podcast a lot the size you are.</v>

4582
01:58:44.231 --> 01:58:45.160
<v Speaker 2>You're a powerful woman.</v>

4583
01:58:45.161 --> 01:58:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Brought that up the other day to who?</v>

4584
01:58:47.250 --> 01:58:48.940
<v Speaker 2>My manager to fucking manager.</v>

4585
01:58:48.941 --> 01:58:49.774
<v Speaker 2>Just do it.</v>

4586
01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you just do it?</v>

4587
01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:51.341
<v Speaker 2>You could do it here.</v>

4588
01:58:51.341 --> 01:58:52.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you use my studio.</v>

4589
01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Can I take the hideaway?</v>

4590
01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:56.740
<v Speaker 2>You could get the throw the thing in the garbage.</v>

4591
01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Well he's my friend gave it to me so you can't throw it away.</v>

4592
01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:00.700
<v Speaker 2>You can put it away.</v>

4593
01:59:00.730 --> 01:59:01.230
<v Speaker 2>I would like to,</v>

4594
01:59:01.230 --> 01:59:02.140
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to look at it.</v>

4595
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.471
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

4596
01:59:02.471 --> 01:59:03.820
<v Speaker 2>so your issue is with the way that this,</v>

4597
01:59:03.821 --> 01:59:04.654
<v Speaker 2>I mean those people are,</v>

4598
01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you are getting,</v>

4599
01:59:06.071 --> 01:59:08.200
<v Speaker 2>you said to me earlier like why give something like bad?</v>

4600
01:59:08.201 --> 01:59:08.591
<v Speaker 2>Your energy.</v>

4601
01:59:08.591 --> 01:59:10.360
<v Speaker 2>These people are horrible and it's on Fox.</v>

4602
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:12.490
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what we were expecting.</v>

4603
01:59:12.670 --> 01:59:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4604
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:14.470
<v Speaker 2>we were expecting bad things,</v>

4605
01:59:14.471 --> 01:59:15.070
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

4606
01:59:15.070 --> 01:59:18.580
<v Speaker 2>in analyzing bad things you can break down what's so goofy about them.</v>

4607
01:59:18.581 --> 01:59:21.700
<v Speaker 2>And I think that there are some clarity comes out of that.</v>

4608
01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:23.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's a let this guy like,</v>

4609
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.521
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

4610
01:59:24.521 --> 01:59:25.390
<v Speaker 2>it gets even goofier.</v>

4611
01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4612
01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:27.430
<v Speaker 2>This is why I wanted to bring it up to you.</v>

4613
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:33.270
<v Speaker 2>I felt like your personality is a uniquely qualified to show the other side of</v>

4614
01:59:34.011 --> 01:59:34.170
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4615
01:59:34.170 --> 01:59:35.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4616
01:59:35.090 --> 01:59:35.711
<v Speaker 6>And all they would,</v>

4617
01:59:35.711 --> 01:59:40.040
<v Speaker 6>I mean ask any woman if she went to her car over her children and so you take</v>

4618
01:59:40.041 --> 01:59:41.300
<v Speaker 6>the kids any day.</v>

4619
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:43.370
<v Speaker 6>Whereas I would question a lot of men out there.</v>

4620
01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:43.710
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

4621
01:59:43.710 --> 01:59:44.543
<v Speaker 6>That's fine.</v>

4622
01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Fucking,</v>

4623
01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:46.480
<v Speaker 2>that's horrible.</v>

4624
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:47.800
<v Speaker 2>That's such a dumb thing to say.</v>

4625
01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:52.120
<v Speaker 2>She had a chance to make a salient point and she said something's really</v>

4626
01:59:52.121 --> 01:59:52.630
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

4627
01:59:52.630 --> 01:59:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Any guy who would choose his car over his kids should just vanish from the</v>

4628
01:59:56.411 --> 01:59:56.800
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

4629
01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Probably not as instantly.</v>

4630
01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Instantly vanished from the planet.</v>

4631
02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:01.473
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4632
02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:03.071
<v Speaker 6>Mark,</v>

4633
02:00:03.071 --> 02:00:03.890
<v Speaker 6>let me tell you,</v>

4634
02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:08.110
<v Speaker 6>it is because we are stronger and we are happier at the end of the day than most</v>

4635
02:00:08.111 --> 02:00:08.471
<v Speaker 6>men.</v>

4636
02:00:08.471 --> 02:00:10.210
<v Speaker 6>And that is factual and you know,</v>

4637
02:00:10.211 --> 02:00:11.044
<v Speaker 6>it's a heart thing.</v>

4638
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:15.570
<v Speaker 6>I just wanted to die sooner</v>

4639
02:00:21.410 --> 02:00:23.710
<v Speaker 6>on the table if you want to play this game,</v>

4640
02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:24.613
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4641
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:25.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4642
02:00:25.450 --> 02:00:29.560
<v Speaker 6>Women go around comparing their engagement rings to show off.</v>

4643
02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:32.030
<v Speaker 6>Who got the most careful Tommy?</v>

4644
02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.310
<v Speaker 6>That women don't compete,</v>

4645
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:38.050
<v Speaker 6>that Joe kind of stuff.</v>

4646
02:00:38.051 --> 02:00:38.491
<v Speaker 6>Mari,</v>

4647
02:00:38.491 --> 02:00:39.190
<v Speaker 6>knock it out.</v>

4648
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:41.320
<v Speaker 6>Word compete on houses,</v>

4649
02:00:41.321 --> 02:00:41.861
<v Speaker 6>divorce,</v>

4650
02:00:41.861 --> 02:00:42.694
<v Speaker 6>settlements,</v>

4651
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:43.421
<v Speaker 6>carrots,</v>

4652
02:00:43.421 --> 02:00:44.470
<v Speaker 6>country clubs.</v>

4653
02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:46.960
<v Speaker 6>Women compete on money all the time.</v>

4654
02:00:46.961 --> 02:00:48.070
<v Speaker 6>Give me a break</v>

4655
02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:51.340
<v Speaker 6>your life buddy.</v>

4656
02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:52.730
<v Speaker 2>How's that for a second?</v>

4657
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.050
<v Speaker 2>Just pretend the date.</v>

4658
02:00:54.110 --> 02:00:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Don't he's so disingenuine I agree.</v>

4659
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:58.880
<v Speaker 2>But I also first there again,</v>

4660
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:59.351
<v Speaker 2>I have to read her.</v>

4661
02:00:59.351 --> 02:01:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Write how horrible that Paula Abdul looking one on the bottom is a nightmare.</v>

4662
02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:04.421
<v Speaker 2>She is disingenuous.</v>

4663
02:01:04.421 --> 02:01:05.254
<v Speaker 2>I 100%.</v>

4664
02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:06.290
<v Speaker 2>He's not wrong.</v>

4665
02:01:06.650 --> 02:01:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4666
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:09.260
<v Speaker 2>he threw a punch so she threw one back.</v>

4667
02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:10.341
<v Speaker 2>Women do compete,</v>

4668
02:01:10.341 --> 02:01:11.001
<v Speaker 2>but so do men.</v>

4669
02:01:11.001 --> 02:01:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I think women do it,</v>

4670
02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:13.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4671
02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:13.851
<v Speaker 2>on not a nit.</v>

4672
02:01:13.851 --> 02:01:14.511
<v Speaker 2>Pick your level,</v>

4673
02:01:14.511 --> 02:01:18.440
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think if you look at the reasons that I'd have to think about it for</v>

4674
02:01:18.441 --> 02:01:18.790
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4675
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:19.880
<v Speaker 2>the reasons we're doing this,</v>

4676
02:01:19.881 --> 02:01:22.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that they come from a horrible place.</v>

4677
02:01:22.581 --> 02:01:23.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think men play into it.</v>

4678
02:01:23.601 --> 02:01:26.990
<v Speaker 2>You're buying her that diamond ring because you want to show how big your bank</v>

4679
02:01:26.991 --> 02:01:30.080
<v Speaker 2>account is and that you're powerful and that she's worth,</v>

4680
02:01:30.110 --> 02:01:30.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4681
02:01:30.321 --> 02:01:31.520
<v Speaker 2>everybody's playing a part in this.</v>

4682
02:01:31.521 --> 02:01:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's innocent hundred percent.</v>

4683
02:01:33.171 --> 02:01:34.490
<v Speaker 2>And you're also dating.</v>

4684
02:01:34.491 --> 02:01:37.700
<v Speaker 2>You made the choice to date that this is my issue.</v>

4685
02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>He made the choice to date that</v>

4686
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.430
<v Speaker 3>horrible woman who thinks the biggest diamond in the world is a big deal.</v>

4687
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:45.390
<v Speaker 3>So what does that say about your decision making skills?</v>

4688
02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:47.210
<v Speaker 3>But when you first start dating someone,</v>

4689
02:01:47.211 --> 02:01:49.490
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes you don't know that they're going to be a horrible person,</v>

4690
02:01:49.491 --> 02:01:50.360
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't go to Yale.</v>

4691
02:01:50.361 --> 02:01:51.130
<v Speaker 3>I fucking get that.</v>

4692
02:01:51.130 --> 02:01:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

4693
02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:52.543
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4694
02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:53.000
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4695
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:53.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4696
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:53.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4697
02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:54.231
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4698
02:01:54.231 --> 02:01:55.190
<v Speaker 3>when that girl is horrible,</v>

4699
02:01:55.191 --> 02:01:56.450
<v Speaker 3>I see a lot of what you do,</v>

4700
02:01:56.451 --> 02:01:59.390
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes you're deep in it and you're trying to like work it out anyway.</v>

4701
02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:00.030
<v Speaker 3>Like I know that I,</v>

4702
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:00.231
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4703
02:02:00.231 --> 02:02:02.450
<v Speaker 3>this is the pot calling kettle black because I can't talk about it cause I just</v>

4704
02:02:02.451 --> 02:02:05.390
<v Speaker 3>told you that horrible story that not what you made an awesome story.</v>

4705
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.901
<v Speaker 3>I awesome.</v>

4706
02:02:05.901 --> 02:02:06.680
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

4707
02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:07.970
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of men,</v>

4708
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:09.103
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4709
02:02:09.290 --> 02:02:10.280
<v Speaker 3>I think different parts,</v>

4710
02:02:10.670 --> 02:02:13.670
<v Speaker 3>men and women in different kinds of simulation and that's just the truth.</v>

4711
02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Not all men need to be challenged by like a smart girl or if or an intelligent</v>

4712
02:02:19.101 --> 02:02:20.240
<v Speaker 3>woman or something like that.</v>

4713
02:02:20.630 --> 02:02:24.350
<v Speaker 3>A lot of men are okay with like a dumb hot girl that wants to like cook his</v>

4714
02:02:24.351 --> 02:02:25.460
<v Speaker 3>meals and just kind of be there.</v>

4715
02:02:25.850 --> 02:02:26.690
<v Speaker 3>A lot of men are okay with that.</v>

4716
02:02:26.691 --> 02:02:30.470
<v Speaker 3>George Harrison once said that all I need from a woman is to be attracted to</v>

4717
02:02:30.471 --> 02:02:30.800
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

4718
02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:32.300
<v Speaker 3>Everything else I can get from a man.</v>

4719
02:02:32.450 --> 02:02:33.740
<v Speaker 3>I do think a lot of men,</v>

4720
02:02:33.930 --> 02:02:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't even care if that's wrong or right,</v>

4721
02:02:35.421 --> 02:02:36.980
<v Speaker 3>everyone is allowed to feel that way.</v>

4722
02:02:36.981 --> 02:02:41.981
<v Speaker 3>And I think men on the whole are on the whole are more program that way and</v>

4723
02:02:42.381 --> 02:02:44.000
<v Speaker 3>women need a lot of external stimuli.</v>

4724
02:02:44.050 --> 02:02:45.950
<v Speaker 3>And this also plays into the bedroom as well.</v>

4725
02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:48.200
<v Speaker 3>So you're not,</v>

4726
02:02:48.201 --> 02:02:51.410
<v Speaker 3>women need to be stimulated by a man more by his mind,</v>

4727
02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:52.880
<v Speaker 3>respecting his mind,</v>

4728
02:02:52.881 --> 02:02:53.870
<v Speaker 3>respecting his,</v>

4729
02:02:53.871 --> 02:02:54.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4730
02:02:54.430 --> 02:02:54.891
<v Speaker 3>his English.</v>

4731
02:02:54.891 --> 02:02:55.724
<v Speaker 3>You're a gold digger,</v>

4732
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:57.620
<v Speaker 3>in which case you're awful and you deserve nothing.</v>

4733
02:02:57.810 --> 02:02:59.210
<v Speaker 3>But I mean for me,</v>

4734
02:02:59.211 --> 02:03:00.230
<v Speaker 3>like if you're stupid,</v>

4735
02:03:00.231 --> 02:03:01.400
<v Speaker 3>even if you're the hottest guy ever,</v>

4736
02:03:01.401 --> 02:03:02.600
<v Speaker 3>like I can't write.</v>

4737
02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:03.140
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

4738
02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Could you like make out with them and take your top off or am I got 100 even?</v>

4739
02:03:08.150 --> 02:03:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I've been out with really hot guys and I'm like,</v>

4740
02:03:09.681 --> 02:03:10.880
<v Speaker 3>I have to leave right now.</v>

4741
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:11.271
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

4742
02:03:11.271 --> 02:03:11.571
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

4743
02:03:11.571 --> 02:03:11.841
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4744
02:03:11.841 --> 02:03:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Cause you it's offensive.</v>

4745
02:03:13.610 --> 02:03:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4746
02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:14.151
<v Speaker 3>Well I,</v>

4747
02:03:14.151 --> 02:03:14.481
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4748
02:03:14.481 --> 02:03:15.740
<v Speaker 3>I can totally get that.</v>

4749
02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4750
02:03:16.370 --> 02:03:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Keep going with that.</v>

4751
02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:21.810
<v Speaker 6>The stature of a lot of men is measured in the car.</v>

4752
02:03:21.811 --> 02:03:26.811
<v Speaker 6>They drive the golf country club they belong to and very much the place they</v>

4753
02:03:28.471 --> 02:03:28.921
<v Speaker 6>live in.</v>

4754
02:03:28.921 --> 02:03:30.420
<v Speaker 6>You have to admit that.</v>

4755
02:03:30.570 --> 02:03:31.400
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

4756
02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:35.090
<v Speaker 7>And whether or not their wives are staying at home and not working.</v>

4757
02:03:35.091 --> 02:03:37.100
<v Speaker 7>That's exactly what I said at the beginning,</v>

4758
02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:41.990
<v Speaker 7>that the way the men are taught that they have to make women happy.</v>

4759
02:03:42.090 --> 02:03:45.620
<v Speaker 7>But the fact of the matter is you can't make anybody happy.</v>

4760
02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:47.630
<v Speaker 7>You have to make yourself happy.</v>

4761
02:03:47.670 --> 02:03:48.050
<v Speaker 7>He's right.</v>

4762
02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:50.030
<v Speaker 7>Happiness is a byproduct of achievement.</v>

4763
02:03:50.031 --> 02:03:52.070
<v Speaker 7>So for women to say that they're unhappy,</v>

4764
02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:53.330
<v Speaker 7>it's their own fault.</v>

4765
02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:54.950
<v Speaker 7>Anybody who says he's unhappy,</v>

4766
02:03:54.951 --> 02:03:55.784
<v Speaker 7>it's his own fault.</v>

4767
02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:58.100
<v Speaker 7>Everybody has to make himself or herself happy.</v>

4768
02:03:58.500 --> 02:03:59.040
<v Speaker 6>Bloody headed.</v>

4769
02:03:59.040 --> 02:03:59.220
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4770
02:03:59.220 --> 02:03:59.521
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4771
02:03:59.521 --> 02:04:00.450
<v Speaker 6>how are you from?</v>

4772
02:04:00.451 --> 02:04:02.620
<v Speaker 6>Where are you from?</v>

4773
02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:06.720
<v Speaker 6>She says bloody like girls that they have to grow up to be reliant on a man as</v>

4774
02:04:06.721 --> 02:04:06.931
<v Speaker 6>you can.</v>

4775
02:04:06.931 --> 02:04:07.081
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4776
02:04:07.081 --> 02:04:07.950
<v Speaker 6>you can say that.</v>

4777
02:04:08.190 --> 02:04:11.570
<v Speaker 6>My son pray for your the same one.</v>

4778
02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:11.980
<v Speaker 7>Nope.</v>

4779
02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:12.371
<v Speaker 7>Same One.</v>

4780
02:04:12.371 --> 02:04:16.300
<v Speaker 7>Who bragged that she's so strong and so tough and doesn't need a man's money?</v>

4781
02:04:16.330 --> 02:04:16.581
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4782
02:04:16.581 --> 02:04:17.830
<v Speaker 7>you're taking alimony.</v>

4783
02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:20.733
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4784
02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:21.830
<v Speaker 6>mark.</v>

4785
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:22.630
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4786
02:04:22.630 --> 02:04:23.463
<v Speaker 6>he's wrong.</v>

4787
02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:24.373
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>

4788
02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:25.433
<v Speaker 6>Hold on.</v>

4789
02:04:25.470 --> 02:04:26.290
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>

4790
02:04:26.290 --> 02:04:26.921
<v Speaker 3>He's wrong.</v>

4791
02:04:26.921 --> 02:04:27.490
<v Speaker 3>How's he wrong?</v>

4792
02:04:27.490 --> 02:04:32.020
<v Speaker 3>Here's how he's wrong because I've thought about this for you.</v>

4793
02:04:32.021 --> 02:04:33.040
<v Speaker 3>Raise these children together.</v>

4794
02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:33.611
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4795
02:04:33.611 --> 02:04:34.660
<v Speaker 3>you have these children together.</v>

4796
02:04:34.661 --> 02:04:35.710
<v Speaker 3>She gave up.</v>

4797
02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:36.791
<v Speaker 3>People aren't gonna like this,</v>

4798
02:04:36.791 --> 02:04:37.624
<v Speaker 3>but is the truth.</v>

4799
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:40.200
<v Speaker 3>A woman has a finite amount of time to have a baby.</v>

4800
02:04:40.230 --> 02:04:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4801
02:04:41.010 --> 02:04:43.350
<v Speaker 3>And a finite amount of time to really be valuable in the workplace.</v>

4802
02:04:43.351 --> 02:04:44.400
<v Speaker 3>As unfortunate as it is,</v>

4803
02:04:44.401 --> 02:04:45.121
<v Speaker 3>that's the way it is.</v>

4804
02:04:45.121 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 3>Your youth is a commodity,</v>

4805
02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:47.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4806
02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:49.500
<v Speaker 3>When you enter into a contract of marriage with someone,</v>

4807
02:04:50.070 --> 02:04:53.940
<v Speaker 3>you're giving up a big part of yourself to either support that man and what he's</v>

4808
02:04:53.941 --> 02:04:56.400
<v Speaker 3>doing to have these children to raise these children.</v>

4809
02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:58.170
<v Speaker 3>So part of that alimony is,</v>

4810
02:04:58.171 --> 02:04:59.310
<v Speaker 3>and this is just the way it is,</v>

4811
02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:04.350
<v Speaker 3>is sort of compensation for all those years you invested in that he is still</v>

4812
02:05:04.351 --> 02:05:07.980
<v Speaker 3>going to be at 50 he can still be just as valuable as he wasn't 25 for a woman.</v>

4813
02:05:08.010 --> 02:05:09.510
<v Speaker 3>It just isn't that way yet.</v>

4814
02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:13.080
<v Speaker 3>He should have to pay for the children as much as she does.</v>

4815
02:05:13.081 --> 02:05:14.070
<v Speaker 3>She's the one raising them.</v>

4816
02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:17.400
<v Speaker 3>So his financial contribution is the compensation for not physically being</v>

4817
02:05:17.401 --> 02:05:17.790
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

4818
02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:19.410
<v Speaker 3>She's the one taking them to doctor's appointments.</v>

4819
02:05:19.411 --> 02:05:21.060
<v Speaker 3>She's the one staying up with them when they're sick.</v>

4820
02:05:21.450 --> 02:05:21.840
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4821
02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.310
<v Speaker 3>my mom was a single mom who,</v>

4822
02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:25.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened with her Alamo situation,</v>

4823
02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:27.840
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that that's wrong.</v>

4824
02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:29.130
<v Speaker 3>You can be a strong woman,</v>

4825
02:05:29.131 --> 02:05:32.760
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't get to just dip out because they had kids and they got a divorce.</v>

4826
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree with you as far as supporting the person who's taking care of</v>

4827
02:05:37.201 --> 02:05:37.861
<v Speaker 1>your children,</v>

4828
02:05:37.861 --> 02:05:39.900
<v Speaker 1>that you absolutely have to make a,</v>

4829
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:43.560
<v Speaker 1>a financial contribution to that.</v>

4830
02:05:43.561 --> 02:05:46.260
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that alimony is a,</v>

4831
02:05:46.261 --> 02:05:47.250
<v Speaker 1>is a big part of that.</v>

4832
02:05:47.290 --> 02:05:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Not just child support but compensating the woman for the,</v>

4833
02:05:50.811 --> 02:05:53.130
<v Speaker 1>the actual time that she has that you,</v>

4834
02:05:53.131 --> 02:05:54.630
<v Speaker 1>if you're not going to give the time,</v>

4835
02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:55.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're not going to be there,</v>

4836
02:05:55.891 --> 02:05:56.220
<v Speaker 1>you will.</v>

4837
02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:57.810
<v Speaker 1>You absolutely should give them money.</v>

4838
02:05:57.840 --> 02:05:58.830
<v Speaker 1>And My,</v>

4839
02:05:58.831 --> 02:06:02.730
<v Speaker 1>my issue with alimony really is with people who don't have children,</v>

4840
02:06:03.090 --> 02:06:04.260
<v Speaker 1>women who don't have children.</v>

4841
02:06:04.261 --> 02:06:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy who was married to a woman for um,</v>

4842
02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.960
<v Speaker 1>when you're married for a certain amount of years.</v>

4843
02:06:09.961 --> 02:06:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the number is,</v>

4844
02:06:10.831 --> 02:06:12.240
<v Speaker 1>but he passed over that number.</v>

4845
02:06:12.690 --> 02:06:15.090
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what your,</v>

4846
02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:15.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4847
02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:16.780
<v Speaker 1>your status is.</v>

4848
02:06:16.781 --> 02:06:17.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what it is.</v>

4849
02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:18.571
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

4850
02:06:18.571 --> 02:06:19.560
<v Speaker 1>unless you have a prenuptial,</v>

4851
02:06:19.561 --> 02:06:22.440
<v Speaker 1>you have to take care of her for the rest of her natural life.</v>

4852
02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:23.453
<v Speaker 1>It's like 12</v>

4853
02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:25.220
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous.</v>

4854
02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:26.690
<v Speaker 3>But to my point,</v>

4855
02:06:27.090 --> 02:06:27.801
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing,</v>

4856
02:06:27.801 --> 02:06:30.830
<v Speaker 3>I guess if you get married at 50 and you read for five years and that's</v>

4857
02:06:30.831 --> 02:06:31.161
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

4858
02:06:31.161 --> 02:06:31.731
<v Speaker 3>but okay,</v>

4859
02:06:31.731 --> 02:06:31.941
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

4860
02:06:31.941 --> 02:06:32.840
<v Speaker 3>let's look at this scenario.</v>

4861
02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Well I think he was married at 2020 I'm 22 or something like that and they</v>

4862
02:06:37.241 --> 02:06:41.590
<v Speaker 1>divorced when she was like 35 or something like that.</v>

4863
02:06:41.591 --> 02:06:43.300
<v Speaker 1>So she's still young enough to get a man,</v>

4864
02:06:43.330 --> 02:06:45.490
<v Speaker 1>but he has to take care of her for the rest of her life.</v>

4865
02:06:45.730 --> 02:06:47.920
<v Speaker 1>And she's living in his old house.</v>

4866
02:06:47.921 --> 02:06:51.820
<v Speaker 1>He this fucking jam and house and the Pacific Palisades overlooking the ocean.</v>

4867
02:06:52.210 --> 02:06:53.830
<v Speaker 1>W if she lives with a man,</v>

4868
02:06:54.070 --> 02:06:56.590
<v Speaker 1>she's no longer eligible so she can't get married.</v>

4869
02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:57.670
<v Speaker 1>So she has a boyfriend,</v>

4870
02:06:57.671 --> 02:07:01.030
<v Speaker 1>but she will not marry the boyfriend because my friend is wealthy and he has to</v>

4871
02:07:01.031 --> 02:07:01.990
<v Speaker 1>pay her a large sum.</v>

4872
02:07:01.991 --> 02:07:04.840
<v Speaker 1>So they play this game where he has a lawyer,</v>

4873
02:07:04.841 --> 02:07:05.890
<v Speaker 1>go to the house and says,</v>

4874
02:07:05.891 --> 02:07:06.701
<v Speaker 1>you're living with a man.</v>

4875
02:07:06.701 --> 02:07:07.001
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

4876
02:07:07.001 --> 02:07:07.181
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4877
02:07:07.181 --> 02:07:09.130
<v Speaker 1>he's just staying the night and he doesn't live here.</v>

4878
02:07:09.131 --> 02:07:11.950
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy has to move out and they hire investigators to make sure that</v>

4879
02:07:11.951 --> 02:07:13.390
<v Speaker 1>this guy is not sleeping over all the time.</v>

4880
02:07:13.570 --> 02:07:16.480
<v Speaker 1>So the guy tries to sneak in through the fucking backyard to stay.</v>

4881
02:07:16.481 --> 02:07:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4882
02:07:17.090 --> 02:07:17.923
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

4883
02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:19.213
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4884
02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:20.233
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4885
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:21.170
<v Speaker 3>that's terrible.</v>

4886
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4887
02:07:21.770 --> 02:07:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Here's the other side of that.</v>

4888
02:07:23.210 --> 02:07:24.043
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not,</v>

4889
02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:25.821
<v Speaker 3>the older I get,</v>

4890
02:07:25.821 --> 02:07:27.860
<v Speaker 3>the more I'm able to see both sides versus being like,</v>

4891
02:07:27.861 --> 02:07:27.981
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4892
02:07:27.981 --> 02:07:30.830
<v Speaker 3>it's about not taking advantage of med or being a strong woman.</v>

4893
02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you're 21 and you get married and the guy says,</v>

4894
02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:35.380
<v Speaker 3>and you want you kids,</v>

4895
02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:35.891
<v Speaker 3>and the guy says,</v>

4896
02:07:35.891 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

4897
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:36.730
<v Speaker 2>don't want kids.</v>

4898
02:07:36.730 --> 02:07:37.563
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4899
02:07:38.290 --> 02:07:39.550
<v Speaker 2>And you get divorced at 35,</v>

4900
02:07:40.090 --> 02:07:40.570
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

4901
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:41.261
<v Speaker 2>let's say older,</v>

4902
02:07:41.261 --> 02:07:41.471
<v Speaker 2>younger,</v>

4903
02:07:41.471 --> 02:07:42.100
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4904
02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:45.280
<v Speaker 2>You've pretty much given up the bulk of your child bearing years.</v>

4905
02:07:45.550 --> 02:07:47.170
<v Speaker 2>You will never have a family now and,</v>

4906
02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:49.690
<v Speaker 2>and you're divorced and you're pretty much left with nothing.</v>

4907
02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.210
<v Speaker 2>And the years that you could have dick,</v>

4908
02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:53.260
<v Speaker 2>let's just say dedicated to having a career or whatever.</v>

4909
02:07:53.261 --> 02:07:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you spent them supporting going through medical school.</v>

4910
02:07:55.930 --> 02:07:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you were there for him.</v>

4911
02:07:57.370 --> 02:07:59.050
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of guys do this and they leave their call.</v>

4912
02:07:59.060 --> 02:07:59.893
<v Speaker 2>A starter wife,</v>

4913
02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:03.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about being compensated for the rest of your life but there should</v>

4914
02:08:03.251 --> 02:08:07.180
<v Speaker 2>be some compensation there for the love and the pain and the support and</v>

4915
02:08:07.181 --> 02:08:09.670
<v Speaker 2>everything that you went through to support that man who you thought was going</v>

4916
02:08:09.671 --> 02:08:11.080
<v Speaker 2>to be the rock for the rest of your life.</v>

4917
02:08:11.110 --> 02:08:14.650
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a very specific scenario you're bringing up and that scenario isn't</v>

4918
02:08:14.651 --> 02:08:17.320
<v Speaker 2>covered by laws that are very generalized.</v>

4919
02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:18.213
<v Speaker 2>I do think,</v>

4920
02:08:18.650 --> 02:08:20.590
<v Speaker 2>oh there's generalities nipping in the bud.</v>

4921
02:08:20.591 --> 02:08:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Again in that specific scenario,</v>

4922
02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:24.910
<v Speaker 2>woman putting a got through medical school,</v>

4923
02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely agree with you.</v>

4924
02:08:25.811 --> 02:08:27.820
<v Speaker 2>She just supporting him just being his wife.</v>

4925
02:08:27.970 --> 02:08:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she gave up having kids for him,</v>

4926
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:30.583
<v Speaker 2>like there's certain,</v>

4927
02:08:30.730 --> 02:08:31.590
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

4928
02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:32.920
<v Speaker 2>In this particular scenario,</v>

4929
02:08:32.921 --> 02:08:34.480
<v Speaker 2>this woman actually couldn't have kids.</v>

4930
02:08:34.481 --> 02:08:37.240
<v Speaker 2>She had a medical situation and one of the reasons why they broke up was because</v>

4931
02:08:37.241 --> 02:08:41.470
<v Speaker 2>he wanted a family and she couldn't have kids for whatever reason.</v>

4932
02:08:41.530 --> 02:08:41.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4933
02:08:41.801 --> 02:08:43.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else they fought about,</v>

4934
02:08:43.570 --> 02:08:46.390
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't a good relationship in many ways.</v>

4935
02:08:46.570 --> 02:08:48.000
<v Speaker 2>So I bumped,</v>

4936
02:08:48.001 --> 02:08:49.540
<v Speaker 2>my friend is tortured by this.</v>

4937
02:08:49.570 --> 02:08:49.871
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4938
02:08:49.871 --> 02:08:50.950
<v Speaker 2>And she's a pariah.</v>

4939
02:08:51.250 --> 02:08:52.083
<v Speaker 2>And I do,</v>

4940
02:08:52.090 --> 02:08:54.190
<v Speaker 2>I think that for every woman that does that,</v>

4941
02:08:54.191 --> 02:08:57.610
<v Speaker 2>it sort of takes away the legitimacy of the argument that like women need to be</v>

4942
02:08:57.611 --> 02:08:58.840
<v Speaker 2>on their own and be strong.</v>

4943
02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:01.090
<v Speaker 2>And the alimony thing that he brought up is absolute bullshit.</v>

4944
02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:02.200
<v Speaker 2>But like this woman,</v>

4945
02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:05.680
<v Speaker 2>if you have a boyfriend and like you're pretty much stopping yourself from being</v>

4946
02:09:05.681 --> 02:09:07.720
<v Speaker 2>married and happy so you can have money.</v>

4947
02:09:07.721 --> 02:09:08.770
<v Speaker 2>You can live in an apartment.</v>

4948
02:09:08.771 --> 02:09:10.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to live in a mansion in the Palisades.</v>

4949
02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:14.410
<v Speaker 2>She's terrible friend is rich and she's making mad loot from him.</v>

4950
02:09:14.411 --> 02:09:16.750
<v Speaker 2>He pays her hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.</v>

4951
02:09:17.190 --> 02:09:18.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a horrible law.</v>

4952
02:09:18.590 --> 02:09:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4953
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:20.020
<v Speaker 2>that's is terrible.</v>

4954
02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:21.700
<v Speaker 2>And he has to pay her for the rest of her life.</v>

4955
02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:22.840
<v Speaker 2>The rest of your life is ridiculous.</v>

4956
02:09:22.841 --> 02:09:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I can understand a couple of years to get you back on your feet.</v>

4957
02:09:25.241 --> 02:09:25.901
<v Speaker 2>Go get a job,</v>

4958
02:09:25.901 --> 02:09:27.460
<v Speaker 2>but someone he needs to get a,</v>

4959
02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:28.301
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4960
02:09:28.301 --> 02:09:29.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he's going to do.</v>

4961
02:09:29.110 --> 02:09:29.231
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4962
02:09:29.231 --> 02:09:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I can understand a couple of years to get you on your feet as well because if</v>

4963
02:09:32.591 --> 02:09:35.830
<v Speaker 2>the guy's completely supporting you and then all of a sudden he pulls the net</v>

4964
02:09:35.831 --> 02:09:36.400
<v Speaker 2>out from I do.</v>

4965
02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:36.701
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

4966
02:09:36.701 --> 02:09:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

4967
02:09:37.330 --> 02:09:38.320
<v Speaker 2>how do I feed myself?</v>

4968
02:09:38.321 --> 02:09:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I need to get a fucking job.</v>

4969
02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:40.360
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

4970
02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:41.890
<v Speaker 2>if you're a grown human being,</v>

4971
02:09:41.891 --> 02:09:45.370
<v Speaker 2>you probably have some sort of a occupational skill.</v>

4972
02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:46.091
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>

4973
02:09:46.091 --> 02:09:48.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the argument for don't have you.</v>

4974
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And she said this,</v>

4975
02:09:50.110 --> 02:09:50.681
<v Speaker 2>you raise,</v>

4976
02:09:50.681 --> 02:09:52.240
<v Speaker 2>you should raise your children to be,</v>

4977
02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:54.300
<v Speaker 2>to self support and not rely on it.</v>

4978
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:55.000
<v Speaker 2>It's not about,</v>

4979
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't need a man.</v>

4980
02:09:55.841 --> 02:09:56.140
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4981
02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I like taking care of myself.</v>

4982
02:09:57.461 --> 02:09:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I would love a guy to take care of me,</v>

4983
02:09:58.661 --> 02:10:00.250
<v Speaker 2>but I'd also like to contribute.</v>

4984
02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:01.480
<v Speaker 2>I want to be married.</v>

4985
02:10:01.481 --> 02:10:01.721
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

4986
02:10:01.721 --> 02:10:02.920
<v Speaker 2>it'd be great if you paid for vacation,</v>

4987
02:10:02.921 --> 02:10:05.020
<v Speaker 2>but I can also pay the mortgage on the house.</v>

4988
02:10:05.021 --> 02:10:05.854
<v Speaker 2>Like it should be.</v>

4989
02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4990
02:10:06.730 --> 02:10:08.440
<v Speaker 2>it should be a bipartisan effort.</v>

4991
02:10:08.650 --> 02:10:11.680
<v Speaker 2>And if the person doesn't need you,</v>

4992
02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:14.590
<v Speaker 2>it's nice if you don't need each other and find that more attractive.</v>

4993
02:10:14.590 --> 02:10:14.921
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

4994
02:10:14.921 --> 02:10:17.830
<v Speaker 2>I think weak men find it attractive when a girl has to depend on them for</v>

4995
02:10:17.831 --> 02:10:18.520
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

4996
02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:22.840
<v Speaker 2>And I think any quality man respects a woman that can buy her own things and</v>

4997
02:10:22.841 --> 02:10:24.220
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want anything from them.</v>

4998
02:10:24.490 --> 02:10:24.701
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4999
02:10:24.701 --> 02:10:27.160
<v Speaker 2>especially if a guy's been through a scenario like that,</v>

5000
02:10:27.161 --> 02:10:29.560
<v Speaker 2>like my friends scenario where you're dealing with a woman,</v>

5001
02:10:29.561 --> 02:10:31.780
<v Speaker 2>it's just sponging off you for the rest of your days.</v>

5002
02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:32.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5003
02:10:32.171 --> 02:10:33.620
<v Speaker 2>he's never going to have sex with her again.</v>

5004
02:10:33.621 --> 02:10:35.890
<v Speaker 2>They're never hugging and don't go on vacations together.</v>

5005
02:10:35.891 --> 02:10:40.160
<v Speaker 2>There's no loving kisses and he's sending hundreds of thousands of dollars every</v>

5006
02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:40.690
<v Speaker 2>year her way.</v>

5007
02:10:40.690 --> 02:10:41.450
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be honest.</v>

5008
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:42.283
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

5009
02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I think you could have spotted that she was a little horrible from the get go.</v>

5010
02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.020
<v Speaker 2>People don't usually turn into that.</v>

5011
02:10:48.030 --> 02:10:48.910
<v Speaker 2>You're do.</v>

5012
02:10:49.670 --> 02:10:52.520
<v Speaker 2>This is where I disagree because it's not a moral compass issue.</v>

5013
02:10:52.670 --> 02:10:54.560
<v Speaker 2>It's an issue of convenience for her.</v>

5014
02:10:54.710 --> 02:10:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Why should she go out and get more?</v>

5015
02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5016
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:57.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not morals.</v>

5017
02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:00.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like if someone gives you a lottery ticket and says,</v>

5018
02:11:00.411 --> 02:11:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5019
02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:01.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5020
02:11:01.371 --> 02:11:01.910
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5021
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:03.530
<v Speaker 2>you won the winning lottery.</v>

5022
02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5023
02:11:04.130 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 2>but if you get this lottery ticket,</v>

5024
02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:07.550
<v Speaker 2>you really would never going to have to work again.</v>

5025
02:11:07.551 --> 02:11:08.900
<v Speaker 2>You're probably not going to pursue your career,</v>

5026
02:11:08.901 --> 02:11:09.231
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>

5027
02:11:09.231 --> 02:11:10.280
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have millions of dollars.</v>

5028
02:11:10.281 --> 02:11:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

5029
02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Most people are going to take those millions of dollars and those millions of</v>

5030
02:11:13.250 --> 02:11:15.890
<v Speaker 2>dollars most likely are going to fuck up your motivation.</v>

5031
02:11:15.891 --> 02:11:16.580
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna,</v>

5032
02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:19.670
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna make you look at money and a completely different way.</v>

5033
02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:21.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a moral thing because if I said,</v>

5034
02:11:21.171 --> 02:11:22.770
<v Speaker 2>here's a lottery ticket and you're going $1 million,</v>

5035
02:11:23.210 --> 02:11:24.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to seriously,</v>

5036
02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:25.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5037
02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:26.630
<v Speaker 2>encumber an inconvenience,</v>

5038
02:11:26.631 --> 02:11:29.180
<v Speaker 2>somebody else who doesn't deserve it necessarily rich,</v>

5039
02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:30.403
<v Speaker 2>he's rich,</v>

5040
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:31.340
<v Speaker 2>why should he care?</v>

5041
02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:31.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5042
02:11:31.611 --> 02:11:32.240
<v Speaker 2>if he makes,</v>

5043
02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:32.620
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

5044
02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:33.470
<v Speaker 2>let's give them a number,</v>

5045
02:11:33.471 --> 02:11:34.670
<v Speaker 2>say $10 million a year.</v>

5046
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:36.380
<v Speaker 2>If he makes $10 million a year,</v>

5047
02:11:36.381 --> 02:11:39.080
<v Speaker 2>why should he care if he has to send 500 grand her way every year?</v>

5048
02:11:39.110 --> 02:11:39.341
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5049
02:11:39.341 --> 02:11:40.174
<v Speaker 2>so here's this then.</v>

5050
02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:40.941
<v Speaker 2>And here's why.</v>

5051
02:11:40.941 --> 02:11:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a moral thing.</v>

5052
02:11:42.110 --> 02:11:44.460
<v Speaker 2>There's also like an,</v>

5053
02:11:44.461 --> 02:11:45.294
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5054
02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:50.060
<v Speaker 2>there's also the idea that like I find it disgusting to have to rely on someone</v>

5055
02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:52.250
<v Speaker 2>that you don't have any use for.</v>

5056
02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:54.200
<v Speaker 2>A perfect example is the Yale thing.</v>

5057
02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:56.390
<v Speaker 2>The day I met him,</v>

5058
02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:57.321
<v Speaker 2>he would say,</v>

5059
02:11:57.321 --> 02:11:57.841
<v Speaker 2>this is where it has,</v>

5060
02:11:57.841 --> 02:11:58.550
<v Speaker 2>it all ties in.</v>

5061
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:59.121
<v Speaker 2>He would say,</v>

5062
02:11:59.121 --> 02:12:01.490
<v Speaker 2>I have a billion miles on whatever airline.</v>

5063
02:12:01.730 --> 02:12:02.061
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

5064
02:12:02.061 --> 02:12:05.090
<v Speaker 2>give me your itinerary and I will upgrade you every time you fly.</v>

5065
02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:05.660
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

5066
02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:06.051
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>

5067
02:12:06.051 --> 02:12:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I've got all these free upgrades,</v>

5068
02:12:07.041 --> 02:12:07.910
<v Speaker 2>you may as well use them.</v>

5069
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.691
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

5070
02:12:08.691 --> 02:12:08.961
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5071
02:12:08.961 --> 02:12:10.190
<v Speaker 2>So when we started dating,</v>

5072
02:12:10.191 --> 02:12:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I would like to use the upgrades and even after we broke up,</v>

5073
02:12:12.441 --> 02:12:12.741
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

5074
02:12:12.741 --> 02:12:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I'd still like to keep giving you upgrades.</v>

5075
02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:17.060
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't keep taking them.</v>

5076
02:12:17.061 --> 02:12:18.560
<v Speaker 2>I think I took like one more upgrade,</v>

5077
02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:20.720
<v Speaker 2>like while we were breaking up.</v>

5078
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5079
02:12:21.230 --> 02:12:21.741
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

5080
02:12:21.741 --> 02:12:22.580
<v Speaker 2>in that email I was like,</v>

5081
02:12:22.581 --> 02:12:26.090
<v Speaker 2>this is my resignation from the upgrade program can go fuck yourself.</v>

5082
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:30.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not worth it to me to fly first class to be tied to you in any way,</v>

5083
02:12:30.711 --> 02:12:31.251
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

5084
02:12:31.251 --> 02:12:33.440
<v Speaker 2>And this woman is in a cosmic way.</v>

5085
02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Keeping yourself tethered to this man and as a man dating her,</v>

5086
02:12:38.181 --> 02:12:41.060
<v Speaker 2>would you be comfortable like living in some other dude's house with some other</v>

5087
02:12:41.061 --> 02:12:41.601
<v Speaker 2>Dude's money?</v>

5088
02:12:41.601 --> 02:12:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the whole thing is awful.</v>

5089
02:12:43.371 --> 02:12:45.410
<v Speaker 2>And so I do think it's a moral issue.</v>

5090
02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5091
02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:46.993
<v Speaker 2>I see your point.</v>

5092
02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:47.810
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

5093
02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:48.621
<v Speaker 2>I would not,</v>

5094
02:12:48.621 --> 02:12:50.410
<v Speaker 2>but some men would broke.</v>

5095
02:12:50.411 --> 02:12:51.011
<v Speaker 2>Man would,</v>

5096
02:12:51.011 --> 02:12:51.690
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

5097
02:12:51.690 --> 02:12:52.523
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5098
02:12:52.570 --> 02:12:52.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5099
02:12:52.911 --> 02:12:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I know a guy who's an actor who's got this girl who takes care of them</v>

5100
02:12:57.141 --> 02:12:57.680
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

5101
02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:02.060
<v Speaker 2>She works all day and he just goes to auditions and to disastrous relationship.</v>

5102
02:13:02.061 --> 02:13:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And I've watched it so like,</v>

5103
02:13:03.410 --> 02:13:04.850
<v Speaker 2>it's horrific to watch.</v>

5104
02:13:04.851 --> 02:13:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Cause like,</v>

5105
02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:05.721
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5106
02:13:05.721 --> 02:13:06.920
<v Speaker 2>if he ever does make it,</v>

5107
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:08.820
<v Speaker 2>most likely he's going to bail for sure.</v>

5108
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:10.723
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is,</v>

5109
02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:11.181
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

5110
02:13:11.181 --> 02:13:13.970
<v Speaker 2>there's a weird resentment that comes from guy who's depending on a woman to</v>

5111
02:13:13.971 --> 02:13:14.804
<v Speaker 2>take care of them.</v>

5112
02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:18.830
<v Speaker 2>And depending on a woman who's also depending on another man,</v>

5113
02:13:18.831 --> 02:13:22.730
<v Speaker 2>it's this weird fucking entangles behavior.</v>

5114
02:13:22.731 --> 02:13:24.410
<v Speaker 2>And you see it in la all the time.</v>

5115
02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:27.620
<v Speaker 2>But I think in her eyes it's like,</v>

5116
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5117
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:29.780
<v Speaker 2>this guy can afford it.</v>

5118
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Fuck him.</v>

5119
02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>I gave him 12</v>

5120
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.790
<v Speaker 1>years of my life and he fucking left me because,</v>

5121
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:35.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5122
02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:36.800
<v Speaker 1>because then the kids think,</v>

5123
02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:37.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5124
02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know to quite honestly,</v>

5125
02:13:39.001 --> 02:13:39.834
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't really,</v>

5126
02:13:39.870 --> 02:13:40.441
<v Speaker 1>I know they,</v>

5127
02:13:40.441 --> 02:13:40.980
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5128
02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:42.750
<v Speaker 1>they weren't getting along great.</v>

5129
02:13:42.810 --> 02:13:45.080
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't as simple as like the,</v>

5130
02:13:45.090 --> 02:13:46.080
<v Speaker 1>she was the love of his life,</v>

5131
02:13:46.081 --> 02:13:47.010
<v Speaker 1>but she couldn't have kids.</v>

5132
02:13:47.011 --> 02:13:47.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5133
02:13:47.221 --> 02:13:47.751
<v Speaker 1>I dropped,</v>

5134
02:13:47.751 --> 02:13:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5135
02:13:48.010 --> 02:13:48.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5136
02:13:48.150 --> 02:13:48.983
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that.</v>

5137
02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:49.620
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

5138
02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:51.060
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of other issues too,</v>

5139
02:13:51.061 --> 02:13:54.210
<v Speaker 1>but they were together long enough and they were married young.</v>

5140
02:13:54.211 --> 02:13:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So there was that thing where like,</v>

5141
02:13:55.501 --> 02:13:55.711
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

5142
02:13:55.711 --> 02:13:56.610
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be together forever.</v>

5143
02:13:56.611 --> 02:13:57.780
<v Speaker 1>We don't need a prenuptial.</v>

5144
02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:58.051
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5145
02:13:58.051 --> 02:13:58.861
<v Speaker 1>And now he,</v>

5146
02:13:58.861 --> 02:14:00.960
<v Speaker 1>if any of his friends or even thinking about marriage,</v>

5147
02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:02.610
<v Speaker 1>he grabs him by the collar and says,</v>

5148
02:14:02.611 --> 02:14:03.780
<v Speaker 1>get up fucking prenuptial.</v>

5149
02:14:03.930 --> 02:14:05.130
<v Speaker 1>And he tells him the whole story</v>

5150
02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:06.320
<v Speaker 3>and he's an idiot.</v>

5151
02:14:06.530 --> 02:14:07.363
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

5152
02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:09.980
<v Speaker 3>Because he didn't have a prenup and she was awful from the young,</v>

5153
02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:10.520
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5154
02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:11.570
<v Speaker 3>I promise you she was,</v>

5155
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:12.800
<v Speaker 3>I promise you she was.</v>

5156
02:14:12.801 --> 02:14:13.634
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you,</v>

5157
02:14:13.820 --> 02:14:16.760
<v Speaker 3>I promise I could look at a woman and tell you if she's horrible.</v>

5158
02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

5159
02:14:17.290 --> 02:14:18.160
<v Speaker 1>let's say this.</v>

5160
02:14:18.161 --> 02:14:23.161
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're both young and the guy is like really ambitious and the woman</v>

5161
02:14:23.561 --> 02:14:26.740
<v Speaker 1>is an artist and you know she doesn't make any money doing what she does,</v>

5162
02:14:26.741 --> 02:14:28.090
<v Speaker 1>but he supports that she does that.</v>

5163
02:14:28.091 --> 02:14:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she's a photographer,</v>

5164
02:14:28.991 --> 02:14:32.170
<v Speaker 1>let's say she's one of those artists things where it's like really fucking hard</v>

5165
02:14:32.171 --> 02:14:33.004
<v Speaker 1>to make money.</v>

5166
02:14:33.670 --> 02:14:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5167
02:14:34.070 --> 02:14:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe she's in new and maybe he doesn't care,</v>

5168
02:14:36.190 --> 02:14:38.080
<v Speaker 1>but then one day along the line,</v>

5169
02:14:38.110 --> 02:14:39.880
<v Speaker 1>12 years later he starts carrying,</v>

5170
02:14:39.881 --> 02:14:40.151
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

5171
02:14:40.151 --> 02:14:40.361
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

5172
02:14:40.361 --> 02:14:41.110
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

5173
02:14:41.110 --> 02:14:45.970
<v Speaker 1>And now she has spent these 12 years being taken care of and has never even</v>

5174
02:14:45.971 --> 02:14:49.030
<v Speaker 1>considered being able to make a living on her own.</v>

5175
02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:50.820
<v Speaker 3>She's awful.</v>

5176
02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:53.230
<v Speaker 3>You don't give up your dream first of all.</v>

5177
02:14:53.231 --> 02:14:55.440
<v Speaker 3>And that goes back to what we were talking about here you are,</v>

5178
02:14:55.441 --> 02:14:56.730
<v Speaker 3>are you a bad photographer?</v>

5179
02:14:56.731 --> 02:14:57.930
<v Speaker 3>And the guy,</v>

5180
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:59.550
<v Speaker 3>men typically don't care if the girls bad.</v>

5181
02:14:59.551 --> 02:15:03.270
<v Speaker 3>I know plenty of men that like date female comics and they're comics too and the</v>

5182
02:15:03.271 --> 02:15:04.470
<v Speaker 3>girl is horrible.</v>

5183
02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:06.930
<v Speaker 3>That's so common and the guys are over.</v>

5184
02:15:06.931 --> 02:15:07.501
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

5185
02:15:07.501 --> 02:15:07.861
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

5186
02:15:07.861 --> 02:15:11.310
<v Speaker 3>I could never date a comic that told horrible Dick Jokes for a living</v>

5187
02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:13.790
<v Speaker 1>that they take them on the road with them and they have the girl.</v>

5188
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep it on the DL.</v>

5189
02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

5190
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's for every Tom Segura and Christina,</v>

5191
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Christina Pezeshki where they're both hilarious.</v>

5192
02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5193
02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:25.610
<v Speaker 1>There's these scenarios where one of them,</v>

5194
02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:26.833
<v Speaker 3>aw shit.</v>

5195
02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:27.640
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

5196
02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:29.040
<v Speaker 3>They are the rare occasion,</v>

5197
02:15:29.041 --> 02:15:29.281
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

5198
02:15:29.281 --> 02:15:29.491
<v Speaker 3>Fine,</v>

5199
02:15:29.491 --> 02:15:30.151

02:15:30.151 --> 02:15:30.631

5201
02:15:30.631 --> 02:15:31.464
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're bad.</v>

5202
02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:36.620
<v Speaker 3>What on this earth things you have the right to stop trying to evolve as a</v>

5203
02:15:37.111 --> 02:15:39.270
<v Speaker 3>person just because you're married.</v>

5204

<v Speaker 3>We'll meet it end.</v>

5205
02:15:40.650 --> 02:15:41.940

<v Speaker 3>and she's not an active role in the relationship,</v>

5240
02:16:30.071 --> 02:16:31.870
<v Speaker 3>but she's not taking care of you and you're just,</v>

5241
02:16:31.871 --> 02:16:33.130
<v Speaker 3>and she's just pretty and that's it.</v>

5242
02:16:34.010 --> 02:16:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5243
02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:37.050
<v Speaker 2>But isn't there more to life than just making money?</v>

5244
02:16:37.051 --> 02:16:37.740
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>

5245
02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:41.160
<v Speaker 2>you're in a relationship with someone and you really truly feel like they're</v>

5246
02:16:41.161 --> 02:16:42.300
<v Speaker 2>going to be together forever,</v>

5247
02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:44.720
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't that person just to be able to there.</v>

5248
02:16:45.090 --> 02:16:46.980
<v Speaker 2>There's enough money between the two of you.</v>

5249
02:16:46.981 --> 02:16:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Were both of your living very comfortably.</v>

5250
02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't you be able to do whatever you want?</v>

5251
02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Course?</v>

5252
02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:51.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5253
02:16:51.301 --> 02:16:51.870
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

5254
02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:52.381
<v Speaker 3>Don't come.</v>

5255
02:16:52.381 --> 02:16:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Don't be upset when it comes back to bite you in the bud that you don't have a</v>

5256
02:16:54.421 --> 02:16:55.830
<v Speaker 3>career 15 years later.</v>

5257
02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:56.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5258
02:16:56.060 --> 02:16:56.893
<v Speaker 3>And he left you.</v>

5259
02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:58.073
<v Speaker 3>I also,</v>

5260
02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:01.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess I just want to know what she does during the day.</v>

5261
02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:02.133
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

5262
02:17:02.210 --> 02:17:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I can kill a day looking at Facebook,</v>

5263
02:17:03.870 --> 02:17:04.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5264
02:17:04.170 --> 02:17:05.003
<v Speaker 3>But then the next day I'll be</v>

5265
02:17:05.050 --> 02:17:05.351
<v Speaker 2>busy.</v>

5266
02:17:05.351 --> 02:17:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>

5267
02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe she kills days looking at Facebook and the next day she's not busy.</v>

5268
02:17:10.391 --> 02:17:11.740
<v Speaker 2>She just keeps looking at Facebook.</v>

5269
02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:12.820
<v Speaker 2>She's does what you do.</v>

5270
02:17:12.821 --> 02:17:13.740
<v Speaker 2>But always look,</v>

5271
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:15.850
<v Speaker 2>I can't judge if somebody has a pea brain,</v>

5272
02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:17.680
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>

5273
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:18.850
<v Speaker 2>These are awful people.</v>

5274
02:17:19.470 --> 02:17:20.380
<v Speaker 2>And you're terrible people.</v>

5275
02:17:20.650 --> 02:17:20.861
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5276
02:17:20.861 --> 02:17:22.150
<v Speaker 2>one one's terrible,</v>

5277
02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:22.631
<v Speaker 2>my friends,</v>

5278
02:17:22.631 --> 02:17:23.441
<v Speaker 2>not terrible friends.</v>

5279
02:17:23.441 --> 02:17:24.160
<v Speaker 2>A little terrible.</v>

5280
02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Why is he terrible?</v>

5281
02:17:24.970 --> 02:17:25.601
<v Speaker 2>Fred's little terrible.</v>

5282
02:17:25.601 --> 02:17:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Cause he married her and she was,</v>

5283
02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:28.720
<v Speaker 2>oh come on.</v>

5284
02:17:28.721 --> 02:17:29.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

5285
02:17:29.831 --> 02:17:32.230
<v Speaker 2>When you were in your 20s you don't fucking know shit.</v>

5286
02:17:32.590 --> 02:17:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean you couldn't figure out a guy was full of shit and you're 30 and smart.</v>

5287
02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I figured it out though.</v>

5288
02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:40.900
<v Speaker 2>You figured it out eventually after a lot of cross examination and investigative</v>

5289
02:17:40.901 --> 02:17:42.730
<v Speaker 2>work involving your mother as well</v>

5290
02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:43.590
<v Speaker 3>theirself.</v>

5291
02:17:43.590 --> 02:17:44.423
<v Speaker 3>And second of all,</v>

5292
02:17:45.050 --> 02:17:46.100
<v Speaker 3>she always involves herself.</v>

5293
02:17:46.430 --> 02:17:46.971
<v Speaker 3>Second of all,</v>

5294
02:17:46.971 --> 02:17:49.340
<v Speaker 3>what is a mental disorder?</v>

5295
02:17:49.341 --> 02:17:51.170
<v Speaker 3>And one's a full on personality disorder.</v>

5296
02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:54.590
<v Speaker 3>The fact that he's a psychopath and he's probably skilled at covering out these,</v>

5297
02:17:54.591 --> 02:17:55.130
<v Speaker 3>it's like a path.</v>

5298
02:17:55.130 --> 02:17:55.580
<v Speaker 3>It's an,</v>

5299
02:17:55.580 --> 02:17:57.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry that I don't work on criminal minds.</v>

5300
02:17:57.650 --> 02:17:58.071
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

5301
02:17:58.071 --> 02:18:01.940
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you from her nail length and what kind of jeans she wears and how</v>

5302
02:18:01.941 --> 02:18:02.930
<v Speaker 3>about her fake Tan is,</v>

5303
02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:05.510
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you what a fucking nightmare this woman is from the get go.</v>

5304
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:06.830
<v Speaker 3>So I think one,</v>

5305
02:18:06.831 --> 02:18:09.590
<v Speaker 3>these are outward clues versus like subversive clues.</v>

5306
02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:10.430
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

5307
02:18:10.430 --> 02:18:11.263
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

5308
02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Kombucha.</v>

5309
02:18:12.100 --> 02:18:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5310
02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:12.960
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

5311
02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:16.950
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a woman who is into nice clothes and nice nails.</v>

5312
02:18:16.980 --> 02:18:17.813
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that.</v>

5313
02:18:17.850 --> 02:18:18.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5314
02:18:18.090 --> 02:18:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say he's into it.</v>

5315
02:18:18.951 --> 02:18:20.680
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell by the type the type,</v>

5316
02:18:20.681 --> 02:18:22.770
<v Speaker 2>but what is the type that a guy should look out for?</v>

5317
02:18:22.890 --> 02:18:23.790
<v Speaker 2>If you're a,</v>

5318
02:18:24.090 --> 02:18:28.650
<v Speaker 2>you're going to give a seminar how guys should avoid nightmare horrible women in</v>

5319
02:18:28.651 --> 02:18:29.250
<v Speaker 2>their life,</v>

5320
02:18:29.250 --> 02:18:30.150
<v Speaker 2>which should they avoid</v>

5321
02:18:31.010 --> 02:18:31.490
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

5322
02:18:31.490 --> 02:18:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5323
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5324
02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:33.051
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

5325
02:18:33.051 --> 02:18:33.920
<v Speaker 3>it's a case by case basis.</v>

5326
02:18:33.921 --> 02:18:35.180
<v Speaker 3>There's plenty of different horrible things.</v>

5327
02:18:35.181 --> 02:18:36.014
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

5328
02:18:36.350 --> 02:18:38.720
<v Speaker 3>if she's got big old French tip nails,</v>

5329
02:18:39.170 --> 02:18:40.400
<v Speaker 3>she's a little bit of white trash.</v>

5330
02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:41.391
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5331
02:18:41.391 --> 02:18:42.590
<v Speaker 3>Friendship nails are bad.</v>

5332
02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:44.720
<v Speaker 3>Like long press on French tip nails would,</v>

5333
02:18:44.721 --> 02:18:45.650
<v Speaker 3>if they're real nails,</v>

5334
02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:46.221
<v Speaker 3>they're French.</v>

5335
02:18:46.221 --> 02:18:47.210
<v Speaker 3>French tip is,</v>

5336
02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:49.460
<v Speaker 3>to me it's just such a trashy book,</v>

5337
02:18:49.490 --> 02:18:49.971
<v Speaker 3>but that's fine.</v>

5338
02:18:49.971 --> 02:18:50.804
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5339
02:18:51.590 --> 02:18:52.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5340
02:18:52.370 --> 02:18:53.780
<v Speaker 3>what about like dark red,</v>

5341
02:18:53.810 --> 02:18:57.020
<v Speaker 3>like Spanish girl with red lipstick and dark red nails?</v>

5342
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.980
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the girl.</v>

5343
02:18:58.010 --> 02:19:01.210
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole package because you could have trashy elements like I'm wearing cut</v>

5344
02:19:01.211 --> 02:19:03.050
<v Speaker 3>off jeans right now in a see through tank top.</v>

5345
02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:03.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

5346
02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:05.213
<v Speaker 3>Ready to judge you.</v>

5347
02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:07.980
<v Speaker 3>But the rest of me is not Polish.</v>

5348
02:19:07.981 --> 02:19:11.810
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the rest I've got like messy hair and one foot painted.</v>

5349
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:12.703
<v Speaker 3>Is that okay?</v>

5350
02:19:12.830 --> 02:19:14.510
<v Speaker 3>It's okay because I'm like not trying.</v>

5351
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:15.583
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5352
02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just,</v>

5353
02:19:16.430 --> 02:19:19.940
<v Speaker 3>there's just certain looks that women have and I don't want to say,</v>

5354
02:19:20.210 --> 02:19:20.361
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5355
02:19:20.361 --> 02:19:21.111
<v Speaker 3>it's this hairdo.</v>

5356
02:19:21.111 --> 02:19:23.480
<v Speaker 3>It's that there's a hole and you know what I'm talking about.</v>

5357
02:19:23.481 --> 02:19:25.970
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole myriad of elements that come together.</v>

5358
02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:27.433
<v Speaker 3>Does she?</v>

5359
02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:28.160
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing</v>

5360
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:29.450
<v Speaker 2>wrong with having like enhancements.</v>

5361
02:19:29.451 --> 02:19:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Does she have fake lips and fake tits and hair extensions and clause Andy,</v>

5362
02:19:34.011 --> 02:19:34.940
<v Speaker 2>she weren't stripper heels.</v>

5363
02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Well then she's probably fucking horrible.</v>

5364
02:19:37.570 --> 02:19:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Like let's get serious lucite heels like indoors.</v>

5365
02:19:41.210 --> 02:19:42.530
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty rare though isn't it?</v>

5366
02:19:42.531 --> 02:19:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm pretty extreme examples.</v>

5367
02:19:45.350 --> 02:19:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what realm we're dealing with here.</v>

5368
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Big Lip thing is,</v>

5369
02:19:49.010 --> 02:19:50.720
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy one too.</v>

5370
02:19:50.721 --> 02:19:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Like they never really worked that out in so many girls jumped on that</v>

5371
02:19:53.580 --> 02:19:54.413
<v Speaker 2>bandwagon.</v>

5372
02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

5373
02:19:55.310 --> 02:19:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Jumped on that bandwagon and they fucked up their face forever.</v>

5374
02:19:58.190 --> 02:20:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I think women in Hollywood make a decision.</v>

5375
02:20:00.141 --> 02:20:00.471
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

5376
02:20:00.471 --> 02:20:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I would rather look super weird than look super old.</v>

5377
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Cause when you like a lot of them you can't tell what they are,</v>

5378
02:20:05.991 --> 02:20:06.824
<v Speaker 2>how old they are.</v>

5379
02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:08.480
<v Speaker 2>They're so weird.</v>

5380
02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:13.070
<v Speaker 2>There's this woman that I see at my daughter's school and I drop my kid off in</v>

5381
02:20:13.071 --> 02:20:14.270
<v Speaker 2>the morning and she's,</v>

5382
02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:16.760
<v Speaker 2>it makes me sad because this lady,</v>

5383
02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:17.690
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

5384
02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:21.410
<v Speaker 2>she looked like she was probably pretty when she was younger and she's not that</v>

5385
02:20:21.411 --> 02:20:21.770
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

5386
02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:25.790
<v Speaker 2>She's probably in her late thirties maybe early forties but she has turned her</v>

5387
02:20:25.791 --> 02:20:27.830
<v Speaker 2>face into that a monster,</v>

5388
02:20:27.890 --> 02:20:28.461
<v Speaker 2>a monster,</v>

5389
02:20:28.461 --> 02:20:29.390
<v Speaker 2>and there's no going back.</v>

5390
02:20:29.391 --> 02:20:30.140
<v Speaker 2>It's rubber,</v>

5391
02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:31.070
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't move.</v>

5392
02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:31.940
<v Speaker 2>It's frozen.</v>

5393
02:20:31.941 --> 02:20:35.990
<v Speaker 2>It's filled in in weird ways where it looks like she's got up fucking tooth ache</v>

5394
02:20:35.991 --> 02:20:38.600
<v Speaker 2>or something like her face is swollen and she,</v>

5395
02:20:38.601 --> 02:20:39.620
<v Speaker 2>you know what the kicker is?</v>

5396
02:20:40.310 --> 02:20:41.510
<v Speaker 2>She might've gotten him for one thing,</v>

5397
02:20:41.511 --> 02:20:44.600
<v Speaker 2>had a weird reaction or whatever and like now it's like that and she might be a</v>

5398
02:20:44.601 --> 02:20:47.000
<v Speaker 2>super cool lady or something and that's just like,</v>

5399
02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:48.620
<v Speaker 2>like you're stuck with that.</v>

5400
02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Well you know what I think it is.</v>

5401
02:20:49.641 --> 02:20:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a dysmorphia.</v>

5402
02:20:51.220 --> 02:20:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Like the same thing where anorexics habit bodybuilders have it.</v>

5403
02:20:55.430 --> 02:20:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Women who have a boob implants a lot of times never think their boob implants</v>

5404
02:20:58.911 --> 02:20:59.571
<v Speaker 2>are big enough.</v>

5405
02:20:59.571 --> 02:21:01.910
<v Speaker 2>They want to keep going and going and going and getting bigger and bigger.</v>

5406
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.630
<v Speaker 2>They get,</v>

5407
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:03.560
<v Speaker 2>they get crazy,</v>

5408
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:05.120
<v Speaker 2>they look at them and they're like not big enough.</v>

5409
02:21:05.121 --> 02:21:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't see what everyone else is seeing.</v>

5410
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Also when you don't have big boobs from the get go,</v>

5411
02:21:10.071 --> 02:21:12.290
<v Speaker 2>you don't realize like how annoying they can be.</v>

5412
02:21:12.490 --> 02:21:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5413
02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:13.903
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>

5414
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:15.440
<v Speaker 2>well you have natural big boobs.</v>

5415
02:21:15.890 --> 02:21:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Did they fuck with your back?</v>

5416
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.721
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5417
02:21:17.721 --> 02:21:19.940
<v Speaker 2>because they're not like so big that it's like,</v>

5418
02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean those girls that have like back issues like those are like gigantic,</v>

5419
02:21:23.031 --> 02:21:24.230
<v Speaker 2>like black lady bras.</v>

5420
02:21:24.370 --> 02:21:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5421
02:21:24.610 --> 02:21:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I dated a girl who had natural ones that were just enormous and she wound up</v>

5422
02:21:28.671 --> 02:21:31.940
<v Speaker 2>getting a reduction because there there's doers just crazy.</v>

5423
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:32.661
<v Speaker 2>They were out of control.</v>

5424
02:21:32.661 --> 02:21:33.321
<v Speaker 2>They're like ease.</v>

5425
02:21:33.321 --> 02:21:34.490
<v Speaker 2>They were enormous.</v>

5426
02:21:34.610 --> 02:21:35.440
<v Speaker 2>There's this,</v>

5427
02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:36.710
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to get personal about it,</v>

5428
02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:39.920
<v Speaker 2>like especially like for like your lady time sometimes like your boobs get</v>

5429
02:21:39.921 --> 02:21:40.730
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>

5430
02:21:40.730 --> 02:21:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting on a shirt.</v>

5431
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

5432
02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:42.950
<v Speaker 2>even I get annoyed.</v>

5433
02:21:43.240 --> 02:21:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm saying,</v>

5434
02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I need to put these things away and like things just don't quite fit.</v>

5435
02:21:45.801 --> 02:21:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I try to put on a dress yesterday and I was like,</v>

5436
02:21:47.241 --> 02:21:50.660
<v Speaker 2>this is inappropriate and you're just trying to like make it fucking work.</v>

5437
02:21:51.290 --> 02:21:52.123
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

5438
02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:55.590
<v Speaker 2>but there are also weapons of math manipulatives drop.</v>

5439
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:58.190
<v Speaker 2>You pull those out and do just go holy.</v>

5440
02:21:58.191 --> 02:21:59.030
<v Speaker 2>But Jesus,</v>

5441
02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:01.330
<v Speaker 2>we were ill.</v>

5442
02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:06.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean like motorboating I mean like the look that they get like a cartoon look.</v>

5443
02:22:06.690 --> 02:22:07.523
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

5444
02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5445
02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:10.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't notice it.</v>

5446
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:14.360
<v Speaker 2>And I only say that because I think when you grow up a certain way,</v>

5447
02:22:14.361 --> 02:22:15.320
<v Speaker 2>like if you're tall,</v>

5448
02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:16.520
<v Speaker 2>like you don't notice that you're like,</v>

5449
02:22:16.521 --> 02:22:17.930
<v Speaker 2>you don't think about it and then you kind of,</v>

5450
02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:19.360
<v Speaker 2>you're used to be always be like when we go,</v>

5451
02:22:19.410 --> 02:22:20.130
<v Speaker 2>you were tall.</v>

5452
02:22:20.130 --> 02:22:20.931
<v Speaker 2>If you have big boobs,</v>

5453
02:22:20.931 --> 02:22:21.370
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

5454
02:22:21.370 --> 02:22:22.670
<v Speaker 2>since I'm 14 years old,</v>

5455
02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:23.511
<v Speaker 2>it's always been a thing.</v>

5456
02:22:23.511 --> 02:22:24.344
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>

5457
02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:25.440
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make me uncomfortable.</v>

5458
02:22:25.441 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 2>I even think about</v>

5459
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:26.760
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

5460
02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:28.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't even notice people looking and if they do,</v>

5461
02:22:28.531 --> 02:22:29.370
<v Speaker 3>it's very comfortable.</v>

5462
02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Well you do Sorta,</v>

5463
02:22:30.461 --> 02:22:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why he said you make out with the guy and take off your shirt and</v>

5464
02:22:32.931 --> 02:22:33.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a nice treat for him.</v>

5465
02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:35.133
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

5466
02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:36.700
<v Speaker 3>But that's what I'm saying.</v>

5467
02:22:36.701 --> 02:22:37.331
<v Speaker 3>Like in general,</v>

5468
02:22:37.331 --> 02:22:37.811
<v Speaker 3>like I don't,</v>

5469
02:22:37.811 --> 02:22:40.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm very comfortable around a bra.</v>

5470
02:22:40.111 --> 02:22:40.944
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

5471
02:22:41.140 --> 02:22:43.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not something that you think about on a regular.</v>

5472
02:22:43.570 --> 02:22:44.110
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

5473
02:22:44.110 --> 02:22:44.410
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5474
02:22:44.410 --> 02:22:45.243
<v Speaker 3>I think about my boobs.</v>

5475
02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:46.331
<v Speaker 3>I bet you do.</v>

5476
02:22:46.331 --> 02:22:47.500
<v Speaker 3>I would if I had them like yours.</v>

5477
02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:48.130
<v Speaker 3>I touch him.</v>

5478
02:22:48.130 --> 02:22:48.910
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you about them.</v>

5479
02:22:48.910 --> 02:22:49.690
<v Speaker 3>All girls do.</v>

5480
02:22:49.690 --> 02:22:51.850
<v Speaker 3>I'd be willing to whip them out at the drop of a hat to,</v>

5481
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:52.510
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>

5482
02:22:52.510 --> 02:22:53.343
<v Speaker 3>not fallen for that one.</v>

5483
02:22:55.550 --> 02:22:56.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally,</v>

5484
02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:57.653
<v Speaker 3>what are words?</v>

5485
02:22:59.110 --> 02:23:00.440
<v Speaker 3>You have another show you,</v>

5486
02:23:00.610 --> 02:23:01.540
<v Speaker 3>you're going somewhere else.</v>

5487
02:23:01.541 --> 02:23:02.351
<v Speaker 3>I'm just looking behind me.</v>

5488
02:23:02.351 --> 02:23:02.501
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

5489
02:23:02.501 --> 02:23:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were making a lot more sense.</v>

5490
02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:06.850
<v Speaker 3>It's two 40 you have to bug you,</v>

5491
02:23:06.851 --> 02:23:06.981
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5492
02:23:06.981 --> 02:23:07.690
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't say one more thing.</v>

5493
02:23:07.690 --> 02:23:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5494
02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:09.070
<v Speaker 3>About that clip.</v>

5495
02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:11.590
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] women need to learn.</v>

5496
02:23:11.980 --> 02:23:15.160
<v Speaker 3>It's very easy in an argument for like I was,</v>

5497
02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:16.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm conditioned to,</v>

5498
02:23:16.811 --> 02:23:18.100
<v Speaker 3>when I watched that side,</v>

5499
02:23:18.101 --> 02:23:21.280
<v Speaker 3>even though that guy was horrible to almost go against women like women when</v>

5500
02:23:21.281 --> 02:23:23.890
<v Speaker 3>they argue become very ugly women.</v>

5501
02:23:23.890 --> 02:23:26.680
<v Speaker 3>I think if they learn to be more composed and calmer,</v>

5502
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:28.120
<v Speaker 3>it was women who were raising their voices.</v>

5503
02:23:28.121 --> 02:23:29.350
<v Speaker 3>They sounded like chickens.</v>

5504
02:23:29.770 --> 02:23:30.311
<v Speaker 3>They can't.</v>

5505
02:23:30.311 --> 02:23:32.020
<v Speaker 3>They block like blood chickens.</v>

5506
02:23:32.021 --> 02:23:33.220
<v Speaker 3>That guy was calm.</v>

5507
02:23:33.221 --> 02:23:35.310
<v Speaker 3>You notice blood chicken,</v>

5508
02:23:35.720 --> 02:23:36.430
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

5509
02:23:36.430 --> 02:23:38.050
<v Speaker 3>That's a great name for a band.</v>

5510
02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Like the blood blood.</v>

5511
02:23:39.270 --> 02:23:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Chicken's good night ice house it up for pussy riot next month in prison.</v>

5512
02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:45.730
<v Speaker 3>They're out.</v>

5513
02:23:45.730 --> 02:23:45.821
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5514
02:23:45.821 --> 02:23:46.654
<v Speaker 3>they did great.</v>

5515
02:23:47.380 --> 02:23:47.861
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>

5516
02:23:47.861 --> 02:23:49.120
<v Speaker 3>you notice he didn't raise his voice.</v>

5517
02:23:49.630 --> 02:23:50.050
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

5518
02:23:50.050 --> 02:23:51.190
<v Speaker 3>even though he was a Douche,</v>

5519
02:23:51.191 --> 02:23:53.140
<v Speaker 3>like everything was very calm and the women were just like,</v>

5520
02:23:53.170 --> 02:23:53.961
<v Speaker 3>I'm proving that.</v>

5521
02:23:53.961 --> 02:23:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm strong and I'm this,</v>

5522
02:23:55.570 --> 02:23:58.120
<v Speaker 6>come on bloody hell.</v>

5523
02:23:58.121 --> 02:23:58.481
<v Speaker 6>What are you?</v>

5524
02:23:58.481 --> 02:23:59.470
<v Speaker 6>Oh Lord,</v>

5525
02:23:59.471 --> 02:24:01.300
<v Speaker 6>who are you dating and don't?</v>

5526
02:24:01.301 --> 02:24:01.481
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5527
02:24:01.481 --> 02:24:02.180
<v Speaker 6>don't yell.</v>

5528
02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Well if just because you can,</v>

5529
02:24:03.650 --> 02:24:04.130
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

5530
02:24:04.130 --> 02:24:06.680
<v Speaker 3>if they kept it calm and they talked like this,</v>

5531
02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:09.620
<v Speaker 3>I would have so much more respect for women in debates.</v>

5532
02:24:10.130 --> 02:24:11.030
<v Speaker 3>Or You Watch Hillary Clinton,</v>

5533
02:24:11.031 --> 02:24:12.890
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't freak out and get high fee like that.</v>

5534
02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:14.180
<v Speaker 3>And those women were awful.</v>

5535
02:24:14.181 --> 02:24:17.660
<v Speaker 3>And I think if women just chill the fuck out and stop trying to prove to every</v>

5536
02:24:17.661 --> 02:24:18.440
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

5537
02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:19.131
<v Speaker 3>I'm so strong,</v>

5538
02:24:19.131 --> 02:24:19.791
<v Speaker 3>I'm independent,</v>

5539
02:24:19.791 --> 02:24:20.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm the all the real housewives.</v>

5540
02:24:20.751 --> 02:24:21.650
<v Speaker 3>That's all they do.</v>

5541
02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:25.040
<v Speaker 3>Stop trying to prove what you aren't and just fucking take a deep</v>

5542
02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:28.110
<v Speaker 1>well that's one of those things that also doesn't work.</v>

5543
02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Like saying I'm strong,</v>

5544
02:24:29.401 --> 02:24:30.151
<v Speaker 1>I'm independent.</v>

5545
02:24:30.151 --> 02:24:31.260
<v Speaker 1>No one believes that.</v>

5546
02:24:31.261 --> 02:24:32.190
<v Speaker 1>You can't just say it.</v>

5547
02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just like name dropping you,</v>

5548
02:24:33.961 --> 02:24:36.570
<v Speaker 1>you feel compelled to say because you have a weak character.</v>

5549
02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5550
02:24:36.780 --> 02:24:39.090
<v Speaker 1>But if you really are strong and you really are independent,</v>

5551
02:24:39.091 --> 02:24:40.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't give a fuck with this person,</v>

5552
02:24:40.651 --> 02:24:42.300
<v Speaker 1>thinks about you so that you don't have to say it.</v>

5553
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:43.081
<v Speaker 1>You know it's,</v>

5554
02:24:43.081 --> 02:24:46.680
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that people do because they're trying to paint a</v>

5555
02:24:46.681 --> 02:24:49.500
<v Speaker 1>picture of themselves that oftentimes doesn't match up with reality.</v>

5556
02:24:49.570 --> 02:24:50.500
<v Speaker 3>That's my whole thing with,</v>

5557
02:24:50.530 --> 02:24:50.801
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5558
02:24:50.801 --> 02:24:51.850
<v Speaker 3>my own example is,</v>

5559
02:24:52.090 --> 02:24:54.640
<v Speaker 3>and I'm targeting real housewives of that whole franchise,</v>

5560
02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:55.840
<v Speaker 3>is that should drive you crazy.</v>

5561
02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:56.920
<v Speaker 3>I can't watch it anymore.</v>

5562
02:24:56.921 --> 02:24:57.820
<v Speaker 3>I used to watch all of them.</v>

5563
02:24:57.970 --> 02:24:59.560
<v Speaker 3>I can't because here you have these women,</v>

5564
02:24:59.561 --> 02:25:00.460
<v Speaker 3>these middle aged women,</v>

5565
02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:03.700
<v Speaker 3>desperate to prove to each other how fertile they are,</v>

5566
02:25:03.820 --> 02:25:04.870
<v Speaker 3>how young they are.</v>

5567
02:25:04.871 --> 02:25:07.690
<v Speaker 3>I could have a baby at 52 fucking can't you?</v>

5568
02:25:07.930 --> 02:25:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Cryogenic Monster.</v>

5569
02:25:10.150 --> 02:25:11.290

5574
02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:14.613
<v Speaker 3>Here's what happened.</v>

5575
02:25:14.740 --> 02:25:18.490
<v Speaker 3>At 18 you got knocked up and thought you would have a go at like being a model.</v>

5576
02:25:18.491 --> 02:25:19.990
<v Speaker 3>So you moved to Hollywood or something.</v>

5577
02:25:20.110 --> 02:25:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Ended up getting married to some guy who probably fucking beat you and then at</v>

5578
02:25:23.290 --> 02:25:24.130
<v Speaker 3>when your kids were all raised,</v>

5579
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:25.570
<v Speaker 2>you put your hand out of the sand and you were like,</v>

5580
02:25:25.571 --> 02:25:25.901
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5581
02:25:25.901 --> 02:25:27.310
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to try to be a human.</v>

5582
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:28.960
<v Speaker 2>That's what all those women are.</v>

5583
02:25:29.350 --> 02:25:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you start out being a quality person?</v>

5584
02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Let life get in the way,</v>

5585
02:25:32.351 --> 02:25:33.071
<v Speaker 2>but deal with it.</v>

5586
02:25:33.071 --> 02:25:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Not like a garbage person and I won't hate you so much.</v>

5596
02:25:45.550 --> 02:25:46.210
<v Speaker 2>This was fun.</v>

5597

<v Speaker 2>it lived up to the height between us.</v>

5600
02:25:49.271 --> 02:25:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Like we had some hype going on.</v>

5601
02:25:50.541 --> 02:25:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I tracked you down in the airport.</v>

5602

5604
02:25:53.530 --> 02:25:56.260
<v Speaker 2>I didn't track it down and then I had the worst flight ever and you didn't help</v>

5605
02:25:56.261 --> 02:25:57.094
<v Speaker 2>me at all.</v>

5607
02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:00.550
<v Speaker 2>The guy was sitting next to me.</v>

02:26:02.050 --> 02:26:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I do remember now.</v>

5611
02:26:03.041 --> 02:26:05.920

5612
02:26:05.921 --> 02:26:06.401
<v Speaker 2>cues better,</v>

02:26:09.731 --> 02:26:10.564
<v Speaker 2>kept talking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It made me,</v>

5623
02:26:22.961 --> 02:26:24.040
<v Speaker 2>it helped me to create,</v>

5624
02:26:24.041 --> 02:26:28.150
<v Speaker 2>I just tweeted after this something like if you played baseball in college are</v>

5627
02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Well that guy would have let you know anything about him.</v>

5628
02:26:34.691 --> 02:26:35.524
<v Speaker 2>He was a moron.</v>

5629
02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Every time I got up he would strike up the most inane conversations.</v>

5630
02:26:38.801 --> 02:26:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I was scared.</v>
