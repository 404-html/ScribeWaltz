<v Speaker 1>of shit.</v>

31
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Usually the answer is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.200
<v Speaker 1>maybe might go with potato chips over </v>
<v Speaker 1>candy bars are fucking cookies or </v>

33
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>something stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could,</v>

34
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could eat fairly clean.</v>

122
00:06:40.771 --> 00:06:43.510
<v Speaker 1>crazy talk about asteroids and just all </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of crazy shit.</v>

123
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:48.511
<v Speaker 1>Sacred geometry.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think you're ready,</v>

133
00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:12.280
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

134
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I feel it from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

135
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:14.950
<v Speaker 1>this is your time to shine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

136
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carmen from you.</v>

137
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.000
<v Speaker 1>That's all it just altered requires.</v>

138
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a great conversation when we </v>

139
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.471
<v Speaker 1>first met and we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever since then I've been trying to </v>

140
00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:25.990
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to repeat it online.</v>

141
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.500
<v Speaker 1>There's videos of us actually having </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the conversation,</v>

142
00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:32.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's music in the background.</v>

143
00:07:32.231 --> 00:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>We're at the comedy club and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

144
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:35.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

146
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.620
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you first,</v>

147
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what we first started </v>

148
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.511
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you blew my mind when you started </v>

149
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:45.630
<v Speaker 1>talking to me about the Holocene crater </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

150
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.850
<v Speaker 1>that this pretty distinct evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been more than one events on </v>

151
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.710
<v Speaker 1>this earth besides the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows about the 65 million </v>

152
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.371
<v Speaker 1>year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one with a big chunk of rock hit the </v>

153
00:08:02.371 --> 00:08:06.811
<v Speaker 1>Yucatan and killed the dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's been a series of those and </v>

154
00:08:06.811 --> 00:08:10.750
<v Speaker 1>that these things may very well be </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for a lot of the cataclysmic</v>

155
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.870
<v Speaker 1>stories that are in epic of Gilgamesh.</v>

156
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.900
<v Speaker 1>The Noah's Ark Story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different fables and tales of </v>

157
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.400
<v Speaker 1>ancient traditions may be based on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic disasters and now since </v>

158
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:29.221
<v Speaker 1>we've spoken science has started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>validate a lot of your theories and </v>

159
00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:34.111
<v Speaker 1>ideas even more substantially the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery of this nuclear glass that </v>

160
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:37.720
<v Speaker 1>they find all throughout Europe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia.</v>

161
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.610
<v Speaker 1>did you catch the thing about a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago?</v>

163
00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in the New York Times.</v>

164
00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Most of the major newspapers are a group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of former NASA astronauts and scientists</v>

165
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:54.060
<v Speaker 1>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said we were new evidence was showing </v>

166
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.770
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're probably somewhere between three </v>

167
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:56.770
<v Speaker 1>and 10 times more likely to encounter</v>

168
00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 3>things than anybody had previously been </v>
<v Speaker 3>estimating even five to 10 years ago.</v>

169
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 3>It was a pretty major article in most of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream media.</v>

170
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 3>You mean by encounter things by getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit by something?</v>

171
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

172
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 3>You remember what happened on February </v>
<v Speaker 3>15th of 2013,</v>

173
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:15.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened on February 15th?</v>

174
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Was that very Russian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

175
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.060
<v Speaker 3>In.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was really interesting about that </v>

176
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.101
<v Speaker 3>is because everybody was at least people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are interested in this sort of </v>

177
00:09:25.101 --> 00:09:28.461
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're kind of looking to the sky anyway </v>

178
00:09:28.461 --> 00:09:30.261
<v Speaker 3>because this was the closest I'm pass of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a of an asteroid.</v>

179
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming within 17,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles of the earth at the same time.</v>

180
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:40.701
<v Speaker 3>This object totally out of the blue came</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and exploded over Chelyabinsk </v>

181
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was very interesting and </v>

182
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 3>coincidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there are such things as coincidences</v>

183
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:51.530
<v Speaker 3>that here when we're expecting this very</v>
<v Speaker 3>close fly by of an asteroid,</v>

184
00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 3>a near Earth asteroid coming actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>within our geosynchronous satellites,</v>

185
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:01.670
<v Speaker 3>within the orbit of those satellites at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time that this object is coming</v>

186
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 3>within 17,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles of the earth,</v>

187
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:09.050
<v Speaker 3>suddenly unexpectedly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here comes the second object and </v>

188
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.960
<v Speaker 3>explodes with the force of about a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

189
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was about a 50 kilo ton </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear weapon.</v>

190
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 3>And of course it had exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm quite high about 20,</v>

191
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 18 to 20 miles in the atmosphere.</v>

192
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.710
<v Speaker 3>And so it didn't kill anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

193
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 3>the thing to bear in mind is if that </v>
<v Speaker 3>object had been just a little bit bigger</v>

194
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:35.390
<v Speaker 3>or it had been a little bit dancer or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the angle of approach had been a little </v>

195
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.141
<v Speaker 3>steeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of 1600 injuries are probably </v>

196
00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 3>could have been 1600 or more casualties </v>
<v Speaker 3>at that point.</v>

197
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:44.400
<v Speaker 3>I think the world would have really sat </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and taken notice.</v>

198
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

199
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.080
<v Speaker 3>it was basically just a warning shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that our knowledge of </v>

200
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 3>asteroids and meteor impacts and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that nature,</v>

201
00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.280
<v Speaker 3>these are our actual experience on it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on this short window that we call </v>

202
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:03.720
<v Speaker 3>human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is for the earth,</v>

203
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.900
<v Speaker 3>such a brief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny blink of an eye.</v>

204
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.760
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I like to point out there that,</v>

205
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say human history,</v>

206
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:13.480
<v Speaker 3>we're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

207
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 3>4,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 5,000</v>

208
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

209
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.370
<v Speaker 3>Generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most historians of,</v>

210
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:25.371
<v Speaker 3>of ancient history will usually say that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the emergence of cuneiform writing in </v>

211
00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 3>the Middle East marks the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 3>official recorded history.</v>

212
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.920
<v Speaker 3>But you've got to bear in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

213
00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:39.921
<v Speaker 3>modern humans have been around a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer than that right now as far as the</v>

214
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:43.530
<v Speaker 3>hard evidence goes to switch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what I like to refer to.</v>

215
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means skeletal remains,</v>

216
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 3>skeletal remains of humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That as far as we know,</v>

217
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 3>are basically no different than than </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern humans.</v>

218
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.290
<v Speaker 3>If you put flesh on him and dressed him </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in modern clothes and they walked </v>

219
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:02.011
<v Speaker 3>down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't think they were anything </v>

220
00:12:02.011 --> 00:12:04.141
<v Speaker 3>unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Modern skeletal skeletal remains with </v>

221
00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 3>modern humans are now dating between </v>
<v Speaker 3>$150,</v>

222
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 3>180,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

223
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.080
<v Speaker 3>So when you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to what we actually have our </v>

224
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.410
<v Speaker 3>have our record of history or record of </v>
<v Speaker 3>history is one 20th,</v>

225
00:12:16.411 --> 00:12:21.411
<v Speaker 3>one slash 25th one 30th of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>time that we humans have been here now.</v>

226
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Now it could be that modern humans have </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually been here much longer than than</v>

227
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 3>180,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

228
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:31.981
<v Speaker 3>We have no way of knowing at what point </v>
<v Speaker 3>we moderns first appeared on this </v>

229
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you think of 180,000</v>

230
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:37.450
<v Speaker 3>years compared to let's say in round </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers,</v>

231
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:38.530
<v Speaker 3>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

232
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 3>it means that there's a lot of the human</v>
<v Speaker 3>story missing.</v>

233
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:47.250
<v Speaker 3>And the thing that's always intrigued me</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that given the assumption that they </v>

234
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.850
<v Speaker 3>would have had the same intelligence as </v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

235
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:54.910
<v Speaker 3>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got the same brain case size,</v>

236
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:59.911
<v Speaker 3>the same cranial capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one would assume that with brains as </v>

237
00:12:59.911 --> 00:13:01.860
<v Speaker 3>big as our modern brains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were able to think they had four,</v>

238
00:13:01.861 --> 00:13:05.590
<v Speaker 3>thought they were able to plan ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>presumably have a,</v>

239
00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:07.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

240
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:12.061
<v Speaker 3>have some kind of a tradition that could</v>
<v Speaker 3>be passed on from generation to </v>

241
00:13:12.061 --> 00:13:15.451
<v Speaker 3>generation and accumulated learning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what we see is that there's </v>

242
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:20.620
<v Speaker 3>basically no record to speak of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what people were doing culturally.</v>

243
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

244
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:27.390
<v Speaker 3>and that has led a lot of scientists to </v>
<v Speaker 3>assume that for all those tens of </v>

245
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:31.630
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years and hundreds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of generations,</v>

246
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 3>that people were essentially living </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing more than a subsistence,</v>

247
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 3>a kind of a hunter gatherer existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

248
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.040
<v Speaker 3>But what they haven't taken into account</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the extremity of some of the global </v>

249
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:48.490
<v Speaker 3>changes that have occurred in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the interval that we humans have been</v>

250
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:53.491
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as we go through our discussion </v>

251
00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:56.341
<v Speaker 3>today and it will pull up some images,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you'll begin to get an idea of </v>

252
00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.710
<v Speaker 3>how extreme and how sweeping some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these changes have been and why in the </v>

253
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 3>aftermath of those changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't,</v>

254
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't expect to find a whole lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard cultural evidence.</v>

255
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Because what you'll hopefully begin to </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate is that we're some of these </v>

256
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:20.130
<v Speaker 3>events of the scale and magnitude that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have happened probably a dozen or more </v>

257
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.590
<v Speaker 3>times in the 150 or 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years that we've been here.</v>

258
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Were those events to occur today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten thousand years from now I'm </v>

259
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.420
<v Speaker 3>archeologists would be sifting through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

260
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.200
<v Speaker 3>through the rubble looking for any kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of evidence that we had ever been here.</v>

261
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.650
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing we have to get into</v>
<v Speaker 3>our consciousness,</v>

262
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.610
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And well I guess if there's any,</v>

263
00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:45.611
<v Speaker 3>any implication of the work that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been doing is that we certainly can't </v>

264
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:50.041
<v Speaker 3>take our president position for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems very difficult for us to put </v>

265
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:57.191
<v Speaker 3>into perspective numbers like 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a hundred thousand or a million.</v>

266
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:02.650
<v Speaker 3>We know that the universe has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>around allegedly for 14 billion,</v>

267
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:08.590
<v Speaker 3>so the earth is four point 6 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those numbers are so weird to us.</v>

268
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.260
<v Speaker 3>They don't register.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just like,</v>

269
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:16.130
<v Speaker 3>I know 4 billion is more than 400,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but both of them are alien.</v>

270
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

271
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we could really wrap our </v>
<v Speaker 3>head around the idea that 10,000</v>

272
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:26.771
<v Speaker 3>years is such an incredible length of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time that if you left a car out for </v>

273
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years within,</v>

274
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three or 4,000,</v>

275
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:36.730
<v Speaker 3>it would be absorbed completely by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Earth Joe within three or four </v>

276
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:36.730
<v Speaker 3>centuries.</v>

277
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:37.310
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

278
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at,</v>

279
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean steel body cars I remember very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well as a kid,</v>

280
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:46.340
<v Speaker 3>not far from where we lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a auto junk auto graveyard and</v>

281
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:51.341
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the teenagers around there who were </v>

282
00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 3>racing cars back in the fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crashing them up and everything,</v>

283
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:57.131
<v Speaker 3>they seem to end up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a kid I used to like to go and </v>

284
00:15:57.131 --> 00:15:57.830
<v Speaker 3>kind of hang around there and play in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the old cars,</v>

285
00:15:57.831 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 3>but they were already after sitting out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there for 10 years,</v>

286
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean already well underway to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to rusting away.</v>

287
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once that process of oxidation begins to</v>

288
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.270
<v Speaker 3>take place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it accelerates not far from where I live</v>

289
00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:16.271
<v Speaker 3>in Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an old iron bridge that had </v>

290
00:16:16.271 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 3>been built around the 18 nineties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's no longer there,</v>

291
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.490
<v Speaker 3>but by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the 19 eighties,</v>

292
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.380
<v Speaker 3>it had almost rusted to nothing.</v>

293
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 3>And within a century it almost rusted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

294
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>metal does not last long.</v>

295
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.710
<v Speaker 3>When exposed to the elements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an interesting series of shows</v>

296
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.380
<v Speaker 3>a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

297
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.070
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had to do with the idea of if,</v>

298
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:43.090
<v Speaker 3>what if humans just suddenly depart?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if we took humans out of the </v>

299
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.960
<v Speaker 3>equation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would happen to all of the </v>

300
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.881
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure left behind just under </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal kind of gradual listic change </v>

301
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:51.920
<v Speaker 3>that we're used to within the last few </v>
<v Speaker 3>centuries.</v>

302
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.950
<v Speaker 3>The upshot of it was the 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years from now,</v>

303
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.460
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty much gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

304
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

305
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.980
<v Speaker 3>the great buildings that make up all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>metropolis metropolitan areas now of the</v>

306
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:10.121
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them are steel frame structures </v>

307
00:17:10.121 --> 00:17:13.960
<v Speaker 3>and they're clothed in a skin that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will keep the elements out maybe </v>

308
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:17.000
<v Speaker 3>for a half a century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But without maintenance,</v>

309
00:17:17.001 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

310
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:18.210
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

311
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:22.490
<v Speaker 3>the Golden Gate Bridge up in San </v>
<v Speaker 3>Francisco is constantly ongoing,</v>

312
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:27.170
<v Speaker 3>undergoing maintenance because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped maintaining it immediately,</v>

313
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:32.171
<v Speaker 3>it starts decaying immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It starts rusting and interesting.</v>

314
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.970
<v Speaker 3>If you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we suddenly,</v>

315
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 3>if humans left the planet 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years from now,</v>

316
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.950
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

317
00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interstellar anthropologists arrive,</v>

318
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.010
<v Speaker 3>what would they see that would indicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we had been here?</v>

319
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:48.650
<v Speaker 3>What do you think would still be left </v>
<v Speaker 3>after 10,000</v>

320
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's actually two things that</v>

321
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.040
<v Speaker 1>they named in this particular program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you can guess one of them out </v>

322
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 1>rushmore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mount Rushmore.</v>

323
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good guests.</v>

324
00:17:56.461 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of them.</v>

325
00:17:57.391 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And of course the great pyramid with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other one and that's it.</v>

326
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else has gone.</v>

327
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

328
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you now begin to factor in,</v>

329
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:12.380
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I've been basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with is the idea that we have </v>

330
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 1>these intermittent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call them nonlinearities.</v>

331
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 1>A discontinuity is within the normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly progression of things.</v>

332
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 1>The catastrophes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

333
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.480
<v Speaker 1>superimpose a few of those in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process and basically 5,000,</v>

334
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years from now,</v>

335
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to find much to show </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we had been here.</v>

336
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.540
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you see structures like a go,</v>

337
00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:41.541
<v Speaker 1>Beckley tapping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is within the last couple of </v>

338
00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:41.541
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been on earth in,</v>

339
00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:46.400
<v Speaker 1>in Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has really thrown a giant monkey </v>

340
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.080
<v Speaker 1>wrench into the timeline of the hunter </v>
<v Speaker 1>gatherer,</v>

341
00:18:47.081 --> 00:18:50.420
<v Speaker 1>a transition into the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>agricultural,</v>

342
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.480
<v Speaker 1>a city.</v>

343
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:56.970
<v Speaker 1>We were in a weird state because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are starting to dig up these things and </v>

344
00:18:57.001 --> 00:18:57.480
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beckley.</v>

345
00:18:57.481 --> 00:19:02.481
<v Speaker 1>Tempe was a completely unknown structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>until this one farmer or hurt or had </v>

346
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:04.730
<v Speaker 1>found a stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

347
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:09.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to unearthing it and then </v>

348
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.121
<v Speaker 1>realized it was these huge stone pillars</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an unknown civilization carved with </v>

349
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.030
<v Speaker 1>three dimensional shapes of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

350
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Some of them weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't even native to the area.</v>

351
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:22.521
<v Speaker 1>So it's incredibly confusing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposely covered up 14 to 12 to 14,000</v>

352
00:19:25.411 --> 00:19:30.411
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that who knows how long it </v>

353
00:19:30.411 --> 00:19:33.861
<v Speaker 1>was there before it could have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>several thousand years old when they </v>

354
00:19:33.861 --> 00:19:37.371
<v Speaker 1>decided to cover it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was purposely filled in and </v>

355
00:19:37.371 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 1>enormous area purposely filled in </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around 12,000</v>

356
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:45.411
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could it have been purposely covered up </v>

357
00:19:45.411 --> 00:19:48.261
<v Speaker 1>in order to protect it and preserve it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be right that we were hoping or </v>

358
00:19:48.261 --> 00:19:50.280
<v Speaker 1>they were hoping rather than someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like us would come along,</v>

359
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 1>not us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like definitely not me.</v>

360
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone would come along and uncover it </v>

361
00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:57.630
<v Speaker 1>and then go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

362
00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:58.240
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

363
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:03.260
<v Speaker 1>what's this all about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe they knew that there were </v>

364
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.700
<v Speaker 1>going to be moments in time where these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things happen,</v>

365
00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:10.701
<v Speaker 1>these impacts these asteroidal impacts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there needed to be some sort </v>

366
00:20:11.401 --> 00:20:13.950
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way of keeping track or some sort of a</v>

367
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:18.951
<v Speaker 1>way of preserving well that that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably be one way of preserving it for</v>

368
00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:24.111
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing would be just like </v>

369
00:20:24.111 --> 00:20:24.111
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned the two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mount Rushmore,</v>

370
00:20:24.111 --> 00:20:25.110
<v Speaker 1>integrate pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

371
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:30.111
<v Speaker 1>are both built of stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously much more durable </v>

372
00:20:30.111 --> 00:20:34.110
<v Speaker 1>than steel or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fabricated materials that we're,</v>

373
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.900
<v Speaker 1>we're making today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even plastics,</v>

374
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.570
<v Speaker 1>plastics are gonna Degrade over a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>millennium.</v>

375
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to preserve something </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Malania,</v>

376
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.320
<v Speaker 1>make it out of stone and making </v>
<v Speaker 1>monumental.</v>

377
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

378
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.980
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at at something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just made an interesting point about</v>

379
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.750
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could we,</v>

380
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.550
<v Speaker 3>how much previous to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

381
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.820
<v Speaker 3>to the burial edit actually been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

382
00:20:57.821 --> 00:21:01.630
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult to dates don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way you would dates known is,</v>

383
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can use various,</v>

384
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:04.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

385
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.550
<v Speaker 3>cosmic magenic ways where when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>expose stone to atmosphere,</v>

386
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.700
<v Speaker 3>it's going to accumulate cosmic rays </v>
<v Speaker 3>which caused changes within the stone </v>

387
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 3>that can actually be measured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it's buried,</v>

388
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to be subject to cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 3>rays so that you can't date it that way.</v>

389
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Which you would probably have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>date.</v>

390
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:28.650
<v Speaker 3>Find some organic material within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>soil matrix or matrix of material around</v>

391
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 3>it and date that material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even there,</v>

392
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:37.411
<v Speaker 3>see that's not going to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's only going to give you a minimum </v>

393
00:21:37.411 --> 00:21:37.411
<v Speaker 3>date,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in other words,</v>

394
00:21:37.411 --> 00:21:41.640
<v Speaker 3>the structure's there for who knows how </v>
<v Speaker 3>long they decided to bury it and they </v>

395
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.331
<v Speaker 3>bring in the material and bury it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if some organic material is in that </v>

396
00:21:45.331 --> 00:21:49.081
<v Speaker 3>soil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily going to be </v>

397
00:21:49.081 --> 00:21:49.960
<v Speaker 3>indicative of the age of the stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure itself.</v>

398
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.960
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be indicative of the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>at which it was buried and how did they </v>

399
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 3>determine that it was buried at 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

400
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:03.031
<v Speaker 3>Was it the uniformity of the depth of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume now I haven't made a </v>

401
00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:07.861
<v Speaker 3>study of Go Beckley tappy yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping that when I get a chance to </v>

402
00:22:07.861 --> 00:22:11.041
<v Speaker 3>hang out with Graham Hancock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get filled in on all the </v>

403
00:22:11.041 --> 00:22:14.401
<v Speaker 3>details of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know specifically about that </v>

404
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.830
<v Speaker 3>other monuments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do suspect that,</v>

405
00:22:17.831 --> 00:22:20.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>name Pedang is probably very old.</v>

406
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Seen Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the monumental stone work that </v>

407
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.330
<v Speaker 3>we find like a bailed back where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have these monstrous,</v>

408
00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:34.060
<v Speaker 3>a megaliths probably go back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pleistocene times.</v>

409
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:39.061
<v Speaker 3>And when I say Pleistocene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about the period from like </v>

410
00:22:39.061 --> 00:22:42.810
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years back about two and a half million </v>

411
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.211
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The time during which there has been </v>

412
00:22:45.211 --> 00:22:47.050
<v Speaker 3>this succession of glacial ages and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Interglacial Ages.</v>

413
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

414
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.790
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned the term policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about that.</v>

415
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Holocene is essentially the modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>geological epoch.</v>

416
00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.480
<v Speaker 3>We've been in this Holocene epoch for </v>
<v Speaker 3>generally they say 10,000</v>

417
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:05.881
<v Speaker 3>years in rough numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it's becoming much more </v>

418
00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:08.971
<v Speaker 3>precisely dated now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll find a lot of references in the </v>

419
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:12.421
<v Speaker 3>scientific literature that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives the date 11 point six or 11,600</v>

420
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:15.550
<v Speaker 3>years as being the onset of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Holocene.</v>

421
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.200
<v Speaker 3>Which is an interesting date for me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't know if you've ever read</v>

422
00:23:20.201 --> 00:23:23.770
<v Speaker 3>plato in his accounts of Atlantis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two of his dialogues,</v>

423
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.800
<v Speaker 3>courteous and tomatoes in which he </v>
<v Speaker 3>describes Atlantis and he gives the </v>

424
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.960
<v Speaker 3>dating and near a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least on three separate occasions.</v>

425
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.210
<v Speaker 3>And he always places that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this whole success,</v>

426
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.240
<v Speaker 3>the whole lineage of the story goes back</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Solon,</v>

427
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 3>who was a historical character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unauthenticated historical character who</v>

428
00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:48.451
<v Speaker 3>lived at about 600 BC and he was a law </v>
<v Speaker 3>giver and poet in Athens and due to </v>

429
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:54.461
<v Speaker 3>political pressures and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went into a 10 year exile and during </v>

430
00:23:54.461 --> 00:23:57.270
<v Speaker 3>that 10 year exile he went to Egypt and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was there that he presumably would've</v>

431
00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.730
<v Speaker 3>heard the tale of Atlantis from elderly </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian priests.</v>

432
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.750
<v Speaker 3>And he was told and came back and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>told the story to his grandson who told </v>

433
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:13.601
<v Speaker 3>it again to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to several individuals before it </v>

434
00:24:13.601 --> 00:24:16.580
<v Speaker 3>actually got to socrates and Plato who </v>
<v Speaker 3>presumably wrote it down.</v>

435
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.090
<v Speaker 3>But what it's interesting is that in in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Plato's account,</v>

436
00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:25.091
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gives the dating for the demise of </v>

437
00:24:25.091 --> 00:24:27.641
<v Speaker 3>Atlantis as 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years prior to solange exile to Egypt.</v>

438
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given that,</v>

439
00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:31.970
<v Speaker 3>that took place and give or take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>decade or two,</v>

440
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:34.550
<v Speaker 3>600 BC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go back,</v>

441
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:36.230
<v Speaker 3>that's 2,600</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

442
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Add that to the 9,000</v>

443
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:40.280
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've got 11,600</v>

444
00:24:40.281 --> 00:24:43.220
<v Speaker 3>years ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to Plato's account,</v>

445
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.640
<v Speaker 3>he says that it was shortly after this </v>
<v Speaker 3>great war between the Atlantic eons and </v>

446
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:53.930
<v Speaker 3>to produce Athenians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was this tremendous cataclysm</v>

447
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:59.230
<v Speaker 3>and Atlanta sunk beneath the waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's giving that date at 11,600</v>

448
00:25:00.561 --> 00:25:05.561
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We now know from the scientific record </v>

449
00:25:05.561 --> 00:25:06.680
<v Speaker 3>that at 11,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>600 years ago,</v>

450
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 3>there was a major climate transition and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a catastrophic warming spike </v>

451
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:16.810
<v Speaker 3>that was associated with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mega scale meltdown event of the great</v>

452
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:19.970
<v Speaker 3>ice sheets that were covering North </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

453
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.420
<v Speaker 3>It was this event at 11,600,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially jerked the planet out of the</v>

454
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:31.180
<v Speaker 3>depths of this ice agent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had been in for thousands and </v>

455
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.481
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years with that melting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had a rapid rise of sea level.</v>

456
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's very interesting that the date </v>

457
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.780
<v Speaker 3>that he gives is precisely now the date </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

458
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:48.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the scientists are giving for this </v>

459
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.580
<v Speaker 3>transition from what's called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger dryas.</v>

460
00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:51.750
<v Speaker 3>I think Graham has mentioned that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

461
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.890
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some of your interviews with him that</v>

462
00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.940
<v Speaker 3>the younger dryas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was this climate spasm that ended </v>

463
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.631
<v Speaker 3>the last ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we look at the chronology of </v>

464
00:26:04.631 --> 00:26:06.350
<v Speaker 3>events around 26,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

465
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:11.860
<v Speaker 3>we were in the later phases of a what </v>
<v Speaker 3>appears to have been an interglacial </v>

466
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.840
<v Speaker 3>period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not too much different from what we're </v>

467
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.200
<v Speaker 3>in now around 26,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

468
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:23.350
<v Speaker 3>The climate rapidly degenerated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these massive glaciers had expanded,</v>

469
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during this,</v>

470
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:27.700
<v Speaker 3>what they call the final phase or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

471
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:28.390
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

472
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:33.430
<v Speaker 3>the late Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they refer to it because initially they </v>

473
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.880
<v Speaker 3>were looking for this evidence into </v>
<v Speaker 3>state of Wisconsin.</v>

474
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.150
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they named the,</v>

475
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.600
<v Speaker 3>this last final phase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the late Wisconsin.</v>

476
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.060
<v Speaker 3>So around 26,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

477
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 3>we see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the launching of this final phase of the</v>

478
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:48.750
<v Speaker 3>ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The late Wisconsin then at around 13,000</v>

479
00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:50.640
<v Speaker 3>years ago is the dates are now giving </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

480
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.120
<v Speaker 3>There was this enormous spasm of warming</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this seemed to be associated with </v>

481
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 3>rapid melting and the first real rapid </v>
<v Speaker 3>sea level rise.</v>

482
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:06.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened is after a very short </v>

483
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:09.051
<v Speaker 3>interval of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the climate snap back into the full </v>

484
00:27:09.051 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 3>depths of glacial cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what had happened was if you go back</v>

485
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:14.010
<v Speaker 3>18,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

486
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 3>this was the coldest part of the ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>

487
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was bitterly cold period of time.</v>

488
00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I live in,</v>

489
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:29.020
<v Speaker 3>in Georgia was the forests that grew </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were like the forest you find in </v>

490
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:33.321
<v Speaker 3>Canada now you had Tundra up in Northern</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kentucky and Southern Idaho Tundra in </v>

491
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:35.940
<v Speaker 3>southern southern Ohio.</v>

492
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.570
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

493
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.860
<v Speaker 3>so it was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really different climate.</v>

494
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:46.100
<v Speaker 3>And once you got to northern Ohio and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the northern United States where New </v>

495
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.160
<v Speaker 3>York City is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicago,</v>

496
00:27:47.161 --> 00:27:49.170
<v Speaker 3>the Great Lakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dakotas,</v>

497
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 3>all of that was under this massive ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheet.</v>

498
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of feet thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go up into Canada over Canada,</v>

499
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.710
<v Speaker 3>the ice was up to two miles thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

500
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:03.730
<v Speaker 3>think about that two miles thick of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it reached from the Atlantic to the </v>

501
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:08.810
<v Speaker 3>Pacific Ocean and from the northern </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States as far south as the 45th </v>

502
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:09.960
<v Speaker 3>parallel all the way up to the Arctic </v>
<v Speaker 3>circle.</v>

503
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Now that is a drastically different </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

504
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:19.220
<v Speaker 3>bare in mind too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that with that much ice piled up on the </v>

505
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.810
<v Speaker 3>surface of the land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sea levels which contribute to dewater,</v>

506
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:26.870
<v Speaker 3>that formed that ice had to go down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's now well documented that sea levels</v>

507
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 3>during the depth of the ice were at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least 400 feet lower than now,</v>

508
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.810
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that the continental shelves</v>

509
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.390
<v Speaker 3>of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're basically exposed now,</v>

510
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I live in Georgia.</v>

511
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.440
<v Speaker 3>If you go out and stand right now on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beach,</v>

512
00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:45.441
<v Speaker 3>like a Cumberland Island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is beautiful wilderness preserve </v>

513
00:28:45.441 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 3>your stand there on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were suddenly transported back to</v>

514
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:53.031
<v Speaker 3>the depths of the ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be in the middle of a boreal </v>

515
00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:55.371
<v Speaker 3>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning a northern forest with spruce </v>

516
00:28:55.371 --> 00:28:55.371
<v Speaker 3>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>large trees,</v>

517
00:28:55.371 --> 00:28:58.881
<v Speaker 3>alder trees to kind of trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find now in the northern United </v>

518
00:28:58.881 --> 00:28:58.881
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

519
00:28:58.881 --> 00:29:01.230
<v Speaker 3>that area and the beach wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been anywhere,</v>

520
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.690
<v Speaker 3>anywhere close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have been another 50,</v>

521
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:07.320
<v Speaker 3>7,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles further to the east because as the</v>

522
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:08.820
<v Speaker 3>sea level drops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens?</v>

523
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.080
<v Speaker 3>It recedes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

524
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:15.210
<v Speaker 3>And so when this final phase of the ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>age came on,</v>

525
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:20.310
<v Speaker 3>sea levels begin to drop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what it did was it exposed all of</v>

526
00:29:20.311 --> 00:29:25.311
<v Speaker 3>the shallow marine ecologies that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that redeemed all of the continents to </v>

527
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 3>the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and basically would have caused enormous</v>

528
00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:30.810
<v Speaker 3>ecological havoc.</v>

529
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Well then within a millennia or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the forests had,</v>

530
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:39.770
<v Speaker 3>had expanded and had now grown out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now off the eastern seaboard of the </v>

531
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.770
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they constantly will find the remains of</v>

532
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 3>tree stumps and forests that had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing.</v>

533
00:29:46.991 --> 00:29:48.310
<v Speaker 3>They're 14,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

534
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:49.690
<v Speaker 3>16,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

535
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Now the ice begins to melt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sea level begins to rise.</v>

536
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Now it's important to realize that if we</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the way modern civilization has </v>

537
00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 3>evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we see is,</v>

538
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:01.000
<v Speaker 3>where did the first city show up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

539
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.270
<v Speaker 3>aren't they mostly trading cities that </v>
<v Speaker 3>show up up there?</v>

540
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:09.271
<v Speaker 3>Port cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they show up along the confluence of </v>

541
00:30:09.271 --> 00:30:12.871
<v Speaker 3>rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They show up where rivers meet the </v>

542
00:30:12.871 --> 00:30:12.871
<v Speaker 3>oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they show up on the,</v>

543
00:30:12.871 --> 00:30:13.180
<v Speaker 3>on the coastlines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

544
00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 3>So if you had major cities during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ice age,</v>

545
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.690
<v Speaker 3>as Graham has pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are now 400 feet underwater.</v>

546
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you begin to appreciate when you </v>

547
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.140
<v Speaker 3>begin to really look at the history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our planet,</v>

548
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:30.730
<v Speaker 3>what you realize is that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost unimaginably dynamic.</v>

549
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.660
<v Speaker 3>This an alteration from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from an interglacial to a glacial age is</v>

550
00:30:35.661 --> 00:30:40.661
<v Speaker 3>an extreme process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I guess the upshot of it is,</v>

551
00:30:42.091 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 3>is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

552
00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:47.080
<v Speaker 3>when we look now at the climate record </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have in hand now,</v>

553
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.740
<v Speaker 3>which has been pretty much reconstructed</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a fair amount of accuracy back to </v>

554
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.740
<v Speaker 3>about 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

555
00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:58.060
<v Speaker 3>And these are primarily based on ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>cores extracted from Greenland,</v>

556
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.630
<v Speaker 3>extracted from Antarctica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extracted from mountain glaciers,</v>

557
00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:05.490
<v Speaker 3>and and most mostly mostly Antarctic </v>
<v Speaker 3>agreement.</v>

558
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you pull out that ice core,</v>

559
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.790
<v Speaker 3>it's layered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

560
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.920
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of cutting down a tree and looking</v>

561
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:16.921
<v Speaker 3>at the annual layers where you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually count the number of layers in </v>

562
00:31:16.921 --> 00:31:19.480
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a cross section of a tree log,</v>

563
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:20.770
<v Speaker 3>and you'll know how old it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

564
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very similar in a,</v>

565
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 3>in a nice court,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got layers and layers because </v>

566
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:28.600
<v Speaker 3>each year they're snow.</v>

567
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.800
<v Speaker 3>That falls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets compressed into Fern,</v>

568
00:31:29.801 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 3>F,</v>
<v Speaker 3>r a n,</v>

569
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:36.001
<v Speaker 3>which is the transitional phase between </v>
<v Speaker 3>snow and glacial ice and it eventually </v>

570
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:41.071
<v Speaker 3>gets compressed into glacial ice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at a cross section of the </v>

571
00:31:41.071 --> 00:31:41.290
<v Speaker 3>ice core,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see these find layers in there,</v>

572
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they can go back and they can look at</v>

573
00:31:43.421 --> 00:31:48.421
<v Speaker 3>these layers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can count the layers and there's a </v>

574
00:31:48.421 --> 00:31:49.900
<v Speaker 3>lot of things going on in these layers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oxygen isotopes are are critical one for</v>

575
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.930
<v Speaker 3>for ascertaining climate changes because</v>
<v Speaker 3>oxygen isotopes are a function of </v>

576
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.720
<v Speaker 3>temperature and we have a graph here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll pull up in a minute.</v>

577
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.750
<v Speaker 3>We can actually look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we see is that the climate has </v>

578
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.840
<v Speaker 3>constantly oscillated back and forth and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we look at the Holocene,</v>

579
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:12.870
<v Speaker 3>going back 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years and then we take that </v>

580
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.310
<v Speaker 3>comparatively and we go back 250 to </v>
<v Speaker 3>400,000</v>

581
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:20.311
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can now begin to reconstruct these </v>

582
00:32:20.311 --> 00:32:21.820
<v Speaker 3>intervals of glacial periods.</v>

583
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Interglacial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's the thing that should be </v>

584
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.911
<v Speaker 3>sobering to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to everybody on the planet today as we </v>

585
00:32:29.911 --> 00:32:30.940
<v Speaker 3>think about climate change and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

586
00:32:30.941 --> 00:32:35.941
<v Speaker 3>Because obviously it's constantly in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>news and all the longest interglacial </v>

587
00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:40.700
<v Speaker 3>period now on record for at least last </v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter million years.</v>

588
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.730
<v Speaker 3>The longest one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the longest unbroken period of </v>

589
00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.090
<v Speaker 3>interglacial warmth is the Holocene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one we're in now,</v>

590
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.920
<v Speaker 3>we've already exceeded by several </v>
<v Speaker 3>millennia,</v>

591
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:56.060
<v Speaker 3>the longest previous period of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interglacial warmth.</v>

592
00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't hear them talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't hear Al Gore talking about that.</v>

593
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't hear anybody talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>in mainstream media,</v>

594
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:08.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard scientific fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

595
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:13.241
<v Speaker 3>We would be shitting our pants way more </v>
<v Speaker 3>if it was a global cooling than if it </v>

596
00:33:13.241 --> 00:33:15.740
<v Speaker 3>was a global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let me tell her under.</v>

597
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 3>We're going to pull up another graph </v>
<v Speaker 3>will pull up a graph in a minute which </v>

598
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.310
<v Speaker 3>shows you that even within the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of thousand years,</v>

599
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.690
<v Speaker 3>periods of global cooling have not been </v>
<v Speaker 3>pleasant times.</v>

600
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Periods of global warming is when we see</v>
<v Speaker 3>human population expanding.</v>

601
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.560
<v Speaker 3>When we see cultural advancement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we see lifespans increasing,</v>

602
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.920
<v Speaker 3>when we see infant mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decreasing periods of global cooling are</v>

603
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 3>when we see populations going into </v>
<v Speaker 3>decline.</v>

604
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.210
<v Speaker 3>When we see lifespans diminishing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

605
00:33:50.211 --> 00:33:55.130
<v Speaker 3>we had a period of global cooling that </v>
<v Speaker 3>began between 5:36</v>

606
00:33:55.131 --> 00:33:57.100
<v Speaker 3>and 5:40</v>
<v Speaker 3>a d.</v>

607
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.560
<v Speaker 3>It was this period of global cooling </v>
<v Speaker 3>that launched what we know of the dark </v>

608
00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.550
<v Speaker 3>ages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this has now been well documented by</v>

609
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.560
<v Speaker 3>dendrochronologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Bailey is one of the leaders of </v>

610
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.581
<v Speaker 3>this who's been looking at the climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes of the last couple thousand </v>

611
00:34:15.581 --> 00:34:19.250
<v Speaker 3>years as preserved in the tree ring </v>
<v Speaker 3>record between 5:36</v>

612
00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:21.160
<v Speaker 3>and about 5:44</v>
<v Speaker 3>a d.</v>

613
00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:27.100
<v Speaker 3>We find that forest growth in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>northern hemisphere almost came to a </v>

614
00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.520
<v Speaker 3>stop and one of the consequences of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was this,</v>

615
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.050
<v Speaker 3>it was associated with a global cooling </v>
<v Speaker 3>and for multiple years running,</v>

616
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:41.080
<v Speaker 3>there were agricultural collapses were </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the cold and damp that came </v>

617
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.780
<v Speaker 3>on with this.</v>

618
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

619
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:48.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the historical record is interesting </v>

620
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:48.350
<v Speaker 3>because you read some of these accounts </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were preserved from that period.</v>

621
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.040
<v Speaker 3>They talk about weeks at a time where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't see the sun.</v>

622
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:57.220
<v Speaker 3>They talk about when it did show up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just a feeble imitation of </v>

623
00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:57.440
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They talk about,</v>

624
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>years with no summer basically,</v>

625
00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:05.590
<v Speaker 3>so what you had was succession of crop </v>
<v Speaker 3>failures that lead to people becoming </v>

626
00:35:06.381 --> 00:35:11.381
<v Speaker 3>malnourished once they become </v>
<v Speaker 3>malnourished or immune systems became </v>

627
00:35:11.381 --> 00:35:15.731
<v Speaker 3>weakened and in 5:40</v>
<v Speaker 3>to add about six years after this well </v>

628
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:20.990
<v Speaker 3>documented transition occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had the onset of the justinian plague</v>

629
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:26.260
<v Speaker 3>which wiped out a third of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>population of Europe and it took 300 </v>

630
00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.370
<v Speaker 3>years to recover from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it didn't.</v>

631
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:33.400
<v Speaker 3>We didn't recover from it until the </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate shifted again and we went into </v>

632
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.571
<v Speaker 3>what's known as the medieval warm period</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the medieval warm period was the </v>

633
00:35:37.571 --> 00:35:41.640
<v Speaker 3>time when the scandinavians were farming</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the west coast of Greenland,</v>

634
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:46.700
<v Speaker 3>where now it's perennially frozen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>for about the next couple of hundred </v>

635
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:51.801
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the climate was according to some </v>

636
00:35:51.801 --> 00:35:54.090
<v Speaker 3>researchers and some scientists as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>as two degrees warmer than now.</v>

637
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.370
<v Speaker 3>And do you think it had to have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>warmer if,</v>

638
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.850
<v Speaker 3>if they were farming in greenland where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is now?</v>

639
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Frozen ground?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to have been warmer and one of </v>

640
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.830
<v Speaker 3>the things that happened with was with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this warming,</v>

641
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:13.220
<v Speaker 3>you had an expansion of the growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>season and you also had the latitude </v>

642
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:18.390
<v Speaker 3>belt at which viable farming or </v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture could be.</v>

643
00:36:18.391 --> 00:36:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Practice shifted three to 400 miles </v>
<v Speaker 3>north of where it had been,</v>

644
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:27.020
<v Speaker 3>which meant that for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>England actually had a flourishing wine </v>

645
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.921
<v Speaker 3>industry which didn't exist previously </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it has only existed until recent </v>

646
00:36:31.411 --> 00:36:36.411
<v Speaker 3>times because of genetically modified </v>
<v Speaker 3>crops is now allowing them to grow </v>

647
00:36:36.411 --> 00:36:40.650
<v Speaker 3>grapes where they haven't been able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>grow wine grapes until we go back to the</v>

648
00:36:40.651 --> 00:36:45.651
<v Speaker 3>medieval warm period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened was now there was a lot</v>

649
00:36:45.691 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 3>of food for people to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

650
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.080
<v Speaker 3>People got healthier.</v>

651
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.590
<v Speaker 3>A human population began to increase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

652
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.960
<v Speaker 3>We begin to accumulate wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We begin to,</v>

653
00:36:55.020 --> 00:37:00.020
<v Speaker 3>to carry on commerce and trade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After this 300 years of dark ages were </v>

654
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:03.870
<v Speaker 3>learning receded into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the monasteries.</v>

655
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.040
<v Speaker 3>And life was very unpleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very short,</v>

656
00:37:08.041 --> 00:37:09.600
<v Speaker 3>very brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unpleasant.</v>

657
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Now we had this warming period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>

658
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:17.780
<v Speaker 3>With the growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the expansion of agriculture and the </v>

659
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:17.890
<v Speaker 3>abundant food supply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

660
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:22.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prolific harvest people were getting </v>

661
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:22.970
<v Speaker 3>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy again,</v>

662
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:27.090
<v Speaker 3>a statute and it's been well documented </v>
<v Speaker 3>that during this two or 300 years of the</v>

663
00:37:27.091 --> 00:37:32.091
<v Speaker 3>medieval warming period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human stature actually increased by </v>

664
00:37:32.091 --> 00:37:33.300
<v Speaker 3>inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Average human size,</v>

665
00:37:33.301 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

666
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.880
<v Speaker 3>by 1150,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this accumulated wealth that had ensued </v>

667
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:43.830
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

668
00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:44.430
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

669
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:49.290
<v Speaker 3>the benign climate of the medieval warm </v>
<v Speaker 3>period is what allowed the,</v>

670
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:54.291
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Great Cathedral building era to </v>

671
00:37:54.291 --> 00:37:57.651
<v Speaker 3>ensue which began between 1130 and 1150 </v>
<v Speaker 3>add and what we see as eco magnificent </v>

672
00:37:58.651 --> 00:37:59.160
<v Speaker 3>cathedrals.</v>

673
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:04.160
<v Speaker 3>If you've been to Europe and visited any</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Kathy put that on your to do </v>

674
00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.031
<v Speaker 3>list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get there and look at some of these </v>

675
00:38:08.031 --> 00:38:10.581
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary works of art that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>built during the high gothic or high </v>

676
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:13.230
<v Speaker 3>middle ages between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

677
00:38:13.231 --> 00:38:18.150
<v Speaker 3>about 1150 and the early 13 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They built 80,</v>

678
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.380
<v Speaker 3>about 80 of these gigantic magnificent </v>
<v Speaker 3>cathedrals that,</v>

679
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:27.440
<v Speaker 3>that required the organizing of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of thousands of highly,</v>

680
00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:34.320
<v Speaker 3>highly skilled craftsman armies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>workers and craftsman.</v>

681
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.990
<v Speaker 3>You had stone masons and carpenters and </v>
<v Speaker 3>glaziers and astronomers and GM </v>

682
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:43.480
<v Speaker 3>attritions and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of these people brought together</v>

683
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:48.481
<v Speaker 3>to create these incredible cathedrals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was made possible by the fact </v>

684
00:38:48.481 --> 00:38:52.411
<v Speaker 3>that European society had become </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively wealthy and this wealth was </v>

685
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.280
<v Speaker 3>brought on by this global warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now what we see,</v>

686
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.440
<v Speaker 3>go ahead to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the beginning,</v>

687
00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.320
<v Speaker 3>to the end of this magnificent gothic </v>
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>

688
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:02.700
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

689
00:39:02.701 --> 00:39:07.701
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's about 500 smaller abby's that </v>

690
00:39:07.701 --> 00:39:12.421
<v Speaker 3>were constructed during this interval.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a very prolific time for a </v>

691
00:39:12.421 --> 00:39:16.171
<v Speaker 3>number of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was the time that you had the </v>

692
00:39:16.171 --> 00:39:16.171
<v Speaker 3>templar knights forming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've probably heard of that.</v>

693
00:39:16.171 --> 00:39:17.290
<v Speaker 3>The tempur nights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

694
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had schools of Kabbalah being </v>

695
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.160
<v Speaker 3>founded in Spain and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you had the rise of Catheter Ism.</v>

696
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.520
<v Speaker 3>You had the troubadours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had these amazing spiritual things </v>

697
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:31.680
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

698
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.910
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Culturally.</v>

699
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:37.090
<v Speaker 3>It was a very extraordinary time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those high Middle Ages.</v>

700
00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:42.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those gothic cathedrals were </v>

701
00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:45.061
<v Speaker 3>never finished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we see is that some of them </v>

702
00:39:45.061 --> 00:39:45.061
<v Speaker 3>have the appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

703
00:39:45.061 --> 00:39:48.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm a builder by profession and you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

704
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:53.370
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at some of these in a what </v>

705
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:55.450
<v Speaker 3>it's very much like as they're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>along building and then all of a sudden </v>

706
00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:59.131
<v Speaker 3>one day nobody shows up to work and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are still tools laying around or </v>

707
00:39:59.131 --> 00:40:03.271
<v Speaker 3>still materials that are often a pile </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're waiting to be incorporated </v>

708
00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:03.790
<v Speaker 3>into the structure.</v>

709
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:09.420
<v Speaker 3>And what happened was that the climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>began to cool again between 13,</v>

710
00:40:10.661 --> 00:40:15.661
<v Speaker 3>15 and 1320 precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we see the end of this tremendous </v>

711
00:40:15.661 --> 00:40:20.281
<v Speaker 3>gothic building boom is when the climate</v>
<v Speaker 3>began to cool and it's cool for the next</v>

712
00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.520
<v Speaker 3>several decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we then see as a repeat of what</v>

713
00:40:24.521 --> 00:40:26.740
<v Speaker 3>happened between 5:36</v>
<v Speaker 3>and 5:42</v>

714
00:40:26.741 --> 00:40:31.741
<v Speaker 3>had agricultural collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crops rotting in the fields.</v>

715
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.670
<v Speaker 3>People going hungry between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was around between 13,</v>

716
00:40:36.671 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 3>14 and 1345.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The onset of the black plague.</v>

717
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:46.110
<v Speaker 3>And once again the population of Europe </v>
<v Speaker 3>was decimated and it took 150 years </v>

718
00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:52.650
<v Speaker 3>basically to recover from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we see is that what what what </v>

719
00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:56.940
<v Speaker 3>was happening is the planet with </v>
<v Speaker 3>shifting into what's called the little </v>

720
00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:56.940
<v Speaker 3>ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you probably heard that term,</v>

721
00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:57.850
<v Speaker 3>the little ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

722
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:02.410
<v Speaker 3>There was two phases to the little ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>age and the first phase began,</v>

723
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:03.790
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around 13,</v>

724
00:41:03.791 --> 00:41:08.791
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lasted about 150 years and there was a </v>

725
00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:11.731
<v Speaker 3>break and it was during that break,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that warm period that basically the </v>

726
00:41:11.731 --> 00:41:14.560
<v Speaker 3>renaissance kicked in and we began to </v>
<v Speaker 3>really move forward.</v>

727
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:19.890
<v Speaker 3>The second phase of the little ice age </v>
<v Speaker 3>came in during the 16 hundreds and it </v>

728
00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.450
<v Speaker 3>was actually even colder than the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>phase.</v>

729
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.800
<v Speaker 3>And worldwide glaciers expanded to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>largest.</v>

730
00:41:26.801 --> 00:41:29.620
<v Speaker 3>They had been in 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 12,000</v>

731
00:41:29.621 --> 00:41:34.621
<v Speaker 3>years since the end of the big ice age </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout the whole Holocene glaciers </v>

732
00:41:34.621 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 3>had been smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now during the big eye,</v>

733
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:41.440
<v Speaker 3>the little ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they grew and they grew to the biggest </v>

734
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:41.960
<v Speaker 3>that they've been in 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

735
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:47.350
<v Speaker 3>It's important to have that context of </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding when we talked about </v>

736
00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 3>glacier recession because the glaciers </v>
<v Speaker 3>begin to recede around the middle of the</v>

737
00:41:50.631 --> 00:41:55.631
<v Speaker 3>19th century worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the little ice age began to wane and </v>

738
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.150
<v Speaker 3>global warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>warmth begin to return to the planet.</v>

739
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.350
<v Speaker 3>This happened in the mid 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>around 18,</v>

740
00:42:03.351 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 3>40 to 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60.</v>

741
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.220
<v Speaker 3>We see the little ice age coming to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>end,</v>

742
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.880
<v Speaker 3>and at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the glaciers worldwide began to recede.</v>

743
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.880
<v Speaker 3>They begin to contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been pretty much contracting </v>

744
00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.780
<v Speaker 3>uniformly since then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when we're talking about glacier </v>

745
00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:24.311
<v Speaker 3>recession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's important to understand that the </v>

746
00:42:24.311 --> 00:42:26.030
<v Speaker 3>glacier recession really began a century</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a half ago or more,</v>

747
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:31.540
<v Speaker 3>and his basically considered continued </v>
<v Speaker 3>more or less uniformly since then with </v>

748
00:42:32.301 --> 00:42:37.301
<v Speaker 3>no real change with the advent of of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human a fossil fuel to the atmosphere,</v>

749
00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.800
<v Speaker 3>a human carbon dioxide which began </v>
<v Speaker 3>really in earnest during the Second </v>

750
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 3>World War is when when we begin to add </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant amounts of carbon dioxide to</v>

751
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:53.471
<v Speaker 3>the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's important to realize that the </v>

752
00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 3>glaciers had been receiving almost a </v>
<v Speaker 3>full century before that point.</v>

753
00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:02.340
<v Speaker 1>So when you see all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a modern hysteria about global warming </v>

754
00:43:02.591 --> 00:43:06.260
<v Speaker 1>and the human created global warming </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>

755
00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:11.280
<v Speaker 1>we keep hearing about in the news and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that our influence on the atmosphere.</v>

756
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Does it drive you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

757
00:43:13.901 --> 00:43:18.901
<v Speaker 1>do you think it's silly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It obviously human beings are </v>

758
00:43:18.901 --> 00:43:18.901
<v Speaker 1>contributing to the carbon footprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

759
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

760
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously that has an effect on </v>

761
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.710
<v Speaker 1>global warming.</v>

762
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

763
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.840
<v Speaker 3>But you've got to bear in mind at carbon</v>
<v Speaker 3>dioxide is only one variable in a very </v>

764
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.720
<v Speaker 3>complex equation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

765
00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 3>There are many factors influencing </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate of which carbon dioxide is only </v>

766
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:40.881
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My problem with so much of the stuff </v>

767
00:43:40.881 --> 00:43:43.971
<v Speaker 3>that's coming out in mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is coming through the </v>

768
00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:44.070
<v Speaker 3>intergovernmental panel on climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>

769
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:49.610
<v Speaker 3>is simply that when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were instituted back in early </v>

770
00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:54.770
<v Speaker 3>nineties by the United Nations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United Nations Framework Convention </v>

771
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:58.101
<v Speaker 3>on climate change basically gave them a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mandate which is demonstrate that humans</v>

772
00:43:58.231 --> 00:44:00.480
<v Speaker 3>are causing climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

773
00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.840
<v Speaker 3>So they focused exclusively on carbon </v>
<v Speaker 3>dioxide,</v>

774
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.540
<v Speaker 3>but there's all kinds of other things </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

775
00:44:06.541 --> 00:44:11.541
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmic rays are constantly bombarding </v>

776
00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:11.541
<v Speaker 3>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

777
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Cosmic rays produce clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more of the cosmic rays penetrate </v>

778
00:44:18.541 --> 00:44:23.541
<v Speaker 3>the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more a low altitude cloud cover </v>

779
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:27.411
<v Speaker 3>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Low altitude clouds reflect heat back </v>

780
00:44:27.411 --> 00:44:31.671
<v Speaker 3>into space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the amount of cosmic rays are </v>

781
00:44:31.671 --> 00:44:31.671
<v Speaker 3>penetrating the atmosphere.</v>

782
00:44:31.671 --> 00:44:34.350
<v Speaker 3>A function of a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got the helio sphere,</v>

783
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:37.450
<v Speaker 3>which is the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially the,</v>

784
00:44:37.451 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

785
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:42.951
<v Speaker 3>the energy envelope of the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which encompasses the whole solar </v>

786
00:44:42.951 --> 00:44:45.420
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Sun actually is fairly variable.</v>

787
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what that means is that when the </v>

788
00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:52.980
<v Speaker 3>solar wind is an in more intense phase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when,</v>

789
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 3>when the sun spots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

790
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:58.850
<v Speaker 3>are very active,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the solar wind is,</v>

791
00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:03.910
<v Speaker 3>is much stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What that does is it serves as a buffer </v>

792
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:07.670
<v Speaker 3>that prevents cosmic rays from </v>
<v Speaker 3>penetrating the atmosphere of the earth </v>

793
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.040
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as strongly as they did previously.</v>

794
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:16.280
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the geomagnetic field of the earth acts </v>

795
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.730
<v Speaker 3>as a buffer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's two things that are completely</v>

796
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.920
<v Speaker 3>not included in the scenarios of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ECC,</v>

797
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 3>but probably have a very profound effect</v>
<v Speaker 3>on global climate.</v>

798
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth's geomagnetic field is,</v>

799
00:45:29.821 --> 00:45:34.821
<v Speaker 3>you probably know that the geomagnetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>field has periodically throughout earth </v>

800
00:45:34.821 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 3>history disappeared completely.</v>

801
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:41.270
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's it's disappeared and come</v>
<v Speaker 3>back with reverse polarity will let </v>

802
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:45.591
<v Speaker 3>geomagnetic field acts as a buffer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which helps to reduce the amount of </v>

803
00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:51.030
<v Speaker 3>cosmic rays penetrating the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's it disappeared completely?</v>

804
00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if really anybody </v>

805
00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 3>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't kept up with all of the most </v>

806
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 3>recent research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the geomagnetism,</v>

807
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:03.621
<v Speaker 3>but you know when you've got you hold a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little compass in your hand and it </v>

808
00:46:03.621 --> 00:46:03.621
<v Speaker 3>points to north,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

809
00:46:03.621 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

810
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:08.370
<v Speaker 3>That's the Jew magnetic field that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>being measured by the compass.</v>

811
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.560
<v Speaker 3>It's moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fluctuating,</v>

812
00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:14.550
<v Speaker 3>and for whatever reason throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of the earth,</v>

813
00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:19.140
<v Speaker 3>it has completely disappeared at some </v>
<v Speaker 3>points and his reverse polarity.</v>

814
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:24.410
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the reversing of the polarity of </v>

815
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.591
<v Speaker 3>the magnetic field that helped prove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prove the reality of continental drift </v>

816
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:32.600
<v Speaker 3>because as the mid Atlantic Ridge </v>
<v Speaker 3>separates and and and a lava flows out,</v>

817
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:40.040
<v Speaker 3>it crystallizes and locked into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crystal and structure of the of the lava</v>

818
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:45.410
<v Speaker 3>is the direction of the magnetic field </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the polarity of the magnetic field </v>

819
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.960
<v Speaker 3>is imprinted in there.</v>

820
00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.410
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the research going back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the 19 fifties,</v>

821
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:55.100
<v Speaker 3>they realized that you had stripes </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect effectively as you moved away </v>

822
00:46:55.171 --> 00:47:00.171
<v Speaker 3>from Tomato Atlantic Ridge as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the lava flow it out and </v>

823
00:47:00.451 --> 00:47:03.480
<v Speaker 3>crystallized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>locked in the magnetic field.</v>

824
00:47:03.481 --> 00:47:08.481
<v Speaker 3>They looked at it and they could see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there were times when it had </v>

825
00:47:08.481 --> 00:47:11.781
<v Speaker 3>completely reversed itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this was like very powerful </v>

826
00:47:11.781 --> 00:47:14.550
<v Speaker 3>evidence that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the theory of continental drift was</v>

827
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:15.200
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

828
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:18.990
<v Speaker 3>that the Atlantic Ocean had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>spreading.</v>

829
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.600
<v Speaker 3>And getting back to this whole Atlantis </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

830
00:47:21.601 --> 00:47:24.160
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting to me is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at,</v>

831
00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:26.130
<v Speaker 3>at um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>replay those account,</v>

832
00:47:26.131 --> 00:47:30.050
<v Speaker 3>he describes Atlantis as being a west of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pillars of herrick lease,</v>

833
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 3>which of course is the Straits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gibraltar,</v>

834
00:47:31.991 --> 00:47:33.310
<v Speaker 3>the mouth of the Mediterranean.</v>

835
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.280
<v Speaker 3>He describes how if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come to some islands,</v>

836
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:44.310
<v Speaker 3>then you come to some more islands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the island complex of Atlantis </v>

837
00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 3>and beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was another whole continent.</v>

838
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:48.910
<v Speaker 3>He describes that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

839
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.010
<v Speaker 3>If you look in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Atlantic Ocean,</v>

840
00:47:51.011 --> 00:47:56.011
<v Speaker 3>you've got the [inaudible] plateau,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is now a couple of thousand feet </v>

841
00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:01.500
<v Speaker 3>under the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The aes or islands are the tops of </v>

842
00:48:01.841 --> 00:48:06.841
<v Speaker 3>mountains that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that emerged from the surface of the </v>

843
00:48:06.841 --> 00:48:06.841
<v Speaker 3>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

844
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:11.240
<v Speaker 3>And they sit right on the Atlantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

845
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:12.700
<v Speaker 3>the mid Atlantic Ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

846
00:48:12.701 --> 00:48:16.700
<v Speaker 3>the mid Atlantic Ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the thinnest crust on,</v>

847
00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:18.010
<v Speaker 3>on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

848
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:23.580
<v Speaker 3>And if it's like a giant suture or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant crack that runs up halfway around </v>

849
00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.940
<v Speaker 3>the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

850
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:30.570
<v Speaker 3>when you have an ice age and you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>piling ice up onto like the North </v>

851
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:35.100
<v Speaker 3>American continent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is the weight of that ice </v>

852
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.520
<v Speaker 3>begins to crush the crust of the earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>down into the mantle.</v>

853
00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.730
<v Speaker 3>It's called isoss to see which is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vertical movement.</v>

854
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:45.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>continental drift is horizontal.</v>

855
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:50.580
<v Speaker 3>I saw stussy is vertical now it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like right now you're sitting on that </v>

856
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.150
<v Speaker 3>soft chair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

857
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:55.420
<v Speaker 3>And your ass is creating a depression in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cushion of the chair,</v>

858
00:48:55.421 --> 00:48:57.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's isostatic depression.</v>

859
00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:02.850
<v Speaker 3>You didn't realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that your ass is creating </v>

860
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:03.670
<v Speaker 3>isostatic depression?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

861
00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:08.671
<v Speaker 3>And when you get up and you walk away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you will have isostatic </v>

862
00:49:08.671 --> 00:49:12.390
<v Speaker 3>compensation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll have isostatic rebound because </v>

863
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.540
<v Speaker 3>the cushion will now rise because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight has been removed.</v>

864
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.960
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with the ice mass on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the continent.</v>

865
00:49:16.961 --> 00:49:21.790
<v Speaker 3>The ice mass was hundreds of billions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>trillions of tons of ice.</v>

866
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:26.400
<v Speaker 3>It pressed the center of the North </v>
<v Speaker 3>American continent or,</v>

867
00:49:26.401 --> 00:49:31.390
<v Speaker 3>or the center of at least Canada down </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps as much as several thousand feet</v>

868
00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:35.200
<v Speaker 3>into the mantle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With the removal of that ice,</v>

869
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:40.440
<v Speaker 3>the land begins to rebound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hudson Bay is the depression leftover </v>

870
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:43.870
<v Speaker 3>from the thickest part of the ice right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

871
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Our photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could probably even pull some up here</v>

872
00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:52.081
<v Speaker 3>in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are photographs taken where you </v>

873
00:49:52.081 --> 00:49:54.841
<v Speaker 3>can see the elevated shoreline </v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounding Hudson Bay because it's </v>

874
00:49:54.841 --> 00:49:55.690
<v Speaker 3>still rising,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

875
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting too is if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

876
00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:59.430
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

877
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:04.440
<v Speaker 3>the distance between these shorelines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that early on there was a </v>

878
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.900
<v Speaker 3>greater distance because the land was </v>
<v Speaker 3>rising faster.</v>

879
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:13.320
<v Speaker 3>As the millennia have have gone on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the distance separating each shoreline </v>

880
00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.881
<v Speaker 3>has diminished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now you have to think that all of </v>

881
00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:19.330
<v Speaker 3>that weight is being transferred back </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the ocean basins.</v>

882
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.290
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it was dumped directly into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Atlantic Ocean,</v>

883
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.410
<v Speaker 3>either via,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the St Lawrence River up there,</v>

884
00:50:26.411 --> 00:50:28.610
<v Speaker 3>the Hudson River,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in the New York area,</v>

885
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:31.850
<v Speaker 3>or via the Mississippi River into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gulf of Mexico.</v>

886
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Now you've got all this water dumping </v>
<v Speaker 3>back into the ocean.</v>

887
00:50:35.901 --> 00:50:40.901
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean levels are coming up hundreds of </v>

888
00:50:40.901 --> 00:50:40.901
<v Speaker 3>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

889
00:50:40.901 --> 00:50:44.260
<v Speaker 3>So now you're adding all of this weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ocean basin and now you've got </v>

890
00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:49.151
<v Speaker 3>the mid Atlantic Ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is some of the thinnest crust on </v>

891
00:50:49.151 --> 00:50:49.151
<v Speaker 3>the earth.</v>

892
00:50:49.151 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what it's doing.</v>

893
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like a hinge line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

894
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:57.290
<v Speaker 3>So now you picture during a glacial age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the weight is taken out,</v>

895
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:59.350
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This lifts up,</v>

896
00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:00.560
<v Speaker 3>lifts up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening,</v>

897
00:51:00.561 --> 00:51:01.700
<v Speaker 3>not watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

898
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.390
<v Speaker 3>When the ice melts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water goes in,</v>

899
00:51:05.391 --> 00:51:07.670
<v Speaker 3>sea level rises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it subsides.</v>

900
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:12.970
<v Speaker 3>Right now you look at the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>plateau is a chunk of the African plate </v>

901
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:18.850
<v Speaker 3>that got left over when the continent's </v>
<v Speaker 3>separated around 70 to 80 million years </v>

902
00:51:19.311 --> 00:51:20.300
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

903
00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:25.250
<v Speaker 3>If you've seen the maps into the showing</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you can fit the continents together.</v>

904
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you fit these back together,</v>

905
00:51:27.741 --> 00:51:30.410
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you reverse continental drift,</v>

906
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:35.920
<v Speaker 3>go back about 70 or 80 million years and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all fits together like a piece of </v>

907
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:36.980
<v Speaker 3>the puzzle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it's separated,</v>

908
00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:42.100
<v Speaker 3>a piece of the of the African plate got </v>
<v Speaker 3>left behind and this is what is the </v>

909
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:45.060
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] plateau and it sits right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

910
00:51:45.061 --> 00:51:45.520
<v Speaker 3>a stride.</v>

911
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:49.010
<v Speaker 3>The Atlantic Ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's maybe a little bit smaller than the</v>

912
00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.980
<v Speaker 3>than Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is considered to be an island,</v>

913
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:55.190
<v Speaker 3>but a pretty good sized island right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

914
00:51:55.940 --> 00:52:00.940
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing this and you have as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much as two or 3000 feet or maybe more </v>

915
00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.050
<v Speaker 3>of this vertical movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

916
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.440
<v Speaker 3>and you added that to 400 feet of sea </v>
<v Speaker 3>level rise.</v>

917
00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Now you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

918
00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:12.851
<v Speaker 3>begin to get a scientific rationale for </v>
<v Speaker 3>how you may have had a large island in </v>

919
00:52:12.851 --> 00:52:15.320
<v Speaker 3>the Middle Atlantic back during the ice </v>
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>

920
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>additional evidence has suggested that </v>

921
00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:23.500
<v Speaker 3>the Gulf stream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which now basically brings a subtropical</v>

922
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:27.170
<v Speaker 3>warmth up to northwestern Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

923
00:52:27.171 --> 00:52:29.210
<v Speaker 3>if you were to terminate the Gulf </v>
<v Speaker 3>stream,</v>

924
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.420
<v Speaker 3>England would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have some pretty,</v>

925
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.410
<v Speaker 3>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

926
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:36.320
<v Speaker 3>malignant times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in northwestern Europe,</v>

927
00:52:36.321 --> 00:52:39.620
<v Speaker 3>because the warmth is being brought up </v>
<v Speaker 3>by that Gulf stream,</v>

928
00:52:39.621 --> 00:52:41.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

929
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 3>during the ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gulf stream diverted to the south at</v>

930
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:50.381
<v Speaker 3>about 45 to 46 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was hundreds of miles further </v>

931
00:52:50.381 --> 00:52:50.990
<v Speaker 3>south and it now goes.</v>

932
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:54.760
<v Speaker 3>So essentially if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] plateau,</v>

933
00:52:55.070 --> 00:53:00.070
<v Speaker 3>a big chunk of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a source plateau would have been above </v>

934
00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:03.250
<v Speaker 3>sea level during the ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that Gulf stream with its warmth </v>

935
00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:04.640
<v Speaker 3>would have just basically embraced it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>

936
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:10.120
<v Speaker 3>So if you suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe found yourself transported </v>

937
00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:13.121
<v Speaker 3>mysteriously back to the ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably where you might want to </v>

938
00:53:13.121 --> 00:53:13.980
<v Speaker 3>go is the [inaudible] plateau.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might've been,</v>

939
00:53:13.981 --> 00:53:18.981
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most benign places on earth </v>

940
00:53:18.981 --> 00:53:21.131
<v Speaker 3>to live during the ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if there was a place where </v>

941
00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:24.671
<v Speaker 3>civilization could evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a very logical place for </v>

942
00:53:24.671 --> 00:53:28.481
<v Speaker 3>it to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing really pseudoscientific </v>

943
00:53:28.481 --> 00:53:31.910
<v Speaker 3>now about assuming that there could've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been some type of historic reality </v>

944
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:34.770
<v Speaker 3>behind these stories of Atlantis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

945
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:39.890
<v Speaker 3>the problem is as the wound will factor </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has gotten so grafted onto these </v>

946
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

947
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:44.510
<v Speaker 1>crystals and aliens and flying ships and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

948
00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

949
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:51.150
<v Speaker 1>we don't have any hard evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hard evidence does suggest that </v>

950
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:54.140
<v Speaker 1>there could have been some very benign </v>
<v Speaker 1>habitable islands,</v>

951
00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.470
<v Speaker 1>large islands in the mid Atlantic during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ice age.</v>

952
00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's intense.</v>

953
00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.290
<v Speaker 1>That's so incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

954
00:54:03.291 --> 00:54:03.810
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

955
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:08.870
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy to think how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much things have changed while human</v>

956
00:54:09.021 --> 00:54:12.830
<v Speaker 1>beings have been here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that during go Beckley tappy,</v>

957
00:54:12.831 --> 00:54:14.300
<v Speaker 1>which is 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

958
00:54:14.301 --> 00:54:19.040
<v Speaker 1>that North America was covered with ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they.</v>

959
00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:24.070
<v Speaker 1>This was when these people in Turkey had</v>
<v Speaker 1>created this incredible structure.</v>

960
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:29.680
<v Speaker 1>So when you see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern hysteria about global </v>

961
00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:34.211
<v Speaker 1>warming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really essentially been like a </v>

962
00:54:34.211 --> 00:54:34.211
<v Speaker 1>wrestling match between the left and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

963
00:54:34.211 --> 00:54:38.530
<v Speaker 1>it's this weird thing where the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to support like burning coal and </v>

964
00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:43.151
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to diminish the economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>by putting all these environmental </v>

965
00:54:43.151 --> 00:54:47.690
<v Speaker 1>regulations on natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the left,</v>

966
00:54:47.691 --> 00:54:50.960
<v Speaker 1>which is screaming at the top of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lungs that the sky is falling,</v>

967
00:54:50.961 --> 00:54:53.450
<v Speaker 1>the oceans are going to rise and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to drown.</v>

968
00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:58.900
<v Speaker 1>W when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know so much about what has </v>

969
00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.351
<v Speaker 1>happened over the course of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've studied this for a great </v>

970
00:55:02.351 --> 00:55:05.240
<v Speaker 1>deal of time like you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your take on all this stuff?</v>

971
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess my intake is,</v>

972
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:10.060
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is fairly simple.</v>

973
00:55:10.061 --> 00:55:11.500
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tend to think that,</v>

974
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:13.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>

975
00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:14.900
<v Speaker 3>if you're looking at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

976
00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.340
<v Speaker 3>the whole process of if you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbon cycle,</v>

977
00:55:18.341 --> 00:55:19.110
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

978
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:24.250
<v Speaker 3>what you see there is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can talk to this to this as much as </v>

979
00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:27.190
<v Speaker 3>possible so we can have his little </v>
<v Speaker 3>variation in the tone as possible.</v>

980
00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

981
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:31.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting this into context,</v>

982
00:55:31.241 --> 00:55:36.241
<v Speaker 3>we have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now we're approaching 400 parts </v>

983
00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:39.601
<v Speaker 3>per million of the ambient amount of Co.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two in the atmosphere.</v>

984
00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:42.850
<v Speaker 3>AT the beginning of the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution,</v>

985
00:55:42.851 --> 00:55:46.330
<v Speaker 3>it was about 100 parts per million less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

986
00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:51.930
<v Speaker 3>you could say basically that over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last century we have increased the </v>

987
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.650
<v Speaker 3>amount of co two measurable co two into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the atmosphere,</v>

988
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:55.090
<v Speaker 3>assuming that it's all from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

989
00:55:55.091 --> 00:55:55.580
<v Speaker 3>I meAn there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

990
00:55:55.590 --> 00:56:00.590
<v Speaker 3>there's questions about that too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if there are other factors </v>

991
00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:01.580
<v Speaker 3>inducing global warming such as changes </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

992
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:06.620
<v Speaker 3>in solar irradiance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of installation penetrating </v>

993
00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:09.751
<v Speaker 3>the atmosphere and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means that the oceans are warming as </v>

994
00:56:09.751 --> 00:56:09.751
<v Speaker 3>a result of that.</v>

995
00:56:09.751 --> 00:56:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oceans are a gigantic carbon dioxide </v>

996
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:15.190
<v Speaker 3>sink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they're warm,</v>

997
00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:18.700
<v Speaker 3>they exude carbon dioxide when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>cold,</v>

998
00:56:18.701 --> 00:56:19.900
<v Speaker 3>they absorb it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

999
00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:25.600
<v Speaker 3>So if you have a natural warming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna expel some carbon dioxide.</v>

1000
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:31.020
<v Speaker 3>So it's not even clear necessarily that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that 100 parts per million is totally </v>

1001
00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:34.960
<v Speaker 3>the result of fossil fuel burning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for the sake of argument,</v>

1002
00:56:34.961 --> 00:56:38.500
<v Speaker 3>let's say that it is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 parts per million,</v>

1003
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:43.530
<v Speaker 3>that's minuscule trace of this very </v>
<v Speaker 3>important constituents of our </v>

1004
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:49.201
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that carbon dioxide is what </v>

1005
00:56:49.201 --> 00:56:49.201
<v Speaker 3>fuels photosynthesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1006
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:54.420
<v Speaker 3>And if you start reducing the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and </v>

1007
00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:58.111
<v Speaker 3>you'd start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you start dropping below 200 parts </v>

1008
00:56:58.111 --> 00:56:58.111
<v Speaker 3>per million and you get down to about </v>
<v Speaker 3>1:50</v>

1009
00:56:58.111 --> 00:57:02.470
<v Speaker 3>to 100 photosynthesis plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>photosynthesis starts shutting down.</v>

1010
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:08.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's kinda like the amount of co </v>
<v Speaker 3>two in the atmosphere right now is at </v>

1011
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:08.560
<v Speaker 3>the very bottom of the scale.</v>

1012
00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:13.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we look at history going back when </v>

1013
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.620
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned the cretaceous tertiary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the dinosaurs ruled,</v>

1014
00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:20.730
<v Speaker 3>there have been many times more the </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of ceo to up to well in excess of</v>

1015
00:57:22.181 --> 00:57:27.181
<v Speaker 3>a thousand parts per million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Several thousand parts per million in </v>

1016
00:57:27.181 --> 00:57:31.111
<v Speaker 3>the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we have increased the amount of </v>

1017
00:57:31.111 --> 00:57:33.760
<v Speaker 3>co two by 100 parts per million in 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1018
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:38.590
<v Speaker 3>it means we've for every million </v>
<v Speaker 3>molecules of air up there,</v>

1019
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:43.660
<v Speaker 3>we add one molecule of co two every year</v>
<v Speaker 3>or two.</v>

1020
00:57:43.661 --> 00:57:46.330
<v Speaker 3>Maybe try to make it a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehensible.</v>

1021
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:52.770
<v Speaker 3>If for every hundred thousand molecules </v>
<v Speaker 3>of air up there every 10 years we had </v>

1022
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:57.350
<v Speaker 3>one molecule of co two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1023
00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm not convinced that that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lead to global catastrophe.</v>

1024
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:02.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of it this way,</v>

1025
00:58:02.501 --> 00:58:07.501
<v Speaker 3>you've got a huge tank with a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand fish in it every 10 years </v>

1026
00:58:07.501 --> 00:58:08.200
<v Speaker 3>you're throwing one more fish.</v>

1027
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Are you even going to notice that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1028
00:58:11.531 --> 00:58:14.560
<v Speaker 3>I think that what's happened is that ceo</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1029
00:58:14.561 --> 00:58:19.561
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one variable in a very complex </v>

1030
00:58:19.561 --> 00:58:20.710
<v Speaker 3>equation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all of the other variables as far as</v>

1031
00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.890
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government funded research ngos have</v>

1032
00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:29.160
<v Speaker 3>been excluded from the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what dismays me is that we're told </v>

1033
00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:33.490
<v Speaker 3>that all scientists agree on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1034
00:58:33.491 --> 00:58:38.491
<v Speaker 3>all scientists don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have though a major government </v>

1035
00:58:39.671 --> 00:58:43.330
<v Speaker 3>funded program like climate change </v>
<v Speaker 3>research,</v>

1036
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.390
<v Speaker 3>which is funded to the tune of about </v>
<v Speaker 3>$2,000,000,000</v>

1037
00:58:46.391 --> 00:58:51.391
<v Speaker 3>per year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have a large vested </v>

1038
00:58:51.391 --> 00:58:53.260
<v Speaker 3>interest in basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1039
00:58:53.261 --> 00:58:57.400
<v Speaker 3>if these guys came out and said nascio </v>
<v Speaker 3>two is really not a big deal,</v>

1040
00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:01.490
<v Speaker 3>it's perhaps fueling plant growth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1041
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:04.280
<v Speaker 3>and this is an interesting aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1042
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:05.440
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1043
00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:10.830
<v Speaker 3>the projections of forest in inventory </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the fifties and sixties based </v>

1044
00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:15.451
<v Speaker 3>upon deforestation is a result of timber</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a result of agriculture.</v>

1045
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:18.950
<v Speaker 3>The projections that at how quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1046
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:24.020
<v Speaker 3>forest inventories we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at those projections back in</v>

1047
00:59:24.021 --> 00:59:29.021
<v Speaker 3>the fifties and sixties and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that in the ensuing period of </v>

1048
00:59:29.021 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've now got exhaustive,</v>

1049
00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:36.790
<v Speaker 3>highly accurate satellite surveys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can actually count the number of </v>

1050
00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:40.931
<v Speaker 3>hectares of forests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting is in the nineties </v>

1051
00:59:40.931 --> 00:59:44.981
<v Speaker 3>when they really started looking at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>date of just how much forest there was </v>

1052
00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:49.661
<v Speaker 3>compared to what the projections were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was like 25 to 40 percent more </v>

1053
00:59:49.661 --> 00:59:52.280
<v Speaker 3>forests worldwide than anybody had </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicted.</v>

1054
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.100
<v Speaker 3>What fueled this prolific forest growth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1055
00:59:58.101 --> 01:00:03.101
<v Speaker 3>it's very likely that at least part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was because of the slight increase in</v>

1056
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:07.430
<v Speaker 3>ceo to Israel resolved as a result of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our fossil fuel burning.</v>

1057
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Now we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we put in every year we burn about a,</v>

1058
01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:15.440
<v Speaker 3>in introducing into the atmosphere about</v>
<v Speaker 3>6 billion tons of co two.</v>

1059
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:21.310
<v Speaker 3>Well there's about 750 or 760 billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>tons of co two in the atmosphere </v>

1060
01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:28.181
<v Speaker 3>naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at least a third of that is cycling </v>

1061
01:00:28.181 --> 01:00:30.440
<v Speaker 3>through from the atmosphere into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biosphere,</v>

1062
01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:35.441
<v Speaker 3>into the oceans and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our contribution isn't really that </v>

1063
01:00:35.901 --> 01:00:38.650
<v Speaker 3>significant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but another part of the.</v>

1064
01:00:38.651 --> 01:00:43.651
<v Speaker 3>The argument is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this has been admitted right in the </v>

1065
01:00:43.651 --> 01:00:47.770
<v Speaker 3>ipc reports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that based on the amount of fossil </v>

1066
01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:51.341
<v Speaker 3>fuel that we're burning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be twice as much co two </v>

1067
01:00:51.341 --> 01:00:52.370
<v Speaker 3>into the atmosphere in the atmosphere as</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're now measuring.</v>

1068
01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:58.210
<v Speaker 3>So what they have been talking about for</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 15 years now is where's the </v>

1069
01:00:58.611 --> 01:00:59.450
<v Speaker 3>missing carbon?</v>

1070
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:02.540
<v Speaker 3>What's this missing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carbon sink will probably.</v>

1071
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:07.541
<v Speaker 3>Some of it's going into the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most likely a lot of it is going </v>

1072
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:09.500
<v Speaker 3>into fueling plant growth and forest </v>
<v Speaker 3>growth worldwide.</v>

1073
01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:14.830
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of studies that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning to come out now that shows </v>

1074
01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:18.251
<v Speaker 3>that perhaps some of the desert areas of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the planet rather than expanding are </v>

1075
01:01:19.731 --> 01:01:21.920
<v Speaker 3>actually contracting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1076
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:26.090
<v Speaker 3>you kNow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at thIs point there's a lot of things we</v>

1077
01:01:26.091 --> 01:01:29.390
<v Speaker 3>still have to learn when it comes down </v>
<v Speaker 3>to understanding the climate.</v>

1078
01:01:29.391 --> 01:01:31.580
<v Speaker 3>We're in the infancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1079
01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.840
<v Speaker 3>you can't talk to a single climatologist</v>
<v Speaker 3>and come up with one single coherent </v>

1080
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:42.370
<v Speaker 3>answer or agreement on what has actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>provoked the planet to go into a full </v>

1081
01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:45.800
<v Speaker 3>ice age or what has caused it to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of an ice age if you don't have,</v>

1082
01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:50.830
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We still have a hell of a lot to learn </v>

1083
01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:54.401
<v Speaker 3>about how the climate works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I get really frustrated when I hear </v>

1084
01:01:54.401 --> 01:01:58.541
<v Speaker 3>this claim that the debate is over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The debate is over because the debate </v>

1085
01:01:58.541 --> 01:02:02.390
<v Speaker 3>hasn't really even begun yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say we need to really look at all of</v>

1086
01:02:02.391 --> 01:02:04.580
<v Speaker 3>these other factors as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1087
01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:07.220
<v Speaker 3>when you look at at at wind currents and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean currents,</v>

1088
01:02:07.221 --> 01:02:08.420
<v Speaker 3>you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the el nino,</v>

1089
01:02:08.421 --> 01:02:10.140
<v Speaker 3>southern oscillation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the,</v>

1090
01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:12.650
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the indian ocean dipole,</v>

1091
01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:14.960
<v Speaker 3>you have the pacific decadal </v>
<v Speaker 3>oscillation.</v>

1092
01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:18.350
<v Speaker 3>All of these things have a very profound</v>
<v Speaker 3>influence on the climate,</v>

1093
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 3>but they're essentially being</v>

1094
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>ignored within the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within the government funded science to </v>

1095
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:30.111
<v Speaker 1>a large extent and you have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists who have objected to some of </v>

1096
01:02:31.051 --> 01:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>the claims of certainty made by the ipc </v>
<v Speaker 1>see scientists,</v>

1097
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>and for the most part the left likes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonize them.</v>

1098
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>This is people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1099
01:02:40.861 --> 01:02:45.861
<v Speaker 1>I think probably the the leading demon </v>
<v Speaker 1>of climate deniers is fred singer </v>

1100
01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>because he wants was given an a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a $10,000</v>

1101
01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>unsolicited donation from exxon years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and years ago,</v>

1102
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.690
<v Speaker 1>but you've got guys like Roy Spencer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>craig ensure would id,</v>

1103
01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:03.420
<v Speaker 1>so when robert balling and Timothy Ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and and the list goes on and on.</v>

1104
01:03:03.421 --> 01:03:06.690
<v Speaker 1>These are distinguished climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists that have devoted their lives</v>

1105
01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:10.170
<v Speaker 1>to understanding climate science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who say,</v>

1106
01:03:10.171 --> 01:03:15.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of flaws in the </v>

1107
01:03:15.171 --> 01:03:16.680
<v Speaker 1>methodology of the ipc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by saying that now they have entered</v>

1108
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:17.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1109
01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:21.890
<v Speaker 1>the spawn of hell according to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in.</v>

1110
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:23.280
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what happened.</v>

1111
01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:26.970
<v Speaker 1>It's turned into a political football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an idler ideological debate.</v>

1112
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.640
<v Speaker 1>It's an ideological debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political debate,</v>

1113
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:34.400
<v Speaker 1>and it's just too bad that the science </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the thing has had to suffering.</v>

1114
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>The consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1115
01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:38.580
<v Speaker 1>it is fascinating because even hearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say this,</v>

1116
01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1117
01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking like it starts popping </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggers like I'm not the type of person</v>

1118
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:49.821
<v Speaker 1>that worries too much about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>labeled because I've been labeled a </v>

1119
01:03:49.821 --> 01:03:50.490
<v Speaker 1>million times already as an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

1120
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bother me to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplating the possibilities of </v>

1121
01:03:56.221 --> 01:04:01.221
<v Speaker 1>controversial ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm listening to you saying </v>

1122
01:04:01.221 --> 01:04:04.521
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I'm hearing is the knee jerk </v>

1123
01:04:04.521 --> 01:04:06.000
<v Speaker 1>reaction of climate denier climate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>always a climate denier.</v>

1124
01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:11.001
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a climate denier and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fucking things that we've grown to</v>

1125
01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>be accustomed to on television where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a guy on the left who has one point</v>

1126
01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:20.991
<v Speaker 1>of view and a guy on the right who says </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wacky and then everybody </v>

1127
01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:23.250
<v Speaker 1>fights about it and then the youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>clips.</v>

1128
01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>You look at the comments and it's filled</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this guy's a faggot and that guy's </v>

1129
01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.340
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy eat shit.</v>

1130
01:04:29.341 --> 01:04:34.341
<v Speaker 1>I hope your house goes under water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking climate denier and when I'm </v>

1131
01:04:34.341 --> 01:04:38.601
<v Speaker 1>listening to you and you mean this </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast has been over an hour already </v>

1132
01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:43.460
<v Speaker 1>and it's incredibly complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have barely scratched the surface and</v>

1133
01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to hear anything like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this on any television show because most</v>

1134
01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>people feel that the general public does</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have the attention span to absorb.</v>

1135
01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:58.581
<v Speaker 1>All of this information is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex explanation of the known </v>

1136
01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:02.250
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the changing of the atmosphere of the</v>

1137
01:05:02.251 --> 01:05:07.251
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people start talking about </v>

1138
01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:10.290
<v Speaker 1>climate denying and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on with climate change,</v>

1139
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:15.120
<v Speaker 1>what they're really doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing their position on what side</v>

1140
01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:20.121
<v Speaker 1>I am the side of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a person who believes in science and</v>

1141
01:05:20.921 --> 01:05:25.921
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how much of this have you actually </v>

1142
01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:25.921
<v Speaker 1>explored?</v>

1143
01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:26.920
<v Speaker 1>How much of it as anybody actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at?</v>

1144
01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a person who supports industry and </v>

1145
01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:34.591
<v Speaker 1>I'm a person who believes the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States needs to recover from our </v>

1146
01:05:34.591 --> 01:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>economic disaster and we got a frack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few wells,</v>

1147
01:05:37.901 --> 01:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so be it.</v>

1148
01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:44.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these two very distinct and </v>

1149
01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes shallow ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives.</v>

1150
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:50.700
<v Speaker 1>And when I say shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shallow from the point of the general </v>

1151
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>public person like me who's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist observing it.</v>

1152
01:05:52.691 --> 01:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And just picking aside with very little </v>
<v Speaker 1>information really,</v>

1153
01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.360
<v Speaker 1>and you talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to grab,</v>

1154
01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:03.390
<v Speaker 1>grab the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average leftie and the average kid </v>

1155
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 1>that thinks that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1156
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:09.121
<v Speaker 1>they have an opinion on global change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just just do me a favor and just </v>

1157
01:06:09.121 --> 01:06:10.480
<v Speaker 1>write down what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just write down.</v>

1158
01:06:10.481 --> 01:06:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you looking online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an opinion?</v>

1159
01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Write down what you know you wouldn't.</v>

1160
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dog shit.</v>

1161
01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:20.590
<v Speaker 1>most people know dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

1162
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1163
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:26.490
<v Speaker 1>it's so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating to me because it </v>

1164
01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 1>becomes another one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ideology is.</v>

1165
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who said it,</v>

1166
01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the enemy of free thinking.</v>

1167
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>You get in these ideological clusters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then anything outside of this thing,</v>

1168
01:06:40.031 --> 01:06:45.031
<v Speaker 1>these predetermined patterns of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to subscribe to anything </v>

1169
01:06:45.031 --> 01:06:47.630
<v Speaker 1>becomes forbidden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes you.</v>

1170
01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:52.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't even entertain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even approach the idea or you </v>

1171
01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.640
<v Speaker 1>see it with everything you see with </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheism.</v>

1172
01:06:54.641 --> 01:06:58.330
<v Speaker 1>You see it with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it with any isms,</v>

1173
01:06:58.331 --> 01:07:01.270
<v Speaker 1>with feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the men's rights.</v>

1174
01:07:01.271 --> 01:07:04.660
<v Speaker 1>You see it with people who subscribe to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right people,</v>

1175
01:07:04.661 --> 01:07:09.661
<v Speaker 1>subscribed to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any variables that don't fit into their </v>

1176
01:07:09.661 --> 01:07:10.930
<v Speaker 1>equation that they've already subscribed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1177
01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to be labeled as that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side and anytime they don't want </v>

1178
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:20.311
<v Speaker 1>to be labeled that they start ignoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>any evidence or any ideas that don't fit</v>

1179
01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:23.470
<v Speaker 1>within this really rigid description.</v>

1180
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:25.090
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1181
01:07:25.091 --> 01:07:28.060
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit the nail on the head job weird.</v>

1182
01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get locked into these ideological</v>

1183
01:07:32.231 --> 01:07:37.231
<v Speaker 1>paradigms and then from that point on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically their perspective is modified </v>

1184
01:07:37.231 --> 01:07:39.970
<v Speaker 1>more by emotion and rationality is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

1185
01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:45.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their feelings rather than real </v>

1186
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:45.020
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1187
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.000
<v Speaker 1>and it's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1188
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to blame it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the fact that the government runs </v>

1189
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:51.420
<v Speaker 1>all the schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1190
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government monopolizes the education</v>

1191
01:07:53.771 --> 01:07:58.771
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not teaching people critical </v>

1192
01:07:58.771 --> 01:08:01.171
<v Speaker 1>thinking skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not teaching people how to </v>

1193
01:08:01.171 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 1>actually become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to be scientifically literate,</v>

1194
01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really sad.</v>

1195
01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1196
01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1197
01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:11.050
<v Speaker 1>you keep hearing the term climate change</v>
<v Speaker 1>denier,</v>

1198
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:12.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1199
01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're going to find a</v>

1200
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:21.010
<v Speaker 3>single climate scientist of any </v>
<v Speaker 3>persuasion that denies that the climate </v>

1201
01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:25.670
<v Speaker 3>is changing and you got to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the terminology has shifted.</v>

1202
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:31.330
<v Speaker 3>It was global warming originally when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when James Hansen gave his testimony </v>

1203
01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:34.680
<v Speaker 3>before congress in the summer of 1988,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1204
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and proposed these potential tipping </v>

1205
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.750
<v Speaker 3>points and catastrophic outcomes of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>burning of fossil fueled.</v>

1206
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:48.430
<v Speaker 3>We've gOne from there to the united </v>
<v Speaker 3>nations getting involved in the united </v>

1207
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:52.661
<v Speaker 3>nations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>setting up the whole the epcc and </v>

1208
01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:55.601
<v Speaker 3>channeling all of this funding to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the consequences is that,</v>

1209
01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:58.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say again,</v>

1210
01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:04.930
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went from global warming to climate </v>

1211
01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:07.721
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why dO they not really used global </v>

1212
01:09:07.721 --> 01:09:11.591
<v Speaker 3>warming is a term anymore is mainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because for 15 years the average global </v>

1213
01:09:12.051 --> 01:09:15.140
<v Speaker 3>temperature is flatlined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is based upon,</v>

1214
01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:20.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most accurate like satellite </v>

1215
01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.620
<v Speaker 3>surveys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ipc generally focuses only on ground</v>

1216
01:09:21.621 --> 01:09:24.290
<v Speaker 3>based sensors which are subjected to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1217
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.140
<v Speaker 3>perhaps some considerable bias because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1218
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:32.500
<v Speaker 3>you picture a ground based sensors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them are sitting at airports </v>

1219
01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.900
<v Speaker 3>when these things were being put in post</v>
<v Speaker 3>world war ii,</v>

1220
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 3>the bulk of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forties and fifties into the sixties.</v>

1221
01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Many of these airports were rural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

1222
01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:42.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adjacent to small towns.</v>

1223
01:09:42.351 --> 01:09:44.660
<v Speaker 3>They were surrounded by fields and </v>
<v Speaker 3>farms.</v>

1224
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:49.930
<v Speaker 3>For us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happened is the urban area has </v>

1225
01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:49.950
<v Speaker 3>encroached,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1226
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.730
<v Speaker 3>every when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you create streets,</v>

1227
01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:55.850
<v Speaker 3>pavement buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this absorbs heat,</v>

1228
01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1229
01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:02.040
<v Speaker 3>and no one has really done an exhaustive</v>
<v Speaker 3>study of the potential bias.</v>

1230
01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:05.690
<v Speaker 3>It's introduced into the ground based </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensors.</v>

1231
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:10.990
<v Speaker 3>That part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least part of the warming of these </v>

1232
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:12.440
<v Speaker 3>ground based sensors may have nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do with carbon dioxide at all.</v>

1233
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:17.470
<v Speaker 3>It may just have to do with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're sitting next to a huge </v>

1234
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.470
<v Speaker 3>parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

1235
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:19.670
<v Speaker 3>and I mean you knoW yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you walk out,</v>

1236
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you know if you're walking in a field </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you walk onto an asphalt </v>

1237
01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.670
<v Speaker 3>parking lot immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1238
01:10:25.671 --> 01:10:26.900
<v Speaker 3>it's much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much hotter.</v>

1239
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:29.770
<v Speaker 3>You see Anthony Watts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is another one of the,</v>

1240
01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:34.940
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dissenters that who's demonized is </v>

1241
01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:38.831
<v Speaker 3>the only one who has really attempted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>exhaustedly document the accuracy of the</v>

1242
01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:45.971
<v Speaker 3>ground based sensors and what he's come </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with is that perhaps as much as 30 to</v>

1243
01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:50.390
<v Speaker 3>50 percent of the perceived warming of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last century,</v>

1244
01:10:50.391 --> 01:10:53.900
<v Speaker 3>which is about eight tenths of a degree </v>
<v Speaker 3>centigrade,</v>

1245
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:57.320
<v Speaker 3>is probably as a result of that bias.</v>

1246
01:10:57.330 --> 01:11:02.330
<v Speaker 3>It's been introduced by what's called </v>
<v Speaker 3>the urban heat island effect and all of </v>

1247
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:07.091
<v Speaker 3>the major city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>La has a urban heat island mitigation </v>

1248
01:11:07.091 --> 01:11:09.830
<v Speaker 3>program underway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of the major metropolitan cities are</v>

1249
01:11:09.831 --> 01:11:14.831
<v Speaker 3>now trying to mitigate the effects of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this heat because of all of the samantha</v>

1250
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:20.160
<v Speaker 3>in the buildings and the pavement in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>parking lots.</v>

1251
01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 3>They're always hotter than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounding rural areas.</v>

1252
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.150
<v Speaker 3>So the question has been legitimately </v>
<v Speaker 3>raised.</v>

1253
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.730
<v Speaker 3>How much of a bias has been introduced </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the,</v>

1254
01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the ground based sensors?</v>

1255
01:11:32.701 --> 01:11:35.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we turn to the balloon sensors,</v>

1256
01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:40.220
<v Speaker 3>the radio sonne balloon sensors into </v>
<v Speaker 3>satellite sensor is basically what </v>

1257
01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:44.541
<v Speaker 3>they're showing is that the average </v>
<v Speaker 3>global temperature has been flat for 15 </v>

1258
01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:45.510
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1259
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.900
<v Speaker 3>because of that and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and many of the,</v>

1260
01:11:47.901 --> 01:11:49.510
<v Speaker 3>the key,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1261
01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:54.150
<v Speaker 3>scientists like phil jones of the ipc </v>
<v Speaker 3>has basically publicly admitted,</v>

1262
01:11:54.151 --> 01:11:54.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1263
01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:58.440
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the average temperature</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that perspective,</v>

1264
01:11:58.441 --> 01:11:59.810
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't warmed in 15.</v>

1265
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Now there are regional pockets of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of warming,</v>

1266
01:12:02.971 --> 01:12:07.971
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>records being sacked all the time </v>

1267
01:12:07.971 --> 01:12:10.740
<v Speaker 3>because local conditions will affect </v>
<v Speaker 3>change enormously.</v>

1268
01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Just like I was talking about the urban </v>
<v Speaker 3>heat island effect is,</v>

1269
01:12:14.031 --> 01:12:19.031
<v Speaker 3>is a local or regional condition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because of the fact that the climate</v>

1270
01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:24.780
<v Speaker 3>hasn't warmed statistically </v>
<v Speaker 3>significantly in 15 years,</v>

1271
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:29.100
<v Speaker 3>now we don't talk about global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked about climate change,</v>

1272
01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.920
<v Speaker 3>but those two terms are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>interchangeable.</v>

1273
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very specific model of climate </v>

1274
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.581
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that you've got this 15 micron </v>

1275
01:12:40.581 --> 01:12:43.641
<v Speaker 3>wavelength of co two in the atmosphere </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's trapping infrared radiation </v>

1276
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:48.480
<v Speaker 3>emanating from the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1277
01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:53.980
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're talking about climate </v>

1278
01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:53.980
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now suddenly you know our,</v>

1279
01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:58.230
<v Speaker 3>our umbrella goes much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much huge and it now encompasses all of </v>

1280
01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:02.361
<v Speaker 3>these other things that I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about and and to question the consensus </v>

1281
01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:08.151
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to consent to question that ceo two is </v>

1282
01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:11.121
<v Speaker 3>the primary or sole driver of climate is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to be a climate change denier.</v>

1283
01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:13.170
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because no,</v>

1284
01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:18.171
<v Speaker 3>I would challenge anybody even uses that</v>
<v Speaker 3>term will show me an example of any </v>

1285
01:13:18.171 --> 01:13:22.581
<v Speaker 3>climate scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter where they fall in the </v>

1286
01:13:22.581 --> 01:13:23.580
<v Speaker 3>argument that is denying that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate is changing.</v>

1287
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:29.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean anybody who has studied the </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate all knows that it has changed </v>

1288
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:33.470
<v Speaker 3>dramatically in dynamically on any scale</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can look at whether it's the decadal</v>

1289
01:13:33.811 --> 01:13:36.780
<v Speaker 3>scale as centennial or millennial or </v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond.</v>

1290
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:39.120
<v Speaker 3>it changes on every level and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1291
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.830
<v Speaker 3>We have to recognize that if we stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>burning fossil fuels tomorrow,</v>

1292
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:46.260
<v Speaker 3>we didn't drive another car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't.</v>

1293
01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:49.380
<v Speaker 3>We shut down all the coal plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell you this.</v>

1294
01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:51.960
<v Speaker 3>The climate would not stop changing.</v>

1295
01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:59.450
<v Speaker 1>When you see a story like here's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the news about a us senator </v>

1296
01:14:00.121 --> 01:14:05.121
<v Speaker 1>marco rubio's denial of manmade climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change should play well with his tea </v>

1297
01:14:06.031 --> 01:14:11.031
<v Speaker 1>party base who support he'll need if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed runs for president in 2:16,</v>

1298
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:17.490
<v Speaker 1>but in taking this position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>florida's junior republican senator </v>

1299
01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:21.151
<v Speaker 1>ignores the vast majority of the world's</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate scientists who say human </v>

1300
01:14:21.151 --> 01:14:24.310
<v Speaker 1>activity is contributing to climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change and rising sea levels.</v>

1301
01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Human</v>

1302
01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.860
<v Speaker 4>activity is contributing to climate </v>
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>

1303
01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:33.100
<v Speaker 4>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no doubt that human activity </v>

1304
01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:33.100
<v Speaker 4>contributes to climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human activity,</v>

1305
01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:37.900
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is one variable in a very complex </v>

1306
01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.781
<v Speaker 4>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish mark marco rubio would keep his </v>

1307
01:14:40.781 --> 01:14:44.090
<v Speaker 4>mouth shut until he goes and spends </v>
<v Speaker 4>about six months or a year.</v>

1308
01:14:44.091 --> 01:14:49.091
<v Speaker 4>Really doing the homework because then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could talk a little bit more </v>

1309
01:14:49.091 --> 01:14:49.250
<v Speaker 4>intelligently about it.</v>

1310
01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:50.690
<v Speaker 1>That is the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1311
01:14:50.691 --> 01:14:53.150
<v Speaker 1>It really does take that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1312
01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Like he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you have.</v>

1313
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:57.530
<v Speaker 1>What did I meet you at six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago?</v>

1314
01:14:57.531 --> 01:14:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1315
01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:03.460
<v Speaker 1>and you had already spent decades </v>
<v Speaker 1>observing the effects of climate change </v>

1316
01:15:05.511 --> 01:15:09.680
<v Speaker 1>and of asteroidal impacts and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of these things.</v>

1317
01:15:09.681 --> 01:15:14.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean the amount of time just absorbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the information so you could rattle it </v>

1318
01:15:14.681 --> 01:15:15.860
<v Speaker 1>off like this in a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1319
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.820
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck got you into this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you get down this rabbit hole?</v>

1320
01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an odd rabbit hole,</v>

1321
01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rabbit hole.</v>

1322
01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:28.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so thankful.</v>

1323
01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Not only that you've gone down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you're willing to exchange this</v>

1324
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:35.960
<v Speaker 1>information with us or imparted on us </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's.</v>

1325
01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:41.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know you're not a right wing </v>

1326
01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:41.540
<v Speaker 1>lunatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are very science based guy,</v>

1327
01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:46.510
<v Speaker 1>but you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at this and the way </v>

1328
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:49.061
<v Speaker 1>you're explaining it is incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational and incredibly frustrating to </v>

1329
01:15:49.061 --> 01:15:52.080
<v Speaker 1>me that there's not that many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

1330
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:54.950
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are saying this well.</v>

1331
01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:56.000
<v Speaker 1>The upside</v>

1332
01:15:56.030 --> 01:16:01.030
<v Speaker 4>I think of the whole global warming </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue or the climate change issue is </v>

1333
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:02.420
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if you know,</v>

1334
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:07.990
<v Speaker 4>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is I made the point that even if we </v>

1335
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:09.230
<v Speaker 4>stopped all fossil fuel consumption </v>
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow,</v>

1336
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:12.680
<v Speaker 4>the climate is still going to change and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to change dramatically.</v>

1337
01:16:12.681 --> 01:16:17.681
<v Speaker 4>It's going to change sometimes even </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic when we need to do from </v>

1338
01:16:17.681 --> 01:16:22.391
<v Speaker 4>here on out is basically think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>strategies of adaptability if as a </v>

1339
01:16:23.001 --> 01:16:28.001
<v Speaker 4>result of this whole issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even even though I think it's misplaced </v>

1340
01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:32.590
<v Speaker 4>based mis misapplied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if part of that comes out of this is </v>

1341
01:16:34.161 --> 01:16:36.740
<v Speaker 4>that we begin to develop strategies of </v>
<v Speaker 4>adaptability.</v>

1342
01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.800
<v Speaker 4>That would be a good thing if however we</v>
<v Speaker 4>focused so exclusively on carbon dioxide</v>

1343
01:16:42.591 --> 01:16:46.160
<v Speaker 4>to the exclusion of everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be a bad thing.</v>

1344
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the climate is going to change </v>

1345
01:16:52.090 --> 01:16:52.090
<v Speaker 4>no matter what we do or where we go with</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1346
01:16:52.090 --> 01:16:52.940
<v Speaker 4>the climate is going to.</v>

1347
01:16:53.210 --> 01:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>So you can put up solar power panels </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the cows come home.</v>

1348
01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 1>The houses that are on the beach in </v>
<v Speaker 1>malibu are still going to be underwater </v>

1349
01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 1>in 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1350
01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.920
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily so buy real estate in </v>

1351
01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:05.920
<v Speaker 1>malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1352
01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.910
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

1353
01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned earlier</v>

1354
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:14.300
<v Speaker 3>that there was a break in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the little ice age of about 150 years</v>

1355
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 3>that that basically led to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>renaissance.</v>

1356
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1357
01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:21.710
<v Speaker 3>we've been in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a receSsion of the little ice age,</v>

1358
01:17:21.711 --> 01:17:26.711
<v Speaker 3>a an interruption of the little ice age </v>
<v Speaker 3>for about 150 years and right now you </v>

1359
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

1360
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:33.101
<v Speaker 3>the ipc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that frustrates me is </v>

1361
01:17:33.101 --> 01:17:35.351
<v Speaker 3>that they basically excludes solar </v>
<v Speaker 3>physicists and solar scientists who are </v>

1362
01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:36.380
<v Speaker 3>essentially saying that insulation </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels,</v>

1363
01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:41.440
<v Speaker 3>insulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of solar energy penetrating </v>

1364
01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.780
<v Speaker 3>the atmosphere is one of the lowest </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels in thousands of years.</v>

1365
01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:49.190
<v Speaker 3>and I mean there are solar physicists </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are saying,</v>

1366
01:17:49.191 --> 01:17:54.191
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could be at the beginning of another </v>

1367
01:17:54.191 --> 01:17:56.561
<v Speaker 3>phase of the little ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if our ceo to it's helping new </v>

1368
01:17:57.201 --> 01:18:01.700
<v Speaker 3>ameliorates somewhat returned the little</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice age,</v>

1369
01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:04.970
<v Speaker 3>that would be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So muscle cars or green,</v>

1370
01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.160
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm getting out of this.</v>

1371
01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Coal and muscle cars are good for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>forest.</v>

1372
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the property,</v>

1373
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 3>the problem with coal is not so much the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ceo to is to me,</v>

1374
01:18:15.111 --> 01:18:17.390
<v Speaker 3>it's just the particulate matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1375
01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.580
<v Speaker 3>that's a different question altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pollution,</v>

1376
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.500
<v Speaker 3>the pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is horrific.</v>

1377
01:18:21.501 --> 01:18:26.501
<v Speaker 3>In China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they had these coal plants and you </v>

1378
01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:26.501
<v Speaker 3>see these people that are essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking,</v>

1379
01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:27.470
<v Speaker 3>it looks like they're in the middle of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>forest fire.</v>

1380
01:18:27.471 --> 01:18:29.800
<v Speaker 3>They're walking down the street and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just dark everywhere.</v>

1381
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a different issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1382
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:33.010
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1383
01:18:33.011 --> 01:18:38.011
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I consider myself a conservationist in </v>

1384
01:18:38.011 --> 01:18:40.991
<v Speaker 3>the respect that we basically need </v>
<v Speaker 3>examples of an,</v>

1385
01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:47.600
<v Speaker 3>a pristine nature because ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature is the most powerful teacher and </v>

1386
01:18:49.161 --> 01:18:54.161
<v Speaker 3>we need examples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need places where nature's just left </v>

1387
01:18:54.161 --> 01:18:54.980
<v Speaker 3>alone to do its thing without </v>
<v Speaker 3>interference of human beings.</v>

1388
01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.450
<v Speaker 3>We need clean air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has the right to dump shit in the</v>

1389
01:18:59.451 --> 01:19:01.070
<v Speaker 3>air that other people have to breathe.</v>

1390
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Nobody has the right to dump shit in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>water that other people have to drink.</v>

1391
01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:07.970
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are different questions and really</v>

1392
01:19:07.971 --> 01:19:12.971
<v Speaker 3>where are the more of our focus should </v>
<v Speaker 3>be rather than these abstractions.</v>

1393
01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:17.090
<v Speaker 3>I have found the course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten some flack over the last few</v>

1394
01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:19.340
<v Speaker 3>years by saying some of the things I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been saying here.</v>

1395
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:24.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've had people stand up and </v>

1396
01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:24.400
<v Speaker 3>accused me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1397
01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:24.530
<v Speaker 3>you're just saying we can just do </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything we want.</v>

1398
01:19:24.531 --> 01:19:28.190
<v Speaker 3>We can just destroy the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course is not the case,</v>

1399
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:30.440
<v Speaker 3>and not saying that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not saying that at all.</v>

1400
01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:35.460
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when we began to look at the bigger </v>

1401
01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.511
<v Speaker 3>context of this thing and we begin to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that the extraordinary </v>

1402
01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:38.240
<v Speaker 3>changes that this planet has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

1403
01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even to some of the lesser things in</v>

1404
01:19:41.571 --> 01:19:42.670
<v Speaker 3>recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mt.</v>

1405
01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:47.780
<v Speaker 3>St helen's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember when that erupted in 1980 </v>

1406
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:49.850
<v Speaker 3>tens of thousands of acres were turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a lunar landscape,</v>

1407
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1408
01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:56.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you read the accounts of the </v>

1409
01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:56.230
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biologists,</v>

1410
01:19:56.230 --> 01:20:01.000
<v Speaker 3>zoologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ecologists that had been studying </v>

1411
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.100
<v Speaker 3>what happened to that decimated </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape and the aftermath,</v>

1412
01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:08.370
<v Speaker 3>what you find out is they're surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost shock.</v>

1413
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.400
<v Speaker 3>It helped quickly nature recovered from </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and how quickly,</v>

1414
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:16.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>colonizer plants moved in,</v>

1415
01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and was followed by a whole,</v>

1416
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 3>the whole succession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ecological succession of reclaiming that</v>

1417
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:25.170
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the,</v>

1418
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:30.310
<v Speaker 3>the exxon valdez disaster up in Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Alaska,</v>

1419
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:36.950
<v Speaker 3>and that was over the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>devastating to the local ecology.</v>

1420
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.540
<v Speaker 3>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting again,</v>

1421
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:44.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there've been several books written by </v>

1422
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.611
<v Speaker 3>some of the lead scientists involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that talking about how remarkably quick </v>

1423
01:20:46.891 --> 01:20:50.730
<v Speaker 3>nature begin to reclaim and recover from</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1424
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000
<v Speaker 3>And here's some irony where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government forced exxon to go in and do </v>

1425
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.570
<v Speaker 3>it's cleanup is actually suffered more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the areas that were just left alone</v>

1426
01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:02.280
<v Speaker 3>for nature to reclaim.</v>

1427
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:04.830
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the chemicals that they used in order</v>

1428
01:21:04.831 --> 01:21:09.831
<v Speaker 3>to break up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the issue with the gulf as </v>

1429
01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:09.831
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1430
01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:13.410
<v Speaker 3>With those dispersants that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>spraying over the area,</v>

1431
01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:16.500
<v Speaker 3>they probably should've just left the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gulf alone because,</v>

1432
01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:20.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have a submarine earthquakes,</v>

1433
01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:25.710
<v Speaker 3>they can expel huge amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hydrocarbons into the ocean.</v>

1434
01:21:25.711 --> 01:21:30.711
<v Speaker 3>Nature has been dealing with massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>expulsions of hydrocarbon into the </v>

1435
01:21:31.651 --> 01:21:35.640
<v Speaker 3>oceans and into the marine ecology for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for millions and millions of years.</v>

1436
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1437
01:21:37.291 --> 01:21:42.291
<v Speaker 3>it was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think what we'll see is that the </v>

1438
01:21:42.291 --> 01:21:46.380
<v Speaker 3>recovery time has been consumed faster </v>
<v Speaker 3>than most people believed possible.</v>

1439
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:47.880
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's,</v>

1440
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:52.230
<v Speaker 3>what's really going to turn out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end looking at all this,</v>

1441
01:21:52.231 --> 01:21:57.231
<v Speaker 3>is that nature is robust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when we begin to look at the number </v>

1442
01:21:57.231 --> 01:21:59.640
<v Speaker 3>of times that nature has been disrupted </v>
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

1443
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.740
<v Speaker 3>we've been talking about asteroids and </v>
<v Speaker 3>comets,</v>

1444
01:22:01.741 --> 01:22:04.980
<v Speaker 3>and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a perspective for you,</v>

1445
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the peak of the cold war,</v>

1446
01:22:08.850 --> 01:22:13.850
<v Speaker 3>when us and the soviet union were </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyeball to eyeball with our nuclear </v>

1447
01:22:13.891 --> 01:22:16.650
<v Speaker 3>weapons on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on high alert,</v>

1448
01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.710
<v Speaker 3>and we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had 10,000</v>

1449
01:22:19.711 --> 01:22:21.780
<v Speaker 3>weapons on our side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had 10,000</v>

1450
01:22:21.781 --> 01:22:26.781
<v Speaker 3>weapons on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The total nuclear arsenal at the times </v>

1451
01:22:27.090 --> 01:22:30.270
<v Speaker 3>had about 18,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>megatons of,</v>

1452
01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:35.130
<v Speaker 3>of energy capable of being delivered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>18,000</v>

1453
01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:39.270
<v Speaker 3>megatons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that means 18 million tons of tnt.</v>

1454
01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:44.280
<v Speaker 3>The bomb that destroyed hiroshima was </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 10,000</v>

1455
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:49.340
<v Speaker 3>tons of tnt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 100 times a hundred hiroshima bombs </v>

1456
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:54.680
<v Speaker 3>would be one mega ton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now there was aBout say 15 to </v>

1457
01:22:55.231 --> 01:23:00.231
<v Speaker 3>18,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>megatons total in the arsenal of the </v>

1458
01:23:00.231 --> 01:23:04.371
<v Speaker 3>superpowers during the height of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cold war had we unleashed an all out </v>

1459
01:23:04.371 --> 01:23:05.920
<v Speaker 3>nuclear war and</v>

1460
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:11.100
<v Speaker 4>fired every warhead that we had in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>arsenals at each other 15,000</v>

1461
01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:13.630
<v Speaker 4>warheads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1462
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1463
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 4>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>warheads,</v>

1464
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:17.470
<v Speaker 4>15,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>megatons.</v>

1465
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:20.080
<v Speaker 4>It would have been an environmental </v>
<v Speaker 4>disaster,</v>

1466
01:23:20.081 --> 01:23:24.280
<v Speaker 4>unprecedented in history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember the scenarios about nuclear</v>

1467
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:24.970
<v Speaker 4>winter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1468
01:23:24.971 --> 01:23:29.971
<v Speaker 4>Because of all of the fires and the suit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the particulate matter thrown into </v>

1469
01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:33.310
<v Speaker 4>the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could literally bring on a a mini ice</v>

1470
01:23:33.311 --> 01:23:34.150
<v Speaker 4>age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1471
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:38.560
<v Speaker 4>And and probably cause without even the </v>
<v Speaker 4>radiation caused,</v>

1472
01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:41.860
<v Speaker 4>major collapse of the human population.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1473
01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.230
<v Speaker 4>Get this number in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>15,000</v>

1474
01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.000
<v Speaker 4>megatons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1475
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 4>Now even a small asteroid impact or </v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1476
01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:53.590
<v Speaker 4>let's say the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the asteroid impact that that struck the</v>

1477
01:23:53.591 --> 01:23:58.591
<v Speaker 4>yucatan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a simple formula that you can </v>

1478
01:23:58.591 --> 01:24:01.541
<v Speaker 4>use when you look at the crater size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take the size of the crater and </v>

1479
01:24:02.261 --> 01:24:07.261
<v Speaker 4>raise it expressed in kilometers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Raise it to the power of three point </v>

1480
01:24:07.261 --> 01:24:11.521
<v Speaker 4>four and multiply the result by two </v>
<v Speaker 4>point four and what it's going to give </v>

1481
01:24:11.521 --> 01:24:14.680
<v Speaker 4>you as the energy yield in megatons of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that object striking.</v>

1482
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:19.870
<v Speaker 4>If I put in 180 kilometers into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>calculator here,</v>

1483
01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:23.560
<v Speaker 4>which is the diameter of the yucatan </v>
<v Speaker 4>crater,</v>

1484
01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:26.980
<v Speaker 4>and I raise it to the three point four </v>
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>

1485
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:30.040
<v Speaker 4>and then I multiply that by the two </v>
<v Speaker 4>point four power,</v>

1486
01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:33.400
<v Speaker 4>I get the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the megaton yield.</v>

1487
01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:38.400
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that number comes up to be three,</v>

1488
01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:42.250
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>111 million megatons.</v>

1489
01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:48.120
<v Speaker 4>I divide that by $15,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And basically what we have there is </v>

1490
01:24:49.211 --> 01:24:54.211
<v Speaker 4>about equivalent to the entire nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 4>arsenal of the superpowers 8,000</v>

1491
01:24:56.351 --> 01:24:58.990
<v Speaker 4>times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over 8,000</v>

1492
01:24:58.991 --> 01:24:59.680
<v Speaker 4>times over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1493
01:24:59.681 --> 01:25:03.490
<v Speaker 4>what kind of an environmental </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence would there be to that?</v>

1494
01:25:03.491 --> 01:25:07.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we saw that global firestorms,</v>

1495
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:08.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this,</v>

1496
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:13.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the studies of the amount of suit at </v>

1497
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:15.541
<v Speaker 4>that boundary layer shows that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of biomass that went up in </v>

1498
01:25:15.931 --> 01:25:20.931
<v Speaker 4>firestorms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the kt boundary was about </v>

1499
01:25:20.931 --> 01:25:22.330
<v Speaker 4>equivalent to every plant on earth today</v>
<v Speaker 4>going up in fire,</v>

1500
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:28.110
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had tsunamis that we're perhaps a </v>

1501
01:25:28.110 --> 01:25:28.110
<v Speaker 4>thousand feet in height.</v>

1502
01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:33.160
<v Speaker 4>You had global earthquakes probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>measured 10 to 11 on the richter scale.</v>

1503
01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.570
<v Speaker 4>And you know how the richter scale </v>
<v Speaker 4>works.</v>

1504
01:25:34.571 --> 01:25:37.660
<v Speaker 4>It's logarithmic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that an eight point,</v>

1505
01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:42.720
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>earthquake is 10 times more powerful </v>

1506
01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:42.720
<v Speaker 4>than a seven point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1507
01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:42.970
<v Speaker 4>nine point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1508
01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.950
<v Speaker 4>is 10 times more powerful than an eight </v>
<v Speaker 4>point?</v>

1509
01:25:44.951 --> 01:25:46.180
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an 11 point.</v>

1510
01:25:46.181 --> 01:25:48.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>earthquake is going to be unimaginable.</v>

1511
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:50.890
<v Speaker 4>The whole framework of the globe would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have shaken.</v>

1512
01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.780
<v Speaker 4>You probably would have massive failures</v>
<v Speaker 4>on every fault line on the planet.</v>

1513
01:25:56.230 --> 01:26:01.230
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kt event was the middle of the five </v>

1514
01:26:01.230 --> 01:26:01.600
<v Speaker 4>great extinction events.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1515
01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 4>There was ordovician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>silurian.</v>

1516
01:26:04.101 --> 01:26:06.620
<v Speaker 4>There was the permian triassic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a couple more.</v>

1517
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Two of them were more extreme than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now even even much smaller than that.</v>

1518
01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1519
01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:18.280
<v Speaker 4>w when they talk about a tipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1520
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:23.240
<v Speaker 4>are we talking about a tipping point </v>
<v Speaker 4>that could trigger a climate change,</v>

1521
01:26:23.241 --> 01:26:27.830
<v Speaker 4>a disastrous catastrophic climate change</v>
<v Speaker 4>is being a few parts per million,</v>

1522
01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:32.860
<v Speaker 4>more of co two or as a tipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really a mile wide asteroid slamming </v>

1523
01:26:34.311 --> 01:26:36.920
<v Speaker 4>into the earth at 100 times the speed of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a rifle bullet.</v>

1524
01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.440
<v Speaker 4>That could be a tipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend,</v>

1525
01:26:39.730 --> 01:26:44.730
<v Speaker 4>and that has happened thousands of times</v>
<v Speaker 4>and hundreds of times since we humans </v>

1526
01:26:44.841 --> 01:26:47.720
<v Speaker 4>have been here hundreds of times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of hundreds of times,</v>

1527
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:50.360
<v Speaker 4>and one was the most recent one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the holocene crater.</v>

1528
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:52.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably it's,</v>

1529
01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:57.220
<v Speaker 4>there's evidence emerging now that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>collapse of the late bronze age </v>

1530
01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.040
<v Speaker 4>civilization is around 4,200</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>

1531
01:26:58.041 --> 01:27:00.470
<v Speaker 4>may have been precipitated by a series </v>
<v Speaker 4>of impacts.</v>

1532
01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.680
<v Speaker 4>There's evidence emerging that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>climate downturn that occurred between </v>

1533
01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:06.140
<v Speaker 4>5:36</v>
<v Speaker 4>and 5:48</v>

1534
01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:11.200
<v Speaker 4>that I talked about earlier may have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been triggered by a series of multiple </v>

1535
01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:15.971
<v Speaker 4>impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>one that looks like it occurred off the </v>

1536
01:27:15.971 --> 01:27:18.641
<v Speaker 4>coast of Norway and another one that </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like it occurred off the coast of </v>

1537
01:27:18.641 --> 01:27:21.680
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like tandem impacts right around 5:36</v>

1538
01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:22.950
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1539
01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:28.040
<v Speaker 4>and we're basically faced with the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>now that literally impacts from things </v>

1540
01:27:28.881 --> 01:27:33.881
<v Speaker 4>from space maybe hundreds of times more </v>
<v Speaker 4>likely than anybody was even imagining a</v>

1541
01:27:35.361 --> 01:27:36.260
<v Speaker 4>generation ago.</v>

1542
01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:41.920
<v Speaker 1>So we're essentiallY this civilization </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is banking on the knowledge that </v>

1543
01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.720
<v Speaker 1>we've accumulated over a very small </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time.</v>

1544
01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And as we're uncovering more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>

1545
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:52.490
<v Speaker 1>more and more information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're starting to realize our ignorance.</v>

1546
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:56.330
<v Speaker 1>We're starting to realize how little we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about our own history,</v>

1547
01:27:56.331 --> 01:28:01.331
<v Speaker 1>the history of this particular species </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how it's interacted in this crazy </v>

1548
01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:06.340
<v Speaker 1>volatile environment of earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many times we've been hit by </v>

1549
01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:06.340
<v Speaker 1>rock.</v>

1550
01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:07.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And see,</v>

1551
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:08.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred years ago,</v>

1552
01:28:08.831 --> 01:28:13.831
<v Speaker 4>the assumption was what are these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these images of these craters are </v>

1553
01:28:13.831 --> 01:28:13.990
<v Speaker 4>impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1554
01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:16.120
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's actually 10 years old.</v>

1555
01:28:16.121 --> 01:28:18.790
<v Speaker 4>But it shows now all the identified </v>
<v Speaker 4>impact.</v>

1556
01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.100
<v Speaker 1>And this is 10 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So since then some new ones have.</v>

1557
01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the dozens more.</v>

1558
01:28:23.491 --> 01:28:28.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since then has been discovery of </v>

1559
01:28:28.491 --> 01:28:31.131
<v Speaker 1>this nuclear glass that they've found </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over europe and all over asia,</v>

1560
01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:36.980
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you referring to the possibly the </v>

1561
01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.430
<v Speaker 4>thing that graham was talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 13,000</v>

1562
01:28:38.431 --> 01:28:38.880
<v Speaker 4>years a year ago</v>

1563
01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.020
<v Speaker 1>of event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1564
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm referring to is there was a </v>

1565
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:48.171
<v Speaker 1>mainstream report about all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these pieces of this very similar </v>

1566
01:28:49.501 --> 01:28:54.501
<v Speaker 1>material to what they find at nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>blasts and that it was all over the </v>

1567
01:28:54.501 --> 01:28:57.240
<v Speaker 1>place at when they did the core samples </v>
<v Speaker 1>around 12,000</v>

1568
01:28:57.241 --> 01:29:02.241
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's exactly what graham stark </v>

1569
01:29:02.241 --> 01:29:05.370
<v Speaker 1>and and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence is getting stronger and </v>

1570
01:29:05.370 --> 01:29:08.151
<v Speaker 1>stronger each year that there have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There may have been a multiple impact </v>

1571
01:29:08.151 --> 01:29:12.411
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The terminated the ice age and this is </v>

1572
01:29:12.411 --> 01:29:15.950
<v Speaker 1>still a very controversial idea because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gradualists just don't want to go </v>

1573
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:20.691
<v Speaker 1>there and this is probably what killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>off mass extinction of the woolly </v>

1574
01:29:20.691 --> 01:29:24.831
<v Speaker 1>mammoth mass extinction of the saber </v>
<v Speaker 1>tooth tiger and a series of animals that</v>

1575
01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:27.900
<v Speaker 1>they really have not figured out why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's,</v>

1576
01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:32.930
<v Speaker 1>there's been all sorts of theories about</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the woolly mammoth went extinct and </v>

1577
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:33.690
<v Speaker 1>some of them are ridiculous like that.</v>

1578
01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.310
<v Speaker 1>people did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1579
01:29:35.311 --> 01:29:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to hear you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous idea.</v>

1580
01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>

1581
01:29:38.371 --> 01:29:40.920
<v Speaker 1>When you think about what kind of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were around 12,000</v>

1582
01:29:40.921 --> 01:29:45.921
<v Speaker 1>years ago and what kind of weapons they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had and what a fucking mammoth looks </v>

1583
01:29:45.921 --> 01:29:45.921
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like jesus christ,</v>

1584
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.660
<v Speaker 1>how many of them more and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's ridiculous about,</v>

1585
01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.360
<v Speaker 1>obviously when I say ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am ridiculous.</v>

1586
01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even be making that </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

1587
01:29:53.251 --> 01:29:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done very little research,</v>

1588
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:58.980
<v Speaker 1>but the research that I've read and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have questioned it,</v>

1589
01:29:58.981 --> 01:30:03.981
<v Speaker 1>have talked about the mass graves where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've found these animals that have </v>

1590
01:30:04.321 --> 01:30:09.321
<v Speaker 1>died instantaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of them and not consumed </v>

1591
01:30:09.321 --> 01:30:11.430
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't show signs of predation or of</v>

1592
01:30:11.431 --> 01:30:13.060
<v Speaker 1>butchering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

1593
01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:16.350
<v Speaker 1>They've died in full form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full body.</v>

1594
01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the massive,</v>

1595
01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:20.010
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive graveyards.</v>

1596
01:30:20.011 --> 01:30:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1597
01:30:21.091 --> 01:30:25.110
<v Speaker 1>for centuries a pristine mammoth tusk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ivory,</v>

1598
01:30:25.111 --> 01:30:29.960
<v Speaker 1>who've been hauled out of the permafrost</v>
<v Speaker 1>of siberia in train load lots.</v>

1599
01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:35.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this has gone into the global ivory </v>

1600
01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:35.700
<v Speaker 1>market literally for three or 400 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1601
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:41.390
<v Speaker 1>some estimates are that there may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been as many as four to 10 million </v>

1602
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:45.050
<v Speaker 1>woolly mammoths worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't realize it right here </v>

1603
01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:48.681
<v Speaker 1>in north America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were three species of provo city </v>

1604
01:30:48.681 --> 01:30:49.260
<v Speaker 1>and are three species of elephants </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the ice age.</v>

1605
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Africa has one species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian India has another species.</v>

1606
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:56.190
<v Speaker 1>We had three species here during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time will go.</v>

1607
01:30:56.191 --> 01:30:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Beckley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tappy was being built.</v>

1608
01:30:57.411 --> 01:31:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the time elephants in ai.</v>

1609
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another perspective.</v>

1610
01:31:04.351 --> 01:31:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Is that one that they found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

1611
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:08.760
<v Speaker 1>This is the bArest safka mammoth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was found in 19.</v>

1612
01:31:08.761 --> 01:31:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one quick frozen.</v>

1613
01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1614
01:31:12.991 --> 01:31:14.880
<v Speaker 1>with flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1615
01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:20.300
<v Speaker 1>at the time this photograph was taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wolves had eaten the flesh off of the </v>

1616
01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.270
<v Speaker 1>skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's,</v>

1617
01:31:21.330 --> 01:31:22.420
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1618
01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.800
<v Speaker 1>it's bare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you see there immediately.</v>

1619
01:31:25.890 --> 01:31:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Dirty wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1620
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Eating some million year old meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gusting assholes.</v>

1621
01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Probably $13,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

1622
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:37.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not quite as bad as stills gusting,</v>

1623
01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:40.950
<v Speaker 1>but you can see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1624
01:31:40.951 --> 01:31:45.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mammas left for liam just in front </v>

1625
01:31:45.951 --> 01:31:45.951
<v Speaker 1>of his face there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see how it's,</v>

1626
01:31:45.951 --> 01:31:50.580
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if jamie toggles back and forth </v>

1627
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:51.090
<v Speaker 1>between this image and the next one </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to see.</v>

1628
01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1629
01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.680
<v Speaker 1>This was how the woolly mammoth was </v>
<v Speaker 1>found.</v>

1630
01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And so they took photos of it when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was found like this,</v>

1631
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 1>and then they left it alone</v>

1632
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:01.950
<v Speaker 4>and the wolves came and got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not,</v>

1633
01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:05.740
<v Speaker 4>this is a reconstruction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in the leningrad museum.</v>

1634
01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:11.010
<v Speaker 4>So what they did was they took the </v>
<v Speaker 4>remains of the woolly mammoth and then </v>

1635
01:32:11.010 --> 01:32:13.891
<v Speaker 4>taxidermists came in and reconstructed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this shows the position in which he </v>

1636
01:32:13.891 --> 01:32:16.090
<v Speaker 4>was found sitting on his haunches like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1637
01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:21.570
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time that the woolly mammoth met </v>

1638
01:32:21.570 --> 01:32:25.921
<v Speaker 4>his demise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was eating flowering plants right </v>

1639
01:32:25.921 --> 01:32:26.200
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's important to keep that in mind.</v>

1640
01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:31.410
<v Speaker 4>His stomach was full of about two dozen </v>
<v Speaker 4>different varieties of plants and sedges</v>

1641
01:32:32.381 --> 01:32:36.460
<v Speaker 4>and things that he had been munching on </v>
<v Speaker 4>up in siberia at the time that he,</v>

1642
01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:40.240
<v Speaker 4>that he met his death number of </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting things.</v>

1643
01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:44.470
<v Speaker 4>The contents of his stomach could not </v>
<v Speaker 4>purified right now.</v>

1644
01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.800
<v Speaker 4>That's mysterious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that his,</v>

1645
01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:50.080
<v Speaker 4>his flesh was still edible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least by wolves.</v>

1646
01:32:50.110 --> 01:32:51.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stories about,</v>

1647
01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:56.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the scientist eating mammoth burgers is </v>

1648
01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:56.940
<v Speaker 4>probably made up.</v>

1649
01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:58.780
<v Speaker 4>But the wolves definitely were able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat the flesh.</v>

1650
01:32:58.781 --> 01:33:01.480
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was described as still being marbled,</v>

1651
01:33:01.481 --> 01:33:04.990
<v Speaker 4>almost as if it had just been frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1652
01:33:04.991 --> 01:33:09.991
<v Speaker 4>a week ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but since the time that the woolly </v>

1653
01:33:09.991 --> 01:33:10.180
<v Speaker 4>mammoth died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it had its whole carcass.</v>

1654
01:33:10.181 --> 01:33:15.181
<v Speaker 4>Now this was a six ton woolly mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he had been frozen for how many </v>

1655
01:33:15.181 --> 01:33:20.041
<v Speaker 4>thousands and thousands of years and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoroughly frozen that the contents of </v>

1656
01:33:22.361 --> 01:33:26.350
<v Speaker 4>the stomach putrefying now a woolly </v>
<v Speaker 4>mammoth of six tons,</v>

1657
01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:29.410
<v Speaker 4>has a lot of internal heat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1658
01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.650
<v Speaker 4>Clarence birdseye,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1659
01:33:32.651 --> 01:33:37.651
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the founder of birdseye foods and the </v>

1660
01:33:37.651 --> 01:33:40.950
<v Speaker 4>inventor of the fast freezing of foods </v>
<v Speaker 4>for preservation got involved in </v>

1661
01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:45.940
<v Speaker 4>examining and in speculating about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>woolly mammoth,</v>

1662
01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:51.360
<v Speaker 4>his conclusion basically that did </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like this in order to prevent </v>

1663
01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:52.840
<v Speaker 4>the contents of the stomach from </v>
<v Speaker 4>putrefying,</v>

1664
01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:58.230
<v Speaker 4>the entire carcass of the woolly mammoth</v>
<v Speaker 4>would've had to been frozen through and </v>

1665
01:33:58.230 --> 01:33:59.470
<v Speaker 4>through in 10 hours or less.</v>

1666
01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:05.640
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bear in mind that this woolly mammoth </v>

1667
01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.231
<v Speaker 4>was eating flowering plants right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how cold would it have to be to freeze a</v>

1668
01:34:09.161 --> 01:34:12.040
<v Speaker 4>six ton woolly mammoth in 10 hours or </v>
<v Speaker 4>less?</v>

1669
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:15.970
<v Speaker 4>His estimate was probably somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>around 150 degrees below zero.</v>

1670
01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:22.260
<v Speaker 4>So from flowering plants to a 150 </v>
<v Speaker 4>degrees below zero in 10 hours in 10 </v>

1671
01:34:24.971 --> 01:34:26.360
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

1672
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:28.210
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what causes something like that?</v>

1673
01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:30.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been some speculation.</v>

1674
01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:32.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>w,</v>

1675
01:34:32.610 --> 01:34:37.610
<v Speaker 4>the speculation that I found most </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting was possibly volcanic gases </v>

1676
01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:41.410
<v Speaker 4>that had been ejected up into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stratosphere,</v>

1677
01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:47.250
<v Speaker 4>approached absolute zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because of the cold fell back to </v>

1678
01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:52.071
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you could get the same effect </v>

1679
01:34:52.071 --> 01:34:53.710
<v Speaker 4>perhaps with a gas is released from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disintegrating common nucleus.</v>

1680
01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:56.890
<v Speaker 4>It's still a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1681
01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.960
<v Speaker 4>anything that anybody says at this point</v>
<v Speaker 4>is purely speculative.</v>

1682
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:05.350
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's clear that whatever this mammoth </v>

1683
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:07.871
<v Speaker 4>underwent was disastrous in the extreme </v>
<v Speaker 4>you saw I'm sitting there on his </v>

1684
01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:08.990
<v Speaker 4>haunches right.</v>

1685
01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:14.170
<v Speaker 4>Both of his hip bones were broken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means that he was slammed back </v>

1686
01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:17.831
<v Speaker 4>onto his haunches very violently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was also found with an erect penis,</v>

1687
01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:23.980
<v Speaker 4>which means that he died by suffocation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which meant that he was entombed </v>

1688
01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:29.330
<v Speaker 4>virtually instantly by the material that</v>
<v Speaker 4>later became the permafrost.</v>

1689
01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:34.900
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about the little ice age</v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier and I was talking about how the </v>

1690
01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:35.660
<v Speaker 4>little ice age ended around 1850.</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1691
01:35:35.661 --> 01:35:40.661
<v Speaker 4>this guy was found about 19 oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one after the climate in siberia had </v>

1692
01:35:40.661 --> 01:35:43.900
<v Speaker 4>been warming somewhat see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what happened was a part of a clip,</v>

1693
01:35:43.930 --> 01:35:46.730
<v Speaker 4>a cliff that had been next to the barest</v>
<v Speaker 4>safka river,</v>

1694
01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:52.120
<v Speaker 4>the [inaudible] river had shifted its </v>
<v Speaker 4>channel and eroded some of the cliff </v>

1695
01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:55.250
<v Speaker 4>face back and then one year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one warm spring,</v>

1696
01:35:55.490 --> 01:36:00.490
<v Speaker 4>there was a collapse of the cliff face </v>
<v Speaker 4>that exposed this mammoth to the </v>

1697
01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:05.920
<v Speaker 4>atmosphere and at that point is when the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves came in and began to devour the </v>

1698
01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:07.190
<v Speaker 4>flesh on the on the skull.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1699
01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.640
<v Speaker 4>so clearly this morley mammoth is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>example of or indicative of some type of</v>

1700
01:36:13.971 --> 01:36:18.971
<v Speaker 4>a catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it was a global catastrophe or </v>

1701
01:36:18.971 --> 01:36:18.971
<v Speaker 4>local catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows,</v>

1702
01:36:18.971 --> 01:36:22.520
<v Speaker 4>but clearly it was catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that woolly mammoth.</v>

1703
01:36:22.521 --> 01:36:27.521
<v Speaker 4>There's only one of dozens of examples </v>
<v Speaker 4>of flash frozen late pleistocene mammals</v>

1704
01:36:28.670 --> 01:36:31.550
<v Speaker 4>that that died under similar </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances</v>

1705
01:36:31.650 --> 01:36:36.650
<v Speaker 1>and these large graveyards of mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinctions of thousands and thousands </v>

1706
01:36:37.831 --> 01:36:40.080
<v Speaker 1>of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the best examples of them?</v>

1707
01:36:40.081 --> 01:36:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Because I know that I've seen some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them online,</v>

1708
01:36:42.541 --> 01:36:44.670
<v Speaker 1>but I can't pull them up like I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can</v>

1709
01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:47.670
<v Speaker 4>got some right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I can get my laptop there,</v>

1710
01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:50.550
<v Speaker 4>pull jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull up,</v>

1711
01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:53.070
<v Speaker 4>look towards the bottom of the list </v>
<v Speaker 4>list.</v>

1712
01:36:53.071 --> 01:36:57.120
<v Speaker 4>You'll see place to seeing the lost </v>
<v Speaker 4>world of the pleistocene.</v>

1713
01:36:58.170 --> 01:37:01.370
<v Speaker 4>You see that pdf?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1714
01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:03.030
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a powerpoint.</v>

1715
01:37:04.230 --> 01:37:06.210
<v Speaker 4>It's in that list of the powerpoints </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I gave you.</v>

1716
01:37:06.211 --> 01:37:06.790
<v Speaker 4>I have some photos.</v>

1717
01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:09.120
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to tell you right now.</v>

1718
01:37:09.121 --> 01:37:11.640
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get freaked out.</v>

1719
01:37:11.641 --> 01:37:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Pretty easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she freaking me out.</v>

1720
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I actually frozen mammoth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to confess that one of my </v>

1721
01:37:20.770 --> 01:37:22.080
<v Speaker 1>objectives in coming here was to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>freak you out.</v>

1722
01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it.</v>

1723
01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're successful.</v>

1724
01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been terrified of yellowstone for,</v>

1725
01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:31.830
<v Speaker 1>for years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched some late night.</v>

1726
01:37:31.831 --> 01:37:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Documentary was a huge mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those things.</v>

1727
01:37:34.201 --> 01:37:39.201
<v Speaker 1>I was about to go to bed and I was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>flipping through the channels and they </v>

1728
01:37:39.201 --> 01:37:41.010
<v Speaker 1>were going over this thing about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>called dara volcano in yellowstone.</v>

1729
01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:42.980
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's it called dara?</v>

1730
01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.200
<v Speaker 1>And then they started talking about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was it something like 600 kilometers </v>

1731
01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.030
<v Speaker 1>wide or something crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is something like 300 miles,</v>

1732
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:56.510
<v Speaker 1>and they were saying that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even discover it until they started </v>

1733
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520
<v Speaker 1>satellite imagery</v>

1734
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:59.220
<v Speaker 4>of a of earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they realized that,</v>

1735
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:04.280
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was a giant volcano that was so </v>

1736
01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.761
<v Speaker 4>violent in its eruption that it blew the</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain off of it and it became this </v>

1737
01:38:07.761 --> 01:38:11.010
<v Speaker 4>massive crater and that it happens every</v>
<v Speaker 4>six to 800,000</v>

1738
01:38:11.011 --> 01:38:16.011
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That the last time it happened was </v>

1739
01:38:16.011 --> 01:38:16.011
<v Speaker 4>600,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1740
01:38:16.170 --> 01:38:18.540
<v Speaker 4>So hopefully keeping our fingers </v>
<v Speaker 4>crossed.</v>

1741
01:38:18.541 --> 01:38:20.850
<v Speaker 4>We got another 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years if we're lucky.</v>

1742
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:21.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but see,</v>

1743
01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:27.090
<v Speaker 4>that's another aspect of this component </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the dynamic history of planet earth.</v>

1744
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:29.730
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these gigantic volcanic eruptions.</v>

1745
01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:35.600
<v Speaker 4>There's been some interesting work </v>
<v Speaker 4>linking asteroid impacts with giant </v>

1746
01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:35.880
<v Speaker 4>volcanic eruptions as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it would.</v>

1747
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:41.510
<v Speaker 4>It would make sense that that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the energy injected into the earth </v>

1748
01:38:42.121 --> 01:38:45.630
<v Speaker 4>by a major impact could trigger volcanic</v>
<v Speaker 4>eruptions.</v>

1749
01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:51.500
<v Speaker 4>We know that during the great meltdown </v>
<v Speaker 4>event of 11 to 13,000</v>

1750
01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:55.560
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there were enormous,</v>

1751
01:38:55.561 --> 01:38:59.040
<v Speaker 4>massive volcanic eruptions and mount st </v>
<v Speaker 4>helens,</v>

1752
01:38:59.070 --> 01:39:00.760
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

1753
01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:04.650
<v Speaker 4>was massively erupting at that time.</v>

1754
01:39:04.650 --> 01:39:07.530
<v Speaker 4>And I have photographed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have some photographs right here,</v>

1755
01:39:07.531 --> 01:39:09.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much time we have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at some of this,</v>

1756
01:39:09.481 --> 01:39:14.481
<v Speaker 4>but where I have gone out and found </v>
<v Speaker 4>thick layers of white volcanic ash from </v>

1757
01:39:15.871 --> 01:39:20.871
<v Speaker 4>mount st helens sandwiched in between </v>
<v Speaker 4>these flood layers and and it.</v>

1758
01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:26.130
<v Speaker 4>It shows that it undoubtedly had to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>been a response to the fact that you had</v>

1759
01:39:26.131 --> 01:39:31.131
<v Speaker 4>this enormous mass transfer of weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we were talking about earlier from </v>

1760
01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:35.550
<v Speaker 4>the continents back to the ocean and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we go through maybe it's time to go</v>

1761
01:39:35.551 --> 01:39:37.650
<v Speaker 4>through a few of these images that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought.</v>

1762
01:39:37.690 --> 01:39:41.700
<v Speaker 4>You can begin to see some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of this melting.</v>

1763
01:39:43.150 --> 01:39:45.030
<v Speaker 4>You'll begin to appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1764
01:39:45.031 --> 01:39:50.031
<v Speaker 4>there were these just enormous mass </v>
<v Speaker 4>transfers of weight unloading in certain</v>

1765
01:39:50.281 --> 01:39:51.990
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loading and other areas.</v>

1766
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:57.350
<v Speaker 4>This would clearly have a profound </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect on the subterranean stability and</v>

1767
01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:03.200
<v Speaker 4>could easily lead to major eruptions and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a spasm of major volcanic </v>

1768
01:40:04.411 --> 01:40:09.150
<v Speaker 4>eruptions globally at the time of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transition out of the ice age,</v>

1769
01:40:09.151 --> 01:40:13.590
<v Speaker 4>which would only have added to the havoc</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that transition and why,</v>

1770
01:40:14.190 --> 01:40:19.190
<v Speaker 4>you Know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>half of the great species of megafauna </v>

1771
01:40:19.190 --> 01:40:19.190
<v Speaker 4>disappeared.</v>

1772
01:40:19.190 --> 01:40:21.240
<v Speaker 4>A megafaun is basically defined as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>

1773
01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:26.330
<v Speaker 4>any animal in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly mammals over 44 kilograms and </v>

1774
01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:28.590
<v Speaker 4>body weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is about a hundred pounds.</v>

1775
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that would include us.</v>

1776
01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:35.600
<v Speaker 4>And if you started thinking about all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the animals globally worldwide that are </v>

1777
01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.951
<v Speaker 4>more than 100 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depending on how you divide up the </v>

1778
01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:40.530
<v Speaker 4>species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there might be 100 to 2,130</v>

1779
01:40:40.531 --> 01:40:45.531
<v Speaker 4>different species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm talking about the lions and </v>

1780
01:40:45.531 --> 01:40:48.801
<v Speaker 4>tigers and bears and elephants and </v>
<v Speaker 4>rhinos and hippos and moose and caribou </v>

1781
01:40:48.801 --> 01:40:50.220
<v Speaker 4>and dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right down the line.</v>

1782
01:40:50.221 --> 01:40:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1783
01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:55.030
<v Speaker 4>Let's go back to the ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The extinction,</v>

1784
01:40:55.031 --> 01:41:00.031
<v Speaker 4>the loss of species at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>last ice age was about equivalent in </v>

1785
01:41:00.031 --> 01:41:04.801
<v Speaker 4>number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The loss of species of mega mammals was </v>

1786
01:41:04.801 --> 01:41:08.101
<v Speaker 4>about equivalent in number two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number of species of mega mammals </v>

1787
01:41:08.101 --> 01:41:10.540
<v Speaker 4>that still exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so in other words,</v>

1788
01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:15.660
<v Speaker 4>these events that terminated the ice age</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically decimated half of the species </v>

1789
01:41:17.381 --> 01:41:19.240
<v Speaker 4>of of mega mammals on earth.</v>

1790
01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:23.590
<v Speaker 4>Half of the species disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you were going to try to affect an</v>

1791
01:41:23.591 --> 01:41:26.500
<v Speaker 4>equivalent mass extinction of species </v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

1792
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:29.800
<v Speaker 4>you basically have to eliminate every </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal on earth,</v>

1793
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:34.830
<v Speaker 4>over 100 pounds in body weight in order </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get the equivalent of that mass </v>

1794
01:41:35.081 --> 01:41:37.960
<v Speaker 4>extinction episode of 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>13,000</v>

1795
01:41:37.961 --> 01:41:39.400
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

1796
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:41.770
<v Speaker 4>It's insane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's absolutely the truth.</v>

1797
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:46.870
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the official like or mainstream </v>

1798
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:49.240
<v Speaker 4>explanation for this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist.</v>

1799
01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:54.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You brought up the idea of of it's </v>

1800
01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:57.211
<v Speaker 4>called overkill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has been the dominant theory for </v>

1801
01:41:57.211 --> 01:41:59.500
<v Speaker 4>for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that human hunters exterminated</v>

1802
01:41:59.501 --> 01:42:04.501
<v Speaker 4>the wooly mammoth and in some vague way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the extermination of the woolly mammoth </v>

1803
01:42:04.501 --> 01:42:09.031
<v Speaker 4>being at the top of the food chain </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow had a ripple effect down through</v>

1804
01:42:09.401 --> 01:42:14.401
<v Speaker 4>the ranks of species and somehow perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 4>in an unaddressed way resulted in the </v>

1805
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.560
<v Speaker 4>loss of all these other species.</v>

1806
01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:22.560
<v Speaker 4>But theY just don't address that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the more you said that theory is </v>

1807
01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.660
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous and that's an understatement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're talking about,</v>

1808
01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:31.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps bands of few hundred or maybe </v>

1809
01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:33.100
<v Speaker 4>even a thousand individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>migrant bands,</v>

1810
01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:36.780
<v Speaker 4>human hunters coming in and somehow </v>
<v Speaker 4>able.</v>

1811
01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:42.100
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to bear in mind that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>estimates of human population during </v>

1812
01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:45.271
<v Speaker 4>this time globally is less than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>estimates of the population of woolly </v>

1813
01:42:45.271 --> 01:42:49.651
<v Speaker 4>mammoth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But somehow our ancestors were able to </v>

1814
01:42:49.651 --> 01:42:54.361
<v Speaker 4>wipe out 4 million to 10 million woolly </v>
<v Speaker 4>mammoths so fast that they couldn't even</v>

1815
01:42:54.521 --> 01:42:57.520
<v Speaker 4>reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was only like 10 million people</v>

1816
01:42:57.521 --> 01:42:59.680
<v Speaker 4>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's well see,</v>

1817
01:42:59.681 --> 01:43:03.610
<v Speaker 4>that's based upon more or less the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conventional interpretation.</v>

1818
01:43:04.150 --> 01:43:09.150
<v Speaker 4>Now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we've been talking about implies </v>

1819
01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:12.570
<v Speaker 4>opens the door to their possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>there being a lot more people and then </v>

1820
01:43:12.570 --> 01:43:15.010
<v Speaker 4>mass extinction also including a massive</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of human beings as well.</v>

1821
01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:20.260
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there is some interesting evidence </v>

1822
01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.561
<v Speaker 4>emerging now that there perhaps was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>population collapse between what is </v>

1823
01:43:22.561 --> 01:43:23.920
<v Speaker 4>called the clovis culture and the folsom</v>
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

1824
01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:29.460
<v Speaker 4>The clovis culture appears in north </v>
<v Speaker 4>America to be what is believed to have </v>

1825
01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:33.271
<v Speaker 4>been the earliest culture and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a site in New Mexico that was </v>

1826
01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:38.620
<v Speaker 4>the first discovery of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the association of human artifacts,</v>

1827
01:43:38.621 --> 01:43:43.621
<v Speaker 4>meaning spear points and arrowheads and </v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that along with extinct </v>

1828
01:43:43.621 --> 01:43:44.190
<v Speaker 4>mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1829
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:45.430
<v Speaker 4>This is clovis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Mexico.</v>

1830
01:43:45.431 --> 01:43:49.120
<v Speaker 4>It's a very interesting site.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I visited there about six or seven years</v>

1831
01:43:49.121 --> 01:43:50.090
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1832
01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:53.630
<v Speaker 4>in order because I was looking for this </v>
<v Speaker 4>so called black matte layer,</v>

1833
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:57.700
<v Speaker 4>which has now been documented at dozens </v>
<v Speaker 4>of clovis sites around north America.</v>

1834
01:43:57.701 --> 01:44:01.130
<v Speaker 4>And the black mat layer is this unique </v>
<v Speaker 4>layer,</v>

1835
01:44:01.190 --> 01:44:02.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1836
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:07.090
<v Speaker 4>that essentially separates the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pleistocene from the holocene and it's </v>

1837
01:44:07.281 --> 01:44:12.281
<v Speaker 4>full of soot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's full of a radium nano diamonds,</v>

1838
01:44:12.710 --> 01:44:17.710
<v Speaker 4>microsphere olds and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>signature things that are indicative of </v>

1839
01:44:17.710 --> 01:44:18.920
<v Speaker 4>some kind of a cosmic event.</v>

1840
01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:22.160
<v Speaker 4>Is this an image indicative of that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what this is that.</v>

1841
01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of a blurry image,</v>

1842
01:44:23.691 --> 01:44:27.380
<v Speaker 4>but right there you can see it up here </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

1843
01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:29.290
<v Speaker 4>So you can face the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1844
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:32.870
<v Speaker 4>The white strip in the middle shows the </v>
<v Speaker 4>black mat layer.</v>

1845
01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:34.980
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1846
01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:39.440
<v Speaker 4>and what you see below it are the bones </v>
<v Speaker 4>of extinct mammals.</v>

1847
01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:41.870
<v Speaker 4>And what you see a couple of thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>years later,</v>

1848
01:44:41.871 --> 01:44:46.871
<v Speaker 4>his bones of extent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mammals and nowhere above that black </v>

1849
01:44:46.871 --> 01:44:51.821
<v Speaker 4>matte layer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you find the bones of the extinct </v>

1850
01:44:51.821 --> 01:44:51.821
<v Speaker 4>mammals?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is extent?</v>

1851
01:44:51.821 --> 01:44:53.180
<v Speaker 4>It means dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That snow still.</v>

1852
01:44:53.181 --> 01:44:54.440
<v Speaker 4>It's still exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1853
01:44:54.650 --> 01:44:56.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1854
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:59.060
<v Speaker 4>bears are extend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>

1855
01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:01.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the only mammoths are extinct.</v>

1856
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:07.010
<v Speaker 4>So there's a very distinct line that can</v>
<v Speaker 4>be attributed to some sort of an event.</v>

1857
01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of innovate something before </v>

1858
01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:12.220
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all alive,</v>

1859
01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:12.220
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1860
01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:13.100
<v Speaker 4>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all dead.</v>

1861
01:45:13.101 --> 01:45:18.101
<v Speaker 4>They're all dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a massive amount of the larger </v>

1862
01:45:18.101 --> 01:45:19.480
<v Speaker 4>mammals gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wiped off the face of the planet,</v>

1863
01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:24.520
<v Speaker 4>wiped off the face of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>North America lost about 75 percent of </v>

1864
01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.810
<v Speaker 4>its species of mega man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy shit.</v>

1865
01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.710
<v Speaker 4>Three quarters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1866
01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:29.660
<v Speaker 4>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There we go.</v>

1867
01:45:29.661 --> 01:45:34.661
<v Speaker 4>There's some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned that thing below that thing </v>

1868
01:45:34.661 --> 01:45:34.661
<v Speaker 4>below.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that fucking thing?</v>

1869
01:45:34.730 --> 01:45:37.880
<v Speaker 4>That giant ground sloth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That fuCking thing is thE mega theOry.</v>

1870
01:45:37.881 --> 01:45:38.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm american.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1871
01:45:38.851 --> 01:45:41.780
<v Speaker 4>it's the giant ground sloths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the size of an elephant.</v>

1872
01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:46.840
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are the glyptodonts these are all </v>

1873
01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:47.900
<v Speaker 4>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1874
01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:51.470
<v Speaker 4>Not this guide is a dinosaur's obviously</v>
<v Speaker 4>did norris.</v>

1875
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:56.530
<v Speaker 4>Maximus is the giant moa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy threw him in here for rock is </v>

1876
01:45:56.530 --> 01:45:57.460
<v Speaker 4>because he's just such an awesome </v>
<v Speaker 4>preacher.</v>

1877
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:58.400
<v Speaker 4>The terror bird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1878
01:45:58.401 --> 01:46:00.090
<v Speaker 4>It's the terror bird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1879
01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Scroll back up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop scrolling.</v>

1880
01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.410
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that fucking bird.</v>

1881
01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:06.640
<v Speaker 4>That's a seven foot tall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bigger than that with eight.</v>

1882
01:46:06.670 --> 01:46:07.910
<v Speaker 4>Nine foot tall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1883
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.120
<v Speaker 4>A bird that doesn't fly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So essentially a murderous ostrich.</v>

1884
01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:14.090
<v Speaker 4>And this was the top of the food chain </v>
<v Speaker 4>during the miocene.</v>

1885
01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:14.990
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:46:14.991 --> 01:46:16.140
<v Speaker 4>This was it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was the,</v>

1887
01:46:16.190 --> 01:46:16.660
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1888
01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:20.210
<v Speaker 4>the baddest ass predator on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 4>for awhile.</v>

1889
01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:25.240
<v Speaker 4>Really more so than a saber tooth tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These guys existed before the saber </v>

1890
01:46:25.581 --> 01:46:27.020
<v Speaker 4>tooth tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1891
01:46:27.110 --> 01:46:29.810
<v Speaker 4>But they succumbed to one of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>global events.</v>

1892
01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:35.200
<v Speaker 4>You got to bear in mind that if you take</v>
<v Speaker 4>a census of all the species that ever </v>

1893
01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:38.891
<v Speaker 4>existed compared to the species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now it's conservative to say that 99 </v>

1894
01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:46.061
<v Speaker 4>point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine percent of all species have become </v>

1895
01:46:46.061 --> 01:46:46.061
<v Speaker 4>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1896
01:46:46.061 --> 01:46:47.120
<v Speaker 4>And in the ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1897
01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:52.380
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course most of those had went </v>

1898
01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:52.380
<v Speaker 4>extinct without any help from humans at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1899
01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 4>Stops growing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that fucking thing?</v>

1900
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:57.930
<v Speaker 4>That's the last materium siberia come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus christ,</v>

1901
01:46:59.510 --> 01:47:03.210
<v Speaker 4>you begin to appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a bowl that fucked a rhino.</v>

1902
01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:05.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like that.</v>

1903
01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:10.710
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane how big that is.</v>

1904
01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:12.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was huge.</v>

1905
01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:17.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was elephant sized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically a woolly rhinoceros the size </v>

1906
01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:17.730
<v Speaker 4>of an elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is sila donta,</v>

1907
01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:22.731
<v Speaker 4>which is the classic willy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there've been quite a few species of </v>

1908
01:47:22.731 --> 01:47:24.600
<v Speaker 4>these guys found that were flash frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is 12,000</v>

1909
01:47:24.601 --> 01:47:25.980
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This thing existed.</v>

1910
01:47:26.170 --> 01:47:27.570
<v Speaker 4>Wooly rhinoceros.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1911
01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:30.210
<v Speaker 4>And we're in north America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus christ.</v>

1912
01:47:30.211 --> 01:47:32.580
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what is,</v>

1913
01:47:32.730 --> 01:47:36.210
<v Speaker 4>what's the mainstream explanation for </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things going away?</v>

1914
01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.450
<v Speaker 4>Good luck on trying to find one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have looked.</v>

1915
01:47:39.451 --> 01:47:42.150
<v Speaker 4>There iS none.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is nothing.</v>

1916
01:47:42.210 --> 01:47:44.220
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing.</v>

1917
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:49.550
<v Speaker 4>So is this something that they just </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't formed any theories about or </v>

1918
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:54.321
<v Speaker 4>they don't try to or it's been ignored </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's not enough information.</v>

1919
01:47:54.421 --> 01:47:55.800
<v Speaker 4>It's been ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's why.</v>

1920
01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:00.960
<v Speaker 4>At the dawn of earth science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>geological science,</v>

1921
01:48:00.961 --> 01:48:03.990
<v Speaker 4>and early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early 19th century to a man,</v>

1922
01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.630
<v Speaker 4>every one of the founding fathers of </v>
<v Speaker 4>geology,</v>

1923
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:11.780
<v Speaker 4>whether it was william buckland or qva </v>
<v Speaker 4>or sir James Hall or or rodney merchants</v>

1924
01:48:13.191 --> 01:48:15.420
<v Speaker 4>and adam sedgwick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could go right down the line.</v>

1925
01:48:15.450 --> 01:48:17.900
<v Speaker 4>All of these guys from 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 up to about 18,</v>

1926
01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:21.420
<v Speaker 4>60,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every one of them was task surfaced to a</v>

1927
01:48:21.421 --> 01:48:26.421
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone because these were guys </v>

1928
01:48:26.421 --> 01:48:29.120
<v Speaker 4>basically who had not been indoctrinated</v>
<v Speaker 4>into any particular interpretation of </v>

1929
01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:33.981
<v Speaker 4>world history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They went out and they looked at </v>

1930
01:48:33.981 --> 01:48:34.050
<v Speaker 4>evidence in the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In their conclusion was,</v>

1931
01:48:34.150 --> 01:48:39.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something really catastrophic has </v>

1932
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:41.301
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then what happened was you had </v>

1933
01:48:41.301 --> 01:48:45.471
<v Speaker 4>charles lyle play fair and hot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>james hot and these three guys came </v>

1934
01:48:45.471 --> 01:48:50.211
<v Speaker 4>along and basically establish the </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctrine of uniformitarianism is.</v>

1935
01:48:50.491 --> 01:48:52.950
<v Speaker 4>It's called a mouthful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1936
01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.770
<v Speaker 4>And basically the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>uniformitarianism was this,</v>

1937
01:48:56.100 --> 01:49:01.000
<v Speaker 4>is that we look at modern processes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>explain ancient process.</v>

1938
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:04.980
<v Speaker 4>So if we see a river eroding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's bank moving sediment,</v>

1939
01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:10.130
<v Speaker 4>creating a sandbar with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we see like during the early 19th </v>

1940
01:49:10.130 --> 01:49:14.751
<v Speaker 4>century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were in the last phase of the little </v>

1941
01:49:14.751 --> 01:49:15.360
<v Speaker 4>ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so glaciers were receding and these guys</v>

1942
01:49:15.361 --> 01:49:19.260
<v Speaker 4>could essentially go up there and look </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a year to year basis and see what was</v>

1943
01:49:19.261 --> 01:49:21.270
<v Speaker 4>happening as the glaciers were receding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1944
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:26.750
<v Speaker 4>So Basically what they then did was </v>
<v Speaker 4>extrapolated from modern processes to </v>

1945
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:28.830
<v Speaker 4>try to explain all the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 4>processes.</v>

1946
01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.620
<v Speaker 4>This is the doctrine of </v>
<v Speaker 4>uniformitarianism.</v>

1947
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:36.830
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very powerful model for </v>

1948
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:39.321
<v Speaker 4>understanding ancient change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However it became ensconced as dogma so </v>

1949
01:49:40.501 --> 01:49:43.980
<v Speaker 4>that by the turn of the century as we </v>
<v Speaker 4>come right up to the,</v>

1950
01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:48.460
<v Speaker 4>to the threshold of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was now considered</v>

1951
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:53.520
<v Speaker 3>unscientific to try to explain anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the past that we couldn't see </v>

1952
01:49:53.891 --> 01:49:55.900
<v Speaker 3>happening today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1953
01:49:56.410 --> 01:50:00.550
<v Speaker 3>So as we go into the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this gradual,</v>

1954
01:50:00.551 --> 01:50:05.551
<v Speaker 3>as dogma became ensconced in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in every geologist,</v>

1955
01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:10.740
<v Speaker 3>from about 1900 up to about 1980 was </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoroughly indoctrinated into this idea </v>

1956
01:50:13.031 --> 01:50:18.031
<v Speaker 3>of the gradualism that all of the earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>change that we see going on on the </v>

1957
01:50:18.031 --> 01:50:19.600
<v Speaker 3>planet today has occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One grain of sand,</v>

1958
01:50:20.110 --> 01:50:25.110
<v Speaker 3>one drop of water at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was considered to be very </v>

1959
01:50:25.110 --> 01:50:29.070
<v Speaker 3>unscientific to begin to evoke things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because initially some of the founding </v>

1960
01:50:30.761 --> 01:50:33.710
<v Speaker 3>fathers of geology were a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interestingly,</v>

1961
01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:38.720
<v Speaker 3>we were theologians who oftentimes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of like adam sedgwick is a good </v>

1962
01:50:38.771 --> 01:50:41.180
<v Speaker 3>example of somebody who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a traveling theologian,</v>

1963
01:50:41.181 --> 01:50:42.640
<v Speaker 3>a traveling minister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1964
01:50:43.090 --> 01:50:48.090
<v Speaker 3>He was traveling around england and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was seeing things like the team's river </v>

1965
01:50:48.090 --> 01:50:51.781
<v Speaker 3>valley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was seeing that the tims flowed </v>

1966
01:50:51.781 --> 01:50:54.781
<v Speaker 3>in this gigantic channel that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely outsized relative to the </v>

1967
01:50:54.781 --> 01:50:55.960
<v Speaker 3>river that was flowing in it.</v>

1968
01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:00.490
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that must've been a huge flood wall.</v>

1969
01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:01.870
<v Speaker 3>He was a theologian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1970
01:51:01.871 --> 01:51:03.120
<v Speaker 3>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1971
01:51:03.250 --> 01:51:04.480
<v Speaker 3>his flood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1972
01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:06.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as it turns out,</v>

1973
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:12.510
<v Speaker 3>there are enormous jus morphic effects </v>
<v Speaker 3>of gigantic floods all over the planet.</v>

1974
01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that now,</v>

1975
01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:20.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the 18 hundreds,</v>

1976
01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:24.550
<v Speaker 3>they assumed that if you saw effects of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic floods,</v>

1977
01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:27.250
<v Speaker 3>it had to have been noah's flood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1978
01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:31.870
<v Speaker 3>at the same time that you had geological</v>
<v Speaker 3>gradualism on the ascent,</v>

1979
01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:35.600
<v Speaker 3>jeal a biological gradualism came along </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the form of,</v>

1980
01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:40.620
<v Speaker 3>of darwinism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the two sort of complimented each </v>

1981
01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:40.620
<v Speaker 3>other in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1982
01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:41.530
<v Speaker 3>in mutually supported each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1983
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:44.170
<v Speaker 3>if we've got infinite time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1984
01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:49.260
<v Speaker 3>millions and millions of years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gradual geological change now that </v>

1985
01:51:49.511 --> 01:51:53.230
<v Speaker 3>allows us millions and millions of years</v>
<v Speaker 3>for gradual biological change.</v>

1986
01:51:53.590 --> 01:51:56.410
<v Speaker 3>And these two paradigms were mutually </v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforcing.</v>

1987
01:51:56.830 --> 01:52:01.420
<v Speaker 3>So now we come to the 20th century and </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the first three quarters of the 20th</v>

1988
01:52:01.421 --> 01:52:06.421
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the dogma that was </v>

1989
01:52:06.421 --> 01:52:08.260
<v Speaker 3>indoctrinated into the minds of every </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth scientists.</v>

1990
01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:13.500
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to vary from that was to be pseudo </v>

1991
01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:16.131
<v Speaker 3>scientific and you're trying to revert </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to biblical fundamentalism if you </v>

1992
01:52:16.131 --> 01:52:18.700
<v Speaker 3>start talking about giant floods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1993
01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened was,</v>

1994
01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:23.230
<v Speaker 3>and it was left to people like emmanuel </v>
<v Speaker 3>volokhonsky.</v>

1995
01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:28.410
<v Speaker 3>It was not a neuroscientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a psychoanalyst and he wrote </v>

1996
01:52:28.410 --> 01:52:31.351
<v Speaker 3>several books in the mid 19 fifties </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he had gathered together in one </v>

1997
01:52:31.351 --> 01:52:35.851
<v Speaker 3>place all of this anomalous evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the earth history that did not fit </v>

1998
01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:38.500
<v Speaker 3>the uniformitarian paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1999
01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:43.320
<v Speaker 3>his books were popular successes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mainstream science just slammed him,</v>

2000
01:52:43.570 --> 01:52:45.680
<v Speaker 3>slammed him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's a nutcase.</v>

2001
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2002
01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:52.120
<v Speaker 3>he did make some serious missteps in </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to explain this anomalous </v>

2003
01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:56.980
<v Speaker 3>geological evidence for catastrophe and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was those missteps that they were </v>

2004
01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:58.130
<v Speaker 3>able to focus on to try to discredit </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2005
01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:03.580
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amassing of evidence for </v>

2006
01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:03.580
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes in earth history has held </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2007
01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:03.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2008
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:08.750
<v Speaker 3>the test of time and and what we see as </v>
<v Speaker 3>1980 was a pivotal year.</v>

2009
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:13.870
<v Speaker 3>That was a year that three separate </v>
<v Speaker 3>teams published evidence showing that </v>

2010
01:53:16.041 --> 01:53:21.041
<v Speaker 3>the cretaceous tertiary boundary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dinosaur boundary was profoundly </v>

2011
01:53:21.041 --> 01:53:24.851
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that opened the door to begin a </v>

2012
01:53:24.851 --> 01:53:26.600
<v Speaker 3>reconsideration of earth history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2013
01:53:26.630 --> 01:53:30.680
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the advent of the space program,</v>

2014
01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:35.990
<v Speaker 3>we are beginning to realize that near </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth space is not a completely empty </v>

2015
01:53:36.501 --> 01:53:41.501
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually densely populated by all </v>

2016
01:53:41.501 --> 01:53:41.501
<v Speaker 3>kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2017
01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:45.980
<v Speaker 3>prior to the apollo moon program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was believed that most of the craters</v>

2018
01:53:45.981 --> 01:53:47.750
<v Speaker 3>on the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not all of the craters on the moon,</v>

2019
01:53:47.751 --> 01:53:52.751
<v Speaker 3>where volcanic right post apollo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The realization was that no,</v>

2020
01:53:53.211 --> 01:53:57.050
<v Speaker 3>they're not volcanic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There impacts of things from space c.</v>

2021
01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Now you're looking at the surface of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moon and I think I'm the last image on </v>

2022
01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:06.740
<v Speaker 3>the joe rogan images.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is going to be a picture of the </v>

2023
01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:10.301
<v Speaker 3>moon and you'll see that it's littered </v>
<v Speaker 3>littered thousands and thousands and </v>

2024
01:54:10.431 --> 01:54:11.210
<v Speaker 3>thousands of craig</v>

2025
01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:16.280
<v Speaker 1>and because it doesn't have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere because it doesn't have </v>

2026
01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:16.350
<v Speaker 1>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can actually see we can't explain.</v>

2027
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:17.100
<v Speaker 1>It's happened</v>

2028
01:54:17.190 --> 01:54:22.190
<v Speaker 3>and the point joe is this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we were unable to strip away the </v>

2029
01:54:22.190 --> 01:54:24.480
<v Speaker 3>biosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thick layers of sedimentary rocks,</v>

2030
01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:27.510
<v Speaker 3>the oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth would look like the moon.</v>

2031
01:54:27.710 --> 01:54:30.860
<v Speaker 1>God damn it would look like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>

2032
01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:35.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's simply a matter of time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that we really,</v>

2033
01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:39.560
<v Speaker 1>well thank thankfully these people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that are paying attention tests,</v>

2034
01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:44.920
<v Speaker 1>but we with the amount of time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been videotaping things and </v>

2035
01:54:46.131 --> 01:54:49.580
<v Speaker 1>writing books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tiny little window that just hasn't</v>

2036
01:54:49.581 --> 01:54:54.581
<v Speaker 1>been enough time to really get a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>account of how often this takes place </v>

2037
01:54:54.581 --> 01:54:56.570
<v Speaker 1>because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that amount of time,</v>

2038
01:54:56.571 --> 01:54:59.690
<v Speaker 1>although it's a grand amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to our lives,</v>

2039
01:55:00.170 --> 01:55:03.140
<v Speaker 1>the life of an individual for the life </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the planet,</v>

2040
01:55:03.150 --> 01:55:05.570
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a perspective issue,</v>

2041
01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:06.530
<v Speaker 3>the perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2042
01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.270
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2043
01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:13.980
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is one reason why I'm an </v>

2044
01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:16.331
<v Speaker 3>advocate for moving forward and </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially becoming a cosmic </v>

2045
01:55:16.761 --> 01:55:18.650
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

2046
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I came of age during the heyday of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mercury and gemini,</v>

2047
01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:25.750
<v Speaker 3>gemini and apollo programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2048
01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.530
<v Speaker 3>that was the one thing when I looked </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and I go,</v>

2049
01:55:27.531 --> 01:55:28.070
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2050
01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:33.130
<v Speaker 3>One of the last times that I was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>proud of my country was when we put </v>

2051
01:55:33.130 --> 01:55:33.680
<v Speaker 3>those men on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2052
01:55:33.710 --> 01:55:35.960
<v Speaker 3>when we planted our aMerican flag on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moon,</v>

2053
01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:39.410
<v Speaker 3>and I really believe back in 1969,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1970,</v>

2054
01:55:39.411 --> 01:55:42.800
<v Speaker 3>that we were america's destiny was to </v>
<v Speaker 3>move the human</v>

2055
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.150
<v Speaker 4>into this grander cosmic environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then of course,</v>

2056
01:55:48.210 --> 01:55:53.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Vietnam war came along and other </v>

2057
01:55:53.210 --> 01:55:55.281
<v Speaker 4>priorities and money got shifted in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nixon administration shifted huge </v>

2058
01:55:55.281 --> 01:55:56.610
<v Speaker 4>amounts of money away from the space </v>
<v Speaker 4>program.</v>

2059
01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:01.940
<v Speaker 4>The timetable that was set out that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were going to have a permanent lunar </v>

2060
01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:05.931
<v Speaker 4>base by the end of the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first manned mission to mars before the </v>

2061
01:56:05.931 --> 01:56:10.280
<v Speaker 4>eighties was over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps a independently self-supporting </v>

2062
01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:14.240
<v Speaker 4>colonies in space by the year 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember I was a junior in high school </v>

2063
01:56:15.151 --> 01:56:18.840
<v Speaker 4>when a kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey </v>
<v Speaker 4>came out.</v>

2064
01:56:18.841 --> 01:56:19.890
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2065
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:21.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen,</v>

2066
01:56:21.871 --> 01:56:23.640
<v Speaker 4>68.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody had any.</v>

2067
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:27.030
<v Speaker 4>It was no stretch of the imagination to </v>
<v Speaker 4>assumed that by 2001.</v>

2068
01:56:27.031 --> 01:56:32.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were going to be orbiting hotels </v>

2069
01:56:32.031 --> 01:56:32.031
<v Speaker 4>in space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>RIght.</v>

2070
01:56:32.031 --> 01:56:34.350
<v Speaker 4>That could have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we lost our vision.</v>

2071
01:56:34.351 --> 01:56:38.660
<v Speaker 4>We lost our will and we just got </v>
<v Speaker 4>sidetracked.</v>

2072
01:56:38.710 --> 01:56:40.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm remembering the seventies talking to</v>

2073
01:56:40.711 --> 01:56:43.260
<v Speaker 4>people about the potential of colonizing</v>
<v Speaker 4>space,</v>

2074
01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:48.320
<v Speaker 4>using the materials and resources found </v>
<v Speaker 4>in space and that the knee jerk response</v>

2075
01:56:50.101 --> 01:56:51.540
<v Speaker 4>I always got was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2076
01:56:51.930 --> 01:56:53.790
<v Speaker 4>we've got too many problems here on </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>

2077
01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:56.970
<v Speaker 4>We got to solve those problems first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2078
01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:58.920
<v Speaker 4>my response to that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2079
01:56:58.921 --> 01:57:02.610
<v Speaker 4>good luck because you're basically </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about altering human nature,</v>

2080
01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:07.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's going to take something more </v>

2081
01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:08.190
<v Speaker 4>than just some policy to alter human </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>

2082
01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:13.410
<v Speaker 4>What it's going to take is some serious </v>
<v Speaker 4>a consciousness excursions,</v>

2083
01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:17.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps people going into space.</v>

2084
01:57:17.190 --> 01:57:19.620
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we had these astronauts.</v>

2085
01:57:19.621 --> 01:57:24.621
<v Speaker 4>I met edgar mitchell years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a a mace and he came to my lodge </v>

2086
01:57:24.621 --> 01:57:24.900
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>edgar mitchell,</v>

2087
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:30.470
<v Speaker 4>who was one of the astronauts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was one of the many astronauts that </v>

2088
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:31.600
<v Speaker 4>went into space and like as in free </v>
<v Speaker 4>mason as in freemasons,</v>

2089
01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.360
<v Speaker 4>everybody freaks out and you say </v>
<v Speaker 4>freemasons,</v>

2090
01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.510
<v Speaker 4>illuminati,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black helicopter nonsense,</v>

2091
01:57:36.511 --> 01:57:41.511
<v Speaker 4>and we should have a whole session just </v>
<v Speaker 4>to deal with that ridiculous nonsense </v>

2092
01:57:41.511 --> 01:57:43.290
<v Speaker 4>next time you freaked me out about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2093
01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:46.580
<v Speaker 4>So edgar mitchell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you met him,</v>

2094
01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:47.940
<v Speaker 4>was he talking about aliens?</v>

2095
01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:48.540
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2096
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:49.520
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2097
01:57:49.590 --> 01:57:52.140
<v Speaker 4>He was talking about going into space </v>
<v Speaker 4>and seeing god.</v>

2098
01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazier than aliens.</v>

2099
01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:55.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazier than the aliens.</v>

2100
01:57:55.471 --> 01:57:57.720
<v Speaker 4>Has god made aliens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps.</v>

2101
01:57:58.170 --> 01:58:01.020
<v Speaker 4>So he saw god in the sense that he got a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

2102
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:05.130
<v Speaker 4>It means without even saying god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got a sense of the,</v>

2103
01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.090
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2104
01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:09.760
<v Speaker 4>the grandness grand universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2105
01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:11.160
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yes.</v>

2106
01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:12.450
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2107
01:58:12.451 --> 01:58:17.451
<v Speaker 4>the potential role of humans in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever been to the keck </v>

2108
01:58:17.451 --> 01:58:17.610
<v Speaker 4>observatory in Hawaii?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2109
01:58:17.611 --> 01:58:20.040
<v Speaker 4>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The keck observatory in Hawaii is a very</v>

2110
01:58:20.041 --> 01:58:25.041
<v Speaker 4>unique place because it's on the big </v>
<v Speaker 4>island of Hawaii and it's very high up </v>

2111
01:58:25.041 --> 01:58:25.950
<v Speaker 4>in an altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you get up there,</v>

2112
01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:29.130
<v Speaker 4>you actually drive through the clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took my family,</v>

2113
01:58:29.131 --> 01:58:32.110
<v Speaker 4>there are several years ago and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were bummed out when I was like,</v>

2114
01:58:32.111 --> 01:58:33.210
<v Speaker 4>god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So clowning,</v>

2115
01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:38.480
<v Speaker 4>we're not gonna be able to see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you pop through the clouds as </v>

2116
01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:41.691
<v Speaker 4>you continue to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the view is magnificent and in is</v>

2117
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:45.640
<v Speaker 1>to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most intense experiences,</v>

2118
01:58:45.970 --> 01:58:48.700
<v Speaker 1>consciousness expanding experiences I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever had.</v>

2119
01:58:48.701 --> 01:58:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I believe it without drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2120
01:58:50.621 --> 01:58:53.860
<v Speaker 1>it was like a psychedelic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really was because the,</v>

2121
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:56.200
<v Speaker 1>the amount of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the keck observatory.</v>

2122
01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:59.680
<v Speaker 1>See how it's above the clouds when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a daytime shot.</v>

2123
01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:01.540
<v Speaker 1>See jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he could pull up at nighttime,</v>

2124
01:59:01.570 --> 01:59:05.950
<v Speaker 1>nighttime shot because they set the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera aperture to capture the.</v>

2125
01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a regular camera I couldn't have.</v>

2126
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't really capture the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual stars themselves.</v>

2127
01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:14.290
<v Speaker 1>But you see the milky way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2128
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:16.270
<v Speaker 1>not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way more intense than that.</v>

2129
01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:19.810
<v Speaker 1>You see the milky way in its full form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>

2130
01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:21.010
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2131
01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2132
01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:25.190
<v Speaker 1>it's so shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2133
01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:29.380
<v Speaker 1>you're immediately forced to accept the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality that we're in space,</v>

2134
01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:34.560
<v Speaker 1>whereas it's so easy to deny when all </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see is the moon and a couple of </v>

2135
01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:34.560
<v Speaker 1>little dots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever,</v>

2136
01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:35.110
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in hollywood,</v>

2137
01:59:35.111 --> 01:59:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I got to go to work and you drive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get.</v>

2138
01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:38.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2139
01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:39.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2140
01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:40.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2141
01:59:40.710 --> 01:59:43.690
<v Speaker 1>that's just a photograph and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2142
01:59:43.691 --> 01:59:46.840
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's some doctor and going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on because I don't know what those lines</v>

2143
01:59:46.841 --> 01:59:50.470
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's insane how intense it is.</v>

2144
01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:52.910
<v Speaker 1>It's insane and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2145
01:59:53.130 --> 01:59:56.170
<v Speaker 1>it's right above you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right above us all the time.</v>

2146
01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:58.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about the high desert</v>
<v Speaker 1>plateaus.</v>

2147
01:59:58.870 --> 02:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>You've got this dry atmosphere and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like literally you can almost reach out </v>

2148
02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:04.780
<v Speaker 1>and touch the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're talking about.</v>

2149
02:00:05.110 --> 02:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>You've never been to la before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is your first trip to la because </v>

2150
02:00:10.110 --> 02:00:13.381
<v Speaker 1>when you're in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go to the mojave and stare at </v>

2151
02:00:13.381 --> 02:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>space space and I stare at the rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rocks below my feet and the stars </v>

2152
02:00:16.361 --> 02:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>over my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2153
02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:20.950
<v Speaker 1>How dId you get involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration of all this stuff?</v>

2154
02:00:21.730 --> 02:00:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2155
02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>I guess I better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to come out of the closet,</v>

2156
02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:29.380
<v Speaker 1>like I did a little too many drugs back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sixties.</v>

2157
02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he did the right amount.</v>

2158
02:00:31.110 --> 02:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're being hard on yourself.</v>

2159
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

2160
02:00:34.770 --> 02:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm in 1969,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so of course I wish I was raised in </v>

2161
02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:44.131
<v Speaker 1>rural Minnesota and where we grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived on the shores of a puddle of </v>

2162
02:00:44.131 --> 02:00:46.480
<v Speaker 1>meltwater puddle leftover from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>receding of the glaciers.</v>

2163
02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:47.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call it a puddle.</v>

2164
02:00:47.801 --> 02:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it a puddle.</v>

2165
02:00:48.971 --> 02:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>It was three quarters of a mile long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

2166
02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota,</v>

2167
02:00:51.701 --> 02:00:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin has got what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25,000</v>

2168
02:00:53.741 --> 02:00:58.741
<v Speaker 1>lakes and every one of them is leftover </v>
<v Speaker 1>meltwater puddles from the recession of </v>

2169
02:00:58.741 --> 02:01:03.031
<v Speaker 1>the glacier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can still remember being like six </v>

2170
02:01:03.031 --> 02:01:03.031
<v Speaker 1>or seven years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my dad telling me,</v>

2171
02:01:03.031 --> 02:01:03.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once upon a time,</v>

2172
02:01:03.941 --> 02:01:07.150
<v Speaker 1>this was thousands of feet under the ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how this.</v>

2173
02:01:07.151 --> 02:01:10.120
<v Speaker 1>We had land on the edge of this lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2174
02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>as a kid I used to sit in my backyard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fish for sunfish and crappies and </v>

2175
02:01:16.421 --> 02:01:21.421
<v Speaker 1>bulkheads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I don't understand that </v>

2176
02:01:21.421 --> 02:01:21.421
<v Speaker 1>interrupt for just one second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck does that happen?</v>

2177
02:01:21.421 --> 02:01:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Were 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

2178
02:01:22.631 --> 02:01:25.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a glacier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten thousand years later.</v>

2179
02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>There's fish in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck are the fish coming from?</v>

2180
02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were there.</v>

2181
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:32.680
<v Speaker 1>But how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the large mouth bass come from?</v>

2182
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this with the lake trout and the </v>

2183
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>great lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck did they come from?</v>

2184
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>If if 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

2185
02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>That</v>

2186
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:41.090
<v Speaker 4>was frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Solid.</v>

2187
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:42.080
<v Speaker 4>Frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Solid.</v>

2188
02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:46.970
<v Speaker 4>Where the fuck the lake trout come from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll have to get to work on that joe,</v>

2189
02:01:47.070 --> 02:01:49.250
<v Speaker 4>because I don't know the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to know man.</v>

2190
02:01:49.251 --> 02:01:51.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about northern pike?</v>

2191
02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:54.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean northern pike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go to saskatchewan.</v>

2192
02:01:54.190 --> 02:01:59.190
<v Speaker 4>People fly in from all over the world to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go fishing up there because they have </v>

2193
02:01:59.190 --> 02:02:01.610
<v Speaker 4>this massive population of beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 4>northern pike.</v>

2194
02:02:01.611 --> 02:02:04.220
<v Speaker 4>These big that was frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2195
02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:08.480
<v Speaker 4>Saskatchewan was a mile of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck man?</v>

2196
02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:11.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't even make sense.</v>

2197
02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:13.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you saw this.</v>

2198
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:18.370
<v Speaker 4>So you were a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a kid growing up with that </v>

2199
02:02:18.370 --> 02:02:18.370
<v Speaker 4>landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I got fascinated by it,</v>

2200
02:02:18.370 --> 02:02:22.991
<v Speaker 4>but in 1969 I went to a rock on outdoor </v>
<v Speaker 4>rock concert that was at an airport </v>

2201
02:02:24.171 --> 02:02:26.810
<v Speaker 4>called eden prairie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's in the.</v>

2202
02:02:26.811 --> 02:02:29.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm just outside of the twin cities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>minneapolis,</v>

2203
02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.250
<v Speaker 4>and it's on a series of bluffs that </v>
<v Speaker 4>overlooks the Minnesota river valley.</v>

2204
02:02:34.490 --> 02:02:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2205
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:40.510
<v Speaker 4>of course I'm stoned out of my gourd and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was taking a break from the music and </v>

2206
02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:45.440
<v Speaker 4>the ladies and everything and I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and was standing on this bluff,</v>

2207
02:02:45.730 --> 02:02:47.390
<v Speaker 4>andy and jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you would pull up.</v>

2208
02:02:47.391 --> 02:02:50.270
<v Speaker 4>I think it's near the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pictures I brought for joe.</v>

2209
02:02:50.271 --> 02:02:55.271
<v Speaker 4>I have a beautiful example of scale </v>
<v Speaker 4>invariance and this is going to be </v>

2210
02:02:55.271 --> 02:02:56.870
<v Speaker 4>similar to what I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2211
02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:59.000
<v Speaker 4>and when you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2212
02:02:59.870 --> 02:03:02.900
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like the 25 images that's labeled</v>

2213
02:03:02.901 --> 02:03:06.500
<v Speaker 4>for joe picture though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll be towards the end.</v>

2214
02:03:06.501 --> 02:03:10.730
<v Speaker 4>It's a picture of the snake river.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find it.</v>

2215
02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:12.680
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The snake river.</v>

2216
02:03:12.681 --> 02:03:17.681
<v Speaker 4>Wait till you see this joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>now this is an example of scale </v>

2217
02:03:17.681 --> 02:03:17.681
<v Speaker 4>invariance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what that means is that,</v>

2218
02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:18.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2219
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>now look at this,</v>

2220
02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:25.810
<v Speaker 4>what you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where can folks that are just listening </v>

2221
02:03:25.810 --> 02:03:26.730
<v Speaker 4>to this go and see these images is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2222
02:03:26.810 --> 02:03:28.440
<v Speaker 4>Are they on your website?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2223
02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:31.100
<v Speaker 4>I think this one is on my website.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2224
02:03:31.101 --> 02:03:36.101
<v Speaker 4>I think this one's on the snake river.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the snake river scale and </v>

2225
02:03:36.101 --> 02:03:37.970
<v Speaker 4>variance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning that the river at the bottom,</v>

2226
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.000
<v Speaker 4>obviously you see the lines all around </v>
<v Speaker 4>it where it indicates that there was a </v>

2227
02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:43.850
<v Speaker 4>much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much larger body of water.</v>

2228
02:03:43.851 --> 02:03:45.110
<v Speaker 4>One point much better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

2229
02:03:45.650 --> 02:03:49.550
<v Speaker 4>the modern snake river is about 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>cubic feet per second,</v>

2230
02:03:49.970 --> 02:03:54.970
<v Speaker 4>right at the end of the last ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the river here was about 30 to 40 </v>

2231
02:03:56.090 --> 02:04:01.090
<v Speaker 4>million cubic feet per second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So wAs that because of the melting </v>

2232
02:04:01.090 --> 02:04:04.121
<v Speaker 4>glaciers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the force of this particular was not </v>

2233
02:04:04.121 --> 02:04:08.081
<v Speaker 4>directly fed by the melting glaciers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the result of the catastrophic </v>

2234
02:04:08.081 --> 02:04:12.461
<v Speaker 4>overflow of lake bonneville,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was the result of massive,</v>

2235
02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:17.770
<v Speaker 4>prolonged torrential rainfall that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>drowned all the deserts of the southern,</v>

2236
02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:21.800
<v Speaker 4>of the western and southwestern United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>

2237
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:25.910
<v Speaker 4>And there was an overflow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a spillway out of the lake,</v>

2238
02:04:25.911 --> 02:04:30.911
<v Speaker 4>bonneville basin in northern Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's spilled over into the snake </v>

2239
02:04:30.911 --> 02:04:35.891
<v Speaker 4>river plain of Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty to 40 million cubic feet per </v>

2240
02:04:35.891 --> 02:04:37.830
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cut this channel.</v>

2241
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:43.280
<v Speaker 4>Now you'll notice that the modern snake </v>
<v Speaker 4>river occupies a small channel within </v>

2242
02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:46.701
<v Speaker 4>the big channel that scale invariance </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the big river,</v>

2243
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:52.930
<v Speaker 4>would have been about equivalent to six </v>
<v Speaker 4>to 700 of the modern snake rivers.</v>

2244
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:58.040
<v Speaker 4>And what you're seeing here is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>example of scale invariance say that the</v>

2245
02:04:58.060 --> 02:05:01.350
<v Speaker 4>little is superimposed upon this big </v>
<v Speaker 4>sea.</v>

2246
02:05:01.650 --> 02:05:06.650
<v Speaker 4>Now in 1969,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was standing on a bluff overlooking </v>

2247
02:05:06.650 --> 02:05:09.090
<v Speaker 4>the Minnesota river valley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>similar to this,</v>

2248
02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:14.240
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking down at the little Minnesota </v>

2249
02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:15.630
<v Speaker 4>ribbon of the Minnesota river and seeing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in this huge channel.</v>

2250
02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:21.360
<v Speaker 4>And I had an aha moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had an aha moment and I realized I saw</v>

2251
02:05:21.361 --> 02:05:26.361
<v Speaker 4>then that this channel that this bluff I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was standing on had once been the bank </v>

2252
02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:33.080
<v Speaker 4>of a gigantic river,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of times bigger than the </v>

2253
02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:33.080
<v Speaker 4>modern Minnesota river.</v>

2254
02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:38.030
<v Speaker 4>But I didn't know it rationally in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense that it took me another 10 or 15 </v>

2255
02:05:38.221 --> 02:05:41.850
<v Speaker 4>years of study and research before I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could go back and say,</v>

2256
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:44.820
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what my initial instinct,</v>

2257
02:05:45.150 --> 02:05:50.150
<v Speaker 4>looking out and seeing this matching set</v>
<v Speaker 4>of bluffs for five miles on the other </v>

2258
02:05:50.150 --> 02:05:54.981
<v Speaker 4>side and seeing this small version of it</v>
<v Speaker 4>into modern river that I was right.</v>

2259
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:58.380
<v Speaker 4>That I remember one time in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>eighties,</v>

2260
02:05:58.381 --> 02:06:03.381
<v Speaker 4>I was giving a talk on that and I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a geologist in the audience </v>

2261
02:06:03.381 --> 02:06:04.950
<v Speaker 4>and he got up and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2262
02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:05.270
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2263
02:06:05.271 --> 02:06:05.600
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2264
02:06:05.601 --> 02:06:05.970
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2265
02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:07.920
<v Speaker 4>That big channel that was millions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

2266
02:06:07.921 --> 02:06:10.050
<v Speaker 4>millions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took for that channel to form.</v>

2267
02:06:10.051 --> 02:06:11.250
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2268
02:06:11.251 --> 02:06:15.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what happened was,</v>

2269
02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:17.400
<v Speaker 4>is by him challenging me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really,</v>

2270
02:06:17.401 --> 02:06:17.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2271
02:06:17.881 --> 02:06:18.750
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2272
02:06:18.751 --> 02:06:19.480
<v Speaker 4>like an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an,</v>

2273
02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:22.140
<v Speaker 4>an mma fighter getting challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>

2274
02:06:22.141 --> 02:06:23.340
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take you on,</v>

2275
02:06:23.341 --> 02:06:28.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I rose to the occasion and I spent </v>

2276
02:06:28.341 --> 02:06:32.090
<v Speaker 4>literally years doing research on </v>
<v Speaker 4>glacial geomorphology on paleo </v>

2277
02:06:32.731 --> 02:06:34.080
<v Speaker 4>hydrology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course,</v>

2278
02:06:34.081 --> 02:06:35.490
<v Speaker 4>at the end of the thing I knew that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

2279
02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:37.980
<v Speaker 4>My instincts were absolutely correct </v>
<v Speaker 4>that yes,</v>

2280
02:06:37.981 --> 02:06:41.250
<v Speaker 4>now there is solid scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>documentable,</v>

2281
02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:46.340
<v Speaker 4>verifiable evidence that this whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>channel of the Minnesota river valley </v>

2282
02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:51.170
<v Speaker 4>was filled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brim full with water at the end of the </v>

2283
02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:51.170
<v Speaker 4>lesson,</v>

2284
02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:52.080
<v Speaker 1>so when he was saying it was millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

2285
02:06:52.090 --> 02:06:57.090
<v Speaker 1>he's saying that same exact channel of </v>
<v Speaker 1>water had never varied and that it had </v>

2286
02:06:57.271 --> 02:07:01.200
<v Speaker 1>just cut through over millions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years very slowly,</v>

2287
02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>but does that sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem rational because of </v>

2288
02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>the width.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2289
02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:06.870
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to.</v>

2290
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:08.910
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make.</v>

2291
02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:12.240
<v Speaker 1>So this goes along with what you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier,</v>

2292
02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:17.480
<v Speaker 1>that the idea that the ideas of science </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that everything had taken place </v>

2293
02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:20.130
<v Speaker 1>much like evolution on a very gradual </v>
<v Speaker 1>pace.</v>

2294
02:07:20.190 --> 02:07:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this the grand canyon as well?</v>

2295
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:24.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

2296
02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I would saY about the grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>canyon.</v>

2297
02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I think that the grand canyon is </v>
<v Speaker 1>presently.</v>

2298
02:07:29.941 --> 02:07:34.941
<v Speaker 1>we can observe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can observe the Colorado rIver </v>

2299
02:07:34.941 --> 02:07:34.980
<v Speaker 1>eroding the grand canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

2300
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.550
<v Speaker 4>I think that the erosion of the grand </v>
<v Speaker 4>canyon is not uniform.</v>

2301
02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:44.580
<v Speaker 4>It's episodic or which means that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grand canyon has probably been there </v>

2302
02:07:45.131 --> 02:07:48.340
<v Speaker 4>between two and 5 million years because </v>
<v Speaker 4>for one thing,</v>

2303
02:07:48.370 --> 02:07:52.750
<v Speaker 4>the grand canyon wouldn't start eroding </v>
<v Speaker 4>until the Colorado plateau had lifted up</v>

2304
02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:58.200
<v Speaker 4>and 10 to 12 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rim rock of collar of the Colorado </v>

2305
02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:02.401
<v Speaker 4>plateau is limestone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which implies a shallow marine </v>

2306
02:08:02.401 --> 02:08:06.750
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now when it's down at marine at </v>

2307
02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:08.050
<v Speaker 4>sea level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to road.</v>

2308
02:08:08.590 --> 02:08:13.590
<v Speaker 4>It's not until the whole plateau lifts </v>
<v Speaker 4>up between five and 10 million years ago</v>

2309
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:18.990
<v Speaker 4>that the downCutting can start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my takE On the grand canyon would be </v>

2310
02:08:20.561 --> 02:08:22.960
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens is is we have.</v>

2311
02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:25.300
<v Speaker 4>You have to understand this now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

2312
02:08:25.301 --> 02:08:29.170
<v Speaker 4>this is I think now is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the merging emerging paradigm.</v>

2313
02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:34.620
<v Speaker 4>There are two modes of change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The gradualist mode that we've seen </v>

2314
02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:38.850
<v Speaker 4>dominating through know the last few </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred years at least sInce the advent </v>

2315
02:08:38.850 --> 02:08:42.961
<v Speaker 4>of modern science and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to call it the catastrophic </v>

2316
02:08:42.961 --> 02:08:44.650
<v Speaker 4>mode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where is much change.</v>

2317
02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:49.650
<v Speaker 4>It's compressed into a few years or </v>
<v Speaker 4>months or sometimes even days or weeks </v>

2318
02:08:50.110 --> 02:08:52.930
<v Speaker 4>as normally would take thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years.</v>

2319
02:08:53.590 --> 02:08:58.590
<v Speaker 4>When I look at the grand canyon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm seeing there is episodes of </v>

2320
02:08:58.590 --> 02:09:02.581
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic erosion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably stretching back over two and a </v>

2321
02:09:02.581 --> 02:09:06.211
<v Speaker 4>half million years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember I said the pleistocene was </v>

2322
02:09:06.211 --> 02:09:09.121
<v Speaker 4>about two and a half million years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What characterizes the pleistocene from </v>

2323
02:09:09.191 --> 02:09:14.191
<v Speaker 4>the previous plyo scene is this </v>
<v Speaker 4>alternating succession of glacial and </v>

2324
02:09:14.191 --> 02:09:18.781
<v Speaker 4>interglacial ages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This swinging back and forth between </v>

2325
02:09:18.781 --> 02:09:21.721
<v Speaker 4>these two extremes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those episodes of transition appear to </v>

2326
02:09:21.721 --> 02:09:26.611
<v Speaker 4>be profoundly catastrophic and they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with things like massive </v>

2327
02:09:27.461 --> 02:09:29.530
<v Speaker 4>storms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive rainfalls,</v>

2328
02:09:29.531 --> 02:09:34.450
<v Speaker 4>rising and falling of sea levels on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme a basis,</v>

2329
02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:40.200
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's that that has created </v>
<v Speaker 4>the grand canyon predominantly.</v>

2330
02:09:41.141 --> 02:09:42.550
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the inner channel.</v>

2331
02:09:42.551 --> 02:09:44.680
<v Speaker 4>I know if you've ever seen grand canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2332
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an inner gorge I could guess at </v>

2333
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:50.530
<v Speaker 4>that inner gorgeous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably less than 100,000</v>

2334
02:09:50.531 --> 02:09:53.740
<v Speaker 4>years old and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably a lot of it was cut 13,000</v>

2335
02:09:53.741 --> 02:09:54.810
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2336
02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:58.720
<v Speaker 4>And so that's when the pleistocene ended</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere around 10,000</v>

2337
02:09:58.750 --> 02:10:00.910
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ten to 13,000</v>

2338
02:10:00.911 --> 02:10:02.200
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2339
02:10:02.230 --> 02:10:03.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

2340
02:10:03.190 --> 02:10:06.190
<v Speaker 4>that's not a real fixture is it seems </v>
<v Speaker 4>like an artist's rendition.</v>

2341
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have pictures somewhere in there where</v>

2342
02:10:09.731 --> 02:10:12.200
<v Speaker 4>you still get a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2343
02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:13.450
<v Speaker 4>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2344
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:18.510
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the accumulation of the sedimentary </v>

2345
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.510
<v Speaker 4>rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2346
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Took hundreds of millions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's one process.</v>

2347
02:10:20.710 --> 02:10:23.950
<v Speaker 4>The downcutting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the erosion of the canyon is a different</v>

2348
02:10:23.951 --> 02:10:25.510
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>

2349
02:10:25.511 --> 02:10:30.511
<v Speaker 4>it comes to a matter of perspective that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're almost incapable of.</v>

2350
02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:32.440
<v Speaker 4>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2351
02:10:32.530 --> 02:10:34.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>academically</v>

2352
02:10:34.670 --> 02:10:39.670
<v Speaker 1>and you could sort of explain how all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this takes place and explain what's </v>

2353
02:10:41.271 --> 02:10:46.271
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in our minds are our perspective of </v>

2354
02:10:46.271 --> 02:10:47.480
<v Speaker 1>living a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking back,</v>

2355
02:10:47.481 --> 02:10:49.500
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to go back 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2356
02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when that happened.</v>

2357
02:10:50.781 --> 02:10:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barely.</v>

2358
02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:54.890
<v Speaker 1>But this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ain't shit compared to the earth,</v>

2359
02:10:55.030 --> 02:11:00.030
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth is just constantly changing </v>

2360
02:11:00.030 --> 02:11:03.031
<v Speaker 1>and our knowledge of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this sort of static view and </v>

2361
02:11:03.031 --> 02:11:06.380
<v Speaker 1>occasionally we have that meteor that </v>
<v Speaker 1>flew over Russia recently and blew up in</v>

2362
02:11:06.381 --> 02:11:07.850
<v Speaker 1>the sky and everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

2363
02:11:07.851 --> 02:11:08.760
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2364
02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:10.910
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it stops.</v>

2365
02:11:10.930 --> 02:11:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Then nothing go back to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to work,</v>

2366
02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.680
<v Speaker 1>go back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2367
02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:16.520
<v Speaker 1>And that thing that blew up over Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

2368
02:11:16.670 --> 02:11:21.670
<v Speaker 1>that was a spec and there was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those turn goose which blew up </v>

2369
02:11:21.670 --> 02:11:22.520
<v Speaker 1>in the early 19 hundreds.</v>

2370
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2371
02:11:23.061 --> 02:11:24.590
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>June 30th,</v>

2372
02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:25.490
<v Speaker 1>19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh eight.</v>

2373
02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Which just flat and thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of acres.</v>

2374
02:11:30.590 --> 02:11:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2375
02:11:31.521 --> 02:11:36.521
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 800 square miles and 640 acres </v>

2376
02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:40.931
<v Speaker 1>per square mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it flat and a half a million acres,</v>

2377
02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.000
<v Speaker 1>a million acres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the energy of that was </v>

2378
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.020
<v Speaker 1>about equivalent to a 15 megaton bomb </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up.</v>

2379
02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:50.750
<v Speaker 1>There's an image of tongue goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2380
02:11:50.850 --> 02:11:54.650
<v Speaker 1>just all the trees completely flattened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely flat.</v>

2381
02:11:54.810 --> 02:11:57.290
<v Speaker 1>A few look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gangster tree is still standing there.</v>

2382
02:11:57.291 --> 02:11:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Hasn't happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2383
02:11:58.671 --> 02:12:01.580
<v Speaker 1>It's just like every now and then just </v>
<v Speaker 1>one bad motherfucker tree.</v>

2384
02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:03.290
<v Speaker 1>That's how people stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2385
02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Because just like everybody else died or</v>
<v Speaker 1>most things died and most of the species</v>

2386
02:12:07.971 --> 02:12:12.971
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few people figured out a way to make </v>

2387
02:12:12.971 --> 02:12:12.971
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they decided to have babies.</v>

2388
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:15.930
<v Speaker 1>What a bunch of crazy fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine?</v>

2389
02:12:15.931 --> 02:12:17.180
<v Speaker 1>A giant asteroid hits.</v>

2390
02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Kills everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rotten people and woolly mammoths all </v>

2391
02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:25.030
<v Speaker 1>over the place and you're still horny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still horny,</v>

2392
02:12:25.311 --> 02:12:30.311
<v Speaker 1>and you make a baby like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you raise it and that baby makes </v>

2393
02:12:30.311 --> 02:12:31.910
<v Speaker 1>more bikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say in the book of genesis?</v>

2394
02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Be fruitful and multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now get this the word,</v>

2395
02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:39.440
<v Speaker 1>replenish the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>replenish the earth and subdue it.</v>

2396
02:12:39.441 --> 02:12:44.441
<v Speaker 1>I think clearly that's a clear hint that</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying this is not the primordial </v>

2397
02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:48.290
<v Speaker 1>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a subsequent creation to something.</v>

2398
02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:52.610
<v Speaker 1>A previous order of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you used the word replenish.</v>

2399
02:12:53.150 --> 02:12:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Be fruitful and multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would make sense if if the human </v>

2400
02:12:58.150 --> 02:13:01.121
<v Speaker 1>population crashes in the wake of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>global catastrophe and we're down </v>

2401
02:13:01.121 --> 02:13:05.480
<v Speaker 1>hovering at the threshold of viability </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you know,</v>

2402
02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:10.900
<v Speaker 1>we could become extinct if just anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else happens and we want to.</v>

2403
02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:13.010
<v Speaker 1>We want to preserve our species while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2404
02:13:13.011 --> 02:13:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Probably the thing we need to be doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is having a lots of sex.</v>

2405
02:13:16.650 --> 02:13:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

2406
02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2407
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean we need to do a lots of screwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to screw and make scientists</v>

2408
02:13:24.861 --> 02:13:26.780
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to get us off this </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock.</v>

2409
02:13:26.890 --> 02:13:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2410
02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:29.840
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fruitful and multiply.</v>

2411
02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It makes patient replenish the earth</v>

2412
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:34.530
<v Speaker 4>and subdue it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell is that?</v>

2413
02:13:34.590 --> 02:13:36.480
<v Speaker 4>Is this a subdue it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Subdue it.</v>

2414
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:40.620
<v Speaker 4>That's in genesis in genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell are they talking about?</v>

2415
02:13:40.621 --> 02:13:42.210
<v Speaker 4>They're choke the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2416
02:13:42.211 --> 02:13:44.340
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the way it's been interpreted.</v>

2417
02:13:44.341 --> 02:13:46.950
<v Speaker 4>I think it's being interpreted to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2418
02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:50.880
<v Speaker 4>you guys are the only rational species </v>
<v Speaker 4>down there.</v>

2419
02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:53.280
<v Speaker 4>You've got these big brains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2420
02:13:53.281 --> 02:13:55.360
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be born before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2421
02:13:55.540 --> 02:14:00.540
<v Speaker 4>it takes you years and years to actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>get where you can survive on your own </v>

2422
02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:01.850
<v Speaker 4>because you've got these big fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

2423
02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:05.670
<v Speaker 4>See?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're kind of like nature's answer to</v>

2424
02:14:05.671 --> 02:14:07.320
<v Speaker 4>all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2425
02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:12.860
<v Speaker 4>only one species right now has the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to intercede and prevent the </v>

2426
02:14:14.161 --> 02:14:16.890
<v Speaker 4>next global catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's us.</v>

2427
02:14:17.370 --> 02:14:20.370
<v Speaker 4>Do we rise to that challenge or do we </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2428
02:14:20.371 --> 02:14:22.200
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to let nature run its course</v>

2429
02:14:22.201 --> 02:14:25.110
<v Speaker 4>and if 50 percent of the species </v>
<v Speaker 4>disappear,</v>

2430
02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:26.760
<v Speaker 4>civilization is over.</v>

2431
02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:29.670
<v Speaker 4>We go back to the stone age struggling </v>
<v Speaker 4>for existence.</v>

2432
02:14:29.671 --> 02:14:30.600
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so be it.</v>

2433
02:14:30.601 --> 02:14:33.330
<v Speaker 4>That's what's in the cards or do we say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2434
02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:38.100
<v Speaker 4>We could be in one generation be </v>
<v Speaker 4>harvesting to resources of asteroids,</v>

2435
02:14:38.250 --> 02:14:42.480
<v Speaker 4>which we could be if we had the will </v>
<v Speaker 4>innovation and the thing is,</v>

2436
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:45.990
<v Speaker 4>is that the most dangerous asteroids </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are out there,</v>

2437
02:14:45.991 --> 02:14:49.380
<v Speaker 4>it's the closer they get to the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more accessible they are.</v>

2438
02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:54.800
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you see we already could be </v>

2439
02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:56.811
<v Speaker 4>harvesting the resources of astra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I meAn asteroids are loaded with </v>

2440
02:14:56.811 --> 02:14:58.200
<v Speaker 4>precious metals and ors and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hydrocarbons.</v>

2441
02:14:58.201 --> 02:15:03.201
<v Speaker 4>there's virtually nothing that we are </v>
<v Speaker 4>now mining from the earth that we </v>

2442
02:15:03.201 --> 02:15:04.290
<v Speaker 4>couldn't mind from asteroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2443
02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:06.900
<v Speaker 4>What does that suggest to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2444
02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:08.520
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and think about this,</v>

2445
02:15:08.670 --> 02:15:11.640
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I like to kind of imagine a scenario,</v>

2446
02:15:11.641 --> 02:15:16.641
<v Speaker 4>suppose we had discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember shoemaker levy nine?</v>

2447
02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:18.570
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2448
02:15:18.630 --> 02:15:23.630
<v Speaker 4>Discovered in march of 1996,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within about eight weeks of </v>

2449
02:15:23.630 --> 02:15:28.341
<v Speaker 4>observations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the astronomers were able to predict </v>

2450
02:15:28.341 --> 02:15:31.580
<v Speaker 4>that these fragmented pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to orbit the sun and </v>

2451
02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:34.810
<v Speaker 4>comeback and be crossing the orbit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>jupiter at exactly the time to jupiter </v>

2452
02:15:34.810 --> 02:15:35.190
<v Speaker 4>was there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2453
02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:37.440
<v Speaker 4>There was going to be a t bone </v>
<v Speaker 4>collision.</v>

2454
02:15:37.441 --> 02:15:42.441
<v Speaker 4>It was like two vehicles coming to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intersection at the same time and they </v>

2455
02:15:42.441 --> 02:15:43.350
<v Speaker 4>were able to predict that right down to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2456
02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:48.440
<v Speaker 4>almost to the minute to the hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if we discovered that there's an </v>

2457
02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:53.121
<v Speaker 4>asteroid orbiting the sun out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's got our number on it and it was </v>

2458
02:15:53.121 --> 02:15:56.421
<v Speaker 4>going to strike the earth and three </v>
<v Speaker 4>years or 10 years or 20 years or </v>

2459
02:15:56.421 --> 02:15:57.420
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would be our response to it?</v>

2460
02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:01.230
<v Speaker 4>What will we do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think globally it would be,</v>

2461
02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:04.380
<v Speaker 4>there would have to be some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>collective x effort.</v>

2462
02:16:04.770 --> 02:16:07.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The scientists from China and Russia and</v>

2463
02:16:07.890 --> 02:16:12.890
<v Speaker 4>all these different various countries </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have a vast technological </v>

2464
02:16:12.890 --> 02:16:15.720
<v Speaker 4>capabilities would probably get together</v>
<v Speaker 4>and have some sort of an agreement.</v>

2465
02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:18.980
<v Speaker 4>I would think that that would have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen and it would fact,</v>

2466
02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:24.170
<v Speaker 4>it would probably make our petty human </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflicts pale into insignificance if we</v>

2467
02:16:25.951 --> 02:16:30.951
<v Speaker 4>were faced with the demise of </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization or even possibly our </v>

2468
02:16:30.951 --> 02:16:35.641
<v Speaker 4>species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but suppose we discovered it and it's </v>

2469
02:16:35.641 --> 02:16:40.231
<v Speaker 4>coming in a couple of years and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>no time to respond.</v>

2470
02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:42.220
<v Speaker 4>What could we do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2471
02:16:42.730 --> 02:16:45.760
<v Speaker 4>perhaps if we had a loNg enough lead </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

2472
02:16:46.270 --> 02:16:51.270
<v Speaker 4>we could actually deflect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All we need to do is is is an asteroid </v>

2473
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:55.151
<v Speaker 4>that's on a collision course with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>aerosol it has to do is be nudged a </v>

2474
02:16:55.151 --> 02:16:57.520
<v Speaker 4>little bit in a direct hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be a wide miss.</v>

2475
02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:02.640
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all we would have to do is just </v>

2476
02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:04.201
<v Speaker 4>nudge it a little and there's various </v>
<v Speaker 4>potential technologies whereby we could </v>

2477
02:17:04.201 --> 02:17:08.161
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what if we didn't have enough lead </v>

2478
02:17:08.161 --> 02:17:08.161
<v Speaker 4>time and we knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was going to slam into the earth</v>

2479
02:17:08.161 --> 02:17:12.600
<v Speaker 4>and for a thousand years gonna be havoc.</v>

2480
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:14.710
<v Speaker 4>What would we do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2481
02:17:14.711 --> 02:17:19.711
<v Speaker 4>perhaps we could go build a base on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moon or build a a something in space </v>

2482
02:17:19.711 --> 02:17:24.310
<v Speaker 4>that would allow humans to survive at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least until the dust settled enough that</v>

2483
02:17:24.311 --> 02:17:27.460
<v Speaker 4>we could return and begin to replenish </v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth.</v>

2484
02:17:27.461 --> 02:17:32.461
<v Speaker 4>you know what a bummer it would be if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you had a base on the moon and everyone </v>

2485
02:17:32.461 --> 02:17:32.461
<v Speaker 4>was living there and you wash the earth </v>
<v Speaker 4>below up.</v>

2486
02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:35.080
<v Speaker 4>Total bummer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it would be even bigger.</v>

2487
02:17:35.081 --> 02:17:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Bummer if you didn't have it and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were sitting on the earth.</v>

2488
02:17:38.410 --> 02:17:39.820
<v Speaker 4>Knowing that that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2489
02:17:39.821 --> 02:17:40.720
<v Speaker 4>that's all she wrote.</v>

2490
02:17:42.100 --> 02:17:47.100
<v Speaker 1>How many different times do you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this has happened while human </v>

2491
02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:48.950
<v Speaker 1>beings are alive and how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2492
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:53.990
<v Speaker 1>the great speculation has always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they see the pyramids or when they </v>

2493
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:57.931
<v Speaker 1>see any incredible structures that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>really haven't totally explained how </v>

2494
02:17:58.091 --> 02:18:03.091
<v Speaker 1>they built what like bow back in Lebanon</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what,</v>

2495
02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>how advanced were they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How advanced were they before the shit </v>

2496
02:18:08.741 --> 02:18:09.370
<v Speaker 1>hit the fan?</v>

2497
02:18:09.890 --> 02:18:12.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me then in order to,</v>

2498
02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:14.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta go,</v>

2499
02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:20.140
<v Speaker 4>why would primitive cultures move rocks </v>
<v Speaker 4>that weighed 200 to a thousand tons?</v>

2500
02:18:23.930 --> 02:18:26.540
<v Speaker 4>Apparently with impunity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were doing it all over the planet,</v>

2501
02:18:26.690 --> 02:18:29.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>W why would,</v>

2502
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:30.950
<v Speaker 4>why would somebody be motivated?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2503
02:18:30.951 --> 02:18:31.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like again,</v>

2504
02:18:31.671 --> 02:18:34.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm a builder so I know how much work it</v>
<v Speaker 4>takes to move even a,</v>

2505
02:18:35.250 --> 02:18:36.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without a crane,</v>

2506
02:18:36.471 --> 02:18:38.620
<v Speaker 4>without modern technology to move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2507
02:18:38.710 --> 02:18:39.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2508
02:18:39.370 --> 02:18:42.290
<v Speaker 4>a beam into place that weighs a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2509
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:43.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2510
02:18:43.341 --> 02:18:46.820
<v Speaker 4>we've got stones in some of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient temples that way.</v>

2511
02:18:46.970 --> 02:18:50.240
<v Speaker 4>Hundreds of tons and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all over the world.</v>

2512
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:55.990
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me difficult to imagine that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have some kind of a </v>

2513
02:18:55.990 --> 02:19:00.881
<v Speaker 4>technology that we've forgot what that </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology is.</v>

2514
02:19:00.980 --> 02:19:02.800
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2515
02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:08.420
<v Speaker 4>but it would sure seem to me that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be no motive for moving,</v>

2516
02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:11.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>500 tons stones,</v>

2517
02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:14.360
<v Speaker 4>unless you had some convenient way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it or</v>

2518
02:19:14.650 --> 02:19:19.650
<v Speaker 1>if not a convenient way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>just explain how an inconvenient way </v>

2519
02:19:21.370 --> 02:19:26.370
<v Speaker 1>they could have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get something like the </v>

2520
02:19:26.370 --> 02:19:27.710
<v Speaker 1>acropolis or the parthenon that's on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>acropolis,</v>

2521
02:19:27.711 --> 02:19:28.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that,</v>

2522
02:19:28.271 --> 02:19:33.271
<v Speaker 1>what is the part?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The acropolis is the stone and the </v>

2523
02:19:33.271 --> 02:19:34.900
<v Speaker 1>parthenon is what's on the hill complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>

2524
02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:37.700
<v Speaker 1>but the parthenon is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse.</v>

2525
02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:41.450
<v Speaker 1>The acropolis is a manmade construction </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has massive,</v>

2526
02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:44.240
<v Speaker 1>massive stones that they just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain.</v>

2527
02:19:44.410 --> 02:19:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2528
02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

2529
02:19:46.011 --> 02:19:49.280
<v Speaker 1>They're in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in cusco in south America.</v>

2530
02:19:50.430 --> 02:19:53.170
<v Speaker 1>They're in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2531
02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:58.240
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ball back one is actually probably </v>

2532
02:19:58.240 --> 02:19:58.240
<v Speaker 1>even more impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chamie.</v>

2533
02:19:58.240 --> 02:19:59.390
<v Speaker 1>See if he could pull that up and stones </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a ball.</v>

2534
02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:01.910
<v Speaker 1>How do you spell it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>B double a l,</v>

2535
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:02.750
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>

2536
02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:07.780
<v Speaker 1>k and there there's these stones are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just unbelievably big.</v>

2537
02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no explanation for how they moved </v>

2538
02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:17.551
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut them and them got them into place </v>

2539
02:20:17.551 --> 02:20:17.870
<v Speaker 1>and what year it was all done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2540
02:20:18.410 --> 02:20:22.400
<v Speaker 1>That's one vision of it or a picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2541
02:20:22.401 --> 02:20:27.401
<v Speaker 1>but if you search for others is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>a closeup of the actual stones </v>

2542
02:20:27.801 --> 02:20:32.801
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they show people standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>next to the stone so you get a </v>

2543
02:20:32.801 --> 02:20:33.530
<v Speaker 1>perspective of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much,</v>

2544
02:20:33.950 --> 02:20:36.440
<v Speaker 1>much taller than a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2545
02:20:36.510 --> 02:20:41.510
<v Speaker 1>I think 10 or 11 feet tall and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>places like there's one rock just like </v>

2546
02:20:43.310 --> 02:20:46.160
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of the stones,</v>

2547
02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:47.270
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good one,</v>

2548
02:20:47.271 --> 02:20:52.271
<v Speaker 1>jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some where you can see the </v>

2549
02:20:52.271 --> 02:20:52.330
<v Speaker 1>massive amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2550
02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:57.340
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stone that was in each individual </v>

2551
02:20:57.340 --> 02:20:59.711
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are literally building </v>

2552
02:20:59.711 --> 02:21:00.700
<v Speaker 1>sized and it's just an individual stone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

2553
02:21:00.780 --> 02:21:03.230
<v Speaker 1>there's one like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man,</v>

2554
02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:06.710
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so big.</v>

2555
02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:10.400
<v Speaker 1>They moved that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cut that query.</v>

2556
02:21:10.401 --> 02:21:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Didn't move it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2557
02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:14.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many people they had to</v>

2558
02:21:14.151 --> 02:21:17.840
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but boy that doesn't seem like something</v>

2559
02:21:17.841 --> 02:21:22.310
<v Speaker 1>that a society which is really concerned</v>
<v Speaker 1>with feeding itself is a is going to get</v>

2560
02:21:22.311 --> 02:21:24.790
<v Speaker 1>done what?</v>

2561
02:21:25.730 --> 02:21:28.820
<v Speaker 1>So when you see like the constructions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the great pyramids,</v>

2562
02:21:28.821 --> 02:21:33.821
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the great wonders of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and to this day they're always </v>

2563
02:21:33.821 --> 02:21:34.550
<v Speaker 1>trying to come up with ways that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it,</v>

2564
02:21:34.551 --> 02:21:38.210
<v Speaker 1>but the sheer size and to put it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

2565
02:21:38.270 --> 02:21:41.030
<v Speaker 1>if you cut and I think the number is 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>stones,</v>

2566
02:21:41.031 --> 02:21:43.990
<v Speaker 1>that debt is $6 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300,000</v>

2567
02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:49.120
<v Speaker 1>plus stones in the great pyramid of giza</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you cut and placed 10 a day,</v>

2568
02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:54.320
<v Speaker 1>it would take you 664 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2569
02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2570
02:21:56.480 --> 02:22:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having seen the great pyramid and many </v>

2571
02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:03.320
<v Speaker 1>of the temples in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that they had to have some</v>

2572
02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:08.030
<v Speaker 1>means that we've forgotten about for </v>
<v Speaker 1>transporting these stones.</v>

2573
02:22:08.470 --> 02:22:13.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may have used fairly primitive </v>

2574
02:22:13.470 --> 02:22:16.930
<v Speaker 1>methods to quarry the stones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to transporting the </v>

2575
02:22:17.481 --> 02:22:19.220
<v Speaker 1>stones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2576
02:22:19.221 --> 02:22:24.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could imagine that they're putting </v>

2577
02:22:24.221 --> 02:22:24.770
<v Speaker 1>them on rollers and dragging them over </v>
<v Speaker 1>hill and dale,</v>

2578
02:22:24.771 --> 02:22:29.771
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go really all over the whole </v>

2579
02:22:29.771 --> 02:22:29.771
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

2580
02:22:30.970 --> 02:22:32.670
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things,</v>

2581
02:22:32.671 --> 02:22:35.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like the demise of the frozen </v>
<v Speaker 1>woolly mammoths.</v>

2582
02:22:35.221 --> 02:22:37.800
<v Speaker 1>There's just no real explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2583
02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:42.820
<v Speaker 1>and we can invoke explanations that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically designed to avoid the </v>

2584
02:22:43.201 --> 02:22:48.201
<v Speaker 1>implications of admitting that there may</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been advanced knowledge,</v>

2585
02:22:48.631 --> 02:22:52.860
<v Speaker 1>scientific knowledge in prehistory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that somehow or another,</v>

2586
02:22:52.861 --> 02:22:55.590
<v Speaker 1>that knowledge was lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was because of the burning of</v>

2587
02:22:55.591 --> 02:23:00.591
<v Speaker 1>the library of alexandria or whether it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just a cataclysmic event that wiped </v>

2588
02:23:01.651 --> 02:23:06.651
<v Speaker 1>out a massive amount of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was remaining was buildings </v>

2589
02:23:06.651 --> 02:23:08.670
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things survived.</v>

2590
02:23:08.730 --> 02:23:13.730
<v Speaker 1>And then people tried to recreate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People eventually figured out some of </v>

2591
02:23:14.581 --> 02:23:17.400
<v Speaker 1>the techniques and made similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>

2592
02:23:17.730 --> 02:23:21.410
<v Speaker 1>but not over a period of a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>years or two years,</v>

2593
02:23:21.420 --> 02:23:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but maybe 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,000</v>

2594
02:23:23.581 --> 02:23:28.581
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always been the work of graham </v>

2595
02:23:28.581 --> 02:23:28.581
<v Speaker 1>hancock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2596
02:23:28.581 --> 02:23:28.581
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2597
02:23:28.581 --> 02:23:33.261
<v Speaker 1>the ideas they bounced around and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember there was that charlton </v>

2598
02:23:33.261 --> 02:23:37.911
<v Speaker 1>heston narrated a documentary on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sphinx where they had gone into great </v>

2599
02:23:38.401 --> 02:23:41.250
<v Speaker 1>detail about the erosion and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought him the geologists,</v>

2600
02:23:41.251 --> 02:23:43.110
<v Speaker 1>robert schoch from boston university.</v>

2601
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I know robert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get him on the podcast too.</v>

2602
02:23:45.961 --> 02:23:50.961
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating cat and he concluded </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the temple,</v>

2603
02:23:51.310 --> 02:23:56.310
<v Speaker 1>the sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enclosure where it was cut out of </v>

2604
02:23:56.310 --> 02:23:57.480
<v Speaker 1>shows thousands of years of erosion by </v>
<v Speaker 1>rainfall,</v>

2605
02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:02.840
<v Speaker 1>which there wasn't rainfall in the nile </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley before 9,000</v>

2606
02:24:03.871 --> 02:24:07.620
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it predates the pyramid construction,</v>

2607
02:24:07.621 --> 02:24:09.300
<v Speaker 1>the average or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2608
02:24:09.301 --> 02:24:12.630
<v Speaker 1>the conventional dating of the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is right there.</v>

2609
02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:16.140
<v Speaker 1>There's some explanations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It predates the,</v>

2610
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:20.370
<v Speaker 1>what the conventional date of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid is by more than 5,000</v>

2611
02:24:20.371 --> 02:24:21.510
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2612
02:24:21.511 --> 02:24:26.511
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've had conversations with robert </v>

2613
02:24:26.511 --> 02:24:28.650
<v Speaker 1>where he will basically say he's got one</v>
<v Speaker 1>number for public consumption,</v>

2614
02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:32.430
<v Speaker 1>but he's perfectly willing to admit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps this makes is much,</v>

2615
02:24:32.431 --> 02:24:33.860
<v Speaker 1>much older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2616
02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:36.660
<v Speaker 1>what's the dark number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the crazy number?</v>

2617
02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the crazy number is tens of</v>

2618
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:43.170
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years if you pull up.</v>

2619
02:24:43.230 --> 02:24:48.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not that crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it was kind of crazy when that </v>

2620
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:50.220
<v Speaker 1>charlton heston documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the documentary was around,</v>

2621
02:24:50.430 --> 02:24:55.430
<v Speaker 1>but now that they found go beckley </v>
<v Speaker 1>tapping and they know that 14,000,</v>

2622
02:24:55.981 --> 02:24:56.880
<v Speaker 1>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2623
02:24:56.881 --> 02:25:01.881
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were absolutely building these </v>

2624
02:25:01.881 --> 02:25:04.050
<v Speaker 1>enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immense structures that would be what,</v>

2625
02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:06.090
<v Speaker 1>8,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

2626
02:25:06.091 --> 02:25:08.510
<v Speaker 1>70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years earlier than the pyramids.</v>

2627
02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that big a deal.</v>

2628
02:25:11.430 --> 02:25:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Not that big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2629
02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:17.720
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conventional dating of the great </v>

2630
02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:17.880
<v Speaker 1>pyramid of giza is 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>bc,</v>

2631
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:23.030
<v Speaker 1>which may be correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still doesn't mean that the </v>

2632
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:24.640
<v Speaker 1>sphinx wasn't way older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way older than that.</v>

2633
02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2634
02:25:26.050 --> 02:25:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced having seen it firsthand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that erosion is water induced.</v>

2635
02:25:30.970 --> 02:25:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at a lot of erosioN over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and you know,</v>

2636
02:25:34.901 --> 02:25:39.220
<v Speaker 1>it's got the classic parabolic profile </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would expect if you started out</v>

2637
02:25:39.221 --> 02:25:40.540
<v Speaker 1>with an initially square.</v>

2638
02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open up the powerpoint show entitled a </v>

2639
02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:47.980
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most global super flood,</v>

2640
02:25:48.310 --> 02:25:50.980
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic global superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my new band.</v>

2641
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:55.010
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be my new band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go for me.</v>

2642
02:25:55.180 --> 02:26:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Cataclysmic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cataclysmic was the greek term for the </v>

2643
02:26:00.180 --> 02:26:00.820
<v Speaker 1>destruction of the world by water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>

2644
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:03.820
<v Speaker 1>From where we get our term cataclysm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2645
02:26:04.090 --> 02:26:05.740
<v Speaker 1>And their term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2646
02:26:05.741 --> 02:26:10.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greeks believed that they were </v>

2647
02:26:10.741 --> 02:26:10.810
<v Speaker 1>alternating destructions of the world by</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and fire,</v>

2648
02:26:11.050 --> 02:26:15.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eq per paralysis was the term greek term</v>

2649
02:26:15.671 --> 02:26:17.590
<v Speaker 1>for the destruction of the world by </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

2650
02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2651
02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:24.660
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of water on this stuff is so </v>

2652
02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:29.131
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably fascinating because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way that you can attribute all of </v>

2653
02:26:30.371 --> 02:26:32.110
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2654
02:26:32.111 --> 02:26:35.470
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these ancient structures,</v>

2655
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:40.060
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can attribute it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we know about their culture.</v>

2656
02:26:40.330 --> 02:26:43.120
<v Speaker 1>We don't know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just not enough evidence.</v>

2657
02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:47.830
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know enough about ancient Egypt</v>

2658
02:26:47.831 --> 02:26:52.831
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or their construction methods are so </v>

2659
02:26:52.831 --> 02:26:53.560
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much thinking,</v>

2660
02:26:54.610 --> 02:26:57.850
<v Speaker 1>so much guesswork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

2661
02:26:58.270 --> 02:27:03.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at these giant structures </v>

2662
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.270
<v Speaker 1>and you wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2663
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.490
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were they doing?</v>

2664
02:27:03.491 --> 02:27:05.470
<v Speaker 1>How did they do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are they like?</v>

2665
02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:08.150
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just,</v>

2666
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I would love to be able to go back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time inside a giant bulletproof bubble.</v>

2667
02:27:12.730 --> 02:27:15.610
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hover over ancient Egypt.</v>

2668
02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:17.920
<v Speaker 1>That was going on back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2669
02:27:17.950 --> 02:27:22.930
<v Speaker 1>When did you guys know jamie go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a global super fluid.</v>

2670
02:27:22.931 --> 02:27:27.931
<v Speaker 1>What is this image?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to slide 58 slash 58.</v>

2671
02:27:29.050 --> 02:27:31.480
<v Speaker 1>The infamous slide 58.</v>

2672
02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Hanger 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slide 58 hours.</v>

2673
02:27:36.091 --> 02:27:37.330
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2674
02:27:37.331 --> 02:27:38.800
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2675
02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:43.480
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what you can see there is you got to</v>

2676
02:27:43.481 --> 02:27:45.430
<v Speaker 1>get it into the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get on the microphone there.</v>

2677
02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:47.280
<v Speaker 1>The valley temple up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2678
02:27:47.281 --> 02:27:52.281
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The valley temple with stones quarried </v>

2679
02:27:52.281 --> 02:27:56.010
<v Speaker 1>from the ditch around the sphinx and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to remember what the sphinx </v>

2680
02:27:56.410 --> 02:27:59.170
<v Speaker 1>is that originally it was a yard day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

2681
02:27:59.260 --> 02:28:04.260
<v Speaker 1>which is a limestone outcrop that sticks</v>
<v Speaker 1>above the surrounding landscape that </v>

2682
02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:07.000
<v Speaker 1>yardang was the head of the sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything else was below.</v>

2683
02:28:07.420 --> 02:28:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Now go to the next slide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jamie.</v>

2684
02:28:10.990 --> 02:28:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There yoU can really see the ditch </v>

2685
02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:15.990
<v Speaker 1>surrounding the sphinx and the layers </v>
<v Speaker 1>forming.</v>

2686
02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:19.510
<v Speaker 1>The sphinx body correspond to the layers</v>
<v Speaker 1>into surrounding ditch.</v>

2687
02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Now wanting to me notice the scaffolding</v>

2688
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:24.140
<v Speaker 4>next to the sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're there.</v>

2689
02:28:24.210 --> 02:28:29.210
<v Speaker 4>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're undertaking these campaigns of </v>

2690
02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:29.210
<v Speaker 4>rests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote unquote,</v>

2691
02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:33.071
<v Speaker 4>restoration grows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what they're actually doing is </v>

2692
02:28:33.071 --> 02:28:33.920
<v Speaker 4>they're covering up the real message of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sphinx.</v>

2693
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.950
<v Speaker 4>Know why are they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are they bothering to try to rebuild</v>

2694
02:28:36.951 --> 02:28:39.950
<v Speaker 4>the thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know it's so stupid like,</v>

2695
02:28:39.951 --> 02:28:41.450
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not rebuilding it.</v>

2696
02:28:41.451 --> 02:28:43.130
<v Speaker 4>You're building new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2697
02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:46.120
<v Speaker 4>you're just rephrasing it with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with new stones.</v>

2698
02:28:46.121 --> 02:28:51.121
<v Speaker 4>So gross,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least nobody is messing with the </v>

2699
02:28:51.121 --> 02:28:54.911
<v Speaker 4>quarry walls where you can see the water</v>
<v Speaker 4>erosion so effectively displayed.</v>

2700
02:28:56.210 --> 02:28:58.340
<v Speaker 4>Go to the next slide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jamie.</v>

2701
02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:02.380
<v Speaker 4>Now what we see here is an abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 4>quarry.</v>

2702
02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:08.330
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to tell the scale here because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that opening is like 40 feet high,</v>

2703
02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:12.470
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see the striations in the rock wall.</v>

2704
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:15.770
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is where they quarried the blocks,</v>

2705
02:29:15.890 --> 02:29:17.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And remove the blocks.</v>

2706
02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Go to the next slide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jamie.</v>

2707
02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:25.630
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This kind of shows the methodology that </v>

2708
02:29:25.630 --> 02:29:25.630
<v Speaker 4>they use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2709
02:29:25.630 --> 02:29:26.000
<v Speaker 4>they would create these separation </v>
<v Speaker 4>trenches.</v>

2710
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:31.030
<v Speaker 4>They would usually go by the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the natural bed bedding layers of the </v>

2711
02:29:31.491 --> 02:29:36.491
<v Speaker 4>rock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go to the next slide and you'll see </v>

2712
02:29:36.491 --> 02:29:40.181
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the presumed process where </v>

2713
02:29:40.181 --> 02:29:43.780
<v Speaker 4>they're cutting a separation tranche and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a block about to be quarried </v>

2714
02:29:44.031 --> 02:29:49.031
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you can see there would have a </v>

2715
02:29:49.031 --> 02:29:49.031
<v Speaker 4>stack of four blocks there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these blocks are enormous.</v>

2716
02:29:49.031 --> 02:29:49.790
<v Speaker 4>Several tons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2717
02:29:49.791 --> 02:29:51.320
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that block there would be,</v>

2718
02:29:51.550 --> 02:29:56.270
<v Speaker 4>it looks like it's probably about four </v>
<v Speaker 4>by eight by probably 10.</v>

2719
02:29:56.390 --> 02:30:01.390
<v Speaker 4>So like 320 cubic feet at 160 per.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2720
02:30:02.970 --> 02:30:04.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or 180.</v>

2721
02:30:04.221 --> 02:30:09.040
<v Speaker 4>So you're looking at about 57,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds divided by 2000.</v>

2722
02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:10.420
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about two.</v>

2723
02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:12.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 30 tons.</v>

2724
02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:15.440
<v Speaker 4>She's got 30 tons for that rock right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2725
02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:17.030
<v Speaker 4>Now go to the next slide.</v>

2726
02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:19.220
<v Speaker 4>Thirty tons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2727
02:30:19.221 --> 02:30:24.221
<v Speaker 4>Now the reason I'm showing you this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is the process they would </v>

2728
02:30:24.221 --> 02:30:25.640
<v Speaker 4>have used to quarry the blocks away from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2729
02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:30.800
<v Speaker 4>the surrounding the sphinx and exposed a</v>
<v Speaker 4>quarry wall.</v>

2730
02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:36.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time that quarry wall was </v>

2731
02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:38.351
<v Speaker 4>exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have been essentially a flat </v>

2732
02:30:38.351 --> 02:30:40.100
<v Speaker 4>surface with this slightly stepped </v>
<v Speaker 4>profile like we saw in the photograph.</v>

2733
02:30:40.130 --> 02:30:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to the next slide,</v>

2734
02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:48.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's now would be a cross section </v>

2735
02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:49.010
<v Speaker 4>with all of the blocks removed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2736
02:30:49.011 --> 02:30:54.011
<v Speaker 4>go to the next slide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what we have here is stone pick </v>

2737
02:30:54.051 --> 02:30:59.051
<v Speaker 4>marks in a limestone quarry from </v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmacy times about 1200 bc.</v>

2738
02:31:00.351 --> 02:31:01.760
<v Speaker 4>So about 3,200</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

2739
02:31:01.761 --> 02:31:06.761
<v Speaker 4>So here's a limestone face of a quarry </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's been exposed for 3000,</v>

2740
02:31:06.831 --> 02:31:10.900
<v Speaker 4>200 years and it seems like they used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a chisel to get that out.</v>

2741
02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:13.220
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pick marks are still visible.</v>

2742
02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:15.350
<v Speaker 4>Go to the next slide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2743
02:31:15.351 --> 02:31:19.590
<v Speaker 4>Here's stone pick marks in a quarry from</v>
<v Speaker 4>nearly new kingdom circa 15.</v>

2744
02:31:19.591 --> 02:31:20.640
<v Speaker 4>So 3,500</v>

2745
02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:25.640
<v Speaker 1>years ago you can actually determine the</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of tool that they used to quarry </v>

2746
02:31:27.031 --> 02:31:29.220
<v Speaker 1>the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The picks are the chisels.</v>

2747
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Go to the next one based on the market </v>
<v Speaker 1>are based on tomorrow.</v>

2748
02:31:32.490 --> 02:31:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here you see that the chisel marks </v>

2749
02:31:37.490 --> 02:31:38.100
<v Speaker 1>made or pick marks made by stone picks </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an old kingdom.</v>

2750
02:31:38.101 --> 02:31:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Limestone quarry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 years bc.</v>

2751
02:31:40.891 --> 02:31:45.891
<v Speaker 1>So here's a 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old quarry that's been sitting </v>

2752
02:31:45.891 --> 02:31:48.561
<v Speaker 1>exposed to the desert elements and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick marks are still visible on the </v>

2753
02:31:48.561 --> 02:31:50.370
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now go to the next slide.</v>

2754
02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the spanx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to the next slide and look at that </v>

2755
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.930
<v Speaker 1>quarry wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2756
02:31:57.010 --> 02:31:58.470
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2757
02:31:58.890 --> 02:31:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2758
02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:03.870
<v Speaker 1>supposedly this quarry wall is only a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few centuries older than net.</v>

2759
02:32:03.871 --> 02:32:08.871
<v Speaker 1>Last picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just saw where we could see the pic </v>

2760
02:32:08.871 --> 02:32:08.871
<v Speaker 1>marks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

2761
02:32:08.871 --> 02:32:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way it would make sense as if </v>

2762
02:32:13.430 --> 02:32:13.430
<v Speaker 1>there was a vastly different type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>

2763
02:32:13.430 --> 02:32:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not though.</v>

2764
02:32:14.071 --> 02:32:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

2765
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Well indurated limestone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert can tell you all about the </v>

2766
02:32:20.750 --> 02:32:20.910
<v Speaker 1>composition of that stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>

2767
02:32:20.911 --> 02:32:23.080
<v Speaker 1>The composition does vary though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2768
02:32:23.090 --> 02:32:23.950
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some.</v>

2769
02:32:23.951 --> 02:32:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's more dense than others and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2770
02:32:25.860 --> 02:32:30.860
<v Speaker 1>you can see the changes and you can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that indented layer about halfway </v>

2771
02:32:31.351 --> 02:32:33.180
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a softer limestone.</v>

2772
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly looks to the layman and I'm</v>

2773
02:32:36.631 --> 02:32:41.631
<v Speaker 1>clearly a layman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly looks like like water </v>

2774
02:32:41.631 --> 02:32:41.631
<v Speaker 1>fishers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2775
02:32:41.631 --> 02:32:43.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishers that are driven rainfall.</v>

2776
02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Even to the trained eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like water,</v>

2777
02:32:46.350 --> 02:32:51.350
<v Speaker 1>but some legit egyptologists and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>legit geologists have tried to attribute</v>

2778
02:32:52.531 --> 02:32:56.970
<v Speaker 1>this to a wind and sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2779
02:32:57.300 --> 02:33:02.300
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know robert has shown pictures of </v>

2780
02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:04.380
<v Speaker 1>the comparison of wind erosion or water </v>
<v Speaker 1>erosion and they don't look the same,</v>

2781
02:33:04.470 --> 02:33:07.920
<v Speaker 1>so the only reason to attribute this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wind and sand,</v>

2782
02:33:07.980 --> 02:33:12.980
<v Speaker 1>it's not based on the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence of what it looks like when </v>

2783
02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:12.980
<v Speaker 1>there's water erosion.</v>

2784
02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:17.720
<v Speaker 1>It's to confirm or to conform with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>known or established timeline of </v>

2785
02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:18.990
<v Speaker 1>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2786
02:33:18.991 --> 02:33:23.991
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I showed you those </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of other core like that old </v>

2787
02:33:23.991 --> 02:33:25.920
<v Speaker 1>kingdom quarry that's almost the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>age as this,</v>

2788
02:33:25.950 --> 02:33:30.150
<v Speaker 1>so it's actually really not scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to attribute it to wind and sand.</v>

2789
02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:35.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is confirming to </v>

2790
02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:35.180
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

2791
02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:39.260
<v Speaker 1>you have an idea in your head and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to to make this really odd </v>

2792
02:33:40.801 --> 02:33:45.801
<v Speaker 1>erosion fit into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't look like wind and </v>

2793
02:33:45.801 --> 02:33:47.520
<v Speaker 1>sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to the next in lik joey,</v>

2794
02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:51.600
<v Speaker 1>jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll jam band.</v>

2795
02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:56.220
<v Speaker 1>So there's the depth of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

2796
02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:01.640
<v Speaker 1>of the ditch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 22 feet and eric show shows </v>

2797
02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:01.830
<v Speaker 1>each of the layers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at layer of Lebanon,</v>

2798
02:34:01.831 --> 02:34:06.831
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be a softer limestone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's eroded deeper right now.</v>

2799
02:34:07.351 --> 02:34:12.351
<v Speaker 1>Go to the next slide and you'll see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done is superimposed what the </v>

2800
02:34:12.351 --> 02:34:16.701
<v Speaker 1>original profile would have looked like </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's been an enormous amount of </v>

2801
02:34:16.701 --> 02:34:21.351
<v Speaker 1>rock limestone rock removed and we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>the profile would have looked like that </v>

2802
02:34:21.351 --> 02:34:25.591
<v Speaker 1>because the stones that were quarried </v>
<v Speaker 1>are what make up the sphinx and valley </v>

2803
02:34:25.591 --> 02:34:25.591
<v Speaker 1>temples.</v>

2804
02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:30.680
<v Speaker 1>The no's have been eroded as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately they've covered that </v>

2805
02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:32.440
<v Speaker 1>up with this reconstruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely,</v>

2806
02:34:32.470 --> 02:34:35.500
<v Speaker 1>most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think robert would confirm this,</v>

2807
02:34:35.530 --> 02:34:40.530
<v Speaker 1>that the limestone blocks at formed </v>
<v Speaker 1>those temples were sheathed in hard </v>

2808
02:34:40.530 --> 02:34:43.420
<v Speaker 1>granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas this quarry wall was not.</v>

2809
02:34:43.450 --> 02:34:47.020
<v Speaker 1>It was exposed and then there's also the</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue of the sphinx head itself,</v>

2810
02:34:47.021 --> 02:34:50.160
<v Speaker 1>which seems to have been altered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2811
02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:54.190
<v Speaker 1>This is a timeline thing that folks may </v>
<v Speaker 1>or may not know,</v>

2812
02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:57.880
<v Speaker 1>but there's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Egypt changed quite a bit,</v>

2813
02:34:57.910 --> 02:35:02.910
<v Speaker 1>mean Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ancient Egypt was around for thousands </v>

2814
02:35:02.910 --> 02:35:05.341
<v Speaker 1>and thousands of years and at some point</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were conquered by the nubians and </v>

2815
02:35:05.341 --> 02:35:09.610
<v Speaker 1>the more african,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we think of as traditional african </v>

2816
02:35:09.610 --> 02:35:09.910
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Egypt as part of africa,</v>

2817
02:35:09.911 --> 02:35:14.911
<v Speaker 1>but the more traditional looking african</v>
<v Speaker 1>faces is what you see in the current </v>

2818
02:35:14.951 --> 02:35:19.780
<v Speaker 1>face in the temple this face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So probably whaT had happened is a later</v>

2819
02:35:19.781 --> 02:35:21.250
<v Speaker 1>date pharaoh said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2820
02:35:21.250 --> 02:35:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my face up there.</v>

2821
02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:29.100
<v Speaker 1>So they put the face of this probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>catherine [inaudible] and I think both </v>

2822
02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:32.590
<v Speaker 1>John Anthony West and robert schoch </v>
<v Speaker 1>would concur with.</v>

2823
02:35:32.620 --> 02:35:35.560
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's so little erosion on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that face.</v>

2824
02:35:36.050 --> 02:35:41.050
<v Speaker 1>That face is only a few thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old and why it would be </v>

2825
02:35:41.050 --> 02:35:41.080
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately small compared to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the body.</v>

2826
02:35:41.710 --> 02:35:43.410
<v Speaker 1>So fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just.</v>

2827
02:35:43.630 --> 02:35:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I would give so much to know what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew then if any point in time to go </v>

2828
02:35:48.971 --> 02:35:51.430
<v Speaker 1>back in human history and just to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to observe.</v>

2829
02:35:51.610 --> 02:35:55.120
<v Speaker 1>That would be the time that the just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of Egypt.</v>

2830
02:35:55.121 --> 02:35:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see what it looked like </v>
<v Speaker 1>before they raided it and took off.</v>

2831
02:35:58.721 --> 02:36:03.721
<v Speaker 1>For folks that don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was covered in smooth limestone and </v>

2832
02:36:03.721 --> 02:36:06.070
<v Speaker 1>they cut it all up to build cairo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They rated it.</v>

2833
02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an earthquake that flattened </v>

2834
02:36:11.220 --> 02:36:13.561
<v Speaker 1>cairo and you know they had attempted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>penetrate the great pyramid prior to </v>

2835
02:36:13.561 --> 02:36:16.570
<v Speaker 1>that without success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently the earthquake,</v>

2836
02:36:16.571 --> 02:36:21.571
<v Speaker 1>which I think happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it happened in the twelfth </v>

2837
02:36:21.571 --> 02:36:24.361
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loosened a few rocks from near the top </v>

2838
02:36:24.361 --> 02:36:28.561
<v Speaker 1>of the pyramid that allowed them to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>some levers in there and begin to pry </v>

2839
02:36:28.561 --> 02:36:28.561
<v Speaker 1>them loose.</v>

2840
02:36:28.561 --> 02:36:32.910
<v Speaker 1>So I've read a bunch of fucking assholes</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about vandalism that get this,</v>

2841
02:36:33.730 --> 02:36:35.770
<v Speaker 1>whether this is true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no way of knowing,</v>

2842
02:36:35.771 --> 02:36:40.771
<v Speaker 1>but there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many arabic accounts and accounts of </v>

2843
02:36:40.771 --> 02:36:44.790
<v Speaker 1>early travelers and pretty much they all</v>
<v Speaker 1>unanimously declare that the entire </v>

2844
02:36:45.581 --> 02:36:50.581
<v Speaker 1>outside of the pyramid was inscribed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now think about that.</v>

2845
02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:53.440
<v Speaker 1>What in the hell would that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling?</v>

2846
02:36:53.441 --> 02:36:57.220
<v Speaker 1>What kind of message was that that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>being sent to the future?</v>

2847
02:36:57.610 --> 02:36:59.260
<v Speaker 1>That must've been amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2848
02:36:59.261 --> 02:37:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get my.</v>

2849
02:37:00.910 --> 02:37:04.910
<v Speaker 1>My hair stands up on my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just thinking about inscribed.</v>

2850
02:37:05.410 --> 02:37:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey listen,</v>

2851
02:37:07.330 --> 02:37:12.330
<v Speaker 1>there's rocks in space and occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>they land and when they do you're </v>

2852
02:37:12.330 --> 02:37:13.870
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Build one of these.</v>

2853
02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>get inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait for</v>

2854
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:21.010
<v Speaker 4>further instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that there.</v>

2855
02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:23.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that thing existed,</v>

2856
02:37:23.271 --> 02:37:28.271
<v Speaker 4>if you've robert schoch has corrected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing existed before the holocene </v>

2857
02:37:28.611 --> 02:37:33.611
<v Speaker 4>events.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the only types of structures </v>

2858
02:37:33.611 --> 02:37:34.820
<v Speaker 4>that would still be here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2859
02:37:35.430 --> 02:37:36.230
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

2860
02:37:36.231 --> 02:37:39.590
<v Speaker 4>did people make it through there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what the number was.</v>

2861
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:41.690
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to adam and eve story.</v>

2862
02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:43.130
<v Speaker 4>Here's my theory on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2863
02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:49.060
<v Speaker 4>all over the world we have traditions </v>
<v Speaker 4>about cactus catastrophes and cataclysms</v>

2864
02:37:49.791 --> 02:37:54.791
<v Speaker 4>and giant floods all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've come down to us and there's a </v>

2865
02:37:54.921 --> 02:37:59.921
<v Speaker 4>lot of deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's also a lot of similarity in </v>

2866
02:37:59.921 --> 02:38:02.860
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that a small group had some </v>

2867
02:38:02.860 --> 02:38:02.860
<v Speaker 4>kind of foreign knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2868
02:38:02.860 --> 02:38:06.940
<v Speaker 4>whether it was knowing the bible or do </v>
<v Speaker 4>kalien in the greek myths or wooten,</v>

2869
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:10.670
<v Speaker 4>a pitch to him into samarian myths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or is this a thrusts or man knew.</v>

2870
02:38:10.671 --> 02:38:11.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2871
02:38:11.580 --> 02:38:16.580
<v Speaker 4>the culture heroes that survived these </v>
<v Speaker 4>great cataclysmic floods are into dozens</v>

2872
02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:17.720
<v Speaker 4>and dozens.</v>

2873
02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:22.720
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>American indians had prolific traditions</v>

2874
02:38:23.691 --> 02:38:26.690
<v Speaker 4>about giant floods when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when george,</v>

2875
02:38:26.691 --> 02:38:28.880
<v Speaker 4>caitlin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the famous indian artist,</v>

2876
02:38:29.060 --> 02:38:34.060
<v Speaker 4>spent decades of his life going around </v>
<v Speaker 4>living with various indian tribes like </v>

2877
02:38:34.250 --> 02:38:37.190
<v Speaker 4>40 years painting and in writing about </v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

2878
02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:39.710
<v Speaker 4>very interesting quote in one of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>books,</v>

2879
02:38:39.711 --> 02:38:44.711
<v Speaker 4>he says that they're widely divergent </v>
<v Speaker 4>with traditions and language and customs</v>

2880
02:38:45.381 --> 02:38:49.700
<v Speaker 4>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but have a hundred and 20 tribes that he</v>

2881
02:38:49.701 --> 02:38:54.701
<v Speaker 4>visited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all had one thing in common that </v>

2882
02:38:54.701 --> 02:38:57.980
<v Speaker 4>they were descended from survivors of </v>
<v Speaker 4>some gigantic cataclysmic event.</v>

2883
02:38:59.570 --> 02:39:01.970
<v Speaker 4>That's american indian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you find it in north America?</v>

2884
02:39:01.971 --> 02:39:06.140
<v Speaker 4>You find it in south America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You find it in the polynesian islands.</v>

2885
02:39:06.141 --> 02:39:08.960
<v Speaker 4>You find it in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan.</v>

2886
02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:11.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's around the entire planet.</v>

2887
02:39:11.540 --> 02:39:16.540
<v Speaker 4>This idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now modern science is confirming </v>

2888
02:39:16.540 --> 02:39:20.330
<v Speaker 4>what we assumed was merely some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>superstitious nonsense.</v>

2889
02:39:20.331 --> 02:39:21.220
<v Speaker 4>Have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2890
02:39:21.660 --> 02:39:24.080
<v Speaker 4>pre scientific illiterate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>barbarians.</v>

2891
02:39:24.260 --> 02:39:29.260
<v Speaker 4>And we're realizing that those myths and</v>
<v Speaker 4>those stories and epic tales that have </v>

2892
02:39:29.260 --> 02:39:32.891
<v Speaker 4>been handed down for centuries and </v>
<v Speaker 4>centuries actually contained hard </v>

2893
02:39:32.891 --> 02:39:34.760
<v Speaker 4>scientific truth from surviving </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyewitnesses.</v>

2894
02:39:35.090 --> 02:39:37.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if these craters actually do exist,</v>

2895
02:39:37.341 --> 02:39:40.790
<v Speaker 4>and they do right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>craters undeniable.</v>

2896
02:39:40.791 --> 02:39:43.430
<v Speaker 4>The nuclear glass throughout asia and </v>
<v Speaker 4>europe,</v>

2897
02:39:43.431 --> 02:39:46.910
<v Speaker 4>undeniable human beings were alive then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2898
02:39:47.090 --> 02:39:49.910
<v Speaker 4>and if human beings were alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they got fucked up.</v>

2899
02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:51.640
<v Speaker 4>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2900
02:39:52.370 --> 02:39:52.920
<v Speaker 4>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2901
02:39:52.970 --> 02:39:53.410
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2902
02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:56.330
<v Speaker 4>they would have suffered enormously and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>

2903
02:39:56.331 --> 02:39:57.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2904
02:39:58.070 --> 02:40:03.070
<v Speaker 4>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if three quarters of the species of </v>

2905
02:40:03.070 --> 02:40:05.231
<v Speaker 4>animals in north America when extinct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think that the 25 percent </v>

2906
02:40:05.231 --> 02:40:06.320
<v Speaker 4>surviving came through completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>unscathed?</v>

2907
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:09.350
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It simply means that there's a threshold</v>

2908
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:13.040
<v Speaker 4>above which species is viable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can survive.</v>

2909
02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:15.930
<v Speaker 4>There's there and below,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>

2910
02:40:15.931 --> 02:40:19.740
<v Speaker 4>there may have been survivors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there just weren't enough of them.</v>

2911
02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:24.740
<v Speaker 4>They were too widely scattered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>serious habitat loss which would have </v>

2912
02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:26.520
<v Speaker 4>diminished food supply in a just died </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

2913
02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:31.880
<v Speaker 4>but either directly or indirectly as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>result of these catastrophic </v>

2914
02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:34.140
<v Speaker 4>environmental changes that accompanied </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ending of the ice age.</v>

2915
02:40:34.350 --> 02:40:39.350
<v Speaker 4>Humans had to have been affected by this</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of the myths and the stories </v>

2916
02:40:40.770 --> 02:40:43.590
<v Speaker 4>would totally concur with that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2917
02:40:43.591 --> 02:40:44.080
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2918
02:40:44.081 --> 02:40:47.520
<v Speaker 4>that there were humans and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're all consistent with this one</v>

2919
02:40:47.521 --> 02:40:49.390
<v Speaker 4>detail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there were some humans that had for</v>

2920
02:40:49.391 --> 02:40:54.391
<v Speaker 4>knowledge and so they built arcs to </v>
<v Speaker 4>kalea and built an ark just like noah </v>

2921
02:40:54.391 --> 02:40:54.391
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wooten,</v>

2922
02:40:54.391 --> 02:40:57.630
<v Speaker 4>dipesh to built an ark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zissel sutras built an ark man,</v>

2923
02:40:57.660 --> 02:41:01.320
<v Speaker 4>new built an ark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are these stories coming from?</v>

2924
02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:06.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they just completely conjured up </v>

2925
02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:08.481
<v Speaker 4>independently of one another and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>detail is just thrown in or is there </v>

2926
02:41:08.481 --> 02:41:12.000
<v Speaker 4>some kind of a reality behind this that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there were people who had for knowledge?</v>

2927
02:41:12.210 --> 02:41:17.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there were people that had foreign </v>

2928
02:41:17.210 --> 02:41:19.730
<v Speaker 4>success to suggest to me that there were</v>
<v Speaker 4>two groups of survivors,</v>

2929
02:41:20.310 --> 02:41:25.310
<v Speaker 4>those who survived because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>intentionally planned to survive.</v>

2930
02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:29.250
<v Speaker 4>They had for knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They took steps to secure their survival</v>

2931
02:41:29.490 --> 02:41:31.740
<v Speaker 4>in freemasonry there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the account of,</v>

2932
02:41:31.741 --> 02:41:34.680
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of lamech or the account of enoch,</v>

2933
02:41:34.681 --> 02:41:37.200
<v Speaker 4>there's variances on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But enoch,</v>

2934
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:38.670
<v Speaker 4>the story of enoch in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2935
02:41:38.730 --> 02:41:41.610
<v Speaker 4>in masonic tradition says that enoch </v>
<v Speaker 4>had,</v>

2936
02:41:41.611 --> 02:41:42.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was in the,</v>

2937
02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:47.760
<v Speaker 4>into the patriarchs before noah had this</v>
<v Speaker 4>for knowledge,</v>

2938
02:41:47.761 --> 02:41:50.520
<v Speaker 4>that the world was going to be destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 4>either by fire or flood.</v>

2939
02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:55.230
<v Speaker 4>So he created this underground vault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was deep underground,</v>

2940
02:41:55.231 --> 02:42:00.231
<v Speaker 4>and it was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was preserved within nine layers of </v>

2941
02:42:00.231 --> 02:42:03.621
<v Speaker 4>stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was nine layered vault and you only </v>

2942
02:42:03.621 --> 02:42:06.400
<v Speaker 4>in unless you had the key to accessing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2943
02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:11.480
<v Speaker 4>to how to access this vault,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was now like a time capsule that </v>

2944
02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:15.561
<v Speaker 4>preserved the science and the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the wisdom of the [inaudible] world </v>

2945
02:42:16.081 --> 02:42:17.160
<v Speaker 4>or pre flood world.</v>

2946
02:42:18.270 --> 02:42:21.090
<v Speaker 4>He then set up two pillars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pillar of brass,</v>

2947
02:42:21.091 --> 02:42:26.091
<v Speaker 4>and a pillar of marble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pillar of brass designed to </v>

2948
02:42:26.091 --> 02:42:27.660
<v Speaker 4>withstand the effects of the cataclysm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lottery destruction.</v>

2949
02:42:27.930 --> 02:42:30.300
<v Speaker 4>The pillar of marble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm remembering it right,</v>

2950
02:42:30.301 --> 02:42:32.700
<v Speaker 4>was to withstand the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2951
02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:34.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the destruction by fire.</v>

2952
02:42:35.220 --> 02:42:40.220
<v Speaker 4>So there were these two pillars that </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically informed any survivors that </v>

2953
02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:44.541
<v Speaker 4>there was this nine chambered </v>
<v Speaker 4>underground fault that contained the </v>

2954
02:42:44.541 --> 02:42:47.100
<v Speaker 4>secrets of the previous world age that </v>
<v Speaker 4>has what's coming to a pass.</v>

2955
02:42:47.550 --> 02:42:50.490
<v Speaker 4>And that's an intrinsic part of masonic </v>
<v Speaker 4>tradition.</v>

2956
02:42:50.491 --> 02:42:55.491
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole masonic symbolism is based </v>

2957
02:42:55.491 --> 02:42:55.530
<v Speaker 4>around that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2958
02:42:56.220 --> 02:42:59.790
<v Speaker 4>and it has parallels throughout other </v>
<v Speaker 4>traditions as well.</v>

2959
02:43:00.090 --> 02:43:01.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I'm getting at here is if,</v>

2960
02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:07.340
<v Speaker 4>if there was some people who had for </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge of it and took steps to </v>

2961
02:43:07.340 --> 02:43:11.451
<v Speaker 4>survive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were the ones who preserved the </v>

2962
02:43:11.451 --> 02:43:12.290
<v Speaker 4>knowledge of the pre,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2963
02:43:12.310 --> 02:43:14.920
<v Speaker 4>the previous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the antediluvian world order,</v>

2964
02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:18.700
<v Speaker 4>the other survivors just survive by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>luck of the draw.</v>

2965
02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.070
<v Speaker 4>Like that tree standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2966
02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:23.560
<v Speaker 4>They just happened to be in the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>place at the right time.</v>

2967
02:43:23.561 --> 02:43:28.561
<v Speaker 4>They survived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now they are going to be the ones </v>

2968
02:43:28.561 --> 02:43:31.090
<v Speaker 4>who are going to be wholly preoccupied </v>
<v Speaker 4>simply with the task of surviving,</v>

2969
02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:36.120
<v Speaker 4>finding enough food to eat and shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because clearly the planetarium </v>

2970
02:43:36.931 --> 02:43:39.310
<v Speaker 4>environment was going through all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 4>of changes.</v>

2971
02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:44.710
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the other group had taken actual</v>
<v Speaker 4>steps to survive and preserve knowledge.</v>

2972
02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we look at the beginning of </v>

2973
02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:49.980
<v Speaker 4>recorded history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>4,000</v>

2974
02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:53.371
<v Speaker 4>to 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago were basically halfway back </v>

2975
02:43:53.371 --> 02:43:53.371
<v Speaker 4>through the holocene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2976
02:43:53.650 --> 02:43:57.280
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's for purposes of conjecture,</v>

2977
02:43:57.281 --> 02:44:00.910
<v Speaker 4>assumed that the end of the holocene </v>
<v Speaker 4>human population crashed,</v>

2978
02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:02.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2979
02:44:02.861 --> 02:44:04.930
<v Speaker 4>if you want to build a pyramid or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>great temple,</v>

2980
02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:07.090
<v Speaker 4>you've got to have a labor force,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2981
02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:12.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've got scattered bands of </v>

2982
02:44:12.750 --> 02:44:12.820
<v Speaker 4>survivors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you basically aren't going to be able to</v>

2983
02:44:12.821 --> 02:44:13.690
<v Speaker 4>accomplish that.</v>

2984
02:44:14.290 --> 02:44:19.290
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's assume that you've got two groups </v>

2985
02:44:19.290 --> 02:44:21.331
<v Speaker 4>of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one that's sitting there with all of </v>

2986
02:44:21.331 --> 02:44:23.431
<v Speaker 4>this knowledge at their disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like imagine if our modern society </v>

2987
02:44:23.431 --> 02:44:26.440
<v Speaker 4>was wiped off the face of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but somebody somewhere in some deep cave</v>

2988
02:44:26.441 --> 02:44:31.441
<v Speaker 4>underground was able to preserve our </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge of physics and chemistry and </v>

2989
02:44:31.441 --> 02:44:34.000
<v Speaker 4>and the various sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2990
02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:39.150
<v Speaker 4>obviously in order to run this computer </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're running here to do this </v>

2991
02:44:39.150 --> 02:44:41.110
<v Speaker 4>broadcast requires an intact huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intact infrastructure.</v>

2992
02:44:41.111 --> 02:44:42.120
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2993
02:44:42.130 --> 02:44:44.400
<v Speaker 4>we could know how to build a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could know how to do,</v>

2994
02:44:44.470 --> 02:44:47.530
<v Speaker 4>how to broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if we don't have the infrastructure,</v>

2995
02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:49.480
<v Speaker 4>we're just sitting on information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2996
02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:55.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's assume that you have a group that </v>

2997
02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:55.320
<v Speaker 4>survived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2998
02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:59.341
<v Speaker 4>And they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're the custodians of this body of </v>

2999
02:44:59.341 --> 02:45:01.180
<v Speaker 4>knowledge right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes 3000,</v>

3000
02:45:01.181 --> 02:45:02.530
<v Speaker 4>4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>5,000</v>

3001
02:45:02.531 --> 02:45:06.970
<v Speaker 4>years for the human population to </v>
<v Speaker 4>reconstitute itself and now you've got a</v>

3002
02:45:06.971 --> 02:45:11.971
<v Speaker 4>labor force and let's suppose that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna be another cataclysm </v>

3003
02:45:11.971 --> 02:45:12.520
<v Speaker 4>impending,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3004
02:45:12.970 --> 02:45:15.530
<v Speaker 4>such as the one that perhaps caused the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3005
02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:16.690
<v Speaker 4>the noah's flood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

3006
02:45:17.020 --> 02:45:19.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's evidence now that around 5,000</v>

3007
02:45:19.511 --> 02:45:22.780
<v Speaker 4>years ago there was an asteroid impact </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the indian ocean,</v>

3008
02:45:23.470 --> 02:45:23.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3009
02:45:24.250 --> 02:45:27.170
<v Speaker 4>That plunge through two miles of ocean </v>
<v Speaker 4>water and blasted a,</v>

3010
02:45:27.450 --> 02:45:30.970
<v Speaker 4>a 12 mile wide hole on the floor of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>indian ocean.</v>

3011
02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:33.370
<v Speaker 4>And what year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This would have been about 5,000</v>

3012
02:45:33.371 --> 02:45:38.371
<v Speaker 4>years ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much of an impact would that have </v>

3013
02:45:38.371 --> 02:45:38.371
<v Speaker 4>had?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3014
02:45:38.371 --> 02:45:40.000
<v Speaker 4>it would have created tsunamis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3015
02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:44.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm on the island of Madagascar and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>southern island of Madagascar,</v>

3016
02:45:44.801 --> 02:45:49.801
<v Speaker 4>and it should be in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this program that we've got open </v>

3017
02:45:49.801 --> 02:45:49.870
<v Speaker 4>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

3018
02:45:49.930 --> 02:45:54.930
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go to slide number,</v>

3019
02:45:56.420 --> 02:45:58.430
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to slide number 111.</v>

3020
02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:06.520
<v Speaker 4>It's so ironic that today our focus is </v>
<v Speaker 4>closer and closer to the cloud and </v>

3021
02:46:09.621 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 4>closer</v>

3022
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:13.850
<v Speaker 1>to chips to solid state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard drives,</v>

3023
02:46:13.851 --> 02:46:16.430
<v Speaker 1>all these different things that are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to last,</v>

3024
02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:17.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No paper.</v>

3025
02:46:17.901 --> 02:46:18.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one's carbon.</v>

3026
02:46:18.981 --> 02:46:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Anything in stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3027
02:46:21.090 --> 02:46:24.500
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge that we have is like how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of what,</v>

3028
02:46:24.530 --> 02:46:28.980
<v Speaker 1>what everybody has his own hard drives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how much of what everybody has is</v>

3029
02:46:28.981 --> 02:46:32.330
<v Speaker 1>in the cloud on a server somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3030
02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And who the fuck is going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to read that shit a </v>

3031
02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:37.880
<v Speaker 1>thousand years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3032
02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Just anything happened to us.</v>

3033
02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:41.450
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to figure out how to read </v>
<v Speaker 4>egyptian hieroglyphs.</v>

3034
02:46:42.220 --> 02:46:42.770
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at.</v>

3035
02:46:42.860 --> 02:46:47.750
<v Speaker 4>Look at slide number 111.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now wish I had my pointer here.</v>

3036
02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:50.720
<v Speaker 4>Go to the next slide so you can see we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3037
02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:51.920
<v Speaker 4>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>

3038
02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:55.070
<v Speaker 4>you see those weekly things like dragon </v>
<v Speaker 4>scales?</v>

3039
02:46:55.130 --> 02:46:58.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What that is is it's water,</v>

3040
02:46:59.090 --> 02:47:04.090
<v Speaker 4>ocean water that washed on land and </v>
<v Speaker 4>washed up and you see it kind of comes </v>

3041
02:47:04.251 --> 02:47:07.640
<v Speaker 4>to a point and then it washed back out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

3042
02:47:07.670 --> 02:47:12.670
<v Speaker 4>this is a tsunami deposit and those few </v>
<v Speaker 4>features that you're looking at,</v>

3043
02:47:12.681 --> 02:47:15.740
<v Speaker 4>the kind of look like this there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she called chevron's right?</v>

3044
02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:18.860
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens when the water </v>
<v Speaker 4>washes in,</v>

3045
02:47:18.980 --> 02:47:22.930
<v Speaker 4>makes deposits of giant ripples and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>washes back.</v>

3046
02:47:23.100 --> 02:47:25.610
<v Speaker 4>What kind of timeframe are you talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about when this happens?</v>

3047
02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:30.670
<v Speaker 4>How long statistics do the oh hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that all happened in hours.</v>

3048
02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:33.590
<v Speaker 4>In hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could still see it today.</v>

3049
02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:35.000
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go to the next slide.</v>

3050
02:47:35.001 --> 02:47:37.880
<v Speaker 4>Jamey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting a closer up look here.</v>

3051
02:47:37.881 --> 02:47:40.670
<v Speaker 4>Now you see how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see how they're shaped.</v>

3052
02:47:40.671 --> 02:47:44.630
<v Speaker 4>Almost like that's the chevron,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a sergeant stripe almost,</v>

3053
02:47:44.650 --> 02:47:45.500
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3054
02:47:45.501 --> 02:47:48.080
<v Speaker 4>Go to the next slide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3055
02:47:48.081 --> 02:47:53.020
<v Speaker 4>Here's a cross section of one of those v</v>
<v Speaker 4>shaped hills at 600 feet in height.</v>

3056
02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>

3057
02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Now what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're seeing in the back.</v>

3058
02:47:58.081 --> 02:47:59.160
<v Speaker 1>That up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One more jamie.</v>

3059
02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:04.290
<v Speaker 1>So those images right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're seeing there,</v>

3060
02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:08.520
<v Speaker 1>it looks like the effects of a river or </v>
<v Speaker 1>water or something.</v>

3061
02:48:08.530 --> 02:48:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It is water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3062
02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:12.000
<v Speaker 1>But then when you go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it from the ground.</v>

3063
02:48:12.420 --> 02:48:13.860
<v Speaker 1>It looks like hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3064
02:48:13.861 --> 02:48:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Six hundred feet high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about a massive amount</v>

3065
02:48:17.701 --> 02:48:18.120
<v Speaker 1>of water.</v>

3066
02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:22.680
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about a tsunami whose </v>
<v Speaker 4>minimum run up height is the height,</v>

3067
02:48:22.681 --> 02:48:25.860
<v Speaker 4>the thickness of these hills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>600 feet minimum,</v>

3068
02:48:25.861 --> 02:48:30.861
<v Speaker 4>minimum minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's of course massive amount of </v>

3069
02:48:30.861 --> 02:48:32.430
<v Speaker 4>weight and devastation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this was all 5,000</v>

3070
02:48:32.431 --> 02:48:33.160
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3071
02:48:33.210 --> 02:48:34.410
<v Speaker 4>Go to the next slide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jamie.</v>

3072
02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:36.960
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3073
02:48:37.210 --> 02:48:38.050
<v Speaker 4>keep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3074
02:48:38.060 --> 02:48:43.060
<v Speaker 4>There's Madagascar location of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chevrons on the southern edge of </v>

3075
02:48:43.060 --> 02:48:43.940
<v Speaker 4>Madagascar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

3076
02:48:43.941 --> 02:48:45.470
<v Speaker 4>Go to slides up</v>

3077
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:47.300
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

3078
02:48:47.990 --> 02:48:52.990
<v Speaker 4>over on the other side at the same age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we look at the southwestern coast of </v>

3079
02:48:53.151 --> 02:48:54.800
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the next slide,</v>

3080
02:48:54.801 --> 02:48:56.990
<v Speaker 4>we'll get a closer in view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There we go.</v>

3081
02:48:56.991 --> 02:48:58.950
<v Speaker 4>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Splurge.</v>

3082
02:48:59.330 --> 02:49:04.330
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the technical scientific term </v>

3083
02:49:04.330 --> 02:49:05.330
<v Speaker 4>isn't really blueedge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3084
02:49:05.331 --> 02:49:07.950
<v Speaker 4>I just made that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You bet.</v>

3085
02:49:07.951 --> 02:49:08.040
<v Speaker 4>You</v>

3086
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:13.040
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the stuff that's been washed </v>

3087
02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:13.040
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see it.</v>

3088
02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:13.040
<v Speaker 1>It's very clear there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3089
02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:18.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the other side of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other side of the ocean directly </v>

3090
02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:21.210
<v Speaker 1>opposite of where this thing impacted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3091
02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Go to the next massive impact in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

3092
02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ancient crash.</v>

3093
02:49:27.210 --> 02:49:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Epic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

3094
02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:31.470
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to that slide where from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the word says ancient crash,</v>

3095
02:49:31.471 --> 02:49:33.720
<v Speaker 1>epic wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next slide.</v>

3096
02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Keep going right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>

3097
02:49:36.810 --> 02:49:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Can we read that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3098
02:49:38.230 --> 02:49:43.230
<v Speaker 1>The southern end of Madagascar lie for </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous wedge shaped deposits called </v>

3099
02:49:43.230 --> 02:49:45.210
<v Speaker 1>chevrons that are composed of material </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the ocean floor.</v>

3100
02:49:45.211 --> 02:49:50.211
<v Speaker 1>Each covers twice the area of manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 1>with sediment as deep as the chrysler </v>

3101
02:49:50.211 --> 02:49:54.861
<v Speaker 1>building is high on close inspection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chevron deposits contained deep </v>

3102
02:49:54.861 --> 02:49:59.301
<v Speaker 1>ocean microfossils that are fused with </v>
<v Speaker 1>medley of metals typically form by </v>

3103
02:50:01.051 --> 02:50:03.330
<v Speaker 1>cosmic impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3104
02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3105
02:50:05.580 --> 02:50:06.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>

3106
02:50:07.590 --> 02:50:10.590
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that happened 4,000,</v>

3107
02:50:10.591 --> 02:50:12.430
<v Speaker 1>800 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3108
02:50:12.650 --> 02:50:17.650
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of an impact would that have </v>

3109
02:50:17.650 --> 02:50:17.650
<v Speaker 1>had on human civilization?</v>

3110
02:50:17.650 --> 02:50:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it pretty much would have wiped out</v>

3111
02:50:19.141 --> 02:50:22.200
<v Speaker 1>anything adjacent to the indian ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything close to it.</v>

3112
02:50:22.410 --> 02:50:24.420
<v Speaker 1>But what about on the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet?</v>

3113
02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would have to be some massive </v>

3114
02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:29.480
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3115
02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:29.480
<v Speaker 1>there would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>

3116
02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:32.400
<v Speaker 1>What we would see on the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet is extreme weather events,</v>

3117
02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:35.310
<v Speaker 1>hurricanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>torrential rain falls,</v>

3118
02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:40.340
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winter kill a huge amount of people </v>

3119
02:50:40.340 --> 02:50:40.970
<v Speaker 1>worldwide could kill a human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge amount of people worldwide.</v>

3120
02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3121
02:50:42.490 --> 02:50:44.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that is probably the most recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3122
02:50:44.850 --> 02:50:49.850
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the most recent and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>record of it because people really </v>

3123
02:50:49.850 --> 02:50:54.561
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the record of it is probably </v>

3124
02:50:54.561 --> 02:50:56.490
<v Speaker 1>when we see these stories like noah's </v>
<v Speaker 1>flood and the rest.</v>

3125
02:50:56.520 --> 02:51:00.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's probably about this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not even about the holocene one.</v>

3126
02:51:00.001 --> 02:51:03.060
<v Speaker 1>It's about one 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years after the house in one.</v>

3127
02:51:03.090 --> 02:51:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3128
02:51:04.741 --> 02:51:09.741
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're beginning to realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>now is that these events have happened </v>

3129
02:51:09.741 --> 02:51:11.880
<v Speaker 1>with a much greater degree of frequency </v>
<v Speaker 1>than anybody hit imagined.</v>

3130
02:51:12.930 --> 02:51:14.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulations.</v>

3131
02:51:14.341 --> 02:51:16.890
<v Speaker 1>You freaked me the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say,</v>

3132
02:51:16.891 --> 02:51:19.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had an objective and you pull it off</v>

3133
02:51:19.680 --> 02:51:24.300
<v Speaker 1>of five stars a plus freakout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3134
02:51:24.510 --> 02:51:26.730
<v Speaker 1>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been an intense three hours.</v>

3135
02:51:26.731 --> 02:51:28.380
<v Speaker 1>It just flew by three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3136
02:51:28.381 --> 02:51:29.850
<v Speaker 1>we just did three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3137
02:51:29.880 --> 02:51:31.110
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3138
02:51:31.170 --> 02:51:32.180
<v Speaker 1>That amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3139
02:51:32.290 --> 02:51:37.290
<v Speaker 1>We got to do this again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you could talk for another 16 </v>

3140
02:51:37.290 --> 02:51:37.290
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3141
02:51:37.290 --> 02:51:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've barely scratched the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface here.</v>

3142
02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

3143
02:51:38.761 --> 02:51:40.980
<v Speaker 1>let's do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a couple months off,</v>

3144
02:51:41.010 --> 02:51:42.930
<v Speaker 1>regroup and come back in again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3145
02:51:42.940 --> 02:51:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to do some more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for doing this.</v>

3146
02:51:45.211 --> 02:51:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really appreciate it.</v>

3147
02:51:46.751 --> 02:51:49.350
<v Speaker 1>It is incredibly enjoyable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly enlightening for me.</v>

3148
02:51:49.351 --> 02:51:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really appreciate it.</v>

3149
02:51:50.941 --> 02:51:55.941
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was going to be like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the brief conversation that we had </v>

3150
02:51:55.941 --> 02:51:55.941
<v Speaker 1>a chance to have in atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3151
02:51:55.941 --> 02:52:00.860
<v Speaker 1>many years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking forward to talking to </v>

3152
02:52:00.860 --> 02:52:00.860
<v Speaker 1>you again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for doing this.</v>

3153
02:52:00.860 --> 02:52:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been awesome.</v>

3154
02:52:01.501 --> 02:52:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have enjoyed it.</v>

3155
02:52:02.711 --> 02:52:05.800
<v Speaker 1>If people want to research more your </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

3156
02:52:05.801 --> 02:52:06.130
<v Speaker 1>read</v>

3157
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:08.020
<v Speaker 4>more of your stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where can they go?</v>

3158
02:52:08.021 --> 02:52:09.400
<v Speaker 4>Where can they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what can they find?</v>

3159
02:52:09.430 --> 02:52:13.090
<v Speaker 4>Go to sacred geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>international.com</v>

3160
02:52:13.150 --> 02:52:18.150
<v Speaker 4>and there are links there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got another website that linked </v>

3161
02:52:18.150 --> 02:52:19.870
<v Speaker 4>from there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like in sacred geometry,</v>

3162
02:52:19.871 --> 02:52:21.880
<v Speaker 4>international idea with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different stuff.</v>

3163
02:52:21.910 --> 02:52:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Not directly connected necessarily with </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we're talking about here,</v>

3164
02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:29.800
<v Speaker 4>but there'll be links to another website</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I've got where I'm really exploring</v>

3165
02:52:29.801 --> 02:52:33.640
<v Speaker 4>like the catastrophic stuff or I've got </v>
<v Speaker 4>lots of images of,</v>

3166
02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:35.290
<v Speaker 4>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3167
02:52:36.310 --> 02:52:41.310
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I've done lots and lots of field </v>

3168
02:52:41.310 --> 02:52:43.710
<v Speaker 4>exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have thousands of images of just </v>

3169
02:52:43.710 --> 02:52:46.540
<v Speaker 4>awesome stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it sacred geometry have anything to</v>

3170
02:52:46.541 --> 02:52:49.270
<v Speaker 4>do with this stuff or is that a totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>different sacred geometry?</v>

3171
02:52:49.480 --> 02:52:53.830
<v Speaker 4>Put it this way as we've inherited this </v>
<v Speaker 4>corpus of ancient knowledge,</v>

3172
02:52:53.860 --> 02:52:58.860
<v Speaker 4>sacred geometry is one of the keys for </v>
<v Speaker 4>deciphering these ancient traditions </v>

3173
02:52:58.871 --> 02:53:03.871
<v Speaker 4>because all of these ancient temple </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures which are the textbooks in </v>

3174
02:53:03.871 --> 02:53:06.700
<v Speaker 4>stone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you will have several components in,</v>

3175
02:53:06.730 --> 02:53:11.730
<v Speaker 4>in common astronomical and geometrical </v>
<v Speaker 4>being the two predominant.</v>

3176
02:53:12.220 --> 02:53:17.220
<v Speaker 4>And if you understand the geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize the geometry is like a </v>

3177
02:53:17.220 --> 02:53:20.341
<v Speaker 4>universal code by where whereby you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>preserve certain types of information </v>

3178
02:53:21.250 --> 02:53:26.250
<v Speaker 4>because geometry is universal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what your spoken </v>

3179
02:53:26.250 --> 02:53:27.400
<v Speaker 4>language is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the principles of geometry are what they</v>

3180
02:53:27.401 --> 02:53:28.630
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3181
02:53:28.631 --> 02:53:33.631
<v Speaker 4>the relationship of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a radius to a circle is the same and </v>

3182
02:53:33.631 --> 02:53:34.870
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter what culture you come </v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

3183
02:53:35.020 --> 02:53:40.020
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so geometry is a critical means of </v>

3184
02:53:40.020 --> 02:53:43.060
<v Speaker 4>decipher the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the knoWledge that and I think that the,</v>

3185
02:53:43.230 --> 02:53:48.230
<v Speaker 4>that the predominant way of preserving </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient knowledge is in the temple </v>

3186
02:53:48.230 --> 02:53:52.381
<v Speaker 4>structures and they have to be looked at</v>
<v Speaker 4>as textbooks in stone and once we begin </v>

3187
02:53:52.381 --> 02:53:53.830
<v Speaker 4>to realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we can go.</v>

3188
02:53:54.190 --> 02:53:59.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you go to Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just the hieroglyphs that's a </v>

3189
02:53:59.190 --> 02:54:02.191
<v Speaker 4>part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also the geometry and the </v>

3190
02:54:02.191 --> 02:54:04.180
<v Speaker 4>astronomy that's encoded there and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>can see the same astronomy at work,</v>

3191
02:54:04.181 --> 02:54:09.181
<v Speaker 4>whether we're looking in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether in geometry or whether we're </v>

3192
02:54:09.181 --> 02:54:11.140
<v Speaker 4>looking at megalithic structures in </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient england or whether we're looking</v>

3193
02:54:11.141 --> 02:54:11.790
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3194
02:54:12.100 --> 02:54:17.100
<v Speaker 4>mega a monumental earthworks up in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ohio valley or we're looking at this,</v>

3195
02:54:17.770 --> 02:54:19.780
<v Speaker 4>the mind you've been to teach an eatsa.</v>

3196
02:54:20.020 --> 02:54:21.190
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3197
02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:26.460
<v Speaker 4>That whole complex there is laid out </v>
<v Speaker 4>according to principles of sacred </v>

3198
02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:29.851
<v Speaker 4>geometry and astronomy and it's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same principles underlying that is </v>

3199
02:54:31.361 --> 02:54:33.820
<v Speaker 4>we find in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That will be our next conversation.</v>
