<v Speaker 1>Got Real.</v>

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>We've got a real mix now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

15
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Solidarity if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

16
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>When you talk right into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it so much better.</v>

17
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>We were having problems when we first </v>
<v Speaker 1>started doing this.</v>

18
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>We just figured out how to do a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically without asking anybody.</v>

19
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>We just trial and error and we fucked a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of shit up and.</v>

20
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>But the biggest thing we fucked up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning was the sound.</v>

21
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>The sound was really bad at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we've got that shit locked down </v>

22
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>so that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

23
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>He's practicing.</v>

24
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Hold the mic like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like smoking a cigarette and </v>

25
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 2>France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What movie is this front?</v>

26
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a movie where a guy singing </v>
<v Speaker 2>karaoke and he's holding the mic like </v>

27
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.530
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

28
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a many used to hang it in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his face like this.</v>

29
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who it was like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking a cock right here.</v>

30
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never said it.</v>

31
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>That flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

32
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we go anywhere.</v>

33
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>We're sponsored by the fleshlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This podcast is a sponsored park at </v>

34
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll be quite honest with you,</v>

35
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 1>if we were not sponsored by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleshlight and um,</v>

36
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just became a subject of the </v>

37
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Speaker 1>conversation of the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will tell you,</v>

38
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>go buy one of those fucking things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

39
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't be embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody jerks off.</v>

40
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>It's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

41
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>if you jerk off and you wouldn't fuck a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber pussy,</v>

42
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just pleasure.</v>

43
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it feels way better than jerk.</v>

44
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I got</v>

45
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 2>a good flashlight story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's hear.</v>

47
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 2>It's about when I bought it about maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

48
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had it for awhile.</v>

49
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.840
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've used it maybe a 20 times right now.</v>

50
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking pretty good if you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to jerk off something about your own </v>

51
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Speaker 2>hand touching your cock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancels out some feeling or something,</v>

52
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel as good as someone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>jerking you off or whatever.</v>

53
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 2>So that's where the fleshlight comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

54
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.230
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels pretty fucking good.</v>

55
00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:22.300
<v Speaker 2>You got the right part or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

56
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.960
<v Speaker 2>about three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe two years ago,</v>

57
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I met this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

58
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 2>when we were on the road in Texas </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>

59
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 2>maybe Houston or Dallas or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

60
00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 2>I was on the road with you met her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

61
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 2>we kept in touch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She came out to La and um,</v>

62
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 2>hung out for a weekend and for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason she wasn't down at all.</v>

63
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.060
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't done at all.</v>

64
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 2>She didn't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't want me to touch her.</v>

65
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:52.971
<v Speaker 2>Now she's staying at my fucking house </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she doesn't even want to touch me </v>

66
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:57.680
<v Speaker 2>and kiss her or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I decided to take her to the hustler </v>

67
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 2>store and go shopping for a fleshlight </v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing.</v>

68
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 2>So she couldn't fucking believe that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I was kidding.</v>

69
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Then I went to the store to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 2>flashlight.</v>

70
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

71
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 2>if you're not going to give me the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pussy,</v>

72
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:09.570
<v Speaker 2>I got to know this is the second best </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

73
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Can invite another girl over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

74
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:14.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my fleshlight store.</v>

75
00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I used it that night too while she </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed out and in.</v>

76
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Just cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>

77
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>It's better than using your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better than using your hand.</v>

78
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.370
<v Speaker 2>If you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could hire a Mexican to clean it </v>

79
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.370
<v Speaker 2>up afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it would be awesome.</v>

80
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just the cleanup Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does it have to be a Mexican man?</v>

81
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 2>They worked cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to put a white male,</v>

82
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 2>white dude to clean up your flashlight </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're done.</v>

83
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 2>You got to go to home depot and pick up </v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of guys and they'll switch off</v>

84
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.020
<v Speaker 3>target the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was these things called magic </v>

85
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.081
<v Speaker 3>microphones for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a kid's toy that looks just like a </v>

86
00:03:51.081 --> 00:03:51.081
<v Speaker 3>fleshlight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at it,</v>

87
00:03:51.081 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

88
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 3>the same company that makes flashlights </v>
<v Speaker 3>must also make this mike on my God.</v>

89
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.090
<v Speaker 3>And so I pick it up and I go to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend,</v>

90
00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:57.540
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.610
<v Speaker 3>they got flashlights here and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look.</v>

92
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:00.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh stupid.</v>

93
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:03.000
<v Speaker 3>I look around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's kids everywhere in mom's looking</v>

94
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:05.400
<v Speaker 3>at me and if I cough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck yes.</v>

95
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.060
<v Speaker 1>It's funny how it's got a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

96
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bad feeling attached to it </v>

97
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>that there's something wrong with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber pussy.</v>

98
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.180
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong with pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was just a massage thing,</v>

99
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.140
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

100
00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I got a massage and makes your backfill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

101
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.910

<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

103
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>There's something about making your dick</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel awesome.</v>

104
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:26.670
<v Speaker 1>That freaks everybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which would freak out if your son.</v>

105
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 2>I was using the flashlight at 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that be bad?</v>

106
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.620
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

107
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

108
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.400
<v Speaker 1>First Birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

109
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

110
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 1>you're body is a biological organism </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't understand you know,</v>

111
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wants you to make decisions for it,</v>

112
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.920
<v Speaker 1>not for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to try to trick you into </v>

113
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>fucking someone with no condom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having babies.</v>

114
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what your body's trying to do.</v>

115
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And it can get real confusing who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually like as opposed to like who </v>

116
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>your Dick is telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know when you're horny all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

118
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.930
<v Speaker 1>your Dick convinces you that you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you don't even like just because </v>

119
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.930
<v Speaker 1>you could fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

120
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>And for a kid when you're just learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get into relationships,</v>

121
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.490
<v Speaker 1>that shit's very tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think every young kid could benefit </v>

122
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.850
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should teach kids how to jerk off </v>

123
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.011
<v Speaker 1>in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should teach kids how your Dick is </v>

124
00:05:14.011 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 1>going to confuse you and how it's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to send you all these messages.</v>

125
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.290
<v Speaker 1>And being horny is actually a baffling </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that takes years and years to </v>

126
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can make.</v>

127
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Hannah Montana flashlights came at </v>
<v Speaker 1>$20,000,000,000</v>

128
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that would be illegal if she</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's all about.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like it's all about.</v>

282
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.610
<v Speaker 5>It's all about like trapping them in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>

283
00:11:25.611 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 5>in their pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not even really asking them.</v>

284
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 5>It's like part of the hustle for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For Joey.</v>

285
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 5>You trick them.</v>

286
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's gonna make people a lot </v>

287
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.541
<v Speaker 2>more faithful because I really believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like twitter and facebook and </v>

288
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:40.350
<v Speaker 2>facebook has really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it so hard to cheat.</v>

289
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

290
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more single people because</v>

291
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:48.891
<v Speaker 2>it's way too hard and a cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you decide to have a girlfriend </v>

292
00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:48.891
<v Speaker 2>or boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

293
00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't even going to try.</v>

294
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.750
<v Speaker 2>You make a comment on one person's </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

295
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows that you just commented </v>
<v Speaker 2>on</v>

296
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.410
<v Speaker 5>some girl's picture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

297
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.530
<v Speaker 5>so it's like you don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't even bother,</v>

298
00:11:57.531 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 5>so you might as well be faith and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not going to stay where it's at.</v>

299
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.730
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's gonna move on to some next </v>

300
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.531
<v Speaker 5>craziness and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that has to do with this iphone </v>

301
00:12:07.531 --> 00:12:09.991
<v Speaker 5>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the next stage of </v>

302
00:12:09.991 --> 00:12:11.491
<v Speaker 5>craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The next stage of intrusion into </v>

303
00:12:11.491 --> 00:12:11.491
<v Speaker 5>people's lives and some people are going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to reject it.</v>

304
00:12:11.491 --> 00:12:13.470
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you do just like textbook?</v>

305
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.780
<v Speaker 5>Just like texts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like picture messages.</v>

306
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.820
<v Speaker 5>So like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why when people are freaking out </v>

307
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:20.820
<v Speaker 5>about flash,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

308
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:20.820
<v Speaker 5>I feel the same thing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

309
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.780
<v Speaker 5>you people are freaking out because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not thinking ahead,</v>

310
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.700
<v Speaker 5>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not thinking about what's next or</v>

311
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:27.130
<v Speaker 5>what's going to be the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just say freaking them out.</v>

312
00:12:27.131 --> 00:12:31.650
<v Speaker 5>Flash for the non technologically a </v>
<v Speaker 5>macromedia flash what?</v>

313
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.370
<v Speaker 5>Macromedia flash is a program on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>websites when you see like animation and</v>

314
00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:37.680
<v Speaker 5>different kinds of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

315
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 5>you put your cursor over something and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it does some funky thing.</v>

316
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.450
<v Speaker 5>Most of the time you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>flash and a lot of these sites and </v>

317
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.211
<v Speaker 5>apparently flash crashes a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had a crush a bunch of times on me </v>

318
00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 5>and Microsoft has their own version of </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

319
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Silver Light.</v>

320
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what's cool is that there's actually</v>

321
00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:57.130
<v Speaker 5>companies now that have software that if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you put it into flash,</v>

322
00:12:57.131 --> 00:13:02.131
<v Speaker 5>and I guess flash is working with this </v>
<v Speaker 5>company that if you go to this website </v>

323
00:13:02.131 --> 00:13:05.881
<v Speaker 5>and it has flash,</v>
<v Speaker 5>flash will detect that you do not have </v>

324
00:13:05.881 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 5>flash on your ipad or whatever and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>will convert it into an html five point.</v>

325
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.260
<v Speaker 5>Oh uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a program or whatever.</v>

326
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:12.730
<v Speaker 5>So that's what youtube does.</v>

327
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:18.330
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think youtube just uses a different </v>

328
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.550
<v Speaker 5>CODEC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some websites where you can go </v>

329
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.710
<v Speaker 5>to on the IPAD and you can still watch </v>
<v Speaker 5>videos and that's html five.</v>

330
00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:21.970
<v Speaker 5>You're watching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're watching it.</v>

331
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:25.660
<v Speaker 5>Just a flashes has moved on from our </v>
<v Speaker 5>youtube.</v>

332
00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:29.380
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't use flash as much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It uses I a Codec h two point six,</v>

333
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 5>four,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe.</v>

334
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.020
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's not even in flash anymore.</v>

335
00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:33.050
<v Speaker 5>You're watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

336
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:38.370
<v Speaker 5>you're just watching a video file.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right that people are </v>

337
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.060
<v Speaker 5>hesitant to change and then they worry </v>
<v Speaker 5>about flash falling apart and you know,</v>

338
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 5>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh this is crazy.</v>

339
00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:43.060
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my website is coded like this and that's</v>

340
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:48.090
<v Speaker 5>just how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when new shit comes along that's </v>

341
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:48.090
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just got to accept it,</v>

342
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.280
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what's more fascinating to me </v>

343
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 5>than anything is a facetime thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

344
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.370
<v Speaker 5>the rise of the droid phones do a droid </v>
<v Speaker 5>phones or luck an infection.</v>

345
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:02.370
<v Speaker 5>There's like so many Goddamn droid </v>
<v Speaker 5>phones now and they do everything the </v>

346
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.061
<v Speaker 5>iphone does and more like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what the iphone has,</v>

347
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the front face feature.</v>

348
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 5>That's a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

349
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 5>Blackberry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blackberry,</v>

350
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 5>blackberry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still number one droids nothing new.</v>

351
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:16.430
<v Speaker 5>It's just an operating system like </v>
<v Speaker 5>windows mobile wise.</v>

352
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.890
<v Speaker 5>These are dope ass phones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dope.</v>

353
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.680
<v Speaker 5>Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As phones that are doing something </v>

354
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:24.680
<v Speaker 5>that's trying to be like an iphone now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

355
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's not doing it as good.</v>

356
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 5>If you use any application on a droid </v>
<v Speaker 5>and compare it to the iphone version,</v>

357
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 5>almost 99 point nine percent of the time</v>
<v Speaker 5>it falls a little short.</v>

358
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:34.190
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

359
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're saying this based on the little </v>

360
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:39.200
<v Speaker 5>experience that you had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

361
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:39.200
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

362
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.980
<v Speaker 5>I've had it for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to straight for a month and I </v>

363
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.730
<v Speaker 5>know from that operating system what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were doing back then is the same as</v>

364
00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 5>now it's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the exact same.</v>

365
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.140
<v Speaker 5>I use the newest one that had the newest</v>
<v Speaker 5>version.</v>

366
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 5>It's the to Motorola</v>

367
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 3>droid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

368
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Which is not supposed to be as good as </v>
<v Speaker 3>this htc evo.</v>

369
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about the hardware </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

370
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 3>You're not talking about the operating </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

371
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean didn't,</v>

372
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.820
<v Speaker 3>didn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just an htc alter the operating </v>

373
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.670
<v Speaker 3>system a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It puts a skin on it that just makes it.</v>

374
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.700
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a skin off the operating </v>

375
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.621
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We make your work more effectively and </v>

376
00:15:11.621 --> 00:15:11.621
<v Speaker 3>some say that hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some say it's better.</v>

377
00:15:11.621 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 3>You know what it does is it gives you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice little widget at the front that has</v>

378
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:15.010
<v Speaker 3>the weather and a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

379
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 3>Well just saying that the iphone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

380
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll agree with you.</v>

381
00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:23.551
<v Speaker 3>You believe the iphone is better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still a fucking amazing phone </v>

382
00:15:23.551 --> 00:15:24.500
<v Speaker 3>and if it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it existed a year ago,</v>

383
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.520
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be freaking the fuck out of </v>

384
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:29.520
<v Speaker 3>existed five years ago.</v>

385
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:29.520
<v Speaker 3>It'd be world changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five years ago.</v>

386
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 3>I would probably be freaking out a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

387
00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:34.190
<v Speaker 3>I doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very impressive phone.</v>

388
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That phone hardware itself is great,</v>

389
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:41.110
<v Speaker 3>but when you compare like somebody was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going off on the other day about how </v>

390
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.110
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

391
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.150
<v Speaker 3>this has an eight mega pixel camera or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the new iphone only has a five megapixel</v>

392
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 3>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

393
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.820
<v Speaker 3>mega pixels don't mean shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why like every year we've stopped</v>

394
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 3>like at 12 megapixels for most cameras </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you notice like most Sony cameras</v>

395
00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:55.910
<v Speaker 3>that were 12 megapixels last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now 10 megapixel.</v>

396
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why doesn't mean shit?</v>

397
00:15:57.561 --> 00:16:02.561
<v Speaker 3>I mean those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mega pixels doesn't mean much </v>

398
00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:02.760
<v Speaker 3>information is in the photograph and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mega pixels don't mean shit.</v>

399
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.240
<v Speaker 3>It means something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Camera sucks.</v>

400
00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 3>We know that 12 megapixel cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

401
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 3>You could blow up giant bill bright's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it does mean something.</v>

402
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.580
<v Speaker 3>It means something to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means something to a point.</v>

403
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:16.760
<v Speaker 3>But the most important thing is the lens</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the actual,</v>

404
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quality of photo.</v>

405
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

406
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:20.290
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes a new.</v>

407
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 3>The new iphone camera has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what most normal camels are just </v>

408
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.760
<v Speaker 3>switching to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this a coil that goes around the </v>

409
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.350
<v Speaker 3>lens and it used to be where the coil </v>
<v Speaker 3>was in front of the lens optics.</v>

410
00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:34.930
<v Speaker 3>So when you take a photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

411
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:40.140
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the light has to go through all these </v>

412
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.921
<v Speaker 3>coils in order to take a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now they found out how to fight the </v>

413
00:16:41.921 --> 00:16:41.921
<v Speaker 3>coil on the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the light,</v>

414
00:16:41.921 --> 00:16:43.760
<v Speaker 3>there's more light that goes in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes in there.</v>

415
00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:47.390
<v Speaker 3>So many calls that the Xmo our lens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it's called,</v>

416
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.560
<v Speaker 3>but now so now this new iphone's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have better low light just because </v>

417
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.300
<v Speaker 3>they decided to do this new coil </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

418
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.350
<v Speaker 3>So that alone photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality megapixel doesn't mean shit.</v>

419
00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.990
<v Speaker 3>It really means something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Brian,</v>

420
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 3>you're getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

421
00:17:00.801 --> 00:17:01.140
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

422
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.570
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm being serious.</v>

423
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Megapixels did not mean shit anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to like five megapixels </v>

424
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.070
<v Speaker 3>and above eight megapixels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 10 to 12 megapixels.</v>

425
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight to 12.</v>

426
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 3>There's barely anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it still means something.</v>

427
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're doing billboards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what's important is the lens and </v>

428
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.500
<v Speaker 3>how important the software they use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also important.</v>

429
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.510
<v Speaker 3>You know what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how the.</v>

430
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:28.570
<v Speaker 3>That's why you have these Carl Zeiss </v>
<v Speaker 3>lenses and shit on all these different </v>

431
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:28.570
<v Speaker 3>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

432
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:29.510
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to get the dopest lens as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

433
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

434
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:33.500
<v Speaker 3>Over a certain point it's negligible and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a bad motherfucker.</v>

435
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:37.100
<v Speaker 3>You knowledge of all this shit is </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable.</v>

436
00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:40.010
<v Speaker 3>You frequent it comes to this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I think of the iphone,</v>

437
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.500
<v Speaker 3>who knows when I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but God it,</v>

438
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.950
<v Speaker 3>they just solved everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got the video camera sucked.</v>

439
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.110
<v Speaker 3>I use it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not now it's HP.</v>

440
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.680
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

441
00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 3>that's still true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

442
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.980
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's even,</v>

443
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

444
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I barely talk on the phone anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't give a shit.</v>

445
00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.060
<v Speaker 2>What I care about is video pictures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>texting.</v>

446
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 2>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And emails and stuff and then you get on</v>

447
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:04.510
<v Speaker 2>twitter and all that stops to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>credible.</v>

448
00:18:04.511 --> 00:18:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about talking to Peter's </v>
<v Speaker 2>applications</v>

449
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.530
<v Speaker 1>on your phone that you can time rounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

450
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.050
<v Speaker 1>It was like a gym boss where you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>time your workouts,</v>

451
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a free application to you.</v>

452
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 1>You could set it so that it'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll put interval training into your </v>

453
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.661
<v Speaker 1>workouts and give you like different </v>
<v Speaker 1>alarms like when you run and when you </v>

454
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:21.661
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you rest,</v>

455
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:21.661
<v Speaker 1>when you go.</v>

456
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:25.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean the flash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Webcam at the HD video,</v>

457
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.660
<v Speaker 2>five megapixels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn think</v>

458
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

459
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.280
<v Speaker 1>these new droid phones are catching up</v>

460
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:36.400
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're totally catching up and I hope </v>

461
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.381
<v Speaker 3>they beat the iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is if all these droid </v>

462
00:18:38.381 --> 00:18:38.381
<v Speaker 3>user saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck,</v>

463
00:18:38.381 --> 00:18:38.381
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone,</v>

464
00:18:38.381 --> 00:18:38.381
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

465
00:18:38.381 --> 00:18:43.360
<v Speaker 3>get this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's your facebook and you want to do </v>

466
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:43.970
<v Speaker 3>like a comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is your facebook on your application</v>

467
00:18:43.971 --> 00:18:45.510
<v Speaker 3>facebook and compared to iphones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apple,</v>

468
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 3>twitter in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

469
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Don't they update those food?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am on every single website everyday on</v>

470
00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:56.381
<v Speaker 3>both the joy and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what's going on with </v>

471
00:18:56.381 --> 00:18:58.450
<v Speaker 3>android versus iphone every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

472
00:18:58.451 --> 00:19:00.710
<v Speaker 3>totally common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a common argument?</v>

473
00:19:00.711 --> 00:19:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Dude?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's common with down the line.</v>

474
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Every program that you get for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone is it's way more fine tuned on </v>

475
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.381
<v Speaker 3>the iphone for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's on purpose or if </v>

476
00:19:11.381 --> 00:19:12.500
<v Speaker 3>it's just the length or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that developers or what,</v>

477
00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:15.610
<v Speaker 3>but like even the twitter applications </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the same with the palm tree.</v>

478
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.010
<v Speaker 3>The palm pre should have been fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>the number one phone.</v>

479
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.750
<v Speaker 3>That should have been way bigger than it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

480
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.170
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is every single </v>
<v Speaker 3>application like their facebook,</v>

481
00:19:24.171 --> 00:19:27.050
<v Speaker 3>their twitter and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even come close to the iphone</v>

482
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:27.840
<v Speaker 3>and it's still</v>

483
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.380
<v Speaker 1>killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that it was on sprint.</v>

484
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:36.850
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you as having a palm pre plus</v>
<v Speaker 3>that every single program that you can </v>

485
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:37.570
<v Speaker 3>download for that thing sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

486
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Compared to the iphone versions and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pump has been out for a year plus longer</v>

487
00:19:41.541 --> 00:19:44.390
<v Speaker 3>than the web.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that'll be doing shit doing shit.</v>

488
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

489
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.330
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because the palm pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like the number one selling product </v>

490
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.541
<v Speaker 1>that a sprint that have launched as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone until this a htc evo came along </v>

491
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.690
<v Speaker 1>and they're saying this pump everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really what's.</v>

492
00:19:57.691 --> 00:20:00.000
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about it was it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the number one thing,</v>

493
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:02.190
<v Speaker 1>but then it petered out and nobody gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fuck about it.</v>

494
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:07.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no one's like in line to get palm </v>

495
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:07.550
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>

496
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

497
00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Remember the trio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trio with the trio.</v>

498
00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.610

<v Speaker 2>The trio was the was.</v>

<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

500
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I remember wanting to bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when you gave me your trio,</v>

501
00:20:21.711 --> 00:20:22.670
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that first day.</v>

502
00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

503

<v Speaker 2>I remember I had,</v>

507
00:20:33.621 --> 00:20:38.621
<v Speaker 2>when I first got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it out of the box and everything </v>

508
00:20:38.621 --> 00:20:38.621
<v Speaker 2>that I was playing with and I was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at Wayne.</v>

509
00:20:38.621 --> 00:20:43.280
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the ultimate piece that's like </v>

510
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.790

<v Speaker 2>pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

514
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever used the keyboard?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

515
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:56.611
<v Speaker 5>You know what I did use though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was pretty dope and I wish someone </v>

516
00:20:56.611 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 5>would figure out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I found sorta doesn't,</v>

517

<v Speaker 5>it would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:12.780
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I've said that a bunch of times and </v>

522
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.000

<v Speaker 5>space button and you keep going onto the</v>

523

<v Speaker 5>next predictive texting.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It was really interesting.</v>

526
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 5>The iphone always gets things wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 5>never wants to accept my swears.</v>

527
00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.610
<v Speaker 5>I still wasn't changed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck to duck.</v>

<v Speaker 5>how many times do I say this?</v>

529
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:26.710
<v Speaker 5>There's ways around that.</v>

530
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.780
<v Speaker 5>There's something like you just make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>new contact and you just put all the </v>

531
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.540
<v Speaker 5>cuss words you want in it or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like I forget.</v>

532
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.260
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it looks it up.</v>

533
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

534
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.910

<v Speaker 5>but it's so silly.</v>

538
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.150
<v Speaker 5>Like why can't it remember swears?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

539
00:21:47.151 --> 00:21:52.151
<v Speaker 5>the new operating system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess as 100 times better when it </v>

540
00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:52.151
<v Speaker 5>comes to all this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the Vocab,</v>

541
00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:53.490
<v Speaker 5>that dictionary that everything and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>got.</v>

542
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.500
<v Speaker 5>Now we finally get multitasking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now Brian's got an apple phone or on </v>

543
00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.270
<v Speaker 5>your fan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boy,</v>

544
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a fan boy because I'm with any </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of technology.</v>

545
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:06.560
<v Speaker 5>I try them all and I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I picked my man.</v>

546
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm just teasing you.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you?</v>

548
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.220
<v Speaker 5>Haven't we always go right back to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>iphone.</v>

549
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 5>The iphone is most certainly the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>all around device without a doubt,</v>

550
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.840
<v Speaker 5>but my main phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use a blackberry because it's verizon </v>

551
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.630
<v Speaker 5>because verizon is way better for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need,</v>

552
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.390
<v Speaker 5>I need to make calls like that game's </v>
<v Speaker 5>over for me now.</v>

553

<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no problems with a t and t </v>

<v Speaker 5>Well my problems with a t and t are </v>

555
00:22:33.121 --> 00:22:33.610
<v Speaker 5>driving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>driving from my house into legends.</v>

556
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:38.611
<v Speaker 5>Others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's three places where I would lose </v>

557
00:22:38.611 --> 00:22:40.261
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if I'd be in a big conversation I'd </v>

558
00:22:40.261 --> 00:22:40.261
<v Speaker 5>have to pull over because I didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

559
00:22:40.261 --> 00:22:41.050
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to lose the call.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it was something that was,</v>

560
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was serious.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I can't talk in my bedroom on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

562
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.770

<v Speaker 5>important call.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 5>fuck up those satellites.</v>

577
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 5>There was an article I was reading about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that about.</v>

578
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:30.301
<v Speaker 5>We're at a moment of the sons awakening </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that the next couple years is </v>

579
00:23:30.301 --> 00:23:34.710
<v Speaker 5>unprecedented solar activity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's they predicted so unprecedented </v>

580
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.120
<v Speaker 5>solar flares that could wipe out </v>
<v Speaker 5>satellites and so what they're trying to</v>

581
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:41.860
<v Speaker 5>get really good at is predicting these </v>
<v Speaker 5>events so that they can shut down or put</v>

582
00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:46.861
<v Speaker 5>these satellites on safe mode,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is pretty nuts when you think </v>

583
00:23:46.861 --> 00:23:46.861
<v Speaker 5>about how much we're reliant</v>

584
00:23:46.861 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 1>on the satellites and you know for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for satellite radio.</v>

585
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I can listen to it every day for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:53.900
<v Speaker 1>for so many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For GPS,</v>

587
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:54.600
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

588
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.520
<v Speaker 1>we're reliant on fucking satellites and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those motherfuckers can get cooked,</v>

589
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.420
<v Speaker 1>they can get cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

590
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.500
<v Speaker 1>at any time the Sun could just make some</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiccup,</v>

591
00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:04.550
<v Speaker 1>a Burp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Fart,</v>

592
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.610
<v Speaker 1>and it just barbecues every fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellite at cs.</v>

593
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 6>They got to have backup satellites and </v>
<v Speaker 6>like just slow out there and protective </v>

594
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 6>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if anything happens,</v>

595
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.790
<v Speaker 6>the other ones they just press a button.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That shit.</v>

596
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That opened the new case.</v>

597
00:24:16.141 --> 00:24:17.290
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if they're gonna do</v>

598
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 1>put shields over satellites like big </v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation shields that's going to have </v>

599
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.780
<v Speaker 1>to be the next field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that before it's filled.</v>

600
00:24:24.781 --> 00:24:27.060
<v Speaker 1>It's got to have something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnets and force fields.</v>

601
00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

602
00:24:27.511 --> 00:24:29.550
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what our gravity is,</v>

603
00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:30.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

604
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.720
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our magnetosphere,</v>

605
00:24:31.721 --> 00:24:32.220
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

606
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.210
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

607
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:38.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gas that surrounds the earth and </v>

608
00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:38.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

609
00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:38.880
<v Speaker 6>our atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we just suspend some gold dust particles</v>

610
00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.140
<v Speaker 6>in the atmosphere will be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Zacharias stitch and style.</v>

611
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:46.770
<v Speaker 1>So Eddie's a big proponent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient alien theory and a Eddie's the </v>

612
00:24:46.841 --> 00:24:50.230
<v Speaker 1>first person that ever got me into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zacharias Hitchin and we've had dude,</v>

613
00:24:50.231 --> 00:24:53.820
<v Speaker 1>how many bones have we smoked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking talking about the auto lock.</v>

614
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.310
<v Speaker 6>We've had more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more ridiculous</v>

615
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.070
<v Speaker 1>spaceman alien auto knocky </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>

616
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.910
<v Speaker 1>ancient ancient tribe theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit where,</v>

617
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations died off and left so much </v>

618
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.851
<v Speaker 1>information that was just last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Mayans and of course the </v>

619
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:17.181
<v Speaker 1>Sumerians and now sand the Sumerians </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk of an even older civilization </v>

620
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:17.760
<v Speaker 1>before then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Eddie,</v>

621
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's the one that got me into</v>

622
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.740
<v Speaker 6>the first.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Scott,</v>

623
00:25:19.741 --> 00:25:20.760
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's about Redondo,</v>

624
00:25:20.761 --> 00:25:21.410
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

625
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:21.750
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

626
00:25:21.751 --> 00:25:23.790
<v Speaker 6>He actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he brought it up to me.</v>

627
00:25:23.791 --> 00:25:24.630
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he brought it up,</v>

628
00:25:24.631 --> 00:25:26.280
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It never registered.</v>

629
00:25:26.281 --> 00:25:26.850
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

630
00:25:26.851 --> 00:25:28.710
<v Speaker 6>listen to this radio station coast to </v>
<v Speaker 6>coast.</v>

631
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.260
<v Speaker 6>There's like 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I never listened to Scott.</v>

632
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.350
<v Speaker 6>But Gina,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the first girl I produced musically,</v>

633
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.080
<v Speaker 6>she's about as crazy as they come.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she's.</v>

634
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.560
<v Speaker 6>She was talking about a party,</v>
<v Speaker 6>talented girl,</v>

635
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.100
<v Speaker 6>super,</v>
<v Speaker 6>super talented singer,</v>

636
00:25:41.101 --> 00:25:42.660
<v Speaker 6>but crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She goes,</v>

637
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.840
<v Speaker 6>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was at this party last night and this </v>

638
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.481
<v Speaker 6>guy was talking about how we recreated </v>
<v Speaker 6>as slaves to mine gold for aliens on </v>

639
00:25:51.061 --> 00:25:52.770
<v Speaker 6>another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

640
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.830
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shut up.</v>

641
00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.630
<v Speaker 6>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because no,</v>

642
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.910
<v Speaker 6>everybody was tripping out on this guy </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about this.</v>

643
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.830
<v Speaker 6>This.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

644
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:06.390
<v Speaker 6>aliens made us as slaves to mine gold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shut the fuck up.</v>

645
00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.780
<v Speaker 6>Let's get to work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I thought about it later on that day,</v>

646
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.760
<v Speaker 6>that whole day I thought about it and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

647
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.420
<v Speaker 6>and I thought it was weird that it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy as all that sounded.</v>

648
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.020
<v Speaker 6>It is weird that the one thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>all agree on,</v>

649
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.090
<v Speaker 6>every culture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every race,</v>

650
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.640
<v Speaker 6>we can agree on shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>politics,</v>

651
00:26:23.641 --> 00:26:24.360
<v Speaker 6>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>

652
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.870
<v Speaker 6>But we all agree that gold is worth more</v>
<v Speaker 6>than money.</v>

653
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.110
<v Speaker 6>That gold is the universal money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I thought that was weird.</v>

654
00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:32.130
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hmm.</v>

655
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:37.430
<v Speaker 6>And then I thought about how the Aztecs </v>
<v Speaker 6>thought Cortez was a god and they gave </v>

656
00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:43.221
<v Speaker 6>them gold and then the people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the pharaohs that die and they get </v>

657
00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:48.261
<v Speaker 6>buried,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get buried with gold and like </v>

658
00:26:48.261 --> 00:26:48.480
<v Speaker 6>thinking about this and like this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can I call Gina Gina?</v>

659
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 6>What was this guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you have his number?</v>

660
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.250
<v Speaker 6>Because that was Jodie or some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think his name was Jodie,</v>

661
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.480
<v Speaker 6>so I called this guy and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

662
00:26:54.481 --> 00:26:59.481
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a genius because what you were </v>

663
00:26:59.481 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 6>talking about some gold and some slaves </v>
<v Speaker 6>and aliens.</v>

664
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck was that about?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he didn't even really know.</v>

665
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

666
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

667
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:08.370
<v Speaker 6>I was talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some guy told me it was weirdest thing.</v>

668
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:13.610
<v Speaker 6>I think his name is Syed Gen or are such</v>
<v Speaker 6>an or something sits in or something.</v>

669
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:19.131
<v Speaker 6>So I looked it up and I just got on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Internet and I looked up sitch and </v>

670
00:27:19.131 --> 00:27:20.310
<v Speaker 6>started getting into it and it blew me </v>
<v Speaker 6>away.</v>

671
00:27:20.311 --> 00:27:22.170
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty fascinating shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

672
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:25.780
<v Speaker 6>as crazy as that sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you really look into it all,</v>

673
00:27:25.781 --> 00:27:30.300
<v Speaker 6>all the basically it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's this at Zachariah such as this guy,</v>

674
00:27:30.301 --> 00:27:35.301
<v Speaker 6>the transcribed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ancient Sumerian text for like </v>

675
00:27:35.301 --> 00:27:37.550
<v Speaker 6>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>tablets have all these stories and all </v>

676
00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.731
<v Speaker 6>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows what they really say because </v>

677
00:27:40.731 --> 00:27:40.731
<v Speaker 6>very few people can actually transcribe </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

678
00:27:40.731 --> 00:27:42.480
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people think Zacharias stitching is</v>

679
00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:45.210
<v Speaker 6>crazy and he just making shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

680
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.740
<v Speaker 6>some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people believe him.</v>

681
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got this,</v>

682
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.260
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of smart people.</v>

683
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interesting shit that he uncovers </v>

<v Speaker 1>and shows in his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

685
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 1>in his videos that's just indisputable </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the images that the Sumerians left </v>

686
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.881
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets really crazy </v>

687
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:04.570
<v Speaker 1>because there's images of a big giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>person with a small person.</v>

688
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has a tail like a monkey.</v>

689
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.010
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>

690
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.500
<v Speaker 1>They have the double helix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the DNA double helix is there caduceus,</v>

691
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have that in,</v>

692
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:19.770
<v Speaker 1>in their images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it was just like a Fez ben guy </v>

693
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:19.870
<v Speaker 1>that walked around the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

694
00:28:19.871 --> 00:28:21.880
<v Speaker 1>that it's dressed up as a cat in </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's true.</v>

695
00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

696
00:28:22.581 --> 00:28:23.790
<v Speaker 1>It could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be.</v>

697
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:28.830
<v Speaker 1>But here's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also had a detailed depiction of </v>

698
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.741
<v Speaker 1>the solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a picture of the sun and then </v>

699
00:28:31.741 --> 00:28:31.741
<v Speaker 1>they had the picture of the planets in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

700
00:28:31.741 --> 00:28:34.090
<v Speaker 1>with the proper size in the proper orbit</v>
<v Speaker 1>orbit.</v>

701
00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.020
<v Speaker 1>And on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

702
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.320
<v Speaker 1>their whole history there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

703
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Sumerian text it talks about the </v>

704
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.261
<v Speaker 1>different planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it talks about your readiness and it </v>

705
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:46.261
<v Speaker 1>talks about Neptune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

706
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:51.241
<v Speaker 1>it talks about the creation of earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the exact same theory that we </v>

707
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:55.030
<v Speaker 1>have as far as the creation of the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory is that Earth one,</v>

708
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.160
<v Speaker 1>there was an earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like billions of years ago,</v>

709
00:28:57.161 --> 00:28:59.350
<v Speaker 1>it got hit with a planet and created the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>

710
00:28:59.351 --> 00:29:04.351
<v Speaker 1>And now we are earth to post impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is something that scientists </v>

711
00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:06.400
<v Speaker 1>had just recently embraced over the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>few decades,</v>

712
00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.210
<v Speaker 1>but sitch and wrote about this shit way </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the seventies.</v>

713
00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>

714
00:29:10.991 --> 00:29:13.390
<v Speaker 1>this was at the Sumerian said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

715
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.020
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch his,</v>

716
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.310
<v Speaker 1>his documentaries and you listen to such</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talk and get his shit online,</v>

717
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.580
<v Speaker 1>it is fucking fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

718
00:29:21.581 --> 00:29:23.050
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

719
00:29:23.051 --> 00:29:26.470
<v Speaker 1>some aliens made us as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a race of slaves.</v>

720
00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:31.530
<v Speaker 1>But I am saying that the world is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy as it is the,</v>

721
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.040
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we could send photographs </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people and you can get video,</v>

722
00:29:36.041 --> 00:29:41.041
<v Speaker 1>download it from your phone and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically answer any question that </v>

723
00:29:41.041 --> 00:29:41.041
<v Speaker 1>immediately by pressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

724
00:29:41.041 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>google or are they</v>

725
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 6>the Google thing where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you talk into it and you say,</v>

726
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what year did Columbus sail,</v>

727
00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:50.020
<v Speaker 6>blah blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it'll give you the information.</v>

728
00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 6>Like instantly this has never happened </v>
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>

729
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:57.091
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this crazy shit and it's only </v>

730
00:29:57.091 --> 00:29:57.400
<v Speaker 6>gonna get crazier now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we live a 100,000</v>

731
00:29:57.401 --> 00:30:00.250
<v Speaker 6>years longer and stayed alive and </v>
<v Speaker 6>managed to keep evolving,</v>

732
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.290
<v Speaker 6>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we would get to the point,</v>

733
00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:07.291
<v Speaker 6>would be able to travel to other planets</v>
<v Speaker 6>and find other species that we thought </v>

734
00:30:07.571 --> 00:30:12.571
<v Speaker 6>weren't advanced enough and fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 6>them if we decided a certain point in </v>

735
00:30:12.571 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 6>time with all this investigation that </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're doing into live,</v>

736
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.600
<v Speaker 6>like what they're doing right now with </v>
<v Speaker 6>synthetic cells where they are creating </v>

737
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 6>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 6>creating cells,</v>

738
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:20.350
<v Speaker 6>and eventually creating living </v>
<v Speaker 6>organisms.</v>

739
00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:25.351
<v Speaker 6>This is all really going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we get to the point where we realize </v>

740
00:30:25.351 --> 00:30:28.571
<v Speaker 6>that life itself is just a code that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>can manipulate and change to our will,</v>

741
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.100
<v Speaker 6>well when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

742
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:35.101
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to think anything's </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrong with taking some monkeys and </v>

743
00:30:35.101 --> 00:30:36.400
<v Speaker 6>making them smarter and having them work</v>
<v Speaker 6>for you,</v>

744
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if there's a super intelligent being</v>

745
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.080
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

746
00:30:40.081 --> 00:30:45.081
<v Speaker 6>or race of beings that's thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 6>years advanced from us or millions or </v>

747
00:30:45.081 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 6>perhaps even a billion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

748
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 6>what if they live in a protected solar </v>
<v Speaker 6>system where they don't have to worry </v>

749
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:51.850
<v Speaker 6>about asteroids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what if the asteroid impact is,</v>

750
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.960
<v Speaker 6>is not a common thing would if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

751
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.680
<v Speaker 6>all this shit that happens in our solar </v>
<v Speaker 6>system is kind of rare.</v>

752
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.200
<v Speaker 6>And in other solar systems,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't have media problems.</v>

753
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.430
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if that's the case,</v>

754
00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:02.890
<v Speaker 6>if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they could be a billion years older than</v>

755
00:31:02.891 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 6>us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't fucking know.</v>

756
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.220
<v Speaker 6>We have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

757
00:31:05.221 --> 00:31:10.221
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>basically switching was one of very few </v>

758
00:31:10.221 --> 00:31:10.221
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

759
00:31:10.221 --> 00:31:14.671
<v Speaker 6>that transcribed over 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>tablets and these tablets were all like </v>

760
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:20.090
<v Speaker 6>in detailed descriptions of how they can</v>
<v Speaker 6>down the names of the rulers.</v>

761
00:31:20.951 --> 00:31:25.951
<v Speaker 6>And the South American ones,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they real technical shit about how it </v>

762
00:31:25.951 --> 00:31:30.060
<v Speaker 6>all went down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He transcribed all that shit in the </v>

763
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.720
<v Speaker 6>seventies and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he put all this information out,</v>

764
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:35.290
<v Speaker 6>all this information that he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's saying that he wasn't making it up.</v>

765
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:38.120
<v Speaker 6>He was just transcribing all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>stories and people are,</v>

766
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.610
<v Speaker 6>or a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

767
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.110
<v Speaker 6>his daughters were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

768
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 6>he's full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How could he know this?</v>

769
00:31:42.521 --> 00:31:43.240
<v Speaker 6>And how could he know that?</v>

770
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 6>But the few things that he did know in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the seventies that,</v>

771
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:47.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were just figuring out now,</v>

772
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:52.380
<v Speaker 6>one in his transcriptions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he talked about how the Sumerians knew </v>

773
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:56.401
<v Speaker 6>that Uranus and Neptune were both water </v>
<v Speaker 6>twins and we just found that out in the </v>

774
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.840
<v Speaker 6>eighties that they actually are water </v>
<v Speaker 6>twins.</v>

775
00:31:58.841 --> 00:32:00.820
<v Speaker 6>That was new.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How the hell did such a know this?</v>

776
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:06.090
<v Speaker 6>Another thing is such.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the basis of the story is aliens </v>

777
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.140
<v Speaker 6>need our acumen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They look just like us.</v>

778
00:32:08.141 --> 00:32:10.420
<v Speaker 6>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're supposedly.</v>

779
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:11.380
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll,</v>

780
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:11.840
<v Speaker 6>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

781
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.920
<v Speaker 6>maybe taller or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But are they way better looking than </v>

782
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.520
<v Speaker 6>they need our gold to ces to turn into </v>
<v Speaker 6>gold dust,</v>

783
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 6>to suspend in their atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to protect their atmosphere.</v>

784
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.580
<v Speaker 6>That's what they need.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's talking to them from radiation.</v>

785
00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what he's talking about.</v>

786
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:27.570
<v Speaker 6>And the seventies and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>transcriptions,</v>

787
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.690
<v Speaker 6>he's not an astrophysicist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We just found out like in 2001,</v>

788
00:32:31.691 --> 00:32:34.900
<v Speaker 6>2002 that that's exactly how you protect</v>
<v Speaker 6>atmospheres.</v>

789
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:39.320
<v Speaker 6>You take metallic particles and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>suspend them in the atmosphere to,</v>

790
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>either keep radiation and or out.</v>

791
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.320
<v Speaker 6>We just figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How the hell did this guy figure out </v>

792
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:47.320
<v Speaker 6>through the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's saying,</v>

793
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:47.810
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he didn't know he transcribed.</v>

794
00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:49.260
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he did.</v>

795
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.160
<v Speaker 6>He just guessed that that's the way we </v>
<v Speaker 6>protect atmospheres.</v>

796
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.350
<v Speaker 6>He already talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of.</v>

797
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:59.590
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he gets into details a lot of shit that </v>

798
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.590
<v Speaker 6>makes it like home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

799
00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:00.290
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot to.</v>

800
00:33:00.291 --> 00:33:02.750
<v Speaker 6>It sounds crazy and we don't have all </v>
<v Speaker 6>day to talk about it,</v>

801
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:05.540
<v Speaker 6>but have an open mind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fascinating stuff.</v>

802
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was towed to the thinking.</v>

803
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:12.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of debate about this </v>

804
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:12.700
<v Speaker 1>planet Nibiru and there's a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a website called [inaudible].</v>

805
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Sitchin is wrong and his website is </v>
<v Speaker 1>stitching is wrong.com,</v>

806
00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:18.500
<v Speaker 1>and this guy does not believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

807
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:22.910
<v Speaker 1>that there's this planet Nibiru and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the quotes to tax.</v>

808
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.490
<v Speaker 1>It's really involved and I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really looked into it.</v>

809
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the fuck is right and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's wrong.</v>

810
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.400
<v Speaker 1>I really don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that the,</v>

811
00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 1>just all the shit that came out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one area is really fascinating and when </v>

812
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.731
<v Speaker 1>you find out that one part of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>is responsible for the first </v>

813
00:33:39.731 --> 00:33:39.731
<v Speaker 1>mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first astronomy,</v>

814
00:33:39.731 --> 00:33:41.720
<v Speaker 1>first astrology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first written language first,</v>

815
00:33:41.721 --> 00:33:44.990
<v Speaker 1>use the wheel first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything first agriculture was Iraq.</v>

816
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.430
<v Speaker 1>It's Iraq because Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

817
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Crazy fucking nuts.</v>

818
00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.000
<v Speaker 1>First organized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

819
00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:58.050
<v Speaker 1>that's why they're so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I've always said that that </v>

820
00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:00.701
<v Speaker 1>part of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why there are laws are so </v>

821
00:34:00.701 --> 00:34:00.701
<v Speaker 1>archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like the townies of the world.</v>

822
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people that were there </v>
<v Speaker 1>when civilization was created and </v>

823
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:06.800
<v Speaker 1>they're still rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still rocking that ancient law.</v>

824
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you dance,</v>

825
00:34:07.791 --> 00:34:10.130
<v Speaker 1>we throw rocks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck someone from the other tribe,</v>

826
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:12.140
<v Speaker 1>we throw rocks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show your ankles,</v>

827
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:13.550
<v Speaker 1>we throw rocks at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is.</v>

828
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Why is an agent that's smart though have</v>
<v Speaker 1>now has not progressed like they </v>

829
00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.270
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody moved out to California,</v>

830
00:34:20.271 --> 00:34:21.530
<v Speaker 1>left like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is California?</v>

831
00:34:21.531 --> 00:34:24.770
<v Speaker 1>California is the group of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>landed somewhere else new.</v>

832
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:29.771
<v Speaker 1>It sucked and move to the best box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually you figure out that the best </v>

833
00:34:29.771 --> 00:34:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Bot of southern California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're figuring out,</v>

834
00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:34.871
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a spot where it never gets so </v>

835
00:34:34.871 --> 00:34:36.140
<v Speaker 1>cold that it's knows okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no hurricanes.</v>

836
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to worry about earthquakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>every now and then,</v>

837
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.230
<v Speaker 1>but there's no lightning as worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic in the rural.</v>

838
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.240
<v Speaker 1>It was the worst traffic in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like as far as rules that climate </v>

839
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:47.510
<v Speaker 1>has nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with climate.</v>

840
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the climate here is the reason</v>

841
00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:52.520
<v Speaker 1>why everybody flocks to this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way easier to live here.</v>

842
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:54.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is true.</v>

843
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:57.820
<v Speaker 6>It's like a club promoters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When a club in La,</v>

844
00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:03.030
<v Speaker 6>when a club rises and falls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the club promoters don't die with the </v>

845
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:07.171
<v Speaker 6>club.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just find a new location and they </v>

846
00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:07.171
<v Speaker 6>just keep moving the original club with </v>
<v Speaker 6>some area.</v>

847
00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:08.470
<v Speaker 6>It was blowing up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was going off.</v>

848
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.960
<v Speaker 6>Then it closed down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the promoters moved to Egypt,</v>

849
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.480
<v Speaker 6>they blew that up for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That shit close down.</v>

850
00:35:13.481 --> 00:35:16.290
<v Speaker 6>People got tired of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then they blew it up in Israel that have</v>

851
00:35:16.291 --> 00:35:18.550
<v Speaker 6>change all the names and in all their </v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

852
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.960
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

853
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:25.090
<v Speaker 6>their stories of creation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then it went to Rome and then it split </v>

854
00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.680
<v Speaker 6>off and then it ended up in England and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Germany and the united.</v>

855
00:35:26.681 --> 00:35:27.420
<v Speaker 6>It's totally okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That makes</v>

856
00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Speaker 1>sense of that part of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards because it's just like going </v>

857
00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:32.420
<v Speaker 1>back home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

858
00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like going back home,</v>

859
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:34.580
<v Speaker 1>if I went back home to Boston and hung </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

860
00:35:34.581 --> 00:35:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I would think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

861
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:38.260
<v Speaker 1>like the dudes I went high school with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like two,</v>

862
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.360
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still living in this fucking this</v>

863
00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.240
<v Speaker 1>crazy land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why didn't you escape?</v>

864
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's like what it's like in air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Sumir,</v>

865
00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:50.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became Iraq and everybody eventually </v>

866
00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.341
<v Speaker 1>moved on to other places of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who weren't satisfied with where </v>

867
00:35:52.341 --> 00:35:55.641
<v Speaker 1>they were and how life was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's where all human beings </v>

868
00:35:55.641 --> 00:35:55.710
<v Speaker 1>supposedly came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody who left as a people that were</v>

869
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:58.410
<v Speaker 1>trying to find something better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of makes sense.</v>

870
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 1>It kind of makes sense that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

871
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:04.950
<v Speaker 1>if that really is the cradle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization and everybody left from </v>

872
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.950
<v Speaker 1>there and trying to find something </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

873
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.290
<v Speaker 1>of course the people that are remained </v>
<v Speaker 1>suck just totally make sense.</v>

874
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Dom didn't suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you,</v>

875
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:11.850
<v Speaker 1>how dare you,</v>

876
00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.840
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare everybody listening to this at </v>

877
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.980
<v Speaker 2>this point in time stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker get him to the Greek.</v>

878
00:36:20.981 --> 00:36:22.570

<v Speaker 2>Five stars?</v>

881
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Not quite as good as hangover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right under hangover,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

885
00:36:35.051 --> 00:36:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I laughed out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least 10.</v>

886
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.710
<v Speaker 2>There was a good 10 times where I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's funny and every they must let him </v>

892
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:55.111
<v Speaker 2>go off because it's not a coincidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he always has great lines and you </v>

<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>

895
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 2>but it was way better than fifty cents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an academy award winning </v>

896
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.040
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he pulled it off and he made me </v>

897
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.961
<v Speaker 2>laugh too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an argument with that one rnb </v>

898
00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:10.210
<v Speaker 2>singer member with the pink shirt.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was so funny that putting it in,</v>

901
00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:16.740
<v Speaker 2>putting it in the previews now that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the pre.</v>

902
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.870
<v Speaker 1>So don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give any spoilers away.</v>

903
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:24.730
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that Russell brand go to diddy </v>

904
00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:25.680
<v Speaker 1>was the probably the best part about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie though.</v>

905
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.310
<v Speaker 1>He was good and I posted that on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

906
00:37:29.311 --> 00:37:31.530
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the worst movies I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in my life.</v>

907
00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.180
<v Speaker 1>It was so ridiculous.</v>

908
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.230
<v Speaker 2>You can splice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

909
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.200
<v Speaker 2>you could tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't think I could tell.</v>

910
00:37:36.201 --> 00:37:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I thought that made me look bad.</v>

911
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Bad Ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so looking forward to that movie,</v>

912
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

913
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.970
<v Speaker 2>did it die?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A horrible death at the box office.</v>

914
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.750
<v Speaker 2>It actually didn't do that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't in the top.</v>

915
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.230
<v Speaker 1>It got 70 something percent on rotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes.</v>

916
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.090
<v Speaker 1>But listen how crazy this movie is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

917
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:52.910
<v Speaker 1>This guy has his girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both scientists.</v>

918
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:58.030
<v Speaker 1>They're doing all these experiments with</v>
<v Speaker 1>human DNA and they figured out how to </v>

919
00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:00.800
<v Speaker 1>synthesize human DNA with a animal DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I phenols lizards or some shit.</v>

920
00:38:00.801 --> 00:38:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck I spliced it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

921
00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.580
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just wanted to see if they could do</v>

922
00:38:04.581 --> 00:38:05.180

<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you something.</v>

1001
00:40:56.331 --> 00:40:59.090
<v Speaker 4>Don't you wish that this movie is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>goddamn bad?</v>

1002
00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:04.270
<v Speaker 4>I think it might turn into one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies that's like a cult hit because </v>

1003
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.490
<v Speaker 4>it's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are going to go see it</v>

1004
00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.260
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

1005
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:10.270
<v Speaker 5>This is what I did hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard that there was actually </v>

1006
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.270
<v Speaker 5>personally that we're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>funny now.</v>

1007
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:14.990
<v Speaker 5>It has nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a humor to where I try to be funny </v>

1008
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.551
<v Speaker 5>if they were there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they said it in an interview that a lot </v>

1009
00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:18.551
<v Speaker 5>of people aren't getting the humor of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the movie.</v>

1010
00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:19.580
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You mean the whole movie,</v>

1011
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:23.040
<v Speaker 5>the whole movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1012
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:28.070
<v Speaker 5>are you sure that you weren't baked and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't get like the humor like </v>

1013
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:28.070
<v Speaker 5>serious or something?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't big at all.</v>

1014
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:29.600
<v Speaker 5>In your defense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

1015
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.980
<v Speaker 5>I think he might like it because you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like crazy shit like that.</v>

1016
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:39.120
<v Speaker 5>Nobody liked him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go in wanting to see something </v>

1017
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:39.120
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to like it,</v>

1018
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.730
<v Speaker 5>but if you go in thinking you're going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get the shit scared out of you.</v>

1019
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:45.731
<v Speaker 5>Like some new alien movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I thought it was going to </v>

1020
00:41:45.731 --> 00:41:45.731
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I saw like it was just like she was</v>

1021
00:41:45.731 --> 00:41:49.901
<v Speaker 5>threatening the in in the previews looks</v>
<v Speaker 5>like she's threatening one of the </v>

1022
00:41:49.901 --> 00:41:49.901
<v Speaker 5>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1023
00:41:49.901 --> 00:41:53.861
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they create something and it's fucking </v>

1024
00:41:53.861 --> 00:41:53.861
<v Speaker 5>crazy and it gets out of control and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's scary.</v>

1025
00:41:53.861 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm to see it this week and I can't wait</v>
<v Speaker 5>to discuss it.</v>

1026
00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:00.040
<v Speaker 5>I can't wait to discuss it with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might bring a bag of rocks thrown at </v>

1027
00:42:00.621 --> 00:42:03.280
<v Speaker 5>you because there has been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There has been movies that,</v>

1028
00:42:03.281 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we totally disagree.</v>

1029
00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:07.510
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of funny how people get upset </v>
<v Speaker 5>when someone likes something.</v>

1030
00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.130
<v Speaker 5>They don't like iphones yet.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about my group or did you like the </v>

1032
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:14.130

<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

1033
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:18.760
<v Speaker 5>when I first saw the preview,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it looked like the dumbest </v>

1034

<v Speaker 5>I haven't heard a thing I haven't heard </v>

<v Speaker 1>of our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in fact empires for real.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that they are vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truly to truly believe it and actually </v>

1135
00:46:30.051 --> 00:46:32.700
<v Speaker 1>thought of biting someone's neck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking their blood out and kill them.</v>

1139
00:46:45.831 --> 00:46:47.400
<v Speaker 1>slash 2006 with a woman named her kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>after Satan.</v>

1140
00:46:47.401 --> 00:46:52.401
<v Speaker 1>Like they were named after like satanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>names and then on that day she murdered </v>

1141
00:46:52.401 --> 00:46:54.210
<v Speaker 1>them on and I drank their bladders.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1145
00:47:03.661 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

1146
00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:10.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe there was a real person </v>

1147
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.860
<v Speaker 1>that existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the magic things attributed to </v>

1148
00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.021
<v Speaker 1>him really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're gonna believe that just </v>

1149
00:47:15.021 --> 00:47:15.021
<v Speaker 1>because it was a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be,</v>

1150
00:47:15.021 --> 00:47:17.490
<v Speaker 1>to me completely silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's acceptable.</v>

1151
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1152
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I understand where you're coming from.</v>

1153
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I understand that's what you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

1154
00:47:21.001 --> 00:47:22.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has their own point of view,</v>

1155
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:24.960
<v Speaker 1>but when you start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>devil's,</v>

1156
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you started talking about Satan like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1157
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Really you think there's a fucking bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>man who's pulling strings and tempting </v>

1158
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:36.760
<v Speaker 1>you with pussy and cigarettes and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1159
00:47:36.761 --> 00:47:41.761
<v Speaker 1>you think that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a devil makes you make bad </v>

1160
00:47:41.761 --> 00:47:44.580
<v Speaker 1>decisions and and it makes you rape and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat people up and you think the devil's</v>

1161
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 1>doing that tempting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Die.</v>

1162
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:51.680
<v Speaker 1>That's so infantiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that people even consider </v>

1163
00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:56.281
<v Speaker 1>it and we know that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of us that knows that </v>

1164
00:47:56.281 --> 00:47:56.281
<v Speaker 1>talking about the devils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

1165
00:47:56.281 --> 00:47:57.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why you don't hear the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it.</v>

1166
00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 1>The president will always talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

1167
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.680
<v Speaker 1>He'll never talk about the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president that may God bless our </v>

1168
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:04.680
<v Speaker 1>troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1169
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.350
<v Speaker 1>we believe that God is on our side.</v>

1170
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Like Bush said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of Wacky God shit.</v>

1171
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Never once did he say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have found Satan and he's in Iraq.</v>

1172
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.340
<v Speaker 1>We know where Satan is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're going to drill to the core of</v>

1173
00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:19.570
<v Speaker 1>the earth until we find tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say You met,</v>

1174
00:48:19.571 --> 00:48:24.571
<v Speaker 1>you've met him at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned st at all and you're </v>

1175
00:48:24.571 --> 00:48:24.610
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

1176
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:29.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we believe we have found the actual </v>

1177
00:48:29.611 --> 00:48:30.070
<v Speaker 1>cross that Jesus was nailed on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will go,</v>

1178
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:31.120
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>

1179
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.480
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think we've found where Satan used to</v>

1180
00:48:34.481 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll get the fuck outta here.</v>

1181
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:38.540
<v Speaker 1>You what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1182
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:41.650
<v Speaker 1>You could actually say you can be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>archeologist and you can say,</v>

1183
00:48:41.651 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 1>we believe we found the cross that Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 1>was nailed on.</v>

1184
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.680
<v Speaker 1>But if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think we found the box where Satan </v>

1185
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:49.690
<v Speaker 1>lived in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would go,</v>

1186
00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:52.360
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't even talk to you.</v>

1187
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:54.100
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't even take you serious for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a second.</v>

1188
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:55.150
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

1189
00:48:55.151 --> 00:48:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Asshole thinks he found where the devil </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

1190
00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan is a force.</v>

1191
00:48:59.731 --> 00:49:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a person.</v>

1192
00:49:00.791 --> 00:49:02.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not a real guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1193
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Isn't he a fallen angel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused.</v>

1194
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean isn't he supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to be cool and they touch a </v>

1195
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:10.180
<v Speaker 1>shitty with God.</v>

1196
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry for going off on true blood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm on just on team Jacob and it kind of</v>

1197
00:49:13.921 --> 00:49:14.320
<v Speaker 5>gets to me</v>

1198
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:15.750
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all right man.</v>

1199
00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Werewolf.</v>

1200
00:49:16.621 --> 00:49:18.420
<v Speaker 1>So don't eat people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>

1201
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:21.060
<v Speaker 1>We want our Goddamn cake and we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it too.</v>

1202
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:24.410
<v Speaker 1>We want all the sexy and none of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder were willful.</v>

1203
00:49:24.411 --> 00:49:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1204
00:49:25.021 --> 00:49:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Or Wolf or you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the wolf man was stupid,</v>

1205
00:49:27.091 --> 00:49:30.930
<v Speaker 1>but I bought it on DVD because I'm such </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sucker for fucking horror movies.</v>

1206
00:49:30.931 --> 00:49:34.170
<v Speaker 1>That's how much I love horror movies by </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediocre horror movies and watch them on</v>

1207
00:49:34.171 --> 00:49:39.171
<v Speaker 1>DVD fighting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put it on the background while I </v>

1208
00:49:39.171 --> 00:49:39.171
<v Speaker 1>was writing nightmare on elm street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new one.</v>

1209
00:49:39.171 --> 00:49:39.171
<v Speaker 1>Did he it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1210
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.200
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

1211
00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Now like that actor though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that dude from the watchman.</v>

1212
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:47.880
<v Speaker 1>He's a the new Freddy Kruger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dude who played a roar shark,</v>

1213
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.760
<v Speaker 5>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's wrong with the old Freddy Krueger</v>

1214
00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.990
<v Speaker 5>Dan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got an.</v>

1215
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.940
<v Speaker 5>You've got an actor just to look like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Freddy Kruger.</v>

1216
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.500
<v Speaker 5>That's one character you can play until </v>
<v Speaker 5>he is 98 because the older he isn't real</v>

1217
00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:03.310
<v Speaker 5>life cut out the old freddy when he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>the shit.</v>

1218
00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:08.340
<v Speaker 5>There was no one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is he became a joke or </v>

1219
00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:08.620
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want it too much money.</v>

1220
00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:13.650
<v Speaker 5>Maybe because I mean seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the new guys just had makeup on to look </v>

1221
00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:13.650
<v Speaker 5>like the old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1222
00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:14.440
<v Speaker 5>so there's not really any reason other </v>
<v Speaker 5>than that.</v>

1223
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:16.320
<v Speaker 5>He looked a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1224
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:19.180
<v Speaker 5>it looked a little creepier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw some pictures of it online.</v>

1225
00:50:19.181 --> 00:50:21.160
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it looks a little new guys.</v>

1226
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:23.100
<v Speaker 5>Is he young?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said No.</v>

1227
00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.440
<v Speaker 5>Well he's a little younger player </v>
<v Speaker 5>himself.</v>

1228
00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 5>Was this like a preschool like they </v>
<v Speaker 5>showed?</v>

1229
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.690
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1230
00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 5>I didn't</v>

1231
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 1>see it as that may have been tasked with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert England in [inaudible] 75.</v>

1232
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just a Redo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it just rebooted it.</v>

1233
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it is Robert England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he in bad shape now?</v>

1234
00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:42.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw on the news he was upset </v>

1235
00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:42.801
<v Speaker 1>about it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you just.</v>

1236
00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:42.801
<v Speaker 1>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1237
00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:44.960
<v Speaker 1>when you try to reboot something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do a different actor.</v>

1238
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many goddamn times they got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the hawk,</v>

1239
00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:52.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did the Eric Bana One and they </v>

1240
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:52.440
<v Speaker 1>liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

1241
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 1>what about Captain America?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't they doing it again?</v>

1242
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Or they're trying it again or I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1243
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I know they did one back like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten years ago.</v>

1244
00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:03.050
<v Speaker 1>We're just one though because they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it like a couple of years after the old </v>

1245
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:03.140
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Eric Bana came out and then like two</v>

1246
00:51:03.141 --> 00:51:05.860
<v Speaker 1>or three years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking Edward Norton one came out.</v>

1247
00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:10.890
<v Speaker 1>When is wonder woman coming up to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder woman for Scarlett Johansson too?</v>

1248

<v Speaker 1>She's got some big titties though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got it.</v>

1249
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.550
<v Speaker 1>She's built like wonder woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got that wonder ass.</v>

1252
00:51:23.451 --> 00:51:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Just put her with a bunch of short </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1253
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:30.130
<v Speaker 1>You put up with a bunch of short people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you give her high heels and that's </v>

1254
00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:30.130
<v Speaker 1>how Tom Cruise rocks in his movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1255
00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.990
<v Speaker 1>you just give a little lift and put them</v>
<v Speaker 1>around people that are installing them.</v>

1256
00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what the tallest guy has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start with.</v>

1257
00:51:35.811 --> 00:51:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably Brad Pitt talked about how they</v>

1258
00:51:38.871 --> 00:51:43.871
<v Speaker 1>had scenes where he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise had to like stand on planks </v>

1259
00:51:43.871 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really try to make them appear to be the</v>

1260
00:51:45.141 --> 00:51:50.141
<v Speaker 1>same height pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's throwing them under the fucking </v>

1261
00:51:50.141 --> 00:51:52.661
<v Speaker 1>throwing them under the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were talking about it in the </v>

1262
00:51:52.661 --> 00:51:52.661
<v Speaker 1>interview and Brad Pitt was confirming </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was interesting.</v>

1271
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:10.400
<v Speaker 1>An interesting conversation I read with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brad Pitt talking about Tom Cruise,</v>

1272
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:12.590
<v Speaker 1>about working on that movie together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1274
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Interview with the vampire is saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he wished that something that he </v>

1275
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:21.791
<v Speaker 1>wished Tom Cruise wasn't so competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that you wished they could be </v>

1276
00:52:21.791 --> 00:52:22.790
<v Speaker 1>better friends with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise was a more competitive,</v>

1277
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I wish I remember the quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm quoting it correctly,</v>

1278
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating,</v>

1279
00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:31.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure because Brad Pitt was just </v>

1285
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:39.860
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people did not want him to play</v>

1365
00:55:49.881 --> 00:55:50.850

1366
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:53.090
<v Speaker 5>that's gotta be one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 5>tortures in life.</v>

1367
00:55:53.091 --> 00:55:58.091
<v Speaker 5>To be deformed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trying to make fun of your deformity to </v>

1368
00:55:58.091 --> 00:55:58.091
<v Speaker 5>make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1369
00:55:58.091 --> 00:55:59.930
<v Speaker 5>but think about that most.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people,</v>

1370
00:55:59.931 --> 00:56:01.940
<v Speaker 5>you look at someone with no arms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no legs,</v>

1371
00:56:01.941 --> 00:56:04.250
<v Speaker 5>and really like our first instinct is </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1372
00:56:04.251 --> 00:56:06.080
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's never going to be truly loved.</v>

1373
00:56:06.081 --> 00:56:08.060
<v Speaker 5>He's not going to be desired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Q.</v>

1374
00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.040
<v Speaker 5>Imagine being this person who is not </v>
<v Speaker 5>desired.</v>

1375
00:56:10.041 --> 00:56:11.530
<v Speaker 5>No one wants to sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1376
00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:15.320
<v Speaker 5>but really when we're all eventually </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be there because like,</v>

1377
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:20.500
<v Speaker 5>like I'm sure a hot 22 year old </v>
<v Speaker 5>supermodel would rather fuck a gray </v>

1378
00:56:20.571 --> 00:56:21.590
<v Speaker 5>maynard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Gray maynard.</v>

1379
00:56:21.591 --> 00:56:23.390
<v Speaker 5>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1380
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 5>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy</v>

1381
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.240
<v Speaker 2>with no arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no legs.</v>

1382
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kyle.</v>

1383
00:56:25.921 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Kyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kyle maynard.</v>

1384
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Some 90 year old man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1385
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.290
<v Speaker 2>We're all good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're eventually going to get there.</v>

1386
00:56:32.291 --> 00:56:37.291
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be just so it's how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to fuck you is the quality </v>

1387
00:56:37.291 --> 00:56:37.900
<v Speaker 2>of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1388
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:43.200
<v Speaker 2>that's the instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when you look at someone who's </v>

1389
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:43.200
<v Speaker 2>deformed or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1390
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.561
<v Speaker 2>no one's ever going to love them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls are programmed to stay away </v>

1391
00:56:46.561 --> 00:56:47.770
<v Speaker 2>sexually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally for burn victims.</v>

1392
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:50.350
<v Speaker 2>People who are amputees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all are.</v>

1393
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Cripples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1394
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:54.250
<v Speaker 2>We are the natural things that when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at someone who's in a wheelchair,</v>

1395
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 2>we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1396
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 2>that sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so young and he's fucked,</v>

1397
00:56:58.091 --> 00:57:00.970
<v Speaker 2>but eventually we're going to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just got it in advance.</v>

1398
00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:04.630
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to walk through that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire unless we die early,</v>

1399
00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.930
<v Speaker 2>but we're all going to be just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>desired as that person,</v>

1400
00:57:07.931 --> 00:57:10.210
<v Speaker 2>so it's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like really?</v>

1401
00:57:10.211 --> 00:57:11.530
<v Speaker 2>What's life all about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to,</v>

1402
00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.800
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to end up living half </v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives at least where no one wants to</v>

1403
00:57:14.801 --> 00:57:16.290
<v Speaker 2>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you?</v>

1404
00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:17.530
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to handle things?</v>

1405
00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Bigger issue is that they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

1406
00:57:21.291 --> 00:57:24.860
<v Speaker 1>They're locked in a trap of a body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they never get to be a normal person.</v>

1407
00:57:24.861 --> 00:57:26.690
<v Speaker 1>They're surrounded by other people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are normal.</v>

1408
00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:29.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the torture man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just whether or not people want</v>

1409
00:57:29.181 --> 00:57:29.660
<v Speaker 1>to fuck them.</v>

1410
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:31.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Eddie isn't in that like you're.</v>

1411
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:32.450
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hot in here.</v>

1412
00:57:32.451 --> 00:57:34.170
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to get married though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're again,</v>

1413
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:36.080
<v Speaker 3>50 percent of that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be with somebody.</v>

1414
00:57:36.081 --> 00:57:38.900
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that doesn't want to be desired by</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people either,</v>

1415
00:57:38.901 --> 00:57:40.970
<v Speaker 3>but you both are undesirable together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1416
00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:42.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go 20 years without having sex.</v>

1417
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Twenty years it desirable</v>

1418
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.560
<v Speaker 1>bolting is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is as much of a,</v>

1419
00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:50.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a factor with those people as why me?</v>

1420
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Why did I get fucked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I the person with this terrible </v>

1421
00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:56.130
<v Speaker 1>situation when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't I just be normal?</v>

1422
00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sure,</v>

1423
00:57:57.401 --> 00:58:02.401
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants people to love them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what they really want is to </v>

1424
00:58:02.401 --> 00:58:02.770
<v Speaker 1>just not be a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1425
00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:07.771
<v Speaker 1>to not be a physical mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be some sort of a genetic </v>

1426
00:58:07.771 --> 00:58:07.880
<v Speaker 1>aberration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1427
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:08.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the,</v>

1428
00:58:08.821 --> 00:58:11.260
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible feeling of pain is.</v>

1429
00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:16.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why these guys are all fucked up </v>

1430
00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:18.391
<v Speaker 1>and angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Gary Coleman was angry as fuck </v>

1431
00:58:18.391 --> 00:58:18.391
<v Speaker 1>before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1432
00:58:18.391 --> 00:58:19.810
<v Speaker 1>you always hear about stories about him </v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling at people like he was.</v>

1433
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:21.480
<v Speaker 1>He had to work a regular job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1434
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:25.480
<v Speaker 1>He was working as a security guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine people would just come</v>

1435
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:26.920
<v Speaker 1>up to him and fuck with them all day?</v>

1436
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only reason I know that is because </v>

1437
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.130
<v Speaker 2>the Dave Chappelle sketch that he did on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary Cole never saw.</v>

1438
00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

1439
00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:37.490
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he do?</v>

1440
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:40.740
<v Speaker 2>He plays Gary Cole and so he plays the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole sketch on his knees.</v>

1441
00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>security and then some chicky chicks,</v>

1442
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:49.190
<v Speaker 2>chicks fighting and then they cut to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the chick biting into all bad.</v>

1443
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:54.500
<v Speaker 2>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Dahlan is security outfit and she's </v>

1444
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:54.500
<v Speaker 2>tossing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary called Raj.</v>

1445
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:55.020
<v Speaker 2>He throws in the minutes.</v>

1446
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:57.800
<v Speaker 1>His show is so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the one one,</v>

1447
00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:01.430
<v Speaker 1>a sketch where he was fighting King Kong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hit King Kong or Godzilla.</v>

1448
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Godzilla with it</v>

1449
00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.070
<v Speaker 2>for cutting down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck was that?</v>

1450
00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.800
<v Speaker 2>It was so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which was that sketch?</v>

1451
00:59:07.801 --> 00:59:09.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but remember when he.</v>

1452
00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:12.060
<v Speaker 2>He has that sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the last season,</v>

1453
00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:14.840
<v Speaker 2>the unfinished season where he goes back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

1454
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:19.990
<v Speaker 2>And he fucks with everybody who told him</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the people that didn't believe in </v>

1455
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.580
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like club owners and all that stuff.</v>

1456
00:59:20.581 --> 00:59:25.581
<v Speaker 2>He blew up like the old club that he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>banned from any.</v>

1457
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:29.780
<v Speaker 2>He fucked up his old acting teacher who </v>
<v Speaker 2>told him that he would never make it.</v>

1458
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:32.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a sketch where he goes back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then at the very end when he goes to</v>

1459
00:59:32.721 --> 00:59:35.570
<v Speaker 2>the comedy club to blow up the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>club,</v>

1460
00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:37.580
<v Speaker 2>he blows it up and he walks out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a,</v>

1461
00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:42.450
<v Speaker 2>a lady walking across the street and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>so on fire that he blew up at the club.</v>

1462
00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:47.830
<v Speaker 2>The club owner was in a wheelchair and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he threw him down the steps and let the </v>

1463
00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:47.830
<v Speaker 2>place on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He takes his baby.</v>

1464
00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:52.661
<v Speaker 2>This random ladies cross the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes Texas baby and punk kicks the </v>

1465
00:59:52.661 --> 00:59:52.661
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1466
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Just out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how to sketch Ed's like he was so</v>

1467
00:59:55.671 --> 01:00:00.130
<v Speaker 2>happy that he got his revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He grabs this newborn baby kicks it.</v>

1468
01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Nothing to do with the Scott.</v>

1469
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.840
<v Speaker 3>Plus his show was so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember the first episode of different </v>

1470
01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 3>strokes with Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drummond took his two new boys,</v>

1471
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:14.170
<v Speaker 3>Willis and Arnold and got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all got in the hot tub together in </v>

1472
01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:14.170
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all wearing tighty.</v>

1473
01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Whities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1474
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:17.750
<v Speaker 3>it was really creepy as a kid and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>haunts me everyday when I.</v>

1475
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1476
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.840
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different strokes.</v>

1477
01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.910
<v Speaker 1>That was one of my favorite shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gross that up.</v>

1478
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Todd was on fear factor and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1479
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.550

<v Speaker 1>He's got A.</v>

1480
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kept it together for the most part up</v>

1481
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:32.870
<v Speaker 1>until the part where uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1482
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.310
<v Speaker 1>he lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got eliminated.</v>

1483
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.500
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even want to shake my hand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked away.</v>

1484
01:00:36.501 --> 01:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't shake my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1485
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:42.910
<v Speaker 1>he was upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was some sort of </v>

1486
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:42.910
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy to make him lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1487
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know what the fuck he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to do or what it was,</v>

1488
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:50.290
<v Speaker 1>what he was upset about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he decided he didn't want to shake </v>

1489
01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:50.290
<v Speaker 1>my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1490
01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:50.360
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 1>up like his,</v>

1492
01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>his automatic way of looking at things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like negative is automatic way of </v>

1493
01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>looking at things was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's out to get me.</v>

1494
01:00:58.070 --> 01:00:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Someone's fucking with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1495
01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:00.130
<v Speaker 1>it ain't going to be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

1496
01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I see how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1497
01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>it's like automatically like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1498
01:01:03.111 --> 01:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>this fucking six people on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five of them have to be losers.</v>

1499
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.670
<v Speaker 1>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the five.</v>

1500
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Shit happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1501
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You got to move on with your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not for him,</v>

1502
01:01:10.681 --> 01:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an angry dude,</v>

1503
01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1504
01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:17.570
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that toxo plasma.</v>

1505
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:21.560
<v Speaker 1>That's that cat tranquilizer or are they</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cat parasite rather?</v>

1506
01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>

1507
01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this on other shows </v>

1508
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I watched a documentary yesterday.</v>

1509
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:31.161
<v Speaker 1>I read some articles about it and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing called toxo plasma is a very </v>

1510
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:36.311
<v Speaker 1>common parasite that human beings get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that completely alters our behavior and </v>

1511
01:01:36.311 --> 01:01:40.580
<v Speaker 1>get this in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>66 percent of the population is infected</v>

1512
01:01:40.581 --> 01:01:41.750
<v Speaker 1>with this toxo plasma.</v>

1513
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.960
<v Speaker 1>And it does two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes women submissive and it makes </v>

1514
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>men reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerks makes men assholes,</v>

1515
01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>and it makes chicks submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like,</v>

1516
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Brazil ecstasy,</v>

1517
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1518
01:01:54.391 --> 01:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1519
01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes reckless.</v>

1520
01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>It makes them cope and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1521
01:01:59.590 --> 01:01:59.810
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1522
01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1523
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reprograms the mind.</v>

1524
01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the crazy thing.</v>

1525
01:02:03.381 --> 01:02:08.381
<v Speaker 1>The parasite exists first in rats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it does with rats is it gets rats </v>

1526
01:02:08.381 --> 01:02:12.431
<v Speaker 1>convinced that rewires their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sexual brain,</v>

1527
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:16.570
<v Speaker 1>the sexual aspect of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gets them to be aroused and,</v>

1528
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:18.950
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and connect it to cat piss.</v>

1529
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1530
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:25.070
<v Speaker 4>these rats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hijacks their sexual system so their </v>

1531
01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.310
<v Speaker 4>sexual system all of a sudden become </v>
<v Speaker 4>sexually aroused,</v>

1532
01:02:26.311 --> 01:02:30.240
<v Speaker 4>like their testes swelled or ball swell </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they smell cat piss.</v>

1533
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:32.650
<v Speaker 4>So these motherfuckers are searching </v>
<v Speaker 4>after campus.</v>

1534
01:02:32.651 --> 01:02:37.651
<v Speaker 4>So they're going towards where cats live</v>
<v Speaker 4>be were cats mark their territory.</v>

1535
01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:42.890
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're attracted to that and they're </v>

1536
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.890
<v Speaker 4>not afraid of cats anymore for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

1537
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:44.640
<v Speaker 4>So the cats obviously eat these rats </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the rats are retarded.</v>

1538
01:02:44.641 --> 01:02:47.550
<v Speaker 4>They stand there where the cats there </v>
<v Speaker 4>with their balls all swollen and a heart</v>

1539
01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:52.551
<v Speaker 4>on the Khakis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some the cat eats the rats than the cat </v>

1540
01:02:52.551 --> 01:02:54.510
<v Speaker 4>hangs around with people and we have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>clean the cat shit.</v>

1541
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.630
<v Speaker 4>And when people clean the cat shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes people touch the cat shit.</v>

1542
01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:02.780
<v Speaker 4>And if you touched the cat shit and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets inside your bloodstream through </v>

1543
01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.240
<v Speaker 4>either an open sore or maybe something </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your food or maybe an open,</v>

1544
01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:08.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your touch your eyes or something like </v>

1545
01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:08.241
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1546
01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:08.241
<v Speaker 4>That shit gets in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1547
01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:11.430
<v Speaker 4>And $60,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million people in this country are </v>

1548
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:12.000
<v Speaker 4>infected by it and it affects your </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>

1549
01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.070
<v Speaker 4>It changes your behavior and get it from</v>
<v Speaker 4>low jobs.</v>

1550
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:18.480
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you could get it from reading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get it from touching raw meat as</v>

1551
01:03:18.481 --> 01:03:19.560
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The um,</v>

1552
01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:23.220
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's 60 something million people in this</v>

1553
01:03:23.221 --> 01:03:28.221
<v Speaker 4>country are affected by and they said a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disproportion amount of people who die </v>

1554
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:31.461
<v Speaker 4>in motorcycle accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things he was talking about </v>

1555
01:03:31.461 --> 01:03:34.821
<v Speaker 4>was that they would test motorcycle </v>
<v Speaker 4>accident victims for toxoplasma because </v>

1556
01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:37.290
<v Speaker 4>the toxo plasma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this parasite that is,</v>

1557
01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:42.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this cat parasite makes people do </v>

1558
01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:42.340
<v Speaker 4>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit makes people wild.</v>

1559
01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:42.960
<v Speaker 4>Cats used to rule the rural and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>they used to like,</v>

1560
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:44.520
<v Speaker 4>this needs to be bigger than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how.</v>

1561
01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:49.550
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's what the thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why we're getting rid of their </v>

1562
01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:49.550
<v Speaker 4>cats.</v>

1563
01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:53.150
<v Speaker 4>Are you getting rid of your cats from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's also maybe,</v>

1564
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:56.610
<v Speaker 4>but then he'd be a woman pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>

1565
01:03:56.611 --> 01:04:01.611
<v Speaker 4>if you think about Brazilians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazilian men are notoriously </v>

1566
01:04:01.611 --> 01:04:01.611
<v Speaker 4>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazilian women,</v>

1567
01:04:01.611 --> 01:04:03.590
<v Speaker 4>notoriously submissive and sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1568
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.620
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1569
01:04:04.621 --> 01:04:09.621
<v Speaker 4>66 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two out of three women of childbearing </v>

1570
01:04:09.621 --> 01:04:12.770
<v Speaker 4>age are infected with this parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder about something to do with </v>

1571
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:14.510
<v Speaker 4>their assets if there's a connection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's quite a bit there?</v>

1572
01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.170
<v Speaker 4>They're asking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a reason.</v>

1573
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.200
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason that 85 percent of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>women between the ages of 18 and 48 have</v>

1574
01:04:22.531 --> 01:04:24.500
<v Speaker 4>great assets in Rio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1575
01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:26.490
<v Speaker 4>there's got to be something and it could</v>
<v Speaker 4>be kept paths.</v>

1576
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:31.500
<v Speaker 4>It could be the milk and why do cats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're up in the air when you tap </v>

1577
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.460
<v Speaker 4>on it because they want you to get that </v>
<v Speaker 4>dirty shit.</v>

1578
01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:33.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

1579
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:33.960
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1580
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:35.230
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got for you.</v>

1581
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:41.300
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>said that because that's one of the </v>

1582
01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.401
<v Speaker 4>things that this one of these articles </v>
<v Speaker 4>were saying was that people who are </v>

1583
01:04:43.401 --> 01:04:47.271
<v Speaker 4>normally polite people when they sneeze </v>
<v Speaker 4>will sometimes inadvertently or </v>

1584
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:52.340
<v Speaker 4>unconsciously turned towards people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sneeze like they don't even realize why </v>

1585
01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:52.390
<v Speaker 4>they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they.</v>

1586
01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:55.170
<v Speaker 4>They almost have an instinct that turned</v>
<v Speaker 4>towards people in Sneeze.</v>

1587
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people do it before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1588
01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.750
<v Speaker 4>Where they go like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're standing,</v>

1589
01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:03.770
<v Speaker 4>you're hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have like your body is trying to get</v>

1590
01:05:04.831 --> 01:05:06.270
<v Speaker 4>you to fucking blow a sneeze on </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody.</v>

1591
01:05:06.271 --> 01:05:08.070
<v Speaker 4>This is the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many cats do you have?</v>

1592
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:13.200
<v Speaker 4>Any possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think about what it does to cats </v>

1593
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.230
<v Speaker 4>and what it does to people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very possible that some viruses </v>

1594
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.140
<v Speaker 4>could try to get you to be attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people when they expel how many cats you</v>

1595
01:05:17.141 --> 01:05:17.830
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to,</v>

1596
01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1597
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 5>Joey Diaz has 10 or nine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck Cock sucker stopped bringing up my </v>

1599
01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.590
<v Speaker 5>Y'all need to get tested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here's the thing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh totally,</v>

1601
01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.190
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you think about that,</v>

1602
01:05:30.191 --> 01:05:30.700
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

1603
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:34.120
<v Speaker 5>if your cat has ever been outside and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you think your cat may have eaten a rat,</v>

1604
01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:40.000
<v Speaker 5>you know my cats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never been outside of Brazil.</v>

1605
01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:42.510
<v Speaker 5>They leave those cats out a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the curator anyway?</v>

1606
01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:47.520
<v Speaker 5>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might have to change the cat box </v>

1607
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:47.520
<v Speaker 5>with condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

1608
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:47.980
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not a cure.</v>

1609
01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:53.540
<v Speaker 5>What would keep you from infecting other</v>
<v Speaker 5>cats from getting in your poor Cuba.</v>

1610
01:05:55.610 --> 01:05:58.210
<v Speaker 5>That's a preventive method.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once you get it.</v>

1611
01:05:58.211 --> 01:05:59.540
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you could do anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

1612
01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:01.780
<v Speaker 5>It's just a water bottle that you spray </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself with.</v>

1613
01:06:01.781 --> 01:06:02.740
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1614
01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:08.310
<v Speaker 5>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We think about that your whole life </v>

1615
01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:10.201
<v Speaker 5>could get hijacked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some parasite could literally take </v>

1616
01:06:10.201 --> 01:06:12.940
<v Speaker 5>over your body and talk to your body and</v>
<v Speaker 5>to living a totally different life.</v>

1617
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.630
<v Speaker 5>And what the doctor was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1618
01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.110
<v Speaker 5>the scientists Soplasky I believe his </v>
<v Speaker 5>name is.</v>

1619
01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:22.380
<v Speaker 5>What he was talking about was that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of free will is really an illusion.</v>

1620
01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:27.571
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a bunch of mitigating </v>
<v Speaker 5>factors that caused you to move in one </v>

1621
01:06:27.571 --> 01:06:28.360
<v Speaker 5>direction or another and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain decisions.</v>

1622
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:33.660
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the thing that you have complete </v>

1623
01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:33.660
<v Speaker 5>free will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is kind of silly if you go on Amazon,</v>

1624
01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.540
<v Speaker 5>there's a urine detector for cat urine </v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you ever buy it,</v>

1625
01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.220
<v Speaker 5>just be worn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't just detect urine.</v>

1626
01:06:39.221 --> 01:06:41.350
<v Speaker 5>It detects a lot of gross shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1627
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:43.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of cool.</v>

1628
01:06:43.391 --> 01:06:45.790
<v Speaker 5>What I like calm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you put it on your bed,</v>

1629
01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:47.560
<v Speaker 5>it's just like every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this shit comes up.</v>

1630
01:06:47.561 --> 01:06:52.561
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty scary dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you've seen those inside edition </v>

1631
01:06:52.561 --> 01:06:54.160
<v Speaker 5>things where they go to hotel rooms and </v>
<v Speaker 5>check the covers.</v>

1632
01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

1633
01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.200
<v Speaker 5>Just judges all over the covers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a Goddamn Jackson pollock </v>

1634
01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.781
<v Speaker 5>painting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time you walk into a room with a </v>

1635
01:07:03.781 --> 01:07:03.781
<v Speaker 5>black light,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just loads everywhere.</v>

1636
01:07:03.781 --> 01:07:06.790
<v Speaker 5>Loads all the floor loads on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll find loads everywhere.</v>

1637
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:12.270
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've several times I've pulled out a </v>

1638
01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:15.601
<v Speaker 5>load and just just let it drip on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking carpet in a hotel.</v>

1639
01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:22.620
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever thrown your just build in?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Might have.</v>

1640
01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm just not thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not judging.</v>

1641
01:07:24.911 --> 01:07:27.780
<v Speaker 5>You might have for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can't remember any.</v>

1642
01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:29.500
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever throw your come on the wall </v>
<v Speaker 5>at a hotel room?</v>

1643
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.190
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never try it.</v>

1644
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:32.770
<v Speaker 5>It's so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just take a look.</v>

1645
01:07:32.771 --> 01:07:35.770
<v Speaker 5>Just throw it on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Spiderman is wrong with you.</v>

1646
01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:40.180
<v Speaker 5>Never done that to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is the nastiest fluid.</v>

1647
01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.370
<v Speaker 5>It's really pretty much the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>as it's not,</v>

1648
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>phlegm,</v>

1649
01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:47.140
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that it also can make </v>
<v Speaker 5>babies,</v>

1650
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just makes it ultra nasty.</v>

1651
01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:54.310
<v Speaker 5>It's weird how some girls love the taste</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it and some girls don't get to choose</v>

1652
01:07:54.311 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 5>between eating a dude's snot and neat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and dudes load for sure.</v>

1653
01:07:57.821 --> 01:08:02.821
<v Speaker 5>You're going to go with snot as chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say if a guy's got a gun to your head </v>

1654
01:08:04.391 --> 01:08:06.260
<v Speaker 5>and you're either going to eat this </v>
<v Speaker 5>load,</v>

1655
01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.360
<v Speaker 5>are you gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eat some snow.</v>

1656
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:10.330
<v Speaker 5>Like all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll eat your stock out of not.</v>

1657
01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 5>It's just rude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what if this is not what's coming </v>

1658
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 5>from the guy's Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

1659
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.980
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somehow they put it in their ultimate </v>

1660
01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:24.041
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pack out like a pastry,</v>

1661
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.870
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brendan?</v>

1662
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:30.410

<v Speaker 5>Which one would you take?</v>

1663
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.560
<v Speaker 5>One of those pastry things called let's </v>
<v Speaker 5>pastry scribes off cook measure.</v>

1664
01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:39.590
<v Speaker 5>You could do that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff so on.</v>

1665
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:42.650
<v Speaker 5>Snow up your load of your Dick like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then squeeze it out.</v>

1666
01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:47.120
<v Speaker 5>Dick spit spit out like that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to use that.</v>

1667
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.240
<v Speaker 5>Have you guys been to six flags lately?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1668
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.060
<v Speaker 5>I just have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just found out I went.</v>

1669
01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:53.930
<v Speaker 5>It was like I live like 15 miles away </v>
<v Speaker 5>from it,</v>

1670
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:56.060
<v Speaker 5>so I got a season pass to the pool when </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

1671
01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:01.320
<v Speaker 5>Fifteen months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing though if you go on the </v>

1672
01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:04.271
<v Speaker 5>rides during the day i.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing like how like the people </v>

1673
01:09:04.271 --> 01:09:07.181
<v Speaker 5>that work there roller,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you go on the highest biggest </v>

1674
01:09:07.181 --> 01:09:09.821
<v Speaker 5>roller coaster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get the best employees I guess at </v>

1675
01:09:09.821 --> 01:09:09.821

<v Speaker 5>at six flags.</v>

1676
01:09:09.821 --> 01:09:12.800
<v Speaker 5>But if you go on like that one boat that</v>
<v Speaker 5>just rocks up and down.</v>

1677
01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:16.930
<v Speaker 5>You obviously have the worst employees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had one guy and I swear to God I'm.</v>

1678
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.570
<v Speaker 5>He might be like mentally handicapped by</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1679
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:20.570
<v Speaker 5>so I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>

1685

<v Speaker 5>glassy stare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he had no idea he was even there </v>

1686
01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:36.860

<v Speaker 5>He's operating the ride.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'll play through the second year.</v>

<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You see the loops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they flip you upside down,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm very scared though right now.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy is the guy who's operating this</v>

<v Speaker 5>at me right in the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was like glass.</v>

<v Speaker 5>maybe the dude is super responsible just</v>

1720
01:11:35.161 --> 01:11:36.960
<v Speaker 5>because he has this tremendous speech </v>
<v Speaker 5>impediment.</v>

1721
01:11:36.961 --> 01:11:40.470
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he's a super responsible super </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientious guy.</v>

1722
01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:43.860
<v Speaker 5>May have ever thought maybe it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>

1723
01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:46.530
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you can't hear people screaming to</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop the ride.</v>

1724
01:11:46.531 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 5>That can't be good if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fucking dude has got the hand on the</v>

1725
01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:50.760
<v Speaker 5>ride button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do that.</v>

1726
01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:52.900
<v Speaker 5>Ride was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Babies go on those lines.</v>

1727
01:11:52.901 --> 01:11:56.730
<v Speaker 5>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a merry go round with swings.</v>

1728
01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:57.930
<v Speaker 5>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which one was it?</v>

1729
01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:03.740
<v Speaker 5>That one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That one is the one we're just spinning </v>

1730
01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:03.740
<v Speaker 5>in a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is swings,</v>

1731
01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:03.740
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still,</v>

1732
01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a ride,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1733
01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:05.430
<v Speaker 5>and then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1734
01:12:05.431 --> 01:12:07.430
<v Speaker 5>So you still think it's too dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>for retarded.</v>

1735
01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:08.730
<v Speaker 5>It's something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's that happened?</v>

1736
01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.390
<v Speaker 5>Was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think he got it?</v>

1737
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.020
<v Speaker 5>What do you think was wrong with him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he was special.</v>

1738
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:14.490
<v Speaker 5>Maybe special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>special,</v>

1739
01:12:14.491 --> 01:12:15.930
<v Speaker 5>special Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Special Olympics.</v>

1740
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.870
<v Speaker 5>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no way magic amount would hire a</v>

1741
01:12:18.871 --> 01:12:19.650
<v Speaker 5>retard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1742
01:12:19.651 --> 01:12:20.650
<v Speaker 5>But with what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there's,</v>

1743
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:25.850
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's all sorts of levels of </v>

1744
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:25.850
<v Speaker 5>impairment that human being suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he passed the test,</v>

1745
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:27.030
<v Speaker 5>like with colors and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there a test?</v>

1746
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.680
<v Speaker 5>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you think the test is?</v>

1747
01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:33.770
<v Speaker 5>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Colors and shapes and those shapes that </v>

1748
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.770
<v Speaker 5>you put in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the circles.</v>

1749
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.770
<v Speaker 5>That's why it seems like the test </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't be there.</v>

1750
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:38.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the odds of getting killed in one of </v>

1751
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.630
<v Speaker 5>those accidents is very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very slim.</v>

1752
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:40.650
<v Speaker 5>But what had happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God town that must suck.</v>

1753
01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:46.060
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you put yourself on some wacky </v>

1754
01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:46.060
<v Speaker 5>rollercoaster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>flips you around,</v>

1755
01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:46.980
<v Speaker 5>you wind up dying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He imagine hanging out with a dude,</v>

1756
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:52.070
<v Speaker 5>we got to get a depth dude and on </v>
<v Speaker 5>crystal meth where he just can't shut </v>

1757
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:55.530
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shut up.</v>

1758
01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.630
<v Speaker 5>He's got so many stories to tell you.</v>

1759
01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:04.790
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy was not deaf because when I </v>

1760
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:06.741
<v Speaker 5>asked him that question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he turned around when I asked him about </v>

1761
01:13:06.741 --> 01:13:07.290
<v Speaker 5>the water bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's way hollow,</v>

1762
01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.090
<v Speaker 5>so he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't deaf.</v>

1763
01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:13.170
<v Speaker 5>So you think he maybe had some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>autism or something like that?</v>

1764
01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:16.140
<v Speaker 5>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but impediment for sure.</v>

1765
01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:19.140
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How ridiculous is that on another ride?</v>

1766
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.940
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't like the biggest,</v>

1767
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:22.560
<v Speaker 5>right was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was called the Ninja,</v>

1768
01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:24.580
<v Speaker 5>which is a rollercoaster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

1769
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:29.780
<v Speaker 5>they were going to check everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like straps and stuff and the guy just </v>

1770
01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:29.910
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see them checking it.</v>

1771
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.170
<v Speaker 5>Then he goes to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just touch it.</v>

1772
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.580
<v Speaker 5>Like he just tapped it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1773
01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:35.250
<v Speaker 5>you weren't even lifting or any that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just touched it.</v>

1774
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.380
<v Speaker 5>Just touching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does not check anything,</v>

1775
01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I was like,</v>

1776
01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:41.520
<v Speaker 5>did he just touch it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know what I mean?</v>

1777
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.860
<v Speaker 5>Like how they lived it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They assume that it's,</v>

1778
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.790
<v Speaker 5>it can be loose and you can go flying </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

1779
01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:53.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it would have fucking scary way to </v>

1780
01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:53.060
<v Speaker 5>die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That must be.</v>

1781
01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.280
<v Speaker 5>And then there was this like this guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>that like he kept on Splat,</v>

1782
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:59.320
<v Speaker 5>like we're waiting in line for like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>raft ride and it was really hot and so </v>

1783
01:13:59.320 --> 01:13:59.910
<v Speaker 5>every couple minutes he would like </v>
<v Speaker 5>splash.</v>

1784
01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.790
<v Speaker 5>Everybody that's in line with water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he was the lifeguard.</v>

1785
01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:07.940
<v Speaker 5>Now he's the one that pushed you down </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the side in this raft for every </v>

1786
01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:11.181
<v Speaker 5>couple minutes who like splash you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he kept them like fucking kicking </v>

1787
01:14:11.181 --> 01:14:12.040

<v Speaker 5>So when I got up there I just started</v>

1788
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.880

1793
01:14:25.171 --> 01:14:26.080

<v Speaker 4>sure I'm part of the ride.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It woke me up and I was like,</v>

1947
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:43.580
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck did I hear?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like looking her ass.</v>

1948
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:47.970
<v Speaker 4>And then a second one came out loud one </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then she woke up.</v>

1949
01:20:47.971 --> 01:20:49.080
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>

1950
01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:50.010
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1951
01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:52.290
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I went back to see,</v>

1952
01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:57.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those vacuums that they have at the car </v>

1953
01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:57.620
<v Speaker 4>wash places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1954
01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:00.980
<v Speaker 4>If they'd have one right by your bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you just kinda like a smoke smoking </v>

1955
01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:05.050
<v Speaker 4>going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd always have to think about it </v>

1956
01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:05.310
<v Speaker 4>getting stuck to your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I did,</v>

1957
01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:11.230
<v Speaker 4>what I did last night is I got off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet is that you take a little bit </v>

1958
01:21:11.230 --> 01:21:11.350
<v Speaker 4>of Vicks Vapor Rub and put around your </v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole.</v>

1959
01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:13.200
<v Speaker 4>So even if it does far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just much like Vick's vapor rub.</v>

1960
01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.560
<v Speaker 4>So the Internet got a tip to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1961
01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:17.790
<v Speaker 4>You tried that and your asshole is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to light on fire.</v>

1962
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
<v Speaker 4>That's terrible advice to put capsaicin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rubbing your butthole is like open </v>

1963
01:21:26.371 --> 01:21:27.180
<v Speaker 4>source.</v>

1964
01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like an open wound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1965
01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:31.260
<v Speaker 4>it's super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super open skin.</v>

1966
01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:36.320
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible airtight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is because you know there's like a </v>

1967
01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:36.870
<v Speaker 4>gigantic explosion like right there at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the end of year you can smell it,</v>

1968
01:21:36.871 --> 01:21:40.040
<v Speaker 4>so what can you do besides vapor?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rub that with you,</v>

1969
01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:43.620
<v Speaker 4>like if you rub like shaving cream or </v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>

1970
01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.320
<v Speaker 4>aftershave on your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It never bothers you at all,</v>

1971
01:21:46.450 --> 01:21:48.990
<v Speaker 4>but if you rub that shit on your balls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to fucking hurt.</v>

1972
01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:54.170
<v Speaker 4>And your balls dip your Dick in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you dip your Dick and that stuff and </v>

1973
01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:55.560
<v Speaker 4>touches like that soft tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put that around your asshole.</v>

1974
01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.360
<v Speaker 4>What about just some bubble gum or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something?</v>

1975
01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:00.000
<v Speaker 4>Just plug it up with some bubble gum </v>
<v Speaker 4>before you go to bed.</v>

1976
01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:05.600
<v Speaker 4>Put roses around it like glue roses </v>
<v Speaker 4>around until took us through a rose </v>

1977
01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:05.600
<v Speaker 4>filter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some lemon juice.</v>

1978
01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:10.131
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's what you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make a filter out of roses like a </v>

1979
01:22:10.131 --> 01:22:11.430
<v Speaker 4>diaphragm as little stickies on it on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the side,</v>

1980
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.050
<v Speaker 4>and just stick it right to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>butthole.</v>

1981
01:22:13.051 --> 01:22:14.820
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a filter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you fart,</v>

1982
01:22:14.821 --> 01:22:19.821
<v Speaker 4>it goes through an snl sketch like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 years ago with commercial parody </v>

1983
01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.910
<v Speaker 4>where they go now you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1984
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.550
<v Speaker 4>No more embarrassing farts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are they?</v>

1985
01:22:23.551 --> 01:22:28.551
<v Speaker 4>Take a big horn and he stuck a big horn </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your ass and then when you were at </v>

1986
01:22:28.551 --> 01:22:28.890
<v Speaker 4>park,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be an electronic voice that said,</v>

1987
01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:30.770
<v Speaker 4>how bout them doctor?</v>

1988
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:37.910
<v Speaker 4>That was all about them dodgers and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>it did filter out your farts smell.</v>

1989
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:47.590
<v Speaker 4>It is pretty incredible when you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about all the technology that we have </v>

1990
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:51.231
<v Speaker 4>that we have zero invested in farts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have nothing invested in cleaning up </v>

1991
01:22:51.331 --> 01:22:56.331
<v Speaker 4>the smell of forest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no product farts or like a </v>

1992
01:22:56.331 --> 01:22:59.391
<v Speaker 4>normal part of everyone's day and yet </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no technology that exists to try</v>

1993
01:22:59.491 --> 01:23:04.491
<v Speaker 4>to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be like a Fart sucker built inside the </v>

1994
01:23:04.491 --> 01:23:07.041
<v Speaker 4>seat cushion where you sit down and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like right there and you could secretly </v>

1995
01:23:07.041 --> 01:23:09.210
<v Speaker 4>just press that button.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't they have writers?</v>

1996
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:14.430
<v Speaker 4>They have a filter on the top of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>litter box so that I don't smell my </v>

1997
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.740
<v Speaker 4>cat's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a charcoal filter.</v>

1998
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:16.870
<v Speaker 4>Why don't they make filters for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>underwear if you like.</v>

1999
01:23:16.871 --> 01:23:21.871
<v Speaker 4>If you like to eat a lot of Mexican food</v>
<v Speaker 4>or if you're going out drinking and you </v>

2000
01:23:21.871 --> 01:23:22.180
<v Speaker 4>know you're gonna be farting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't they have some filters?</v>

2001
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:25.060
<v Speaker 4>That's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a fart.</v>

2002
01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:26.870
<v Speaker 4>Kotex?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2003
01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.070
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the FARC,</v>

2004
01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:33.080
<v Speaker 4>Kotex build into your underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your Saturday night party in short and </v>

2005
01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:38.700
<v Speaker 4>he your Saturday night party and </v>
<v Speaker 4>underwear and they have built in </v>

2006
01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:41.170
<v Speaker 4>charcoal filter in there to sent it like</v>
<v Speaker 4>strawberries or something like that.</v>

2007
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.580
<v Speaker 4>Like a butt plug to take because you got</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fuck with the noise through.</v>

2008
01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:49.620
<v Speaker 4>The noise is going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you need to stick something in your </v>

2009
01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:49.970
<v Speaker 4>ass like maybe a couple inches and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>it just got something real list.</v>

2010
01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:53.390
<v Speaker 4>The knowledge will be way muffled if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a Kotex over your bundle.</v>

2011
01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 4>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a real loud one.</v>

2012
01:23:56.261 --> 01:23:56.950
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2013
01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:02.240
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tate Fletcher would be their fucking </v>

2014
01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.311
<v Speaker 4>product management guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd be the one to test to see the </v>

2015
01:24:05.311 --> 01:24:05.320
<v Speaker 4>efficacy of their individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Filters.</v>

2016
01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:11.560
<v Speaker 4>Sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sounds with a clipboard like organizing.</v>

2017
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:18.030
<v Speaker 4>He's like head of the science team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's and it's all built around his </v>

2018
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.030
<v Speaker 4>gas.</v>

2019
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Put the stethoscope notice stomach to </v>
<v Speaker 4>try to determine whether that is ready </v>

2020
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:22.700
<v Speaker 4>to fart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fart.</v>

2021
01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hot as fuck.</v>

2022
01:24:23.801 --> 01:24:26.110
<v Speaker 4>It's hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to my ac broke and the side of the</v>

2023
01:24:26.111 --> 01:24:27.880
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to get it fixed.</v>

2024
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:30.130
<v Speaker 4>Get some Mexicans to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2025
01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:32.350
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>With the Mexicans?</v>

2026
01:24:32.351 --> 01:24:33.940
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

2027
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:36.880
<v Speaker 4>So speaking of Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Gulf of Mexico,</v>

2028
01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:41.900
<v Speaker 4>the fucking oil spill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've just determined that the oil is </v>

2029
01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:44.731
<v Speaker 4>coming out in multiple locations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've just confirmed that it's not </v>

2030
01:24:44.731 --> 01:24:46.120
<v Speaker 4>just this one spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even if they dig this relief,</v>

2031
01:24:46.121 --> 01:24:51.121
<v Speaker 4>well it's still might be fucked because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the oil is coming out from all these </v>

2032
01:24:51.121 --> 01:24:52.240
<v Speaker 4>different spots like very far away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

2033
01:24:52.241 --> 01:24:53.500
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

2034
01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Fucked up Cancun yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2035
01:24:56.650 --> 01:24:59.160
<v Speaker 4>Once it goes around the Florida and goes</v>
<v Speaker 4>up the code,</v>

2036
01:24:59.410 --> 01:25:01.870
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy because I mean just think </v>
<v Speaker 4>myrtle beach,</v>

2037
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beaches,</v>

2038
01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:04.710
<v Speaker 4>all that shit's not going to get a swim.</v>

2039
01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:09.720
<v Speaker 4>Then beach on the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those beaches of Jack duty might go </v>

2040
01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:09.720
<v Speaker 4>to England.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2041
01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:14.460
<v Speaker 4>It's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so incredible that they don't have </v>

2042
01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:18.001
<v Speaker 4>a way to stop the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're allowed to make these </v>

2043
01:25:18.001 --> 01:25:20.701
<v Speaker 4>things and not have fail safes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would think there would be a bunch </v>

2044
01:25:20.701 --> 01:25:20.701
<v Speaker 4>of set failsafes if there's a rupture in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this line.</v>

2045
01:25:20.701 --> 01:25:22.300
<v Speaker 4>We shut it off here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a rupture here.</v>

2046
01:25:22.301 --> 01:25:27.301
<v Speaker 4>We shut it off here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This way we can absolutely ensure that </v>

2047
01:25:27.301 --> 01:25:27.350
<v Speaker 4>will be no pollution comes out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2048
01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:30.190
<v Speaker 4>animals are going to evolve and thrive </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the oil.</v>

2049
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:34.280
<v Speaker 4>Probably not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's probably gonna happen,</v>

2050
01:25:34.290 --> 01:25:37.560
<v Speaker 4>we may be millions of years from now if </v>
<v Speaker 4>I kept talking to what's going to happen</v>

2051
01:25:37.650 --> 01:25:39.790
<v Speaker 4>to kill all these animals off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2052
01:25:39.791 --> 01:25:42.250
<v Speaker 4>make belief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mon Southern Fire Monster.</v>

2053
01:25:42.970 --> 01:25:47.970
<v Speaker 4>Some fucking dragon that eats the oil </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that stores in like a special gland </v>

2054
01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:52.860
<v Speaker 4>has got rocks in the back of his throat </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it sparks up the flame to how </v>

2055
01:25:53.951 --> 01:25:58.951
<v Speaker 4>many dragons are there an ancient </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures and where the fuck that come </v>

2056
01:25:58.951 --> 01:25:58.951
<v Speaker 4>from dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that still exist?</v>

2057
01:25:58.951 --> 01:26:03.691
<v Speaker 4>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to the zoo and some of these </v>

2058
01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:05.641
<v Speaker 4>lizard things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those looked like fucking like Komodo </v>

2059
01:26:05.641 --> 01:26:05.641
<v Speaker 4>dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit's crazy.</v>

2060
01:26:05.641 --> 01:26:07.130
<v Speaker 4>If you just have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2061
01:26:07.150 --> 01:26:08.950
<v Speaker 4>I think Komodo dragons were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2062
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.000
<v Speaker 4>dwarfs of the big old relative to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chinese dragon came from someone saw </v>

2063
01:26:14.331 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 4>like a crocodile or a Komodo Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just drew it in the story.</v>

2064
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:21.050
<v Speaker 4>Went back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rawlings being misinterpreted.</v>

2065
01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you were saying that dude,</v>

2066
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.800
<v Speaker 4>like there's drama that people tales and</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2067
01:26:24.801 --> 01:26:27.290
<v Speaker 4>That's just some gay guy that depth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some dude was drawing,</v>

2068
01:26:27.291 --> 01:26:29.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he was dressed up as a dragon or it</v>

2069
01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 4>could have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2070
01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:32.120
<v Speaker 4>the national enquirer for 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

2071
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:33.840
<v Speaker 4>They were just making shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2072
01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's possible.</v>

2073
01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had to believe in one.</v>

2074
01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:44.290
<v Speaker 4>Dragons are vampires attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One Dragon Dragon's dude.</v>

2075
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:48.410
<v Speaker 4>Vampires are so stupid to think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2076
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:49.670
<v Speaker 4>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>

2077
01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:52.210
<v Speaker 4>Will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where will this be for bleeding?</v>

2078
01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:53.740
<v Speaker 4>Cool Dragon?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2079
01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:55.500
<v Speaker 4>I believe vampires before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe where will,</v>

2080
01:26:55.570 --> 01:27:00.570
<v Speaker 4>because I've seen vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What could it be is it could be some </v>

2081
01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:00.700
<v Speaker 4>sort of a parasite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that hijacks your system,</v>

2082
01:27:00.701 --> 01:27:02.540
<v Speaker 4>but vampires is supposed to be dead and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>

2083
01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:07.690
<v Speaker 4>But what if the parasite hijacks your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your aging system too and keeps you </v>

2084
01:27:07.690 --> 01:27:07.690
<v Speaker 4>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it makes you feast on blood.</v>

2085
01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:11.420
<v Speaker 4>It could be just the idea of a blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>sucking person,</v>

2086
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:16.570
<v Speaker 4>a person that lives off blood that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>parasite could trick you into doing </v>

2087
01:27:16.570 --> 01:27:19.901
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is way more possible than a </v>

2088
01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:22.361
<v Speaker 4>werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of the changes back and forth to </v>

2089
01:27:22.361 --> 01:27:22.361
<v Speaker 4>another animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then back again.</v>

2090
01:27:22.361 --> 01:27:26.230
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying that Sun can burn </v>

2091
01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:26.230
<v Speaker 4>people during the day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2092
01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:29.170
<v Speaker 4>but I can't say that if they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they had some sort of a crazy,</v>

2093
01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:34.420
<v Speaker 4>a blood problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know where they may be in intensely </v>

2094
01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:37.691
<v Speaker 4>anemic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might have like a real aversion to </v>

2095
01:27:37.691 --> 01:27:40.151
<v Speaker 4>sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might lose the pigment in their </v>

2096
01:27:40.151 --> 01:27:40.151
<v Speaker 4>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's possible,</v>

2097
01:27:40.151 --> 01:27:43.001
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you think you see the shit that </v>

2098
01:27:43.001 --> 01:27:45.161
<v Speaker 4>parasites do do to different insects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different caterpillars and bugs and ants</v>

2099
01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:50.291
<v Speaker 4>and all sorts of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their whole bodies get hijacked by </v>

2100
01:27:50.291 --> 01:27:51.350
<v Speaker 4>parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely rewires their entire system.</v>

2101
01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.930
<v Speaker 4>It happens to frogs and happens to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lizards.</v>

2102
01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.080
<v Speaker 4>So many different animals exist in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal kingdom and it just recently </v>

2103
01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:01.640
<v Speaker 4>discovering new parasites that hijack </v>
<v Speaker 4>new hosts caused them to do.</v>

2104
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.300
<v Speaker 4>Let's get this straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cat parasites make women more horny.</v>

2105
01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.580
<v Speaker 4>It makes women more submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes.</v>

2106
01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:12.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of interpretation of </v>

2107
01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:12.660
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it exactly affects them,</v>

2108
01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:15.350
<v Speaker 4>but it seems to make men and women the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposite makes men more aggressive.</v>

2109
01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:19.420
<v Speaker 4>Women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They going crazy guy with a beard down,</v>

2110
01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.830
<v Speaker 4>calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazilian women aren't calm.</v>

2111
01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:25.100
<v Speaker 4>Well then that doesn't make sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're wild too,</v>

2112
01:28:25.101 --> 01:28:28.010
<v Speaker 4>and they have to deal with all those </v>
<v Speaker 4>wild men so it makes them extra wire.</v>

2113
01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.120
<v Speaker 4>What are you saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

2114
01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:32.270
<v Speaker 4>This is all based off the research guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2115
01:28:32.271 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2116
01:28:32.661 --> 01:28:32.990
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2117
01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:33.890
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2118
01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:34.220
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2119
01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:34.520
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2120
01:28:34.521 --> 01:28:38.700
<v Speaker 4>Toxo toxo plasma is a very well </v>
<v Speaker 4>established overtaking.</v>

2121
01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:39.710
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2122
01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:40.460
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>

2123
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.030
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2124
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:46.030
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This says 6 million people or or 60 </v>

2125
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.850
<v Speaker 4>million people rather than America </v>
<v Speaker 4>habit.</v>

2126
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:49.340
<v Speaker 4>This is the CDC there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look online,</v>

2127
01:28:49.341 --> 01:28:51.590
<v Speaker 4>there's many different studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many different ports,</v>

2128
01:28:51.591 --> 01:28:53.270
<v Speaker 4>many different scientists working on </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

2129
01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:58.420
<v Speaker 4>Toxo plasma is a very real parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is his actual d actually detectable</v>

2130
01:28:59.481 --> 01:29:04.481
<v Speaker 4>and people that they know is responsible</v>
<v Speaker 4>in part or connected in part to uh,</v>

2131
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:06.720
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of different psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>ailments.</v>

2132
01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:07.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the part that it.</v>

2133
01:29:07.871 --> 01:29:10.820
<v Speaker 4>Schizophrenia making girls submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That part of this whole.</v>

2134
01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.170
<v Speaker 4>I know one guy saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2135
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.220
<v Speaker 4>it's a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would also train.</v>

2136
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:18.120
<v Speaker 4>It changes all sorts of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said it changes.</v>

2137
01:29:18.121 --> 01:29:19.560
<v Speaker 4>Rats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes them attracted.</v>

2138
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Cat piss changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men makes them assholes.</v>

2139
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:25.900
<v Speaker 4>Makes him reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really fascinating stuff.</v>

2140
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.040
<v Speaker 4>And when you research and you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how many different parasites might</v>

2141
01:29:30.041 --> 01:29:35.041
<v Speaker 4>exist that we don't even buy my shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't work.</v>

2142
01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:39.490
<v Speaker 4>Check,</v>
<v Speaker 4>check,</v>

2143
01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:40.010
<v Speaker 4>check,</v>
<v Speaker 4>check,</v>

2144
01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:47.930
<v Speaker 4>check,</v>
<v Speaker 4>check.</v>

2145
01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:53.450
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much was out just for 20 seconds </v>

2146
01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:55.820
<v Speaker 4>talking about campus anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know.</v>

2147
01:29:55.910 --> 01:30:00.910
<v Speaker 4>We know that these parasites exist and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that these parasites affect </v>

2148
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:02.570
<v Speaker 4>people and if we know there's just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of them,</v>

2149
01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:06.410
<v Speaker 4>how do we not know that there's a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 4>more that we haven't detected yet?</v>

2150
01:30:06.411 --> 01:30:11.411
<v Speaker 4>What about use as a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to eat those green weeds with a </v>

2151
01:30:11.411 --> 01:30:13.400
<v Speaker 4>yellow flower on the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever eat those?</v>

2152
01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Dogs would piss on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dogs a piano,</v>

2153
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:16.520
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the Dandelion.</v>

2156
01:30:22.101 --> 01:30:24.710
<v Speaker 4>Dandelions you eat,</v>

2160
01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:36.680
<v Speaker 4>How crazy that is though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if there really is a,</v>

2161
01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:40.250
<v Speaker 4>an animal parasite that makes people </v>
<v Speaker 4>like aggressive,</v>

2162
01:30:40.251 --> 01:30:42.710
<v Speaker 4>it makes women's submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that is Brazil.</v>

2163

2165
01:30:54.461 --> 01:30:54.461
<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just because they need that.</v>

2166
01:30:54.461 --> 01:30:57.140
<v Speaker 4>They're just happy to get that coke or </v>
<v Speaker 4>coke.</v>

2167
01:30:57.141 --> 01:31:00.770
<v Speaker 4>Makes them immediately submissive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's cooked.</v>

2168
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:05.830
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember Larry used to have coke around </v>

01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:16.150
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never fucked with it.</v>

2173
01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:17.360
<v Speaker 4>I knew too many people that had real </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems with it.</v>

2174
01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:19.700
<v Speaker 4>I've done coke maybe five times in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole life.</v>

2175
01:31:19.730 --> 01:31:23.120
<v Speaker 4>Maybe three to five times sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scary pussies.</v>

2176
01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.460
<v Speaker 4>They say you got to get that Rockstar </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cook.</v>

2177
01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:28.820
<v Speaker 4>That's what a Tom Sawyer from cobb's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>San Francisco.</v>

2178
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:31.250
<v Speaker 4>He's always saying you got to get that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rockstar Coke Shit.</v>

2179
01:31:31.251 --> 01:31:32.780
<v Speaker 4>I read somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something about coke.</v>

2180
01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:36.080
<v Speaker 4>How there's bad coke going around now </v>
<v Speaker 4>that like will eat your skin.</v>

2181
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:41.110
<v Speaker 4>Like it has some kind of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical in it that just starts burning </v>

2182
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.110
<v Speaker 4>your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

2183
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:43.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ain't got a google list now.</v>

2184
01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:45.080
<v Speaker 4>Bad cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

2185
01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.650
<v Speaker 4>What you were telling me about tylenol?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is going on with?</v>

2186
01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:50.570
<v Speaker 4>So there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you try to get tylenol right now,</v>

2187
01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:55.571
<v Speaker 4>I guess there's this huge tylenol like </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they pulled it from the store </v>

2188
01:31:55.571 --> 01:31:58.541
<v Speaker 4>shelves and what's crazy is that I did </v>
<v Speaker 4>some research on it and it seems like a.</v>

2189
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 4>So they</v>

2190
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:05.250
<v Speaker 3>did all these like things where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>went to the factories were tylenol is </v>

2191
01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:07.990
<v Speaker 3>made and they found a like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bacteria inside tylenol.</v>

2192
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:12.370
<v Speaker 3>They found like the chemicals that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>being made to make tunnel were off.</v>

2193
01:32:12.371 --> 01:32:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Like there was too much of one chemical </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not enough of another chemical.</v>

2194
01:32:15.490 --> 01:32:17.500
<v Speaker 3>So it could possibly have got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2195
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:22.590
<v Speaker 3>made kid's sick and so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pulled off tylenol off the shelves </v>

2196
01:32:22.590 --> 01:32:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the other day a monitor,</v>

2197
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:30.720
<v Speaker 3>there was this report that came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this report that came out </v>

2198
01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:31.750
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Johnson and Johnson,</v>

2199
01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:33.310
<v Speaker 3>the company that owns tylenol or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2200
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:38.430
<v Speaker 3>hired this third party company from San </v>
<v Speaker 3>Diego to act like customers and then go </v>

2201
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:41.440
<v Speaker 3>into grocery stores and buy all this one</v>
<v Speaker 3>product off the shelf.</v>

2202
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Like they're doing a phantom recall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning they didn't want to tell anybody</v>

2203
01:32:45.461 --> 01:32:46.690
<v Speaker 3>or anyone to know.</v>

2204
01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.910
<v Speaker 3>So they hired a company to go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>grocery stores,</v>

2205
01:32:48.911 --> 01:32:51.160
<v Speaker 3>into pharmacies to take this product off</v>
<v Speaker 3>your shelf.</v>

2206
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.230
<v Speaker 3>And then they got caught and then a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month later they,</v>

2207
01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.910
<v Speaker 3>they recalled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2208
01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.260
<v Speaker 3>this other drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like Tylenol,</v>

2209
01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:02.280
<v Speaker 3>I forget the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like another one and they're </v>

2210
01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:02.380
<v Speaker 3>like kids tylenol or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2211
01:33:02.381 --> 01:33:04.450
<v Speaker 3>How much have you looked into this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously?</v>

2212
01:33:04.451 --> 01:33:06.670
<v Speaker 3>It was like a half hour today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just read around today,</v>

2213
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:11.910
<v Speaker 3>but a tylenol Johnson Johnson was </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to give over to the FDA like </v>

2214
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:16.021
<v Speaker 3>this report about their findings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that and they missed the </v>

2215
01:33:16.021 --> 01:33:20.101
<v Speaker 3>deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the deadline was yesterday or </v>

2216
01:33:20.101 --> 01:33:22.021
<v Speaker 3>two days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They missed the deadlines is something </v>

2217
01:33:22.021 --> 01:33:22.270
<v Speaker 3>might be up at Tylenol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you have any tylenol from 2008,</v>

2218
01:33:22.271 --> 01:33:24.700
<v Speaker 3>you might want to go check it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw it away or do whatever you have to</v>

2219
01:33:24.701 --> 01:33:29.701
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there was another report I was </v>

2220
01:33:29.701 --> 01:33:30.280
<v Speaker 3>reading as say something like there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 deaths related to tylenol in the last</v>

2221
01:33:30.281 --> 01:33:32.680
<v Speaker 3>two years and they don't know if that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected or not either.</v>

2222
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:35.020
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google search,</v>

2223
01:33:35.021 --> 01:33:40.021
<v Speaker 3>tylenol recall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some crazy shit going on with </v>

2224
01:33:40.021 --> 01:33:40.021
<v Speaker 3>some tylenol right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2225
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 3>They're saying that the pharmacist that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we were at today said that there might </v>

2226
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 3>not be tying on until 2011.</v>

2227
01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.850
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who is fuck.</v>

2228
01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:52.890
<v Speaker 5>Who's who got in trouble for cyanide?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're saying there's potential </v>

2229
01:33:52.890 --> 01:33:52.960
<v Speaker 5>criminal charges and indictments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2230
01:33:53.010 --> 01:33:54.100
<v Speaker 5>that's what they're saying about </v>
<v Speaker 5>tylenol.</v>

2231
01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:54.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2232
01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.980
<v Speaker 3>and it's crazy because you pay extra for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tylenol,</v>

2233
01:33:57.981 --> 01:33:58.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2234
01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:03.500
<v Speaker 3>your tunnels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like more expensive than like the </v>

2235
01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:03.500
<v Speaker 3>average brand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2236
01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:07.211
<v Speaker 3>And you would think that they would have</v>
<v Speaker 3>their shit together a little bit better </v>

2237
01:34:07.211 --> 01:34:07.211
<v Speaker 3>than fucking</v>

2238
01:34:07.211 --> 01:34:07.211
<v Speaker 5>buffering first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Toyota.</v>

2239
01:34:07.211 --> 01:34:10.770
<v Speaker 5>Now this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's next fucking cup of color.</v>

2240
01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.080

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2241
01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:17.100
<v Speaker 5>as the economy starts to fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as people start to make less and less </v>

2242
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:17.170
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna see more and more problems.</v>

2243
01:34:17.171 --> 01:34:20.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure less and less research is going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be done less and less,</v>

2244
01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fail safe measures.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Did you watch the last comic standing </v>
<v Speaker 5>last night?</v>

<v Speaker 5>people and one of them was going to try </v>

2256

<v Speaker 4>Parks or schools.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>if we became legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his whole business shuts down.</v>

2430
01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:17.280
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then that's a tricky situation for a </v>

2431
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:17.280
<v Speaker 4>week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dr.</v>

2432
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:19.240
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be wild.</v>

2433
01:42:19.241 --> 01:42:24.241
<v Speaker 4>If it gets through though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it gets through in California and it </v>

2434
01:42:24.241 --> 01:42:26.080
<v Speaker 4>becomes absolutely legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be fucking crazy.</v>

2435
01:42:26.230 --> 01:42:29.950
<v Speaker 4>It's going to really change the culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>here because people realize how much has</v>

2436
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:32.380
<v Speaker 4>changed the culture since medical </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana became legal,</v>

2437
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:36.100
<v Speaker 4>but that's just the beginning man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When when it becomes legal legal,</v>

2438
01:42:36.101 --> 01:42:41.101
<v Speaker 4>when it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know a personal use issue when you </v>

2439
01:42:41.101 --> 01:42:43.621
<v Speaker 4>just have to be over 21,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just go to the fucking corner </v>

2440
01:42:43.621 --> 01:42:44.200
<v Speaker 4>drugstore and they're selling weed or </v>
<v Speaker 4>selling weed everywhere.</v>

2441
01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:45.630
<v Speaker 4>It's going to change things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2442
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:47.440
<v Speaker 4>They're going to start selling weed at </v>
<v Speaker 4>bars.</v>

2443
01:42:47.530 --> 01:42:49.930
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have weed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking sections at bars for sure.</v>

2444
01:42:49.931 --> 01:42:52.570
<v Speaker 4>They'll have like a back patio where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can smoke weed.</v>

2445
01:42:53.110 --> 01:42:57.070
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna be nuts when they allow you </v>
<v Speaker 4>to buy a joint at a movie theater,</v>

2446
01:42:57.071 --> 01:43:02.071
<v Speaker 4>like at the arc light smoke because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have like a movie theater designated </v>

2447
01:43:02.071 --> 01:43:06.540
<v Speaker 4>with a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be 21 to get into this </v>

2448
01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:06.540
<v Speaker 4>theater at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have a weed there.</v>

2449
01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:08.230
<v Speaker 4>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the problem is.</v>

2450
01:43:08.231 --> 01:43:11.530
<v Speaker 4>You can't even smoke cigarettes indoors </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's a personal.</v>

2451
01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:14.290
<v Speaker 4>It's other people's health that you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>to choose.</v>

2452
01:43:14.810 --> 01:43:17.050
<v Speaker 4>You get to choose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to choose.</v>

2453
01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:19.510
<v Speaker 4>They don't let that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't let that happen in.</v>

2454
01:43:19.511 --> 01:43:21.370
<v Speaker 4>In California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't even smoke at a bar.</v>

2455
01:43:21.371 --> 01:43:24.190
<v Speaker 4>It's not even an option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to go to a cigar bar.</v>

2456
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:26.830
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I belong to a cigar bar in beverly hills</v>

2457
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:30.340
<v Speaker 4>and you go there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2458
01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:35.440
<v Speaker 4>but so god bars like a bunch of stuffy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rich dudes and it's got a thousand </v>

2459
01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:38.290
<v Speaker 4>dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

2460
01:43:38.291 --> 01:43:40.480
<v Speaker 4>Maybe more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the gayest thing I've ever heard.</v>

2461
01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:45.540
<v Speaker 4>You take a failed cigar bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The licensing for smoke Brian and </v>

2462
01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:46.180
<v Speaker 4>convert it into weed barn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2463
01:43:46.181 --> 01:43:48.970
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how many cigar bars there are a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of cigar stores.</v>

2464
01:43:48.971 --> 01:43:50.320
<v Speaker 4>Alicia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>small right next to the Improv.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This one vending everywhere.</v>

2466
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what you would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a store that lets you smoke there</v>

2467
01:43:55.810 --> 01:44:00.810
<v Speaker 6>and in Canada they got spots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's weird because in Canada you can't </v>

2468
01:44:00.810 --> 01:44:01.150
<v Speaker 6>buy the weed there if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>smoke,</v>

2469
01:44:01.151 --> 01:44:02.950
<v Speaker 6>but they have places where you can smoke</v>
<v Speaker 6>weed.</v>

2470
01:44:02.951 --> 01:44:04.630
<v Speaker 6>You've got to bring your own shit in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Vancouver,</v>

2513
01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so many Jujitsu players.</v>

2514
01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:50.380
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure in all sports,</v>

2515
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:53.340
<v Speaker 6>the same thing in basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you just bought huge too for sure.</v>

2516
01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:58.370
<v Speaker 6>There's so many pop jujitsu players that</v>
<v Speaker 6>are stoned out of their fucking minds </v>

2517
01:45:58.381 --> 01:46:00.390
<v Speaker 6>when they roll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>including the Diaz brothers.</v>

2518
01:46:00.391 --> 01:46:03.330
<v Speaker 6>They admitted Bj Penn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no,</v>

2519
01:46:03.331 --> 01:46:05.160
<v Speaker 6>and then when people come one guys and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it goes,</v>

2520
01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:08.940
<v Speaker 6>and then they say that it cuts down on </v>
<v Speaker 6>your reaction time.</v>

2521
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.860
<v Speaker 6>That's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If anything,</v>

2522
01:46:11.010 --> 01:46:15.570
<v Speaker 6>if you're doing jujitsu and your </v>
<v Speaker 6>reaction time is slowed down in any way,</v>

2523
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:18.210
<v Speaker 6>your jujitsu is going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>

2524
01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:23.240
<v Speaker 6>Just there's no way you can do anything </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's going to slow your reaction time </v>

2525
01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.690
<v Speaker 6>and be really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't work that way.</v>

2526
01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:29.780
<v Speaker 6>There's no way you can have slow </v>
<v Speaker 6>reactions like when you know there's a </v>

2527
01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:30.930
<v Speaker 6>reason why rappers always get high.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When they wrap their flowing,</v>

2528
01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.480
<v Speaker 6>they got a million words a minute coming</v>
<v Speaker 6>out of their mouth.</v>

2529
01:46:33.630 --> 01:46:35.680
<v Speaker 6>There can't be any slow reaction time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2530
01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:36.780
<v Speaker 6>A,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a myth.</v>

2531
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:40.340
<v Speaker 1>There's no slowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't slow anything down.</v>

2532
01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:43.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a not at all the mikes on different</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

2533
01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:45.200
<v Speaker 1>people are complaining to on different </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

2534
01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:50.230
<v Speaker 1>I turned yours up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took yours down when you were doing </v>

2535
01:46:50.230 --> 01:46:50.370
<v Speaker 1>the job ads because it was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2536
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:51.960
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't slow you down at all.</v>

2537
01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:53.910
<v Speaker 1>People that say it does or silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2538
01:46:53.911 --> 01:46:54.300
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2539
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:59.410
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything it just puts you in a </v>

2540
01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:02.121
<v Speaker 1>different state of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It puts you in a very creative state of </v>

2541
01:47:02.121 --> 01:47:02.121
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

2542
01:47:02.121 --> 01:47:06.140
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say 80 percent of my material </v>

2543
01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:10.401
<v Speaker 1>would be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 80 percent of the things that I </v>

2544
01:47:10.401 --> 01:47:13.641
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write while I'm high and that's being </v>

2545
01:47:13.641 --> 01:47:13.641
<v Speaker 1>very conservative because it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily,</v>

2546
01:47:13.641 --> 01:47:16.440
<v Speaker 1>could be 90 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be 90 percent of all the things that</v>

2547
01:47:16.441 --> 01:47:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write under the influence of marijuana</v>

2548
01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:20.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think if it wasn't for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

2549
01:47:20.731 --> 01:47:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I think the material would be different.</v>

2550
01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:26.580
<v Speaker 1>It's much like that fucking cat parasite</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes the way people behave.</v>

2551
01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana changes the way you behave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it changes it in a good way </v>

2552
01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:31.980
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

2553
01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:37.440
<v Speaker 1>There's been many times where I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone where I look back at shit I have </v>

2554
01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:37.440
<v Speaker 1>thought or done while I was stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2555
01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:39.540
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was I thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2556
01:47:39.690 --> 01:47:44.690
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually when it comes to like making </v>

2557
01:47:44.690 --> 01:47:45.870
<v Speaker 1>videos or just anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't give you great ideas.</v>

2558
01:47:45.930 --> 01:47:48.540
<v Speaker 1>It just gives you more of the energy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the ideas,</v>

2559
01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.550
<v Speaker 1>more ideas that you would already come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with,</v>

2560
01:47:50.551 --> 01:47:52.470
<v Speaker 1>but you're getting them all at once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is.</v>

2561
01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Everything is supercharged and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>

2562
01:47:54.810 --> 01:47:56.520
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes dumb people smart.</v>

2563
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:59.460
<v Speaker 1>It depends on a bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on first of all how high you get</v>

2564
01:47:59.550 --> 01:48:03.630
<v Speaker 1>because if you get too high and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get too high where everything spirals in</v>

2565
01:48:03.631 --> 01:48:04.820
<v Speaker 1>front of you and it becomes like.</v>

2566
01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:10.100
<v Speaker 1>IT's like you have millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>flying around you but you're in the </v>

2567
01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:11.010
<v Speaker 1>middle of a tornado and you can't grab </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of it.</v>

2568
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:16.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you get to that super </v>

2569
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:19.071
<v Speaker 1>paranoid super high state and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not manageable and you have to </v>

2570
01:48:19.071 --> 01:48:21.810
<v Speaker 1>wait until you come down from that super</v>
<v Speaker 1>high to a more manageable place.</v>

2571
01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Then you can become creatIve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you sit down and write and you can </v>

2572
01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:29.661
<v Speaker 1>keep a thought going and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say that like maybe sometimes pots </v>

2573
01:48:29.661 --> 01:48:34.521
<v Speaker 1>made you make shitty decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just making you take chances </v>

2574
01:48:34.521 --> 01:48:35.130
<v Speaker 1>when you're sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2575
01:48:35.131 --> 01:48:36.780
<v Speaker 1>and you go back and you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2576
01:48:36.781 --> 01:48:41.781
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're just not seeing it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you were seeing it then and </v>

2577
01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:41.781
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't complete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2578
01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:43.080
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't fight a complete division.</v>

2579
01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:48.380
<v Speaker 1>But look at how much cool shit that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have created from pot pot has been </v>

2580
01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:50.700
<v Speaker 1>responsible for a lot of your really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good editing too,</v>

2581
01:48:50.701 --> 01:48:51.240
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>

2582
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

2583
01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:54.570
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>

2584
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it's not 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nothing's 100 percent,</v>

2585
01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:03.320
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta remember you want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to keep track of all that dumb </v>

2586
01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:04.230
<v Speaker 1>ideas you come up with not stoned and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then compare.</v>

2587
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also what's your state of mind </v>

2588
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.470
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2589
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:10.320
<v Speaker 1>how are you coming to the creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>table?</v>

2590
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Are you coming to the table tired?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you coming to the table in a good </v>

2591
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.350
<v Speaker 1>mood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2592
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I could have some personal issues going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2593
01:49:16.141 --> 01:49:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I could have some things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bothering me or some,</v>

2594
01:49:18.210 --> 01:49:23.210
<v Speaker 1>some unfinished business that I need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get taken care of before my mind can be </v>

2595
01:49:23.210 --> 01:49:24.390
<v Speaker 1>a piece and then you get high and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a good reaction,</v>

2596
01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:27.690
<v Speaker 1>but you could be in the best state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm in the best state,</v>

2597
01:49:27.691 --> 01:49:32.691
<v Speaker 1>when I'm feeling the best that I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most loose and my mind feels free and </v>

2598
01:49:32.691 --> 01:49:33.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy and I'm positive and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get high.</v>

2599
01:49:33.790 --> 01:49:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Then she Just feels like it all just </v>
<v Speaker 1>tunes in.</v>

2600
01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:41.660
<v Speaker 1>then I feel like I'm wide open to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where there's nothing that's </v>

2601
01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:41.660
<v Speaker 1>bothering me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing that's,</v>

2602
01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:46.100
<v Speaker 1>that's tightening me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm wide open and loose and then the </v>

2603
01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 1>weed hits and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just washes you in this crazy energy.</v>

2604
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It just hits you with this blast of </v>
<v Speaker 1>light perception in this new way of </v>

2605
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:54.040
<v Speaker 1>seeing things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2606
01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:59.640
<v Speaker 1>it sometimes can fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think when even when it fucks you </v>

2607
01:49:59.640 --> 01:49:59.640
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's lessons in that shit.</v>

2608
01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:04.531
<v Speaker 1>There's lessons in why it fucked you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lessons in where your head was </v>

2609
01:50:04.531 --> 01:50:05.110
<v Speaker 1>at when you weren't in the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2610
01:50:05.410 --> 01:50:06.970
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it needs to be fucking.</v>

2611
01:50:07.210 --> 01:50:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Someone needs to teach us how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

2612
01:50:09.821 --> 01:50:12.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated thing using any </v>
<v Speaker 1>entheogens,</v>

2613
01:50:12.791 --> 01:50:14.470
<v Speaker 1>losing marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using mushrooms.</v>

2614
01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:20.100
<v Speaker 1>There should be people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals that can talk people </v>

2615
01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:23.851
<v Speaker 1>through the use of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how you were talking last week </v>

2616
01:50:23.851 --> 01:50:24.700
<v Speaker 1>about the shermans and fuck yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need that.</v>

2617
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:27.430
<v Speaker 1>We need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we had that with,</v>

2618
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:32.520
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's something that comes out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this whole marijuana legalization </v>

2619
01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:32.520
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you know,</v>

2620
01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.180
<v Speaker 1>marijuana therapy therapy for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2621
01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:34.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2622
01:50:34.871 --> 01:50:36.880
<v Speaker 1>people need gambling therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

2623
01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2624
01:50:37.991 --> 01:50:42.991
<v Speaker 1>we can gamble and quit and so big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people get knocked up on </v>

2625
01:50:42.991 --> 01:50:46.501
<v Speaker 1>gambling.</v>

2626
01:50:46.501 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Speaker 1>gambling and I think there needs to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy for weed people too.</v>

2627
01:50:47.741 --> 01:50:52.741
<v Speaker 1>For some people that Just get fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>on weed and it's really just therapy </v>

2628
01:50:52.741 --> 01:50:52.741
<v Speaker 1>they need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2629
01:50:52.741 --> 01:50:55.590
<v Speaker 1>most of these addictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction to masturbation,</v>

2630
01:50:55.600 --> 01:51:00.600
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all psychological addictions </v>

2631
01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:00.600
<v Speaker 1>are not physical addictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're still there,</v>

2632
01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:05.040
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to have to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna have to have therapy for </v>

2633
01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:05.040
<v Speaker 1>people to get fucked up on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and sinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about when you get seasick?</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's so ridiculous where eddie chokes </v>

<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2742
01:55:32.490 --> 01:55:34.860

<v Speaker 2>into the garage,</v>

2743
01:55:34.890 --> 01:55:37.260
<v Speaker 2>into the backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a total douche bag.</v>

<v Speaker 2>disrupting the class and the crazy thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I'll get the camera.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to.</v>

2748
01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:51.870
<v Speaker 2>Denny percopo is my one of my black </v>
<v Speaker 2>belts.</v>

2749
01:55:51.871 --> 01:55:53.440
<v Speaker 2>I went up to him a few years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2750
01:55:53.490 --> 01:55:58.490
<v Speaker 2>when he walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never saw the response sketches </v>

2751
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.610
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went up to denim denny,</v>

2752
01:55:58.650 --> 01:55:59.850
<v Speaker 2>you got your camera on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>

2753
01:55:59.851 --> 01:56:00.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2755
01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it out.</v>

2756
01:56:02.110 --> 01:56:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Keep the kicker on this guy might have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fuck this dude up.</v>

2757
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:05.310
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2758
01:56:05.311 --> 01:56:05.790
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2759
01:56:06.770 --> 01:56:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Video taping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to sell it like we get into </v>

2760
01:56:11.770 --> 01:56:13.010
<v Speaker 2>like an argument or a discussion for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple minutes so you know,</v>

2761
01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:16.200
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to get too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We slowly dragged people into it.</v>

2762
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:19.440
<v Speaker 2>We start arguing and then we just start </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting and then I get crazy.</v>

2763
01:56:19.530 --> 01:56:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I tried to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a total douche bag.</v>

2764
01:56:21.791 --> 01:56:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I actually tried to kill the twitches </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shakes and shaded kicks his legs and</v>

2765
01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:31.760
<v Speaker 2>then people drag them off into the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just did it at the ufc expo in front </v>

2766
01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:32.150
<v Speaker 2>of a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got it on.</v>

2767
01:56:33.650 --> 01:56:37.110
<v Speaker 2>We got tom lawler and vinnie my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is fucking hilarious.</v>

2768
01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:40.620
<v Speaker 2>What's so hilarious about it is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely unexpected.</v>

2769
01:56:40.621 --> 01:56:45.621
<v Speaker 2>How many people would think that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu master would also be doing </v>

2770
01:56:45.621 --> 01:56:46.620
<v Speaker 2>pranks like on a regular basis?</v>

2771
01:56:48.330 --> 01:56:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Most of those pranks or on my dvd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mastering the rubber guard,</v>

2772
01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:52.950
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the original one,</v>

2773
01:56:52.951 --> 01:56:57.951
<v Speaker 2>the original bag that I got on video is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2010 years ago as quad tooth when I,</v>

2774
01:56:59.070 --> 01:56:59.660
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2775
01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:01.770
<v Speaker 2>put some black makeup on and another </v>
<v Speaker 2>time I was a black guy,</v>

2776
01:57:01.771 --> 01:57:06.771
<v Speaker 2>I was scaring my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my mastering the rubber guard </v>

2777
01:57:06.771 --> 01:57:06.771
<v Speaker 2>dvd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the original one.</v>

2778
01:57:06.771 --> 01:57:09.030
<v Speaker 2>That was before punk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2779
01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I've alWays had that in me for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

2780
01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:16.820
<v Speaker 2>You have a very strange sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like my default setting is </v>

2781
01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:20.330
<v Speaker 2>constantly saying like inappropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and the wrong things and I don't </v>

2782
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:24.861
<v Speaker 2>know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have been like that since I met you </v>

2783
01:57:24.861 --> 01:57:24.861
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I tried to talk to you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do stand up.</v>

2784
01:57:24.861 --> 01:57:26.420
<v Speaker 2>And he did it for nine times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2785
01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Standup is way harder than jujitsu.</v>

2786
01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:33.600
<v Speaker 2>That's for damn sure not to spend a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time perfecting.</v>

2787
01:57:33.601 --> 01:57:38.601
<v Speaker 2>Stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just go up there and tell </v>

2788
01:57:38.601 --> 01:57:38.601
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu wasn't in the beginning.</v>

2789
01:57:38.601 --> 01:57:42.890
<v Speaker 2>It's no different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just like anything else to </v>

2790
01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:44.550
<v Speaker 2>get great at anything just requires time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and effort and thought and concentration</v>

2791
01:57:44.551 --> 01:57:46.350
<v Speaker 2>and evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>

2792
01:57:46.530 --> 01:57:47.550
<v Speaker 2>And comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2793
01:57:47.551 --> 01:57:49.260
<v Speaker 2>you got to bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You started off terrible.</v>

2794
01:57:49.261 --> 01:57:51.810
<v Speaker 2>If you saw me when I first started off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had some video,</v>

2795
01:57:51.811 --> 01:57:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I got some somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some vhs tape of me on stage,</v>

2796
01:57:54.530 --> 01:57:59.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the 10th time I was ever on stage </v>

2797
01:57:59.530 --> 01:57:59.530
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2798
01:57:59.530 --> 01:57:59.970
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2799
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.920
<v Speaker 2>one's good in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything else.</v>

2800
01:58:01.921 --> 01:58:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got good at jujitsu.</v>

2801
01:58:03.301 --> 01:58:08.301
<v Speaker 2>You aren't good at jujitsu when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>first started and thinking about you </v>

2802
01:58:08.301 --> 01:58:08.301
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2803
01:58:08.301 --> 01:58:08.301
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about,</v>

2804
01:58:08.301 --> 01:58:13.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since when I tried stand up for the </v>

2805
01:58:13.281 --> 01:58:13.281
<v Speaker 2>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never.</v>

2806
01:58:13.281 --> 01:58:16.180
<v Speaker 2>It was before I had a school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were hanging out at the comedy store </v>

2807
01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:16.500
<v Speaker 2>every week and I'm seeing all these guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>go up and bomb and I thought,</v>

2808
01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:17.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do this shit.</v>

2809
01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:18.920
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2810
01:58:18.930 --> 01:58:21.540
<v Speaker 2>I went up and I realized that if I put a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of time into it,</v>

2811
01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:24.690
<v Speaker 2>I might be able to be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had to,</v>

2812
01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:29.780
<v Speaker 2>I was spreading myself too thin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to really think about what I was </v>

2813
01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:29.780
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was I going to be a comedian,</v>

2814
01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:33.360
<v Speaker 2>a jujitsu flair and end of musician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to figure it out.</v>

2815
01:58:33.361 --> 01:58:38.361
<v Speaker 2>So I just decided to not pursue common </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore and just focus on jujitsu and </v>

2816
01:58:38.361 --> 01:58:40.470
<v Speaker 2>focus on my music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who knows,</v>

2817
01:58:40.471 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 2>maybe one from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from</v>

2818
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:47.040
<v Speaker 5>teaching the last seven years I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've gotten a lot more comfortable </v>

2819
01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:47.950
<v Speaker 5>speaking in front of people when before </v>
<v Speaker 5>I was teaching,</v>

2820
01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:53.150
<v Speaker 5>that was the hardest part of comedy is </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting up and talking to a crowd that's</v>

2821
01:58:53.170 --> 01:58:55.600
<v Speaker 5>stopping you crack jokes when you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>on stage at the viper room.</v>

2822
01:58:58.090 --> 01:58:59.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>BuT you know what,</v>

2823
01:58:59.051 --> 01:59:01.300
<v Speaker 5>when people are aren't paying for </v>
<v Speaker 5>laughs,</v>

2824
01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:06.420
<v Speaker 5>it's easier to make them run pan to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like it's a little different </v>

2825
01:59:07.210 --> 01:59:08.410
<v Speaker 5>finding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's easy.</v>

2826
01:59:08.411 --> 01:59:10.420
<v Speaker 5>I could well coming from someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>done it.</v>

2827
01:59:10.421 --> 01:59:12.580
<v Speaker 5>and this is why I told you in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning that you could do it.</v>

2828
01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.040
<v Speaker 5>It's just a matter of effort and </v>
<v Speaker 5>concentration.</v>

2829
01:59:15.041 --> 01:59:18.040
<v Speaker 5>You have a comedian sense of my sense of</v>
<v Speaker 5>humor.</v>

2830
01:59:19.210 --> 01:59:21.820
<v Speaker 5>Now days with youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eddie could make a video that's probably</v>

2831
01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:26.821
<v Speaker 5>a million times funnier than him having </v>
<v Speaker 5>to go on stage for three years just to </v>

2832
01:59:26.821 --> 01:59:26.920
<v Speaker 5>get a joke out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2833
01:59:27.190 --> 01:59:28.540

<v Speaker 5>stage to not become a standup comic and </v>

2851
02:00:03.721 --> 02:00:08.590
<v Speaker 5>really work to get like 30 people in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>room where nowadays you can take these </v>

2852
02:00:08.590 --> 02:00:10.180
<v Speaker 5>same bits and jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make it into a youtube video,</v>

2853
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:15.750
<v Speaker 5>get a billion people and if you keep on </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing that then you could have a whole </v>

2854
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:18.190
<v Speaker 5>career based off either advertising or </v>
<v Speaker 5>you could have like a show on crackle.</v>

2855
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:22.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of websites like </v>
<v Speaker 5>crackle that have sitcoms are tv shows,</v>

2856
02:00:22.571 --> 02:00:26.830
<v Speaker 5>web based series that are all based off </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that did it and I understand what</v>

2857
02:00:26.831 --> 02:00:27.790
<v Speaker 5>You're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>however,</v>

2858
02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:32.820
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying diminishes the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the artist standup comedy and that's </v>

2859
02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:35.611
<v Speaker 5>why it's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling him thAt he could be an </v>

2860
02:00:35.611 --> 02:00:35.611
<v Speaker 5>artist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a standup comedian.</v>

2861
02:00:35.611 --> 02:00:37.180
<v Speaker 5>He can go places and perform and do </v>
<v Speaker 5>stand up comedy.</v>

2862
02:00:37.181 --> 02:00:39.940
<v Speaker 5>What you're saying is he can instead do </v>
<v Speaker 5>videos.</v>

2863
02:00:40.110 --> 02:00:45.110
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of standup people that </v>

2864
02:00:45.110 --> 02:00:47.551
<v Speaker 5>want to be standup comics are now </v>
<v Speaker 5>changing how they're getting their </v>

2865
02:00:47.551 --> 02:00:47.800
<v Speaker 5>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2866
02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:49.780
<v Speaker 5>I Think I definitely think can be people</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to be.</v>

2867
02:00:49.781 --> 02:00:51.250
<v Speaker 5>Comedians were getting a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>audience.</v>

2868
02:00:51.251 --> 02:00:52.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean that bob burnham kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2869
02:00:52.641 --> 02:00:57.641
<v Speaker 5>he got a huge following from his youtube</v>
<v Speaker 5>videos and you could definitely get </v>

2870
02:00:57.641 --> 02:01:02.161
<v Speaker 5>people attracted to stuff that you put </v>
<v Speaker 5>online and they want to come see you </v>

2871
02:01:02.161 --> 02:01:02.161
<v Speaker 5>live.</v>

2872
02:01:02.161 --> 02:01:03.710
<v Speaker 5>But what I was saying to eddie was that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he could be an artist,</v>

2873
02:01:03.711 --> 02:01:05.980
<v Speaker 5>so stand up comedian as an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could do it.</v>

2874
02:01:05.981 --> 02:01:09.060
<v Speaker 5>He has a sense of you're welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has that sense of humor.</v>

2875
02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:14.100
<v Speaker 5>He's got that way of looking at things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's always looking at the most </v>

2876
02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:14.620
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous side of things when whenever </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a subject that comes up with the</v>

2877
02:01:14.621 --> 02:01:19.621
<v Speaker 5>news,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's always looking at the most </v>

2878
02:01:19.621 --> 02:01:19.621
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>LIke automatically.</v>

2879
02:01:19.621 --> 02:01:24.560
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a comedian sensibility things </v>

2880
02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:24.960
<v Speaker 5>that funny guy looking for an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

2881
02:01:25.410 --> 02:01:26.860
<v Speaker 5>he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's what I'm saying.</v>

2882
02:01:26.861 --> 02:01:31.861
<v Speaker 5>like stamp comics seems kind of diluted </v>
<v Speaker 5>nowadays because I think if you're a </v>

2883
02:01:31.861 --> 02:01:34.831
<v Speaker 5>funny guy looking for an audience back </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the day stamp comedies that like one </v>

2884
02:01:34.831 --> 02:01:35.590
<v Speaker 5>of the only few options you could do </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you couldn't get tv show.</v>

2885
02:01:35.710 --> 02:01:37.150
<v Speaker 5>So now these people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2886
02:01:37.151 --> 02:01:39.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want an audience.</v>

2887
02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot</v>

2888
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:45.070
<v Speaker 1>of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think stamp comedies probably getting </v>

2889
02:01:45.070 --> 02:01:45.070
<v Speaker 1>more and more diluted as more time goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2890
02:01:45.070 --> 02:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>What don't you thInk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2891
02:01:45.690 --> 02:01:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I disagree because I think the art of </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy,</v>

2892
02:01:47.871 --> 02:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>to me as a patron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a person who goes to see it,</v>

2893
02:01:50.721 --> 02:01:55.721
<v Speaker 1>is still the most fun thing to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to see a louis c k the other day </v>

2894
02:01:55.721 --> 02:01:56.210
<v Speaker 1>with ari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking loved it.</v>

2895
02:01:56.211 --> 02:02:01.211
<v Speaker 1>I had a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat in the audience or the day when </v>

2896
02:02:01.211 --> 02:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>aziz ansari was working out of shit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mtv music awards.</v>

2897
02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I was on that show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>

2898
02:02:03.911 --> 02:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And I enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2899
02:02:04.930 --> 02:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I still enjoy the art of standup comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

2900
02:02:07.491 --> 02:02:10.610
<v Speaker 1>in a crowd with a bunch of people there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funnier,</v>

2901
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>

2902
02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>the comedy club atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like.</v>

2903
02:02:14.110 --> 02:02:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I like sitting in the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like drinking.</v>

2904
02:02:16.521 --> 02:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I like how everybody's laughing </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2905
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that art form to me is insanely </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfying.</v>

2906
02:02:22.190 --> 02:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Way more satisfying than watching a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video clip on youtube.</v>

2907
02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:27.680
<v Speaker 1>I haven't used the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you said that there's a little.</v>

2908
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:30.860
<v Speaker 1>There's barely any real stamp comics </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays,</v>

2909
02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>but have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There used to be a bunch of real standup</v>

2910
02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:36.140
<v Speaker 1>comics and nowadays there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That number seems to be a lot smaller.</v>

2911
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just because there's less places to</v>

2912
02:02:37.731 --> 02:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In boston where I used to be mad,</v>

2913
02:02:40.611 --> 02:02:42.680
<v Speaker 1>there was so many different comedy clubs</v>
<v Speaker 1>in boston,</v>

2914
02:02:42.681 --> 02:02:46.550
<v Speaker 1>so many open mic nights that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real community developed around it,</v>

2915
02:02:46.551 --> 02:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>but then as the economy tightened up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

2916
02:02:49.281 --> 02:02:54.281
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these comics that were in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>area moved out and the guys that had </v>

2917
02:02:54.281 --> 02:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>been there for a long time really didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>write any new material.</v>

2918
02:02:55.401 --> 02:03:00.401
<v Speaker 1>Does the scene died out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if there was more comedy clubs and </v>

2919
02:03:00.401 --> 02:03:01.430
<v Speaker 1>it was a thriving community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be more comedians.</v>

2920
02:03:01.610 --> 02:03:03.920
<v Speaker 1>The real Problem is they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough places to perform.</v>

2921
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:06.410
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough open mic nights and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2922
02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.790
<v Speaker 1>comedy comes and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2923
02:03:07.791 --> 02:03:08.660
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's waves.</v>

2924
02:03:08.661 --> 02:03:11.930
<v Speaker 1>But I think right now is a very good way</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like established guys.</v>

2925
02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at all the guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are around like louis c,</v>

2926
02:03:15.151 --> 02:03:19.070
<v Speaker 1>k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a chappelle,</v>

2927
02:03:19.670 --> 02:03:22.130
<v Speaker 1>chris rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dave attell,</v>

2928
02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:26.510
<v Speaker 1>nick depaulo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jim norton a patent oswald,</v>

2929
02:03:26.511 --> 02:03:28.220
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of my personal favorites.</v>

2930
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:30.770
<v Speaker 1>And you see all these different guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are out right now.</v>

2931
02:03:30.771 --> 02:03:32.540
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fan bill burr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

2932
02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:36.320
<v Speaker 1>if you're a fan of standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much good comedy going on,</v>

2933
02:03:36.321 --> 02:03:37.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>francisco,</v>

2934
02:03:37.791 --> 02:03:42.791
<v Speaker 1>francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the best times </v>

2935
02:03:42.791 --> 02:03:44.450
<v Speaker 1>ever for standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what's happened with the youtube</v>

2936
02:03:44.451 --> 02:03:47.570
<v Speaker 1>and the internet and my space on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship is that people have had a chance to</v>

2937
02:03:47.571 --> 02:03:49.200
<v Speaker 1>extend their careers and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2938
02:03:49.201 --> 02:03:54.201
<v Speaker 1>and make their careers like penetrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>further in than they would have </v>

2939
02:03:54.201 --> 02:03:54.201
<v Speaker 1>ordinarily.</v>

2940
02:03:54.201 --> 02:03:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Not having any television shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not having any movie credits.</v>

2941
02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:02.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now people are gettIng big audiences </v>

2942
02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:03.390
<v Speaker 1>just from stand up comedy just from </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the,</v>

2943
02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:04.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the youtube clips.</v>

2944
02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you think that most standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics are in it just to become actors?</v>

2945
02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2946
02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:10.640
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2947
02:04:10.641 --> 02:04:13.040
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing more fun than real </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy.</v>

2948
02:04:13.041 --> 02:04:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you jim norton is not in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just become an actor,</v>

2949
02:04:16.761 --> 02:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>a guarantee you louis ck is not in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to become an actor.</v>

2950
02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>They're really good guys or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much fun in doing standup,</v>

2951
02:04:24.670 --> 02:04:29.670
<v Speaker 1>but that's just like a couple people </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the thousands and thousands </v>

2952
02:04:29.670 --> 02:04:32.921
<v Speaker 1>of people that are in it for standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy to become what we're talking </v>

2953
02:04:32.921 --> 02:04:32.921
<v Speaker 1>about the best guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking about.</v>

2954
02:04:32.921 --> 02:04:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I just think that a lot of people look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the idea of doing standup comedy as a</v>

2955
02:04:37.411 --> 02:04:39.600
<v Speaker 1>lot of pressure and that because of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>

2956
02:04:39.601 --> 02:04:43.110
<v Speaker 1>they looked to get off that pressure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a television show is like a relief.</v>

2957
02:04:43.110 --> 02:04:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2958
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm free of the pressure now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the show bombs,</v>

2959
02:04:46.261 --> 02:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bombs is to show if the bad writing</v>

2960
02:04:49.801 --> 02:04:52.070
<v Speaker 1>was there when I got there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing I can do about it.</v>

2961
02:04:52.071 --> 02:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>If I do a movie and the movie doesn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2962
02:04:53.581 --> 02:04:58.581
<v Speaker 1>but the next month he does fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm okay and so it becomes less </v>

2963
02:04:58.581 --> 02:05:00.840
<v Speaker 1>responsibility on their back and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit easier and they look at it as</v>

2964
02:05:00.841 --> 02:05:03.420
<v Speaker 1>a steady income as opposed to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>something stand up comedy.</v>

2965
02:05:03.421 --> 02:05:04.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2966
02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:06.890
<v Speaker 1>no one's really going to be sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are gonna.</v>

2967
02:05:06.910 --> 02:05:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Come see you next week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2968
02:05:08.101 --> 02:05:13.101
<v Speaker 1>you could only assume that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to continue to have an audience and you </v>

2969
02:05:13.101 --> 02:05:13.940
<v Speaker 1>have to continue to produce and continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a,</v>

2970
02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new sets on television,</v>

2971
02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>new comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>central specials.</v>

2972
02:05:17.221 --> 02:05:22.221
<v Speaker 1>Continue to write new material after </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets released so that people could </v>

2973
02:05:22.221 --> 02:05:22.470
<v Speaker 1>come see you a year later and they know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you got all new shit.</v>

2974
02:05:22.770 --> 02:05:25.200
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of pressure and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people don't like that.</v>

2975
02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one day we'll do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do a b.</v>

<v Speaker 5>we don't have to.</v>

2982
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.650
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2983
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:50.810

<v Speaker 1>I could do five minutes.</v>

2992
02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're both could do five </v>

2993
02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian fucking killed it in,</v>

2994
02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:12.581
<v Speaker 1>in atlanta when he hadn't done comedy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and he got talked to the june it </v>

2995
02:06:12.581 --> 02:06:15.150
<v Speaker 1>during the nighttime show filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>ufc fans.</v>

2996
02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:19.170
<v Speaker 1>All fucking hammered on a friday night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sold out.</v>

2997
02:06:19.230 --> 02:06:21.960
<v Speaker 1>You were killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only did he do good,</v>

2998
02:06:22.050 --> 02:06:24.750
<v Speaker 1>he went into the abyss and pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself out of the flames.</v>

2999
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:30.250
<v Speaker 1>He did good in the beginning and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a couple of jokes in a row that </v>

3000
02:06:30.250 --> 02:06:33.711
<v Speaker 1>tanked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were starting to fucking freak </v>

3001
02:06:33.711 --> 02:06:33.711
<v Speaker 1>out and he kept it together.</v>

3002
02:06:33.711 --> 02:06:34.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

3003
02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:39.060
<v Speaker 5>I started doing it a lot and I did a </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole bunch and I started doing it </v>

3004
02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:39.210
<v Speaker 5>almost every week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a few times a week,</v>

3005
02:06:39.211 --> 02:06:42.360
<v Speaker 5>but I got to a point where I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just didn't have it in me.</v>

3006
02:06:42.750 --> 02:06:45.390
<v Speaker 5>You really have to give up your life to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be a standup.</v>

3007
02:06:45.450 --> 02:06:46.150
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

3008
02:06:47.310 --> 02:06:48.700
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have it in you,</v>

3009
02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:49.960
<v Speaker 1>but just because you don't have it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3010
02:06:49.961 --> 02:06:54.961
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that the art form is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that people should pursue if </v>

3011
02:06:54.961 --> 02:06:55.600
<v Speaker 1>they want to be a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying though is that,</v>

3012
02:06:55.840 --> 02:07:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know you're not trying to </v>

3013
02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:00.840
<v Speaker 1>offend me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a comedian it's kind of offensive</v>

3014
02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:05.131
<v Speaker 1>because you're saying that like somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>or another that someone if they wanted </v>

3015
02:07:05.131 --> 02:07:09.181
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should just go and do youtube clips now </v>

3016
02:07:09.181 --> 02:07:09.400
<v Speaker 1>and not become a standup comedian </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's too difficult.</v>

3017
02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:14.540
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying that if you are a uP comic </v>

3018
02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:15.120
<v Speaker 5>nowadays that it seems like youtube </v>
<v Speaker 5>would make a lot more sense.</v>

3019
02:07:15.150 --> 02:07:18.030
<v Speaker 5>This boolean howard's target.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3020
02:07:18.450 --> 02:07:22.230
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>To be an artist as a standup comedian,</v>

3021
02:07:22.231 --> 02:07:27.231
<v Speaker 5>to be a real comic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to do it in front of an </v>

3022
02:07:27.231 --> 02:07:29.061
<v Speaker 5>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the only art form where you must </v>

3023
02:07:29.061 --> 02:07:29.061
<v Speaker 5>have an audience to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you do not have it all,</v>

3024
02:07:29.061 --> 02:07:30.600
<v Speaker 5>what's the difference between not going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be good?</v>

3025
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:33.210
<v Speaker 5>Because you don't have immediate </v>
<v Speaker 5>response of people laughing at you.</v>

3026
02:07:33.211 --> 02:07:34.260
<v Speaker 5>Whether you know whether or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's funny.</v>

3027
02:07:34.261 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we ever made ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you</v>

3028
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:37.840
<v Speaker 1>don't though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not hearing these people laugh.</v>

3029
02:07:37.841 --> 02:07:42.841
<v Speaker 1>I don't hear shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have people staring at you in </v>

3030
02:07:42.841 --> 02:07:42.841
<v Speaker 1>texting things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3031
02:07:42.841 --> 02:07:42.841
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't get the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct,</v>

3032
02:07:42.841 --> 02:07:47.761
<v Speaker 1>immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tangible response that you get when </v>

3033
02:07:47.761 --> 02:07:47.761
<v Speaker 1>you're going on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3034
02:07:47.761 --> 02:07:50.731
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very asked various aspects of a joke or </v>

3035
02:07:50.731 --> 02:07:51.880
<v Speaker 1>funny how the transitions work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear yourself and the recordings you</v>

3036
02:07:51.881 --> 02:07:54.130
<v Speaker 1>need to know this part sounded falls or </v>
<v Speaker 1>this part.</v>

3037
02:07:54.131 --> 02:07:59.131
<v Speaker 1>How too many words and it's an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just piecing it all together and </v>

3038
02:07:59.131 --> 02:08:00.100
<v Speaker 1>performing it in front of a live crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you nail it,</v>

3039
02:08:00.101 --> 02:08:05.101
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're on stage and you fucking </v>

3040
02:08:05.101 --> 02:08:06.050
<v Speaker 1>nail a joke where the audience is dying </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

3041
02:08:06.070 --> 02:08:11.070
<v Speaker 1>they're dying now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got like five more levels to this </v>

3042
02:08:11.070 --> 02:08:11.070
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this joke,</v>

3043
02:08:11.070 --> 02:08:14.230
<v Speaker 1>like I'm hitting them now and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got some shit coming up to that,</v>

3044
02:08:14.231 --> 02:08:14.440
<v Speaker 1>to this.</v>

3045
02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to get to because I know if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think this is funny,</v>

3046
02:08:17.351 --> 02:08:20.140
<v Speaker 1>this next part is my favorite part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then boom,</v>

3047
02:08:20.141 --> 02:08:20.710
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

3048
02:08:20.711 --> 02:08:25.711
<v Speaker 1>and it piles on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like that that you're </v>

3049
02:08:25.711 --> 02:08:25.711
<v Speaker 1>ever going to get off youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this.</v>

3050
02:08:25.711 --> 02:08:29.800
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get that sort of a </v>

3051
02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:32.221
<v Speaker 1>response from the people and as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience member you're not going to get </v>

3052
02:08:32.221 --> 02:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>something that's that much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to me,</v>

3053
02:08:33.461 --> 02:08:36.400
<v Speaker 1>more fun still after doing comedy for 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

3054
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:38.350
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more fun than watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

3055
02:08:38.530 --> 02:08:41.260
<v Speaker 1>It's the best man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much fucking fun.</v>

3056
02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:42.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

3057
02:08:42.521 --> 02:08:44.830
<v Speaker 1>the most fun art form and that's why I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comedian.</v>

3058
02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:47.110
<v Speaker 1>What I was trying to say is that eddie </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have done that too.</v>

3059
02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:52.560
<v Speaker 1>The only difference between me and him </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he had other things to do is </v>

3060
02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:53.710
<v Speaker 1>focusing on and he he went and pursued </v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

3061
02:08:53.711 --> 02:08:58.711
<v Speaker 1>but if he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he wasn't thinking about pursuing a </v>

3062
02:08:58.711 --> 02:09:01.231
<v Speaker 1>career in jujitsu and wasn't thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about pursuing a career in music and </v>

3063
02:09:01.231 --> 02:09:01.750
<v Speaker 1>have the kind of time that I had when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started out doing comedy,</v>

3064
02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would be just as successful as me </v>

3065
02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3066
02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:07.930
<v Speaker 1>You'd be able to do everything that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing come true come true.</v>

3067
02:09:07.931 --> 02:09:09.400
<v Speaker 1>You'd be able to do everything that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

3068
02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not hard.</v>

3069
02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of focus and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an honest person and you evolve </v>

3070
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:17.770
<v Speaker 1>and you you your objective and you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at your shit and you keep working at it,</v>

3071
02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:22.920
<v Speaker 1>that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one day I'll call you have the </v>

3072
02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:22.920
<v Speaker 1>sense if you don't have the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>

3073
02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:24.670
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have the mind for comedy,</v>

3074
02:09:24.671 --> 02:09:26.020
<v Speaker 1>that type of person who looks at things </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

3075
02:09:26.410 --> 02:09:27.610
<v Speaker 1>everybody else is agreeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go,</v>

3076
02:09:27.611 --> 02:09:29.540
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that like?</v>

3077
02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.600
<v Speaker 1>That's how I was my whole life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you are,</v>

3078
02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:33.580
<v Speaker 1>and brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are to a certain extent too.</v>

3079
02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:38.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have a different sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humor than I do and brian and eddie has </v>

3080
02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:38.920
<v Speaker 1>a different sense of humor that you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all different,</v>

3081
02:09:39.070 --> 02:09:41.950
<v Speaker 1>but we all have the same thing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>brian like you,</v>

3082
02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:44.800
<v Speaker 1>your sense when it comes to technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always doing this.</v>

3083
02:09:44.890 --> 02:09:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Someone to bring up a point and you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll always be like,</v>

3084
02:09:47.630 --> 02:09:52.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody just thinks that because this </v>

3085
02:09:52.630 --> 02:09:52.630
<v Speaker 1>bubba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubba,</v>

3086
02:09:52.630 --> 02:09:55.411
<v Speaker 1>bubba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll go against the grain right away </v>

3087
02:09:55.411 --> 02:09:55.411
<v Speaker 1>and pick out the flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>

3088
02:09:55.411 --> 02:09:59.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the mind of a standup comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person who stands up as the person </v>

3089
02:09:59.250 --> 02:10:01.360
<v Speaker 1>who's functioning societies to stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and look at things besides being funny.</v>

3090
02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Stand up and look at things and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

3091
02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:05.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what the comic does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comic looks at something.</v>

3092
02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:07.060
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

3093
02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:08.530
<v Speaker 1>When everybody else just takes it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>

3094
02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:11.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of comics out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just never become comics.</v>

3095
02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:16.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's guys that work in gas stations </v>

3096
02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:19.920
<v Speaker 1>that could be one of the funniest guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have ever walked the face of the </v>

3097
02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:22.621
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just no one ever talked them into </v>

3098
02:10:22.621 --> 02:10:22.621
<v Speaker 1>getting onstage.</v>

3099
02:10:22.621 --> 02:10:22.621
<v Speaker 1>They never directed their life in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

3100
02:10:22.621 --> 02:10:23.680
<v Speaker 1>They never had the discipline to follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

3101
02:10:23.890 --> 02:10:28.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people like that that I </v>

3102
02:10:28.890 --> 02:10:28.890

<v Speaker 1>died.</v>

3104

<v Speaker 1>funnIest fucking comedians that ever </v>
