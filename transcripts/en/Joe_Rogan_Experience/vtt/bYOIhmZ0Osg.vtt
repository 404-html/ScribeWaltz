1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Move over a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seem right.</v>

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.050
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>welcome back Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up man?</v>

6
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>How's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

7
00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Happy to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are good.</v>

8
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>How many have you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.950
<v Speaker 1>What's the latest and the greatest view?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A new book came out yesterday.</v>

10
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.970
<v Speaker 1>That's always a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's called a unconventional medicine.</v>

11
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.670
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us the,</v>

12
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are those sheets?</v>

13
00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:28.600
<v Speaker 1>The back sheet called to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.650
<v Speaker 1>the backseat not works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>the biggest challenge we face today is </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic disease and conventional </v>

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.220
<v Speaker 1>medicine has failed to address it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need a new system.</v>

17
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the nutshell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're essentially,</v>

18
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing nutrition based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.360
<v Speaker 1>for the three components,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestral diet and lifestyle,</v>

20
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>which we've talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a functional medicine and a </v>

21
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.930
<v Speaker 1>collaborative practice model that </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporates health coaches,</v>

22
00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>nutritionists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other allied providers to,</v>

23
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>to offer more support to patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean when you say </v>

24
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.070
<v Speaker 1>functional medicine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the easiest way to understand it,</v>

25
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an approach that is geared towards </v>

26
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.981
<v Speaker 1>addressing the underlying cause of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem instead of just suppressing the </v>

27
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:13.981
<v Speaker 1>symptoms.</v>

28
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So you go into the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a high cholesterol,</v>

29
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>usually given a drug to lower it </v>
<v Speaker 1>statens.</v>

30
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got high blood pressure and those </v>

31
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>are devastating your health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Statens or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some people they can be.</v>

34
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say they're devastating for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody and they do save lives in </v>

35
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.361
<v Speaker 1>certain situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that they're the first </v>

36
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:36.361
<v Speaker 1>thing we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would do in that situation.</v>

37
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:41.341
<v Speaker 1>That's what's off that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't suggest like altering the </v>

38
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

39
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at why the cholesterol is </v>
<v Speaker 1>high in the first place.</v>

40
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with high blood pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go into the doctor,</v>

41
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>high blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a drug to lower it,</v>

42
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker 1>there's rarely any investigation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your blood pressure is high.</v>

43
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.850
<v Speaker 1>And what are the main factors that high </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol?</v>

44
00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Because I know that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big part of it is hereditary.</v>

45
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

46
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Genetics play a huge role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 1>So the genetics is one for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

48
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>but then you have things like poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>thyroid function can actually lead to </v>

49
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.091
<v Speaker 1>high cholesterol or Ldl particle number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got infections can do that.</v>

50
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:17.401
<v Speaker 1>Like h Pylori,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the bacteria that causes ulcer </v>

51
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got leaky gut.</v>

52
00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Intestinal permeability has been shown </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

53
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.960
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting that you did you talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this before,</v>

54
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people are not aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

55
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.190
<v Speaker 1>that there's actually gut bacteria that </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes ulcers.</v>

56
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

58
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a cool story actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

59
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago that the dominant idea was </v>

60
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>ulcers were caused by stress and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like eating spicy foods and a couple of </v>

61
00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Australian physicians presented at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conference.</v>

62
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:44.740
<v Speaker 1>This notion that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

63
00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 1>actually they're caused by this bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 1>called helicobacter pylori,</v>

64
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>and they were literally laughed off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

65
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Nobody took them seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were ridiculed and they kept going.</v>

66
00:02:55.431 --> 00:03:00.431
<v Speaker 1>I kept doing this research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept trying to present this idea and </v>

67
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>nobody take them seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

68
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>one of them swallowed a vial of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a solution that had the bacterium </v>

69
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

70
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed an ulcer as a result,</v>

71
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.060
<v Speaker 1>and then treated himself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics and got rid of the ulcer to </v>

72
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>approve this is how committed this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

73
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>this idea and proving this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally at that point people started</v>

74
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:24.931
<v Speaker 1>to pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still was another 10 years </v>

75
00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:27.871
<v Speaker 1>before that theory was widely accepted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they eventually won the Nobel </v>

76
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>prize in medicine as a result of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>

77
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

78
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a great example of how group </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is such a problem in medicine.</v>

79
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a tendency to just like get </v>

80
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.250
<v Speaker 1>stuck on the status quo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though a core principle of sciences</v>

81
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>like we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

83
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>we come up with a hypothesis.</v>

84
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>We have to be willing to challenge our </v>
<v Speaker 1>most cherished views all the time.</v>

85
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if we look at the history of </v>

86
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.021
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the history of most people being </v>

87
00:03:58.021 --> 00:03:58.021
<v Speaker 1>wrong about most things most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

88
00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing how many people are </v>

89
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.071
<v Speaker 1>still operating under information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been updated many times over the </v>

90
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.190
<v Speaker 1>past couple of decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But absolutely talk to the average </v>

91
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.481
<v Speaker 1>person about what you should eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're looking at like the food </v>

92
00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>pyramid from the Dr Seuss books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

93
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or another one is you probably saw some </v>

94
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>articles like stents have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't work.</v>

95
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read that just came out with they</v>

96
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>don't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still a massively being used</v>

97
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.960
<v Speaker 1>in part because they get a doctors get </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid for that now.</v>

98
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy because I thought a stent </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

99
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I thought it propped open the artery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what does it do?</v>

100
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

101
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.280
<v Speaker 1>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that actually have the desired </v>

102
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.940
<v Speaker 1>effect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thing was based on pain </v>

103
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.940
<v Speaker 1>resident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

104
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And mammograms prevent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to prevent breast cancer.</v>

105
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.160
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we saw the huge randomized </v>

106
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>controlled trial that showed that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only did they not prevent breast cancer,</v>

107
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:59.521
<v Speaker 1>they may actually increase death either </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a result of unnecessary treatments </v>

108
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:02.930
<v Speaker 1>that come from the mammogram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

109
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.310
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you get an unnecessary trip?</v>

110
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Like if you did a mammogram and you saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lump,</v>

111
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.120
<v Speaker 1>well it's not always black or white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it could be a cyst or something </v>

112
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.080
<v Speaker 1>unless somebody gets unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment and that lends that leads to </v>

113
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 1>an adverse event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just saying it's,</v>

114
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to be humble and realize that we </v>

115
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.391
<v Speaker 1>don't always have the answers and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 10 years it's going to look really </v>

116
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:24.391
<v Speaker 1>different than it does now.</v>

117
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Just like a hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody thought they had the answers </v>

118
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.791
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look back on them and we say how </v>

119
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:32.791
<v Speaker 1>silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:36.360
<v Speaker 1>but we forget that people are 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead are going to look back on us with </v>

121
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.360
<v Speaker 1>that same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

122
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to shake their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:44.521
<v Speaker 1>It's very unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is a tendency that people have </v>

124
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>when they've been living their life </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on what they think is like certain</v>

125
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>rigid information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is absolute,</v>

126
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they've been teaching that.</v>

127
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 1>That's when it gets especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic or writing books about that.</v>

128
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they just never want to admit </v>

129
00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.680
<v Speaker 1>that their book is bullshit and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

130
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>our education system needs to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical education because you know,</v>

131
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>you write a textbook and that takes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and then,</v>

132
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the textbook is used in,</v>

133
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.380
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in chorus,</v>

134
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.390
<v Speaker 1>like the medical schools are still using</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nutrition textbooks that were </v>

135
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>probably written in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties or something.</v>

136
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.170
<v Speaker 1>And then we get all these new studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that like cholesterol in the </v>

137
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.981
<v Speaker 1>Diet makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has no impact on your blood cholesterol </v>

138
00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:23.981
<v Speaker 1>for most people.</v>

139
00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Say that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because for a lot of people who live </v>

140
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did he just say?</v>

141
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

142
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the American standard us diet </v>

143
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.800
<v Speaker 1>guidelines last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people might've missed this.</v>

144
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.060
<v Speaker 1>They completely removed any restriction </v>
<v Speaker 1>on dietary cholesterol from the,</v>

145
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.890
<v Speaker 1>from the US diet guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They basically said there's no reason to</v>

146
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:46.900
<v Speaker 1>limit cholesterol in your diet anymore.</v>

147
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Now for people who don't know why this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so crazy or how this came to be,</v>

148
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.110
<v Speaker 2>you need to go to the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 2>article on how the sugar industry bribe </v>

149
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.130
<v Speaker 2>scientists and convinced scientists to </v>
<v Speaker 2>publish faulty or false information </v>

150
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.540
<v Speaker 2>pointing toward saturated fats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol as being the cause of heart </v>

151
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.861
<v Speaker 2>disease and heart attacks and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different elements so that they could </v>

152
00:07:13.861 --> 00:07:17.850
<v Speaker 2>push the blame away from sugar and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think they only got paid something like </v>

153
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.190
<v Speaker 2>$50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

154
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

155
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.450
<v Speaker 2>she's amazing when you think about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people that's affected.</v>

156
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these,</v>

157
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:28.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these conflicts of interest are </v>

158
00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:28.831
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big topic of interest.</v>

159
00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:28.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>

160
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.640
<v Speaker 1>that's just crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

161
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.610
<v Speaker 1>But it's horrible things to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It totally,</v>

162
00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:38.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunately pretty normal in </v>

163
00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:41.101
<v Speaker 1>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a study that just came out a </v>

164
00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:43.920
<v Speaker 1>few days ago that showed that the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>gifts doctors receive from </v>

165
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.981
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more expensive the drugs they </v>

166
00:07:46.981 --> 00:07:49.570
<v Speaker 1>prescribe and the more prescriptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>they write in general.</v>

167
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that's true.</v>

168
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife's mom was a nurse and she would </v>

169
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.911
<v Speaker 1>tell me stories about how they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>take them out to nice dinners at fancy </v>

170
00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:01.060
<v Speaker 1>restaurants and everything on the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's human nature.</v>

171
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:04.780
<v Speaker 1>up to one of my favorite quotes is from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Upton Sinclair.</v>

173
00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:09.781
<v Speaker 1>He said it's difficult to get a man to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand something when his salary is </v>

174
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 1>dependent on him not understanding it.</v>

175
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 1>So one more time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dietary cholesterol has no impact.</v>

177
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

178
00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:23.881
<v Speaker 1>I'll be more specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in 70 percent of people eating egg </v>

179
00:08:25.031 --> 00:08:29.620
<v Speaker 1>yolks and cholesterol and meat and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things doesn't do anything to your serum</v>

180
00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:31.600
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cholesterol levels in your blood,</v>

181
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:37.170
<v Speaker 1>in 30 percent of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a slight raise in your ldl </v>

182
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.170
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called bad cholesterol,</v>

183
00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:40.930
<v Speaker 1>but you also get a raise in your hdl </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol,</v>

184
00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:45.931
<v Speaker 1>which is a so called good cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means there's no net clinical </v>

185
00:08:45.931 --> 00:08:48.970
<v Speaker 1>impact of that in terms of your risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease.</v>

186
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:54.330
<v Speaker 1>And this is why the US finally the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrialized country to actually do </v>

187
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They finally said,</v>

188
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.810
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we really just can't do this </v>

189
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.181
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't tell you not to eat dietary </v>

190
00:09:05.181 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol because there's just not any</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence to support that.</v>

191
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>What took so long?</v>

192
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you just referred to one of the </v>

193
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:12.380
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 1>conflicts of interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were invested in maintaining</v>

195
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:18.831
<v Speaker 1>the status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think also there's probably some </v>

196
00:09:18.831 --> 00:09:21.660
<v Speaker 1>concern about losing credibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 1>these organs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these government organizations,</v>

198
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:28.581
<v Speaker 1>if they told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told us not to eat cholesterol for so </v>

199
00:09:28.581 --> 00:09:31.131
<v Speaker 1>long and then they tell us that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a problem and they do that </v>

200
00:09:31.131 --> 00:09:31.131
<v Speaker 1>with saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

201
00:09:31.131 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 1>people stop listening because they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw up their hands.</v>

202
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:38.151
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who to believe or what to </v>

203
00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:38.151
<v Speaker 1>listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That saturated fat is another one.</v>

204
00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:41.771
<v Speaker 1>You talked to the average person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think you should restrict your </v>

205
00:09:41.771 --> 00:09:41.771
<v Speaker 1>intake of saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

206
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 1>average person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most doctors still.</v>

207
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:44.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

208
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

209
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is some nuance here and,</v>

210
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:54.010
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we talked about this on the last </v>

211
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.721
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where we're headed in my opinion </v>

212
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:59.810
<v Speaker 1>with diet and nutrition recommendations </v>
<v Speaker 1>is from general blanket recommendations </v>

213
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>that apply to everybody to more </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalized recommendations that depend</v>

214
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:05.850
<v Speaker 1>on your genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goals,</v>

215
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:07.400
<v Speaker 1>your lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

216
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your health status,</v>

217
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 1>your age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

218
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 1>So let's take somebody who is apo e </v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

219
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:16.550
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

220
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a certain genetic haplotype and </v>

221
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 1>they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:23.620
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

223
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 1>they are really sensitive to the dietary</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of saturated fat if you have </v>

224
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.220
<v Speaker 1>that gene type and if they eat the </v>
<v Speaker 1>common,</v>

225
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:34.740
<v Speaker 1>is that not very common at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

226
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the exact percent.</v>

227
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:38.790
<v Speaker 1>It'S below 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's three point three,</v>

228
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:43.791
<v Speaker 1>four percent or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if those people eat a lot of </v>

229
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:45.360
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ldl particle number,</v>

230
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:50.390
<v Speaker 1>which we can define if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the particles that carry </v>

231
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol can go up pretty pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

232
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.980
<v Speaker 1>And what we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least from the research that we have </v>

233
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.431
<v Speaker 1>is that people who have a much higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>ldl particle number can be at higher </v>

234
00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 1>risk for heart disease and alzheimer's.</v>

235
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some murkiness there because </v>

236
00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:08.650
<v Speaker 1>that's just on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:13.341
<v Speaker 1>we don't know if that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that risk applies to people who are </v>

238
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:13.341
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:16.801
<v Speaker 1>paleo type of diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing crossfit at taking care of </v>

240
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:17.030
<v Speaker 1>themselves in every other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just know that,</v>

241
00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:20.280
<v Speaker 1>that the general population in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general population,</v>

242
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 1>a higher ldl p leads to a higher risk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these conditions.</v>

243
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know pete,</v>

244
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know people,</v>

245
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people know this,</v>

246
00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:33.741
<v Speaker 1>but some people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between ldl and </v>

247
00:11:33.741 --> 00:11:34.160
<v Speaker 1>hdl and wise one good and one bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

248
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.550
<v Speaker 1>he asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

249
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example of how things are </v>

250
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:42.580
<v Speaker 1>changing again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

251
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.670
<v Speaker 1>so historically the idea has been that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ldl,</v>

252
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:49.671
<v Speaker 1>which stands for low density lipoprotein</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hdl stands for high density </v>

253
00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>lipoprotein the ldl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea was it was bad,</v>

254
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a number of effects that contribute </v>

255
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.310
<v Speaker 1>to the risk of heart disease.</v>

256
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Whereas hdl does a kind of like clean up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and repair process and actually reduces </v>

257
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 1>the risk of heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just a couple of weeks ago there was</v>

258
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:12.781
<v Speaker 1>some pretty influential research </v>
<v Speaker 1>published suggesting that hdl may not be</v>

259
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:19.530
<v Speaker 1>actually so protective and it may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of like a like a bystander effect </v>

260
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:24.121
<v Speaker 1>where people that have lower risks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease just just also have higher</v>

261
00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>hdl and it's not that the hdl is </v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting them.</v>

262
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:33.331
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever other underlying processes</v>
<v Speaker 1>are protecting them happened to lead to </v>

263
00:12:33.331 --> 00:12:36.540
<v Speaker 1>higher hdl levels and the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think this now is that they.</v>

264
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.470
<v Speaker 1>They've done a whole bunch of trials on </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs that raise hdl and guess what?</v>

265
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't need the people who have an </v>

266
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.921
<v Speaker 1>increase in their hdl because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs don't have a lower risk of heart </v>

267
00:12:50.201 --> 00:12:55.201
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some cases they've even had to </v>

268
00:12:55.201 --> 00:12:57.331
<v Speaker 1>stop the trials because it became clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was not only no benefit but </v>

269
00:12:57.331 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe even some harm.</v>

270
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:03.450
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of harm would there be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just more know more cardiovascular </v>

271
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.921
<v Speaker 1>events or more deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just another example of </v>

272
00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 1>something that we just assume for so </v>
<v Speaker 1>long it's true.</v>

273
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.840
<v Speaker 1>And then we find out that it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with a guy who's a </v>

274
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.850
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy and we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs and uh,</v>

275
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

276
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:24.001
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to eat about four to six eggs a </v>

277
00:13:24.001 --> 00:13:24.001
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

278
00:13:24.001 --> 00:13:24.001
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about all the cholesterol?</v>

279
00:13:24.001 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

280
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

281
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 1>And like you don't know that and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really smart guy.</v>

282
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Like this is kind of stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

283
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's gonna take.</v>

284
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what I just told you about hdl,</v>

285
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:36.760
<v Speaker 1>think of everything that has to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reflect that new understanding.</v>

286
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 1>You've got textbooks that need to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewritten.</v>

287
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 1>You've got primary care guidelines </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>

288
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>it's just massive.</v>

289
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.740
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to get our head </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

290
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:48.430
<v Speaker 1>And so the average primary care </v>
<v Speaker 1>provider's not going to get this message</v>

291
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.670
<v Speaker 1>for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say decades,</v>

292
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 1>not more than years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

293
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to be giving out bad </v>

294
00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.971
<v Speaker 1>advice to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the average person who works all day </v>

295
00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:02.110
<v Speaker 1>and doesn't have the time to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>research that you do or you know,</v>

296
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe isn't informed about all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>various blogs and books and just doesn't</v>

297
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:12.811
<v Speaker 1>have time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to his primary care doctor and ask </v>

298
00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:15.071
<v Speaker 1>him questions and he gets terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>information because then unfortunately </v>

299
00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 1>the primary care doctor doesn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time either.</v>

300
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

301
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in a bad spot.</v>

302
00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:20.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of primary care physicians,</v>

303
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:25.591
<v Speaker 1>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone I know went into medicine for </v>

304
00:14:25.591 --> 00:14:25.591
<v Speaker 1>the right reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to help people.</v>

305
00:14:25.591 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 1>They're doing their best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're seeing 2,500</v>

306
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>patients.</v>

307
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>That's how many they have on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>roster.</v>

308
00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:36.031
<v Speaker 1>Their average visit is eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is between eight and 12 minutes because </v>

309
00:14:36.031 --> 00:14:39.250
<v Speaker 1>they get reimbursed based on the number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of visits.</v>

310
00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:40.630
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to make a living,</v>

311
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 1>they have to see a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>patients a day.</v>

312
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:44.860
<v Speaker 1>And the insurance companies often </v>
<v Speaker 1>mandate that.</v>

313
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in a 10 minute visit,</v>

314
00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Speaker 1>patient shows up with multiple chronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>

315
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:52.450
<v Speaker 1>taking multiple medications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

316
00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.090
<v Speaker 1>and then presenting with new symptoms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're concerned about.</v>

317
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.270
<v Speaker 1>There's barely enough time to say hello </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

318
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:04.750
<v Speaker 1>figure out what's going on with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>meds and make an adjustment and make a </v>

319
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:05.960
<v Speaker 1>new prescription much less to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in any kind of meaningful way about</v>

320
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>their diet and their lifestyle and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

321
00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

322
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.280
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary care doctors I think are as </v>

323
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:15.280
<v Speaker 1>much victims of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

324
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.020
<v Speaker 1>of our conventional system and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's set up as patients are and if </v>

325
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.260
<v Speaker 1>they're busting their butts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing patients eight hours a day every </v>

326
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.311
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they have all the paperwork to </v>

327
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:30.491
<v Speaker 1>do on top of that last thing they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to want to do is go home and fire </v>

328
00:15:30.491 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 1>up pub pub mat and start reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

329
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.420
<v Speaker 1>the latest studies that have come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure they're going to be exhausted.</v>

330
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Non-motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 1>And they got families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 1>they have other things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

333
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:39.900
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

334
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.970
<v Speaker 1>and there are studies that have shown </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the majority of of primary care </v>

335
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Speaker 1>physicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understandably given this situation,</v>

336
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 1>receive most of their education from </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical sales reps.</v>

337
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who bring in the brochures and to,</v>

338
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about a particular condition and of</v>

339
00:15:57.291 --> 00:16:02.291
<v Speaker 1>course those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to be unbiased </v>

340
00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:05.231
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious that they get their </v>

341
00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:05.231
<v Speaker 1>information from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

342
00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the reps come to the office,</v>

343
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:12.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so and they have the brochures to </v>

344
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.500
<v Speaker 1>the drugs and the in the brochures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk about the condition and you know,</v>

345
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.560
<v Speaker 1>they have cartoons and pictures in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and showing you the bad stuff that's </v>

346
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.320
<v Speaker 1>happening to your arteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

347
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy system and it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

348
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 1>we're in big trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the message in my book.</v>

349
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

350
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.980
<v Speaker 1>this is not just about individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

351
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 1>which is my first book was about taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>back your own health.</v>

352
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.560
<v Speaker 1>This book is about taking back </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare because we're,</v>

353
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:39.690
<v Speaker 1>we're screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the numbers and by the </v>

354
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:39.690
<v Speaker 1>year 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

355
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.410
<v Speaker 1>it's estimated at 100 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal federal budget will go towards </v>

356
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:47.090
<v Speaker 1>medicare and medicaid expenses leading </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing for anything else.</v>

357
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Military and just want someone with 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 watts talking about our lifetimes.</v>

358
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.120
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

359
00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:58.121
<v Speaker 1>That's if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if healthcare spending continues to </v>

360
00:16:58.121 --> 00:16:58.610
<v Speaker 1>increase at its current pace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

361
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.410
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does not.</v>

362
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:06.610
<v Speaker 1>This is why the department of defense's </v>
<v Speaker 1>has named healthcare as an existential </v>

363
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:08.660
<v Speaker 1>threat to this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

364
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear war or any other military </v>

365
00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.721
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've named chronic disease as an </v>

366
00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:17.810
<v Speaker 1>existential threat that could actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

367
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threaten our survival as a nation.</v>

368
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever thought of it that way,</v>

369
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>who could have ever imagined that </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally all of our budget would go to </v>

370
00:17:31.281 --> 00:17:33.890
<v Speaker 1>take care of people's health by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>

371
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.350
<v Speaker 1>That's not long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not long in.</v>

372
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me give you a few examples just to,</v>

373
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make this more clear.</v>

374
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:46.841
<v Speaker 1>So the cost of treating a patient with </v>
<v Speaker 1>type two diabetes is estimated to be </v>

375
00:17:46.841 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 1>$14,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

376
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know now that a hundred million </v>

377
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.500
<v Speaker 1>americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a third of the population </v>

378
00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:57.540
<v Speaker 1>have either prediabetes or type two </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes.</v>

379
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

380
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:04.131
<v Speaker 1>cdc just published these numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 million americans have prediabetes </v>

381
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:08.430
<v Speaker 1>or type two diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one third,</v>

382
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.450
<v Speaker 1>one third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is the.</v>

383
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had just asked me like what </v>

384
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:21.171
<v Speaker 1>percentage of americans have diabetes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably said like four percent </v>

385
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.380
<v Speaker 1>percent who actually have type two </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes is lower it,</v>

386
00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:28.430
<v Speaker 1>but I said prediabetes or type two </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes.</v>

387
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

388
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.140
<v Speaker 1>so here are a couple other sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A 88 percent of people who have </v>

389
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:40.431
<v Speaker 1>prediabetes don't know that they have it</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 87 percent and the average amount of </v>

390
00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:45.951
<v Speaker 1>time it takes for someone to progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>from prediabetes to full fledged type </v>

391
00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:49.290
<v Speaker 1>two diabetes is just five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

392
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 1>So let's go back to that number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$14,000</v>

393
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 1>a year to treat a single patient with </v>
<v Speaker 1>type two diabetes.</v>

394
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Imagine someone gets diagnosed at age </v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

395
00:18:57.451 --> 00:19:01.360
<v Speaker 1>which is totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean now even eight year old kids,</v>

396
00:19:01.361 --> 00:19:06.361
<v Speaker 1>they're being diagnosed with type two </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes and imagine that person lives </v>

397
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:10.281
<v Speaker 1>at an another 45 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also feasible because we have </v>

398
00:19:10.281 --> 00:19:14.211
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the amazing things about </v>

399
00:19:14.211 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 1>conventional medicine into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies that keep us alive probably</v>

400
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:19.761
<v Speaker 1>a lot longer than we should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that person lives 45 years.</v>

401
00:19:20.131 --> 00:19:22.290
<v Speaker 1>We spent $13,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

402
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.320
<v Speaker 1>a $14,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year treating that person,</v>

403
00:19:25.321 --> 00:19:30.321
<v Speaker 1>that's $630,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to treat one patient with one disease </v>

404
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 1>over that patient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:34.350
<v Speaker 1>remaining lifetime.</v>

406
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Now if you start doing some math and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume how,</v>

407
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:44.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even 50 million people with diabetes </v>

408
00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.930
<v Speaker 1>times $630,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a number with so many zeroes </v>

409
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.110
<v Speaker 1>after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what it is.</v>

410
00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like a google or a google plex or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

411
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.890
<v Speaker 1>So this is why we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're facing this threat and this is why</v>

412
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I wrote the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people aren't aware that we're</v>

413
00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:02.720
<v Speaker 1>at this point where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.220
<v Speaker 1>like one in two americans now as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic disease,</v>

415
00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:10.221
<v Speaker 1>one in four have multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in two americans has a chronic </v>

416
00:20:10.221 --> 00:20:13.791
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one into one in four have multiple </v>

417
00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:14.790
<v Speaker 1>chronic diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know you're a parent so,</v>

418
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:19.850
<v Speaker 1>and I am 2:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent almost of kids now have a </v>

419
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 1>chronic disease and that's up from just </v>
<v Speaker 1>13 percent in 1994.</v>

420
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.770
<v Speaker 1>So there's been more than a doubling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids with chronic disease and less than </v>

421
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.770
<v Speaker 1>25 years.</v>

422
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.610
<v Speaker 1>How has that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has changed in the american diet?</v>

423
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.820
<v Speaker 1>YoU attributing it to the american </v>
<v Speaker 1>american and affects all of the above.</v>

424
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.600
<v Speaker 1>So I wouldn't say it's the diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an increase in sedentary activity,</v>

425
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lIke a sitting for very long periods,</v>

426
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:47.910
<v Speaker 1>not moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not enough exposure to artificial or non</v>

427
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.080
<v Speaker 1>exposure to bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

428
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 1>to natural light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much exposure to artificial light,</v>

429
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.760
<v Speaker 1>not enough sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

430
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:59.970
<v Speaker 1>So all of these things come together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we've got a nation of people with </v>

431
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:04.381
<v Speaker 1>chronic disease and chronic disease is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bankrupting our country and it's </v>

432
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.100
<v Speaker 1>extremely difficult to treat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lasts for a lifetime and our only </v>

433
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:15.280
<v Speaker 1>hope actually of dealing with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and surviving as a,</v>

434
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.080
<v Speaker 1>as a country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a nation,</v>

435
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.680
<v Speaker 1>is to figure out a way to prevent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse disease instead of just </v>

436
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.070
<v Speaker 1>suppressing symptoms and putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>bandaids on it,</v>

437
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:27.970
<v Speaker 1>which is what our current conventional </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical system does.</v>

438
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you really scared me with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes number,</v>

439
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 1>that debts really freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that.</v>

440
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you pull them up,</v>

441
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:41.850
<v Speaker 1>jane?</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than 100 million americans have </v>

442
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:41.850
<v Speaker 1>diabetes or its precursor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Staggering.</v>

443
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Cdc report reveals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just from july.</v>

444
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

445
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 1>In 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>least one point 5 million new cases were</v>

446
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:55.021
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed and people over 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a third of the us population is </v>

447
00:21:55.021 --> 00:21:55.300
<v Speaker 1>diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diabetes.</v>

448
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Let me throw a couple others that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

449
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.400
<v Speaker 1>the cdc just updated it to obesity </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>

450
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 percent of us adults are obese.</v>

451
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty percent for intent,</v>

452
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.060
<v Speaker 1>not just overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obese and 30 percent,</v>

453
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:14.740
<v Speaker 1>40 percent and almost 20 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescents are now obese.</v>

454
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are they based in this?</v>

455
00:22:16.391 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 1>By those body standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>body mass index,</v>

456
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.370
<v Speaker 1>obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not.</v>

457
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.230
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not perfect,</v>

458
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imperfect that it's,</v>

459
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:31.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a 20 percent </v>

460
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.590
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

461
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Look at body mass Index,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five foot eight,</v>

462
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.490
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm like dying.</v>

463
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.440
<v Speaker 1>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

464
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.180
<v Speaker 1>like if you look at the body mass index,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm like,</v>

465
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:44.270
<v Speaker 1>have to have terrible health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all you have to do is go to an </v>

466
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.270
<v Speaker 1>airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

467
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I just flew down here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 1>you sit in an airport and you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>around yo the sticks or crowds,</v>

469
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.280
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lift weights,</v>

470
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.900
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>

471
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

472
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.700
<v Speaker 1>what am I obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

473
00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

474
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Damn that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on site.</v>

475
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have diabetes and you're </v>

476
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:06.870
<v Speaker 1>not 10 percent body fat or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

477
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.250
<v Speaker 1>so that's just not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not real.</v>

478
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

479
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that statistic.</v>

480
00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:18.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think out of 10 people that </v>

481
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:18.210
<v Speaker 1>you see on the street are for obese?</v>

482
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm obese now I know that I'm obese,</v>

483
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to that will give you gotta </v>

484
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:25.540
<v Speaker 1>throw that thing out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good metric.</v>

485
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:29.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not a perfect metric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have done studies where they </v>

486
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.200
<v Speaker 1>have accounted for that and they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do see some variation,</v>

487
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.000
<v Speaker 1>but you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not the norm.</v>

488
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

489
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you're an outlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware of that,</v>

490
00:23:38.831 --> 00:23:42.030
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's probably got to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a few outliers out there.</v>

491
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.000
<v Speaker 1>There are quite a few but not enough on </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>

492
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 1>but not enough to change that statistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a really meaningful way.</v>

493
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

494
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:51.710
<v Speaker 1>there aren't 20 percent of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to drop that from 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent to 20 percent.</v>

496
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 1>So maybe 40 to 35.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that reasonable?</v>

497
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Still a lot back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

498
00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:03.080
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say maybe 40 to 39 or 38.</v>

499
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

500
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

501
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.460
<v Speaker 1>so here's the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

502
00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>

503
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:15.280
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the whole recent healthcare </v>

504
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.980
<v Speaker 1>debate with the affordable care act and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the current administration </v>

505
00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:22.451
<v Speaker 1>suggesting something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole discussion revolved around </v>

506
00:24:22.451 --> 00:24:22.730
<v Speaker 1>how we're going to pay for health care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.080
<v Speaker 1>insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health insurance.</v>

508
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:29.530
<v Speaker 1>But we have to understand that health </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance is not the same thing as </v>

509
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:29.530
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

510
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a method of paying for healthcare.</v>

511
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.720
<v Speaker 1>And my key point in the book is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter what method of health </v>

512
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.820
<v Speaker 1>that we use to pay for healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the government,</v>

513
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.370
<v Speaker 1>whether it's corporations or whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's individuals,</v>

514
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:48.710
<v Speaker 1>there is no method that sustainable in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of the rising rates of chronic </v>

515
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.530
<v Speaker 1>disease that we're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's.</v>

516
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.380
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating as I am pretty aware of this</v>

517
00:24:54.381 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 1>stuff and I didn't know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me and I'm stunned.</v>

518
00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm stunned at the number of people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic disease and I'm stunned at the </v>

519
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.110
<v Speaker 1>number of people that are either </v>
<v Speaker 1>prediabetic or diabetic.</v>

520
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know how to digest that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

521
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:10.630
<v Speaker 1>that's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that could be attributed almost </v>

522
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.330
<v Speaker 1>entirely to diet in a lack of extra sets</v>
<v Speaker 1>of preventable disease.</v>

523
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Type two diabetes is a fully preventable</v>

524
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.430
<v Speaker 1>condition in type one diabetes varies in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what way?</v>

525
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 1>That's an autoimmune condition and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly genetically mediated.</v>

526
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:31.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which means that it doesn't necessarily </v>

527
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.980
<v Speaker 1>mean that if you have the genes you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get the disease,</v>

528
00:25:33.981 --> 00:25:34.820
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

529
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:39.910
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of the risk I think is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistic that I've seen a of type one </v>

530
00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:44.801
<v Speaker 1>diabetes is genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas we know now that 85 percent of </v>

531
00:25:44.801 --> 00:25:49.451
<v Speaker 1>the risk of of disease in generaL comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to environmental and behavioral </v>

532
00:25:49.451 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behavioral meaning you die,</v>

533
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or or your sleep or your,</v>

534
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your physical activity,</v>

535
00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:56.780
<v Speaker 1>stress management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

536
00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.710
<v Speaker 1>So that means only 15 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk of disease is genetic,</v>

537
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purely genetically a driven.</v>

538
00:26:03.801 --> 00:26:08.801
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the other 85 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the vast majority is actually </v>

539
00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 1>under our control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at a statistic that made a</v>

540
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:16.811
<v Speaker 1>correlation between sleep and weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss and saying that people who slept an</v>

541
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:21.770
<v Speaker 1>average of eight to 10 hours a day had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant,</v>

542
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:28.190
<v Speaker 1>a significant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly less body fat and weighed </v>

543
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:33.611
<v Speaker 1>less and lost more weight than people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who did the exact same activity but </v>

544
00:26:33.611 --> 00:26:35.300
<v Speaker 1>slept four to six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

545
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I would say that among a people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>research a weight regulation,</v>

546
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.240
<v Speaker 1>sleep is now recognized as being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second most influential lifestyle factor</v>

547
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.970
<v Speaker 1>that determines our weight aside from </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet low.</v>

548
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I had I ahead of physical activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got a couple of good ones for you.</v>

549
00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:01.190
<v Speaker 1>A single night of sleep deprivation has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been shown to cause mild insulin </v>

550
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:05.511
<v Speaker 1>resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in healthy people with no </v>

551
00:27:05.511 --> 00:27:05.511
<v Speaker 1>preexisting blood sugar disorders.</v>

552
00:27:05.511 --> 00:27:10.310
<v Speaker 1>So just one night of not sleeping well </v>
<v Speaker 1>can cause a little bit of insulin </v>

553
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.310
<v Speaker 1>resistance the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

554
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 1>it's transient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes,</v>

555
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.750
<v Speaker 1>goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's significant.</v>

556
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.440
<v Speaker 1>There was a study where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they deprive people of sleep for eight </v>

557
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.251
<v Speaker 1>nights in a row pretty severely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't obviously not total sleep </v>

558
00:27:22.251 --> 00:27:25.881
<v Speaker 1>deprivation because they'd be dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you really be dead for eight nights </v>

559
00:27:25.881 --> 00:27:25.980
<v Speaker 1>in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

560
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a partial partial but significant</v>

561
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 1>sleep deprivation for eight nights in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>

562
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:37.290
<v Speaker 1>these people ate an additional 566 </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories a day,</v>

563
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:43.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during that period with no changes in </v>

564
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.951
<v Speaker 1>resting energy expenditure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's equivalent to gaining a pound </v>

565
00:27:45.951 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 1>a week of bodyweight or 52 pounds in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

566
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.080
<v Speaker 1>So most people won't have that severe of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep deprivation,</v>

567
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:55.110
<v Speaker 1>but if you just even have mild sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation,</v>

568
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a significant period,</v>

569
00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:01.020
<v Speaker 1>what if that could account for 10 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weight gain a year and over,</v>

570
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>

571
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:02.950
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

572
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.730
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a lot of weekends.</v>

573
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it because you're sleepy,</v>

574
00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:09.980
<v Speaker 1>so you just force yourself to eat food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

575
00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

576
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:15.670
<v Speaker 1>it totally screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It totally screws with hormone </v>

577
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.690
<v Speaker 1>production and all the hormones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate appetite and satiety and,</v>

578
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his laptop and his tire and appetites</v>

579
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.040
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get satiated and it also </v>

580
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 1>decreases your willpower and judgment </v>
<v Speaker 1>around food.</v>

581
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.400
<v Speaker 1>So people are likely to make worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices when it comes to food.</v>

582
00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I know I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

583
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm really,</v>

584
00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:42.891
<v Speaker 1>really tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I immediately go to like bullshit </v>

585
00:28:42.891 --> 00:28:42.891
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburgers or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

586
00:28:42.891 --> 00:28:42.891
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

587
00:28:42.891 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of what has been documented </v>

588
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

589
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.980
<v Speaker 1>You like reward yourself with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible for you.</v>

590
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know probably in,</v>

591
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:58.810
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also related to the changes in </v>

592
00:28:58.810 --> 00:28:58.810
<v Speaker 1>brain chemistry that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

593
00:28:58.810 --> 00:28:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

594
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

595
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:05.390
<v Speaker 1>and now we know that a third of </v>
<v Speaker 1>americans get fewer than six hours of </v>

596
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:09.471
<v Speaker 1>sleep and outside of maybe three percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the population that has a gene that </v>

597
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:12.430
<v Speaker 1>allows them to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

598
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.290
<v Speaker 1>be okay with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that few hours of sleep,</v>

599
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:21.620
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of people need seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>to eight and a half hours of sleep to </v>

600
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:21.620
<v Speaker 1>function properly.</v>

601
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's been clearly documented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

602
00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I had read something about outliers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of performance outliers.</v>

603
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:29.010
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

604
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:34.370
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like entrepreneurs guys were killing it </v>

605
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.390
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

606
00:29:34.391 --> 00:29:36.330
<v Speaker 1>they're getting like four to five hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep at night.</v>

607
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.890
<v Speaker 1>And I was stunned by that and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

608
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.100
<v Speaker 1>how's that possible account?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are these people that are,</v>

609
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:46.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing all these physical </v>

610
00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:46.260
<v Speaker 1>activities working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running their business.</v>

611
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And then I found out about adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

612
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.220
<v Speaker 1>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

613
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

614
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:56.491
<v Speaker 1>there are some genetic polymorphisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we at least some research suggests </v>

615
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.530
<v Speaker 1>that allow people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

616
00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.260
<v Speaker 1>deal with less sleep than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

617
00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I think in that community there's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stimulant use.</v>

618
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:08.090
<v Speaker 1>It's driving that and at some point </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to pay the price.</v>

619
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to come clean about that.</v>

620
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the dirty little secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that are entrepreneurs in</v>

621
00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley people and did the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>they describe it,</v>

622
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:18.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people chewing gum.</v>

623
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is doing new vigil provigil </v>

624
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.120
<v Speaker 1>which are apparently less problematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then adderall across the board.</v>

625
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

626
00:30:29.891 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

627
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:36.020
<v Speaker 1>we're making choices now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both individually and collectively that </v>

628
00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.950
<v Speaker 1>are taking us in the wrong direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

629
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:39.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

630
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:45.190
<v Speaker 1>this week I've shared a few stats that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of blew you away and they've blown </v>

631
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.780
<v Speaker 1>me away to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

632
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.490
<v Speaker 1>when I was researching the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how it all came together.</v>

633
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:50.470
<v Speaker 1>For me it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a wake up call,</v>

634
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have a six year old daughter and </v>

635
00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.191
<v Speaker 1>now you have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's kids are the first generation </v>

636
00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:01.030
<v Speaker 1>that are expected to live shorter </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespans than us,</v>

637
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 1>their parents.</v>

638
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.840
<v Speaker 1>That's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

639
00:31:04.841 --> 00:31:08.800
<v Speaker 1>as long as we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on this statistic about diabetes,</v>

640
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.920
<v Speaker 1>the dramatic increase in chronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

641
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:14.710
<v Speaker 1>So as long as we've been measuring it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern world,</v>

642
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.870
<v Speaker 1>lifespans just been going like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

643
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:19.150
<v Speaker 1>there's been a few blips due to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pandemics,</v>

644
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:21.610
<v Speaker 1>like the spanish flu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for as long as we've been measuring,</v>

645
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 1>it's just going up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

646
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:23.170
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

647
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.540
<v Speaker 1>and now this is the first generation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

648
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:28.090
<v Speaker 1>It's actually expected start going back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the other direction.</v>

649
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I showed my kids that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sugar documentary,</v>

650
00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:35.610
<v Speaker 1>my wife showed it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lasted about four months and then </v>

651
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:35.610
<v Speaker 1>they will like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gives a shit?</v>

652
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's get back to the ice cream.</v>

653
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:44.340
<v Speaker 1>The kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's hard because we're </v>

654
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.380
<v Speaker 1>hard that this is where the evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is so important for people </v>

655
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:52.240
<v Speaker 1>to understand where we're hardwired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to seek out foods that are calorie dense</v>

656
00:31:52.241 --> 00:31:57.241
<v Speaker 1>and highly rewarding and by rewarding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about that term in the </v>

657
00:31:57.241 --> 00:32:01.741
<v Speaker 1>scientific context context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means eating something makes you </v>

658
00:32:01.741 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 1>want to eat more of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

659
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 1>so a potato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chips,</v>

660
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:10.590
<v Speaker 1>ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly rewarding because you'll keep </v>

661
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.200
<v Speaker 1>eating them even beyond the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hunger has been satisfied.</v>

662
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:16.270
<v Speaker 1>A baked potato with no salt or butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very rewarding.</v>

663
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.610
<v Speaker 1>You know you'll eat if you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll eat it,</v>

664
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:23.820
<v Speaker 1>but you won't eat more than your hungry </v>
<v Speaker 1>for and even a steak which is most </v>

665
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:28.471
<v Speaker 1>people like and it's tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When's the last time you heard about </v>

666
00:32:28.471 --> 00:32:32.011
<v Speaker 1>somebody bingeing on a steak?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really happen because it's </v>

667
00:32:32.011 --> 00:32:35.911
<v Speaker 1>not highly rewarding in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human beings evolved in an </v>

668
00:32:35.911 --> 00:32:39.961
<v Speaker 1>environment of food scarcity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have these wired genetic</v>

669
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.400
<v Speaker 3>biological mechanisms that caused us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>seek out foods that have a lot of </v>

670
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.931
<v Speaker 3>calories and that are very palatable and</v>
<v Speaker 3>rewarding because that would signal to </v>

671
00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 3>us that they have different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different nutrients,</v>

672
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.520
<v Speaker 3>macro nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flavors,</v>

673
00:32:55.521 --> 00:33:00.521
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're in an environment of food </v>

674
00:33:00.521 --> 00:33:01.280
<v Speaker 3>scarcity that works really well because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

675
00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 3>stocking up on calories would allow us </v>
<v Speaker 3>to survive a period of,</v>

676
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.720
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

677
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.710
<v Speaker 3>famine or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or food shortage or you know,</v>

678
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.790
<v Speaker 3>unable to locate food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

679
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:16.390
<v Speaker 3>So we have all these mechanisms that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were originally designed to help us </v>

680
00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:17.930
<v Speaker 3>survive starvation in a natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

681
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 3>That's all well and good when we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in that kind of environment.</v>

682
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:25.310
<v Speaker 3>But what happens when we live in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment where there is a seven slash</v>

683
00:33:25.311 --> 00:33:30.311
<v Speaker 3>11 on every corner and amazon delivering</v>
<v Speaker 3>food your door and a costco around the,</v>

684
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.790
<v Speaker 3>around the block.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Food is everywhere.</v>

685
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.940
<v Speaker 3>And so all of these mechanisms that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually helped us to survive in our </v>

686
00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.631
<v Speaker 3>ancestral environment cause set us up </v>
<v Speaker 3>for failure in this modern food </v>

687
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:49.541
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we capitalize on that with things </v>

688
00:33:49.541 --> 00:33:49.541
<v Speaker 3>like the banana split.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

689
00:33:49.541 --> 00:33:54.011
<v Speaker 3>Well the thing is that big big food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hire scientists who understand </v>

690
00:33:56.361 --> 00:34:01.361
<v Speaker 3>these mechanisms and specifically </v>
<v Speaker 3>designed foods to hit all of those </v>

691
00:34:01.361 --> 00:34:02.560
<v Speaker 3>circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

692
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.900
<v Speaker 3>what do you think is like probably is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there a statistically most addictive </v>

693
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:08.070
<v Speaker 3>food?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

694
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know actually the answer to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

695
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:15.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of controversy about </v>

696
00:34:15.881 --> 00:34:17.831
<v Speaker 3>whether sugar is addictive in the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the true sense of the way that </v>

697
00:34:17.931 --> 00:34:20.480
<v Speaker 3>scientists use the term addictive like </v>
<v Speaker 3>meth.</v>

698
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

699
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.200
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're both sides of that debate.</v>

700
00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think most of us can have,</v>

701
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:28.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just on our,</v>

702
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:33.220
<v Speaker 3>in our own personal experience can kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of assess the effect that sugar has on </v>

703
00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:35.330
<v Speaker 3>us or our kids or whatever it.</v>

704
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 3>It's highly rewarding in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes us want more and more of it.</v>

705
00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:44.510
<v Speaker 3>It's not addicted to me in the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I get a detox if I'm not having it,</v>

706
00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:48.920
<v Speaker 3>but if it's around me and I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the craving is very creepy.</v>

707
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

708
00:34:49.881 --> 00:34:52.970
<v Speaker 3>like what is this jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most addictive foods?</v>

709
00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.070
<v Speaker 3>Pizza is number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

710
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's based on a health line.com</v>

711
00:34:57.501 --> 00:34:59.120
<v Speaker 3>study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>

712
00:34:59.121 --> 00:34:59.530
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

713
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.750
<v Speaker 3>there might be something of that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were in New York and uh,</v>

714
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.960
<v Speaker 3>you brought over those slices of pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn,</v>

715
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:10.990
<v Speaker 3>those are good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't figure out a way to make </v>

716
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:10.990
<v Speaker 3>that pizza here we have real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

717
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:15.731
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that you showed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm the top six foods in the </v>

718
00:35:15.831 --> 00:35:18.260
<v Speaker 3>american diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to cow,</v>

719
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.320
<v Speaker 3>the amount of calories that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprise in our diet or a pizza bread,</v>

720
00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.430
<v Speaker 3>grain based desserts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>

721
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.730
<v Speaker 3>sugar sweetened beverages and chicken </v>
<v Speaker 3>dishes,</v>

722
00:35:31.731 --> 00:35:35.060
<v Speaker 3>primarily fried chicken dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like chicken nuggets from mcdonald's.</v>

723
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:40.660
<v Speaker 3>Those six foods comprise the majority of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the calories that the average american </v>

724
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.530
<v Speaker 3>eats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you look at our ancestral diet.</v>

725
00:35:43.531 --> 00:35:45.570
<v Speaker 3>It was mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

726
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.330
<v Speaker 3>meat and fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild fruits and vegetables,</v>

727
00:35:48.331 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 3>not even the domesticated varieties that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we eat today,</v>

728
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.570
<v Speaker 3>nuts and seeds and a lot of starchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>fibrous plants,</v>

729
00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of which aren't even available to </v>

730
00:35:59.940 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 3>us at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

731
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet potatoes would be our kind of </v>

732
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.911
<v Speaker 3>modern analog of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you have a situation where we </v>

733
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:07.140
<v Speaker 3>evolved in the context of eating those </v>
<v Speaker 3>foods,</v>

734
00:36:07.141 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're nutrient dense,</v>

735
00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:15.120
<v Speaker 3>they're anti inflammatory and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally low in calories and they're </v>

736
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 3>all foods that are very hard for us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>overeat.</v>

737
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's when you don't hear about </v>

738
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.750
<v Speaker 3>people bingeing on broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't hear about them.</v>

739
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Bingeing on steak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you your money macadamia nuts,</v>

740
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:24.690
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I yesterday,</v>

741
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:27.480
<v Speaker 3>last night I got home and I just had 14 </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet potatoes.</v>

742
00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.160
<v Speaker 3>I hear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even if they have sweet potatoes,</v>

743
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times people put brown sugar on</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

744
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maple syrup or something like that,</v>

745
00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:40.740
<v Speaker 3>which then you might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might overeat them,</v>

746
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.870
<v Speaker 3>but if in those foods in their natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>

747
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:45.930
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to overeat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to eat til we're satiated.</v>

748
00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:51.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all the other foods that I just </v>

749
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:51.450
<v Speaker 3>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those top six foods,</v>

750
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:52.950
<v Speaker 3>pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grain based desserts like cake bread,</v>

751
00:36:52.951 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all foods that trigger all those</v>

752
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:58.710
<v Speaker 3>reward circuits in a big way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've all had the experience,</v>

753
00:36:58.711 --> 00:37:02.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure of overeating pretty or </v>
<v Speaker 3>overconsuming everything on that list.</v>

754
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I used to always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

755
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:09.280
<v Speaker 2>coming home from jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would order an extra large pizza and </v>

756
00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.190
<v Speaker 2>eat it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this big,</v>

757
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:15.750
<v Speaker 2>it was huge and I would get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get either pineapple and double </v>

758
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:20.890
<v Speaker 2>pineapple on double anchovies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I know some people think it's </v>

759
00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:20.890
<v Speaker 2>disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very delicious.</v>

760
00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Or I would get a pepperoni and mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would kill that thing.</v>

761
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:27.800
<v Speaker 2>And then afterwards I would literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like somebody opened up my mouth,</v>

762
00:37:27.801 --> 00:37:32.801
<v Speaker 2>like they were trying to force feed of </v>
<v Speaker 2>goose to make fog fagua and they just </v>

763
00:37:32.801 --> 00:37:36.431
<v Speaker 2>poured cement into my stomach and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just lay there and just feel terrible </v>

764
00:37:36.431 --> 00:37:41.081
<v Speaker 2>and feel thAt insulin spike and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole body just reacts this sludge that </v>

765
00:37:41.081 --> 00:37:43.820
<v Speaker 2>you're forcing it to process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just doe,</v>

766
00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:45.770
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's.</v>

767
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.120
<v Speaker 3>And the cheese is great though.</v>

768
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a step,</v>

769
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it seems to.</v>

770
00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:55.780
<v Speaker 2>The doe is what gives you that ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the heavy got bomb.</v>

771
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gut bomb.</v>

772
00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so good though?</v>

773
00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Because I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those alternatives,</v>

774
00:38:01.581 --> 00:38:03.950
<v Speaker 2>they suck and that they're not that </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

775
00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.210
<v Speaker 2>They're good food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did.</v>

776
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not the same.</v>

777
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:10.190
<v Speaker 2>There's no free ride right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No decadent alternative.</v>

778
00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Although I did find a very good cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called no.</v>

779
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Do you know no foods and seeing that go </v>
<v Speaker 2>grab one of those things.</v>

780
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have.</v>

781
00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got one right there.</v>

782

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

783
00:38:21.621 --> 00:38:22.610

<v Speaker 2>entire cookie.</v>

787
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.710

<v Speaker 2>28 grams of sugar.</v>

788
00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:35.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a big ass cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

790
00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

791
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.610
<v Speaker 1>it's all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

792
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.910
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I actually enjoy eating it,</v>

793
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.550
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all okay.</v>

794
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Here we go with almonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coconuts,</v>

795
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:47.030
<v Speaker 1>egg whites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flaxseed,</v>

796
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.210
<v Speaker 1>chia seed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero trans fat,</v>

797
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and a 16 grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen grams of protein,</v>

798
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:56.950
<v Speaker 1>four grams net carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 grams of fiber.</v>

799
00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a coupon and it tastes pretty good,</v>

800
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:04.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as good as not a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>pizza with anchovies and pineapple on </v>

801
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.520
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as good as like a Mrs.</v>

802
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Fields chocolate chip cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YoU know when you pull it apart in that </v>

803

<v Speaker 1>string of chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that absolutely.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean the nice glass of milk and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>are all good because they,</v>

805
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.390
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

806
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.830
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trigger,</v>

807
00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:24.790
<v Speaker 1>all of those hardwired reward circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They push all the right buttons.</v>

808
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get you.</v>

809
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.230
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing how many foods there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are like that.</v>

810
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.320
<v Speaker 1>If you stop and think about like just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down the street,</v>

811
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:36.180
<v Speaker 1>walk in a normal street where there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of stores and restaurants,</v>

812
00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.380
<v Speaker 1>like how much of that stuff is bad for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

813
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:43.410
<v Speaker 1>It's primarily bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's primarily bad and you think the </v>

814
00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.440
<v Speaker 1>whole modern food environment is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and that's what I mean.</v>

815
00:39:44.441 --> 00:39:49.441
<v Speaker 1>We're set up to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who said who sets out to be lean </v>

816
00:39:49.441 --> 00:39:52.360
<v Speaker 1>and fit and healthy is swimming </v>
<v Speaker 1>upstream.</v>

817
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.270
<v Speaker 1>You have to be put in some serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra.</v>

818
00:39:54.271 --> 00:39:59.271
<v Speaker 1>You have to constantly be putting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort because there's a barrage of </v>

819
00:39:59.271 --> 00:40:00.490
<v Speaker 1>advertisements you walk into a grocery </v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

820
00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:05.491
<v Speaker 1>all of those foods are triggering all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those circuits that make us seek and </v>

821
00:40:06.101 --> 00:40:11.101
<v Speaker 1>crave those foods because those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary mechanisms that cannot be </v>

822
00:40:11.101 --> 00:40:14.530
<v Speaker 1>consciously overridden very easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why weight loss continues to</v>

823
00:40:14.531 --> 00:40:19.531
<v Speaker 1>be a billion dollar multibillion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry because information is not </v>

824
00:40:19.531 --> 00:40:21.400
<v Speaker 1>enough for most people.</v>

825
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not enough just to know what foods </v>
<v Speaker 1>are healthy,</v>

826
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:29.970
<v Speaker 1>which foods are unhealthy because we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're operating from a much deeper </v>

827
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.070
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The olympics,</v>

828
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.500
<v Speaker 1>the limbic system are kind of lizard </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain that is driving our preferences </v>

829
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:41.371
<v Speaker 1>for food and what foods we seek in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods we don't see and that's below the </v>

830
00:40:41.371 --> 00:40:44.170
<v Speaker 1>level of conscious thought that no where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we say,</v>

831
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:49.171
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that food's not good and I know </v>

832
00:40:49.171 --> 00:40:50.200
<v Speaker 1>this food is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then that lizard brain is like,</v>

833
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.320
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you had a delicious you.</v>

834
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:57.570
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like if you're walking by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you have some potato chips or </v>

835
00:40:58.661 --> 00:41:00.520
<v Speaker 1>something on the shelf and you walk by </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

836
00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:05.521
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like there's an invisible </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand on your shoulder pushing you </v>

837
00:41:05.521 --> 00:41:05.521
<v Speaker 1>towards you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of go hand.</v>

838
00:41:05.521 --> 00:41:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I stop pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop pushing me,</v>

839
00:41:06.671 --> 00:41:08.080
<v Speaker 1>or you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

840
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just kind of give and here's the key</v>

841
00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:13.420
<v Speaker 1>thing to understand too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not because you're weak person</v>

842
00:41:13.421 --> 00:41:18.421
<v Speaker 1>or you don't have willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're a human being and </v>

843
00:41:18.421 --> 00:41:18.421
<v Speaker 1>that's how your brain is programmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

844
00:41:18.421 --> 00:41:23.041
<v Speaker 1>That is a very important thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that there's a reason why it's </v>

845
00:41:23.041 --> 00:41:25.360
<v Speaker 1>difficult for you and and even for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that think it's,</v>

846
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not difficult for me,</v>

847
00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:31.561
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe if you've conditioned </v>

848
00:41:31.561 --> 00:41:32.290
<v Speaker 1>yourself and if you've conditioned your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body and condition,</v>

849
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 1>especially your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something</v>

850
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 2>that does happen when your gut biome </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes where your cravings change.</v>

851
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're eating a lot of sugar,</v>

852
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:45.290
<v Speaker 2>it is incredibly difficult to get off </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because that is what that gut biome</v>

853
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:50.291
<v Speaker 2>wants and there's some sort of a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange difficult to pin down feeling </v>

854
00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.510
<v Speaker 2>that would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That craving is.</v>

855
00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.210
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectualize,</v>

856
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have to go to the bathroom,</v>

857
00:41:58.221 --> 00:41:59.240
<v Speaker 2>it's very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>

858
00:41:59.241 --> 00:42:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I got to pee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there,</v>

859
00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:02.600
<v Speaker 2>you feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is,</v>

860
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:07.130
<v Speaker 2>but the weird hunger craving for sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>is almost like you can't grab it.</v>

861
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.070
<v Speaker 2>You can't like hold on to and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm talking about.</v>

862
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:10.940
<v Speaker 2>This is that thing.</v>

863
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the example I like to use.</v>

864
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:17.280
<v Speaker 3>there's a parasite that the whole life </v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle is really interesting.</v>

865
00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:18.550
<v Speaker 3>You probably aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

866
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.950
<v Speaker 3>it ends up in mice and it changes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

867
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Toxoplasma gondii changes the behavior </v>

868
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.421
<v Speaker 3>of mice so that they are dumber in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their ability to evade getting eaten </v>

869
00:42:31.091 --> 00:42:32.170
<v Speaker 3>by a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

870
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:36.970
<v Speaker 3>and then so then they get eaten by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cat and then the toxoplasma transfers to</v>

871
00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:40.480
<v Speaker 3>the cat where and goes to the cat's </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain where it normally lives,</v>

872
00:42:40.481 --> 00:42:43.380
<v Speaker 3>so that's an example of how a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny little micro,</v>

873
00:42:43.381 --> 00:42:48.381
<v Speaker 3>but you can't even see with your eye can</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerfully control behavior and as you </v>

874
00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:52.441
<v Speaker 3>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got trillions of microbes in our </v>

875
00:42:52.441 --> 00:42:55.420
<v Speaker 3>gut that control our behavior and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like our food preferences and cravings.</v>

876
00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.340
<v Speaker 2>We had robert sapolsky on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about that and he said that some</v>

877
00:42:59.341 --> 00:43:04.341
<v Speaker 2>of the mice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually rewires their sexual reward </v>

878
00:43:04.341 --> 00:43:05.610
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them attracted to the smell of cat</v>

879
00:43:05.611 --> 00:43:06.340
<v Speaker 2>urine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

880
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:09.090
<v Speaker 2>So their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their testes swell and they're,</v>

881
00:43:09.091 --> 00:43:14.091
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're literally like horny little </v>

882
00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:14.091
<v Speaker 2>zombies running straight towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cats.</v>

883
00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:17.340
<v Speaker 2>It completely rewires their fear of cats</v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes out the window.</v>

884
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:22.610
<v Speaker 2>And the reason being is that the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that toxo plasma can reproduce is </v>

885
00:43:22.921 --> 00:43:24.630
<v Speaker 2>inside the cat's gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

886
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Which is just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of a twisted system and </v>

887
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:32.040
<v Speaker 2>how did this evolve over all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

888
00:43:32.041 --> 00:43:37.041
<v Speaker 2>like the gut biome and gut bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is so fascinating to me.</v>

889
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's an interesting way of looking at </v>

890
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:43.720
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know justin sonnenburg?</v>

891
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.920
<v Speaker 3>He's a microbiologist at stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really fast.</v>

892
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.820
<v Speaker 3>Interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>

893
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:53.990
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to Paraphrase this because I </v>

894
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.061
<v Speaker 3>won't get the quote exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wrote a book about the gut </v>

895
00:43:56.061 --> 00:43:59.211
<v Speaker 3>microbiome and he said something to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect of humans or are just the </v>

896
00:44:00.121 --> 00:44:05.121
<v Speaker 3>elaborate elaborate vessels for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>propagation of microorganisms probably </v>

897
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.390
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's basically saying that we're kind of</v>

898
00:44:12.391 --> 00:44:16.260
<v Speaker 3>the evolutionary vehicle or tool for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the microbes that live in our gut.</v>

899
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.120
<v Speaker 3>They've been around a lot longer than </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

900
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot longer.</v>

901
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.530
<v Speaker 3>They outnumber us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

902
00:44:22.531 --> 00:44:23.040
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

903
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:28.190
<v Speaker 3>the number of microbial cells in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body are more than the number of human </v>

904
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.971
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's lots of different ways to </v>

905
00:44:31.971 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 3>interpret,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think</v>

906
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.520
<v Speaker 1>at the very minimum you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to see how important that </v>

907
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.540
<v Speaker 1>microbial community is to our overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and also our behavior.</v>

908
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you really want to get creepy,</v>

909
00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.330
<v Speaker 1>think about how like categorically they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't vary individually,</v>

910
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.290
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're essentially the exact same thing</v>

911
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:53.530
<v Speaker 1>in mass numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting in the interest of the mass </v>

912
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.560
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then influencing us,</v>

913
00:44:55.561 --> 00:45:00.561
<v Speaker 1>which vary widely and our different </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions propagate them in different </v>

914
00:45:00.901 --> 00:45:02.400
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm freaking out.</v>

915
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:06.570
<v Speaker 1>It's especially weird too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think that all of that stuff,</v>

916
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.730
<v Speaker 1>all of those microorganisms that are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our gut,</v>

917
00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:12.030
<v Speaker 1>they're not actually in our body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not really part of us.</v>

918
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 1>They're just hanging out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

919
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:18.381
<v Speaker 1>think about a tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go through a tunnel under a </v>

920
00:45:18.381 --> 00:45:18.660
<v Speaker 1>river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in the river,</v>

921
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 1>woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just in a tunnel under the river.</v>

922
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:28.230
<v Speaker 1>And our gut is a hollow tube that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from our mouth to our anus,</v>

923
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.320
<v Speaker 1>intersects our body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everything inside the tube is </v>

924
00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:33.540
<v Speaker 1>technically outside of the body.</v>

925
00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:44.380
<v Speaker 1>So their influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're influencing us from inside the </v>

926
00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:44.540
<v Speaker 1>tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from inside of the tunnel.</v>

927
00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:47.870
<v Speaker 1>They're not really inside of our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're kind of running the show,</v>

928
00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:53.080
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really in us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a car inside the tunnel </v>

929
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.861
<v Speaker 1>that's controlling the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet jesus christ more freaking out,</v>

930
00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:02.150
<v Speaker 1>freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I thought about that.</v>

931
00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.030
<v Speaker 1>And the crazy thing is that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>affect.</v>

932
00:46:05.031 --> 00:46:06.530
<v Speaker 1>mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can affect,</v>

933
00:46:06.531 --> 00:46:08.320
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can affect,</v>

934
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ambition,</v>

935
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:14.760
<v Speaker 1>the way you behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a study on the way down here,</v>

936
00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:19.770
<v Speaker 1>and I did a feed of all the new research</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it showed that overgrowth of </v>

937
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:21.680
<v Speaker 1>bacteria in our small intestine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of our got,</v>

938
00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:26.120
<v Speaker 1>is associated with heart problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

939
00:46:26.121 --> 00:46:28.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't actually know why yet,</v>

940
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:30.410
<v Speaker 1>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

941
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:31.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

942
00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:36.340
<v Speaker 1>something going on and with the cars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tunnel is really tweaking the river </v>

943
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:36.710
<v Speaker 1>and just about every way you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

944
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:40.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not just about gut as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it affects every system in the body.</v>

945
00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:45.610
<v Speaker 1>So paul was saying that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that he worked with found during </v>

946
00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:49.721
<v Speaker 1>his residency that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate number of motorcycle </v>

947
00:46:49.721 --> 00:46:53.291
<v Speaker 1>accidents that were attributed to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were infected by toxoplasma because it </v>

948
00:46:53.291 --> 00:46:54.520
<v Speaker 1>made them more impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

949
00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I can change human behavior as Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

950
00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked about this last time,</v>

951
00:46:59.601 --> 00:47:04.601
<v Speaker 1>but the prevalent theory now I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What causes depression is that it's a </v>

952
00:47:04.601 --> 00:47:06.590
<v Speaker 1>disrupted gut microbiome that causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

953
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:12.200
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it leads to the production of what are </v>

954
00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:12.200
<v Speaker 1>called cytokines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're chemical messengers,</v>

955
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:15.770
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory cytokines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They traveled across the gut barrier.</v>

956
00:47:15.771 --> 00:47:20.771
<v Speaker 1>They go into the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel up into the brain and cross the </v>

957
00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:24.851
<v Speaker 1>blood brain barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they suppress the activity in </v>

958
00:47:24.851 --> 00:47:27.130
<v Speaker 1>the frontal cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which causes all the telltale signs and </v>

959
00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.250
<v Speaker 1>symptoms of depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what if depression,</v>

960
00:47:28.251 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>which we have thought about either</v>

961
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:30.840
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

962
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:35.290
<v Speaker 3>disruption of brain chemistry or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's purely situational,</v>

963
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:36.750
<v Speaker 3>is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

964
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a physiological causes as a driver.</v>

965
00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.690
<v Speaker 3>Now that's not to say that those </v>
<v Speaker 3>situational factors don't matter.</v>

966
00:47:43.691 --> 00:47:48.691
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be reductionist here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say depression is only caused by gut </v>

967
00:47:48.691 --> 00:47:49.600
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's ridiculous.</v>

968
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.240
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

969
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 3>the problem is the average person goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the doctor with depression.</v>

970
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:59.940
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come out of that office</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a prescription for an </v>

971
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.521
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not going to be any </v>

972
00:48:02.521 --> 00:48:04.471
<v Speaker 3>investigation into their got and whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have inflammation in the gut and </v>

973
00:48:04.471 --> 00:48:09.391
<v Speaker 3>intestinal permeability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not gonna be a referral to a </v>

974
00:48:09.391 --> 00:48:10.330
<v Speaker 3>gastroenterologist to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to check that out.</v>

975
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:11.470
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

976
00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:13.450
<v Speaker 3>one of the problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conventional system.</v>

977
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 3>The way it's set up is we had a doctor </v>
<v Speaker 3>for every different part of the body and</v>

978
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:19.660
<v Speaker 3>there's no quarterback.</v>

979
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:24.950
<v Speaker 3>It's really overseeing that whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ideally that would be the primary </v>

980
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:28.771
<v Speaker 3>care provider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because their appointments are 10 </v>

981
00:48:28.771 --> 00:48:28.771
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got 2,500</v>

982
00:48:28.771 --> 00:48:30.370
<v Speaker 3>patients on their roster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no time for that.</v>

983
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:35.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to find a doctor that's very </v>

984
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.471
<v Speaker 3>meticulous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's willing to go over your blood work </v>

985
00:48:37.471 --> 00:48:38.260
<v Speaker 3>for you and check out what your diet is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

986
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:42.130
<v Speaker 3>We'll take ours and wnl as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not looking.</v>

987
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.300
<v Speaker 3>So imagine a patient that goes into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor and they've got depression.</v>

988
00:48:46.301 --> 00:48:50.050
<v Speaker 3>Let's say they've got a eczema or </v>
<v Speaker 3>psoriasis.</v>

989
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:55.410
<v Speaker 3>They've got a digestive issues and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got a brain fog,</v>

990
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:02.040
<v Speaker 3>cognitive problems like a whole big </v>
<v Speaker 3>roster of symptoms and the and the </v>

991
00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.530
<v Speaker 3>primary care provider might give them an</v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressant for the depression.</v>

992
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.180
<v Speaker 3>They give them a steroid skin cream for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the skin problem.</v>

993
00:49:07.181 --> 00:49:07.900
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

994
00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:08.340
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

995
00:49:08.341 --> 00:49:10.240
<v Speaker 3>they leave with a handful of </v>
<v Speaker 3>medications.</v>

996
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:15.750
<v Speaker 3>But what if there was one thing that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>causing all these problems are one </v>

997
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:16.720
<v Speaker 3>underlying cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was leading to all that.</v>

998
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.280
<v Speaker 3>So just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

999
00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:23.320
<v Speaker 3>in this example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if that patient had gluten </v>

1000
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:23.440
<v Speaker 3>intolerance and they hadn't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly diagnosed?</v>

1001
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.920
<v Speaker 3>We know now from the research that </v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten intolerance doesn't just cause </v>

1002
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.380
<v Speaker 3>the gi distress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people get,</v>

1003
00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:31.480
<v Speaker 3>it also can cause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1004
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Speaker 3>it's associated with dermatitis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is eczema.</v>

1005
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.350
<v Speaker 3>It's associated with all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive and neurological problems.</v>

1006
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:43.710
<v Speaker 3>So a single food protein could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>leading to all of these different </v>

1007
00:49:44.711 --> 00:49:46.540
<v Speaker 3>symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the conventional system,</v>

1008
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.400
<v Speaker 3>they might go to the primary care </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor,</v>

1009
00:49:48.401 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 3>then they get a referral to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dermatologist,</v>

1010
00:49:50.201 --> 00:49:52.030
<v Speaker 3>they get a referral to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gastroenterologist,</v>

1011
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:55.090
<v Speaker 3>they maybe get a referral to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurologist or a psychiatrist.</v>

1012
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:58.720
<v Speaker 3>They're seeing all these separate people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to deal with all these separate symptoms</v>

1013
00:49:59.020 --> 00:49:59.420
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1014
00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 3>playing whack a mole with the symptoms.</v>

1015
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 3>They take one drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1016
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:06.910
<v Speaker 3>the antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then maybe the antidepressant causes</v>

1017
00:50:06.911 --> 00:50:09.550
<v Speaker 3>constipation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you go to the gastroenterologist</v>

1018
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:10.900
<v Speaker 3>and they get a drug for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1019
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:14.350
<v Speaker 3>a laxative for the constipation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then before,</v>

1020
00:50:14.351 --> 00:50:17.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just this incredibly complex web of</v>

1021
00:50:17.321 --> 00:50:22.321
<v Speaker 3>all these drug interactions and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the focus is on suppressing </v>

1022
00:50:22.321 --> 00:50:24.760
<v Speaker 3>these symptoms with different doctors </v>
<v Speaker 3>for different body parts.</v>

1023
00:50:24.761 --> 00:50:28.760
<v Speaker 3>When in this example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least it was something as simple as a</v>

1024
00:50:28.761 --> 00:50:33.761
<v Speaker 3>food protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be easily removed from the </v>

1025
00:50:33.761 --> 00:50:33.761
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not easily,</v>

1026
00:50:33.761 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten's in a lot of things.</v>

1027
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:40.241
<v Speaker 3>But I'm taken out and then all of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems which seemed like they were </v>

1028
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:45.251
<v Speaker 3>separate and disconnected go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's really the promise of </v>

1029
00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 3>functional medicine because instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at things,</v>

1030
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:51.800
<v Speaker 3>starting with the symptoms and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>working backwards,</v>

1031
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.750
<v Speaker 3>we're starting from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1032
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:55.620
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inside and,</v>

1033
00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.600
<v Speaker 3>and working out.</v>

1034
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1035
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:03.260
<v Speaker 3>an analogy I like to use is if you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a rock in your shoe and it's making your</v>

1036
00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:06.290
<v Speaker 3>foot hurt and you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the conventional system,</v>

1037
00:51:06.291 --> 00:51:08.360
<v Speaker 3>you'll end up with a diagnosis of foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>

1038
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Or actually we'll be fancier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1039
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:13.850
<v Speaker 3>there'll be like the latin name for foot</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pain or something.</v>

1040
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 3>It sounds more official and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you'll get a painkiller and the</v>

1041
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:20.170
<v Speaker 3>painkiller will help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1042
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:25.180
<v Speaker 3>it'll reduce the pain a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but obviously it makes a lot more sense </v>

1043
00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.300
<v Speaker 3>to just take your shoe off and dump out </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rock.</v>

1044
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:31.360
<v Speaker 3>ANd that's really what functional </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine is about now when it comes to </v>

1045
00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.811
<v Speaker 3>gluten intolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one that gets dIsmissed as it </v>

1046
00:51:34.811 --> 00:51:34.811
<v Speaker 3>sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds frivolous,</v>

1047
00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.160
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1048
00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:37.010
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden everyone's gluten </v>
<v Speaker 3>intolerant,</v>

1049
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:42.011
<v Speaker 3>like this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my belief is that there's varying </v>

1050
00:51:42.011 --> 00:51:45.320
<v Speaker 3>levels of this and that it's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have just dismissed,</v>

1051
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:50.560
<v Speaker 3>is a weird feeling that you get after </v>
<v Speaker 3>you eat gluten and that they're not </v>

1052
00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.311
<v Speaker 3>really in tune with the effect of </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation and that there's a real </v>

1053
00:51:54.311 --> 00:51:59.081
<v Speaker 3>difference between the we'd have today </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the we'd have say the early 19 </v>

1054
00:51:59.081 --> 00:51:59.081
<v Speaker 3>hundreds.</v>

1055
00:51:59.081 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 3>It's been maniPulated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there are a few reasons.</v>

1056
00:52:00.921 --> 00:52:04.280
<v Speaker 3>There's misunderstanding about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number one is that,</v>

1057
00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:08.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there up untIl recently has not been a,</v>

1058
00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:13.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an understanding of the difference </v>

1059
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.490
<v Speaker 3>between celiac disease and non celiac </v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten sensitivity.</v>

1060
00:52:13.491 --> 00:52:18.491
<v Speaker 3>So for a long time the idea was either </v>
<v Speaker 3>have celiac or you're not sensitive to </v>

1061
00:52:18.491 --> 00:52:18.890
<v Speaker 3>gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1062
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1063
00:52:20.451 --> 00:52:22.610
<v Speaker 3>There's no gray area that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous.</v>

1064
00:52:22.611 --> 00:52:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who still believes that has not </v>
<v Speaker 3>even done the most cursory search of the</v>

1065
00:52:27.201 --> 00:52:32.201
<v Speaker 3>scientific literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go in and anyone who's watching </v>

1066
00:52:32.201 --> 00:52:33.680
<v Speaker 3>who's listening or watching can go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pub med.gov,</v>

1067
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:35.810
<v Speaker 3>pub,</v>
<v Speaker 3>med.gov</v>

1068
00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.630
<v Speaker 3>in the search field type,</v>
<v Speaker 3>non celiac,</v>

1069
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:42.890
<v Speaker 3>gluten sensitivity or non-celiac wheat </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity and tell me how many results</v>

1070
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:44.060
<v Speaker 3>come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

1071
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:46.820
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1072
00:52:46.821 --> 00:52:50.300
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to be linking and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes to the second point.</v>

1073
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.600
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be linking not just to gut</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems and diarrhea.</v>

1074
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:58.601
<v Speaker 3>It's going to link to all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different conditions from depression to </v>

1075
00:52:58.601 --> 00:53:01.370
<v Speaker 3>anxiety to heart issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hormone imbalance,</v>

1076
00:53:01.371 --> 00:53:04.190
<v Speaker 3>to a cognitive problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

1077
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:09.520
<v Speaker 3>So that's the second problem is </v>
<v Speaker 3>historically how many?</v>

1078
00:53:09.561 --> 00:53:14.561
<v Speaker 3>Six hundred and 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus and I and and there's lots of </v>

1079
00:53:14.561 --> 00:53:16.460
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you use some different terminology,</v>

1080
00:53:16.461 --> 00:53:20.060
<v Speaker 3>you can find more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with celiac disease,</v>

1081
00:53:20.061 --> 00:53:25.061
<v Speaker 3>the initial idea was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just causes diarrhea and severe </v>

1082
00:53:25.061 --> 00:53:29.501
<v Speaker 3>diarrhea and cramping and so the </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumption was that if you don't have </v>

1083
00:53:29.501 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 3>severe diarrhea and cramping when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat gluten,</v>

1084
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 3>you don't have celiac and you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>any other kinds of gluten intolerance,</v>

1085
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.360
<v Speaker 3>but we now know that I'm there with </v>
<v Speaker 3>celiac.</v>

1086
00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:44.850
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there are forums called atypical or </v>

1087
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:45.750
<v Speaker 3>silent celiac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are forms that do not present with</v>

1088
00:53:45.751 --> 00:53:50.751
<v Speaker 3>the typical got presentation and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of atypical celiac cases out.</v>

1089
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's much higher than the number of </v>

1090
00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.070
<v Speaker 3>typical ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a patient goes to the doctor,</v>

1091
00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:00.890
<v Speaker 3>they're having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1092
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>headaches,</v>

1093
00:54:02.251 --> 00:54:05.910
<v Speaker 3>they're having motor problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're having a,</v>

1094
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of other issues.</v>

1095
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:13.220
<v Speaker 3>The doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they think that celiac is only about </v>

1096
00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:16.611
<v Speaker 3>gut issues and not even think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>testing that patient for gluten </v>

1097
00:54:16.611 --> 00:54:17.280
<v Speaker 3>intolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of motor issues would you get?</v>

1098
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

1099
00:54:18.311 --> 00:54:20.280
<v Speaker 3>there was something called a attacks </v>
<v Speaker 3>sia,</v>

1100
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:24.060
<v Speaker 3>which is a form of paralysis that can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>caused by gluten sensitivity.</v>

1101
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get paralyzed from the kids.</v>

1102
00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:28.670
<v Speaker 3>It's called gluten associated attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ia,</v>

1103
00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:33.860
<v Speaker 3>jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is for people who are non </v>

1104
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:33.860
<v Speaker 3>celiac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.720
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the second problem is,</v>

1106
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:39.570
<v Speaker 3>is again w and l we're not looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the patients go to the doctor,</v>

1107
00:54:39.571 --> 00:54:41.670
<v Speaker 3>they have all these weird kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>complaints,</v>

1108
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.950
<v Speaker 3>the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have gut issues.</v>

1109
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:48.030
<v Speaker 3>So the doctor then rules out celiac or </v>
<v Speaker 3>non celiac,</v>

1110
00:54:48.031 --> 00:54:53.031
<v Speaker 3>gluten sensitivity because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet know that it can manifest in all </v>

1111
00:54:53.031 --> 00:54:54.030
<v Speaker 3>these different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how is this happening?</v>

1112
00:54:54.031 --> 00:54:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Is that the tolerance that you have for </v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten,</v>

1113
00:54:57.091 --> 00:55:02.091
<v Speaker 3>when you consume that gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gluten goes into the gut and </v>

1114
00:55:02.091 --> 00:55:02.850
<v Speaker 3>interacts with your gut biome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what's the.</v>

1115
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.000
<v Speaker 3>What's the mechanism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two different mechanisms and </v>

1116
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.221
<v Speaker 3>celiac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an autoimmune mechanism where </v>

1117
00:55:10.221 --> 00:55:12.381
<v Speaker 3>the proteins in gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body creates antibodies towards </v>

1118
00:55:12.381 --> 00:55:16.701
<v Speaker 3>those proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also there's like a bystander effect</v>

1119
00:55:17.311 --> 00:55:22.311
<v Speaker 3>where certain tissues in the body that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have similar protein structures to </v>

1120
00:55:22.311 --> 00:55:24.120
<v Speaker 3>gluten get attacked as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certain enzymes,</v>

1121
00:55:24.121 --> 00:55:27.680
<v Speaker 3>trans glutamates to transglutaminase is </v>
<v Speaker 3>three in trans contaminates,</v>

1122
00:55:27.681 --> 00:55:30.060
<v Speaker 3>six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's the thing you knoW,</v>

1123
00:55:30.061 --> 00:55:31.680
<v Speaker 3>related to what we were just talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1124
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.550
<v Speaker 3>transglutaminase two is is is typically </v>
<v Speaker 3>found in the gut.</v>

1125
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:40.700
<v Speaker 3>So that's why a lot of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>celiac have these gut issues is because </v>

1126
00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.230
<v Speaker 3>their body is actually attacking the gut</v>
<v Speaker 3>tissue and breaking it down.</v>

1127
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:46.990
<v Speaker 3>It's an autoimmune reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now we know that trend there.</v>

1128
00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:50.940
<v Speaker 3>That same autoimmune reaction can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>directed at transcript tammany's three,</v>

1129
00:55:50.941 --> 00:55:55.941
<v Speaker 3>which is primarily in the skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why something like 30 percent </v>

1130
00:55:55.941 --> 00:55:59.901
<v Speaker 3>of people with celiac also have eczema </v>
<v Speaker 3>and other skin problems and trans </v>

1131
00:55:59.901 --> 00:56:02.640
<v Speaker 3>contaminated six is in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

1132
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:08.180
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a person who has antibody production </v>

1133
00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:08.910
<v Speaker 3>against trans contaminated sixth eats </v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten,</v>

1134
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.810
<v Speaker 3>their body attacks their brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1135
00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:16.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's why it breaks down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>enzyme,</v>

1136
00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.620
<v Speaker 3>which has played a number of important </v>
<v Speaker 3>roLes in the brain.</v>

1137
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:23.530
<v Speaker 3>And so this is why celiac and also non </v>
<v Speaker 3>celiac,</v>

1138
00:56:23.531 --> 00:56:28.531
<v Speaker 3>gluten sensitivity is associated with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole bunch of different cognitive </v>

1139
00:56:28.531 --> 00:56:30.940
<v Speaker 3>issues like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also actual motor problems.</v>

1140
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:33.070
<v Speaker 3>I a taxi because it's attacking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

1141
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:38.770
<v Speaker 3>The immune system's attacking the brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that leads to some potentially very </v>

1142
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:40.090
<v Speaker 3>serious problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did they start to alter wheat?</v>

1143
00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Like w what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what year do you know?</v>

1144
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:47.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know and I do think that is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue because I've,</v>

1145
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people that have gone to</v>
<v Speaker 3>europe,</v>

1146
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:50.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat,</v>

1147
00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:52.450
<v Speaker 3>we eat here and they go to europe and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can eat.</v>

1148
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:53.880
<v Speaker 3>We.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:56:55.130 --> 00:57:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there are some other things </v>

1150
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:02.491
<v Speaker 3>that are actually more meaningful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant and this leads me to the </v>

1151
00:57:02.491 --> 00:57:03.040
<v Speaker 3>third reason why I think we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>underestimated,</v>

1152
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:08.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten sensitivity and why people don't </v>

1153
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.950
<v Speaker 3>understand how significant it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1154
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:11.980
<v Speaker 3>we're not living in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a vacuum,</v>

1155
00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:17.070
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you've got a person who is </v>

1156
00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:21.720
<v Speaker 3>like a hunter gatherer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been living in a pristine </v>

1157
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:21.720
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1158
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.580
<v Speaker 3>they eat all nutrient dense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1159
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.390
<v Speaker 3>good food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their gut microbiome is thriving because</v>

1160
00:57:25.391 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 3>they'd been eating plenty of fermentable</v>
<v Speaker 3>fiber and you know,</v>

1161
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:32.200
<v Speaker 3>probiotic type of foods and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>super healthy.</v>

1162
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:36.070
<v Speaker 3>If that person gets exposed to gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might not have any problem.</v>

1163
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.750
<v Speaker 3>But then you take a person who is living</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the modern industrialized world,</v>

1164
00:57:40.751 --> 00:57:43.510
<v Speaker 3>they're sleeping five hours a night </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1165
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.450
<v Speaker 3>They've taken antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1166
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:48.670
<v Speaker 3>30 but 30 courses of antibiotics by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time they're an adult,</v>

1167
00:57:48.671 --> 00:57:50.860
<v Speaker 3>which is not an exaggeration that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1168
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the exact number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's extremely high that the average</v>

1169
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:58.330
<v Speaker 3>number of courses of antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were born by c section.</v>

1170
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:03.780
<v Speaker 3>They eat a crappy diet with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>processed and refined foods and they're </v>

1171
00:58:04.151 --> 00:58:05.710
<v Speaker 3>sedentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not exercising,</v>

1172
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:10.711
<v Speaker 3>so this person is in really bad shape </v>
<v Speaker 3>and their immune system seriously </v>

1173
00:58:10.711 --> 00:58:14.281
<v Speaker 3>dysregulated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when they get exposed to </v>

1174
00:58:14.281 --> 00:58:17.131
<v Speaker 3>gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which might otherwise be a harmless </v>

1175
00:58:17.131 --> 00:58:17.440
<v Speaker 3>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it causes problems.</v>

1176
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:22.920
<v Speaker 3>So I think the reason that more people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are intolerant of gluten and intolerant </v>

1177
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:27.691
<v Speaker 3>of other foods now is it's not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the foods have changed just </v>

1178
00:58:27.691 --> 00:58:31.420
<v Speaker 3>because we've changed is because we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>become compromised.</v>

1179
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:32.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should.</v>

1180
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 3>Human beings should be resilient and </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to tolerate these kinds of,</v>

1181
00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>food proteins.</v>

1182
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:43.890
<v Speaker 3>But when our immune system breaks down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about the gut as a barrier </v>

1183
00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:45.940
<v Speaker 3>system where everything that's inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guide is outside the body.</v>

1184
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:51.870
<v Speaker 3>It's important to understand like in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the purpose of the gut is to serve </v>

1185
00:58:52.001 --> 00:58:57.001
<v Speaker 3>as a selective barrier that determines </v>
<v Speaker 3>what gets in and what stays out.</v>

1186
00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Because everything we eat is either </v>
<v Speaker 3>absorbed or eliminated as waste.</v>

1187
00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:07.750
<v Speaker 3>And if that barrier becomes permeable in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nonselective way,</v>

1188
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:13.080
<v Speaker 3>meaning it loses the ability to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate decisions about what gets in</v>

1189
00:59:15.161 --> 00:59:17.230
<v Speaker 3>and out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then food proteins,</v>

1190
00:59:17.231 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 3>they would otherwise be benign and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1191
00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be broken down into</v>

1192
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:27.010
<v Speaker 1>smaller particles and those small </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles get absorbed and don't cause </v>

1193
00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:31.421
<v Speaker 1>any problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The larger food proteins get absorbed </v>

1194
00:59:31.421 --> 00:59:34.811
<v Speaker 1>before they're broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that initiates an immune </v>

1195
00:59:34.811 --> 00:59:35.300
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wreaks havoc.</v>

1196
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if someone has a healthy gut than the</v>

1197
00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:43.190
<v Speaker 1>insult of some sort of a gluten protein </v>
<v Speaker 1>being introduced into their,</v>

1198
00:59:43.191 --> 00:59:48.191
<v Speaker 1>god's not going to be as big of a deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if someone is just drinking gatorade </v>

1199
00:59:48.191 --> 00:59:48.940
<v Speaker 1>all day and eat and cook zygosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1200
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:51.620
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like any other ecosystem.</v>

1201
00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:56.621
<v Speaker 1>So if you think of like an ecosystem </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really healthy and you introduce </v>

1202
00:59:56.621 --> 00:59:59.040
<v Speaker 1>a predator like a predator or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

1203
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.600
<v Speaker 1>something else that could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could potentially throw it out of </v>

1204
01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.301
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't go out of balance because the </v>

1205
01:00:07.301 --> 01:00:07.340
<v Speaker 1>whole ecosystem is working together to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep that in check.</v>

1206
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1207
01:00:09.261 --> 01:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>you hear about like the small islands </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they introduced a particular,</v>

1208
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a predator or prey species that then </v>

1209
01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>just because the ecosystem of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>island is fragile,</v>

1210
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>you get a huge proliferation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1211
01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.510
<v Speaker 1>where it's just all of a sudden there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but deer on the island and until</v>

1212
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:29.630
<v Speaker 1>they start dying because of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>imbalance,</v>

1213
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it starts all over again.</v>

1214
01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.090
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that in Hawaii,</v>

1215
01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>on lanai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1216
01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>They're overrun With a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an animal called the axis deer.</v>

1217
01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.500
<v Speaker 1>They're all over the place and for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>same reason,</v>

1218
01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:45.740
<v Speaker 1>and we have the same phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if we have,</v>

1219
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.160
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone's got microbiome is severely </v>

1220
01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>disrupted especially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that started as a kid,</v>

1221
01:00:51.331 --> 01:00:53.570
<v Speaker 1>then they start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they developed gluten intolerance,</v>

1222
01:00:53.571 --> 01:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>they develop and tolerance to corn and </v>
<v Speaker 1>soy and dairy and allergy.</v>

1223
01:00:57.291 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>This is why allergies are on the rise in</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids is my belief.</v>

1224
01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not because there's some weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1225
01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden someone introduced some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of poison that is causing kids to </v>

1226
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.180
<v Speaker 1>be more allergic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because of immune dysregulation.</v>

1227
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's happening because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep issue,</v>

1228
01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>the food and all of the other aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern lifestyle.</v>

1229
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:22.030
<v Speaker 1>So what's the best approach for someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to be healthier if they want </v>

1230
01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:26.621
<v Speaker 1>to take control of their gut biome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it just consuming a lot of very </v>

1231
01:01:26.621 --> 01:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>strong probiotic foods?</v>

1232
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.620
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is to just eat real </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

1233
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1234
01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I really liked boil it down to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>three words,</v>

1235
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:39.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat real food and by real I mean not </v>

1236
01:01:39.191 --> 01:01:39.191
<v Speaker 1>stuff that comes in a bag or a box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1237
01:01:39.191 --> 01:01:43.810
<v Speaker 1>the less processed and refined the </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and that either came out of the </v>

1238
01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:44.510
<v Speaker 1>ground or lives on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1239
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.130
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1240
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tend to get really,</v>

1241
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:53.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worked up about all the differences </v>

1242
01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:53.830
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1243
01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>there's [inaudible] you could say eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>real food and do vegan.</v>

1244
01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:59.510
<v Speaker 1>You could say real food and do paleo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's all great.</v>

1245
01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>But I really actually believe that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just ate real food of any kind,</v>

1246
01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>we'd be in a totally different place </v>
<v Speaker 1>than we are now.</v>

1247
01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.430
<v Speaker 1>individual health issues would be worked</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the variations of those dials.</v>

1248
01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the fine tweaking comes.</v>

1249
01:02:12.891 --> 01:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>But we didn't get to this point because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1250
01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's eating real food and </v>

1251
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>everyone's doing or everyone's doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>paleo.</v>

1252
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>We got to this point because people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating trash essentially.</v>

1253
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:29.270
<v Speaker 1>So one of the most key things with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gut microbiome to understand is that our</v>

1254
01:02:29.581 --> 01:02:34.581
<v Speaker 1>healthy gut bacteria thrive on what are </v>
<v Speaker 1>called fermentable carbohydrates or </v>

1255
01:02:34.581 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>justin sonnenburg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we talked about before,</v>

1256
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>he calls them microbiotic accessible </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates.</v>

1257
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>These are fancy terms that just mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiber.</v>

1258
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.830
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1259
01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:49.900
<v Speaker 1>what distingUished is fiber is that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't break it down and turn it into </v>

1260
01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.961
<v Speaker 1>glucose or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other molecules that we can absorb and </v>

1261
01:02:53.961 --> 01:02:56.140
<v Speaker 1>use for our own energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stays in the gut to,</v>

1262
01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:01.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way to the colon and then the </v>

1263
01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.741
<v Speaker 1>bacteria eat that fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fiber is food for our beneficial gut </v>

1264
01:03:03.741 --> 01:03:05.700
<v Speaker 1>bacteria and that's what makes them </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrive.</v>

1265
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:08.130
<v Speaker 1>so that's fascinating because most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think of fiber,</v>

1266
01:03:08.131 --> 01:03:10.560
<v Speaker 1>they think of it almost as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a laxative.</v>

1267
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1268
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it was something that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean out their bowels.</v>

1269
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:17.610
<v Speaker 1>So not all fiber is fermentable by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gut bacteria.</v>

1270
01:03:17.611 --> 01:03:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Some fiber just has that mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

1271
01:03:20.281 --> 01:03:21.110
<v Speaker 1>It's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1272
01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 1>pushing things through the bowels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas other fiber can actually be used</v>

1273
01:03:25.081 --> 01:03:28.370
<v Speaker 1>as food by your gut bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that fiber's probably more bats.</v>

1274
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.350
<v Speaker 1>The more beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking like sauerkraut,</v>

1275
01:03:31.351 --> 01:03:33.080
<v Speaker 1>kimchi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

1276
01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's soLuble fiber that are present </v>

1277
01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of fruits and vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1278
01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:43.220
<v Speaker 1>you've got a non starch polysaccharides </v>
<v Speaker 1>like inulin and fos and things like that</v>

1279
01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:45.930
<v Speaker 1>that are in like onions and garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerusalem,</v>

1280
01:03:45.931 --> 01:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>artichokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leeks,</v>

1281
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.660
<v Speaker 1>umm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got resistant starch,</v>

1282
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:56.661
<v Speaker 1>which is actually not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in a lot of starchy plants that </v>

1283
01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:56.661
<v Speaker 1>we used to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1284
01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:58.590
<v Speaker 1>way back in paleolithic era.</v>

1285
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And some traditional hunter gatherers </v>
<v Speaker 1>still do,</v>

1286
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.920
<v Speaker 1>but a resistant starch these days can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>found in certain types of starches that </v>

1287
01:04:08.191 --> 01:04:11.160
<v Speaker 1>have been cooked and cooled potatoes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>lentils.</v>

1288
01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people now are supplementing with </v>

1289
01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.280
<v Speaker 1>resistance starch or they're eating a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like green unripe,</v>

1290
01:04:17.281 --> 01:04:19.470
<v Speaker 1>bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unripe plantations,</v>

1291
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are those?</v>

1292
01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Are those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that because they're unripe it's the </v>

1293
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.570
<v Speaker 1>starches resistant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As they ripen the starch,</v>

1294
01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:31.140
<v Speaker 1>it becomes just regular starch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1295
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:36.650
<v Speaker 1>so cook those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you wanted to cook a green </v>

1296
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:40.541
<v Speaker 1>plantain use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can slice them and then dehydrate </v>

1297
01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:43.011
<v Speaker 1>them and you make them into chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can even buy plantain chips now at </v>

1298
01:04:43.011 --> 01:04:44.460
<v Speaker 1>some health food stores by plantain </v>
<v Speaker 1>chips.</v>

1299
01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:46.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting dehydrated,</v>

1300
01:04:46.051 --> 01:04:49.110
<v Speaker 1>getting some resistant starch there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1301
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>or you can bake a white potato for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

1302
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>and tHen let it cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AnD that cooLing processes what forms of</v>

1303
01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.680
<v Speaker 1>resistant starch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what's really interesting.</v>

1304
01:04:58.681 --> 01:05:03.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people think of potatoes is </v>

1305
01:05:03.681 --> 01:05:05.361
<v Speaker 1>something that would spike their blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar because they have a lot of </v>

1306
01:05:05.361 --> 01:05:06.600
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you cook and cooled a potato,</v>

1307
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:09.720
<v Speaker 1>it won't have that effect because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance starts,</v>

1308
01:05:09.721 --> 01:05:12.060
<v Speaker 1>you can't absorb and break that into </v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose.</v>

1309
01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1310
01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:16.350
<v Speaker 1>so when you cool a potato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better for you?</v>

1311
01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's</v>

1312
01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:23.060
<v Speaker 3>like a cold potato salad would actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>not have the same effect on your blood </v>

1313
01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:24.850
<v Speaker 3>sugar is eating a warm baked potato that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just cooked.</v>

1314
01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:29.440
<v Speaker 3>In fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

1315
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard of the potato?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heck no.</v>

1316
01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:37.380
<v Speaker 3>This is probabLy the most effective diet</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've ever come across for weight </v>

1317
01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:41.380
<v Speaker 3>loss and this is what I use in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>practice with patients when nothing else</v>

1318
01:05:41.381 --> 01:05:46.381
<v Speaker 3>has worked or if someone's super </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivated and just wants to make </v>

1319
01:05:46.381 --> 01:05:49.621
<v Speaker 3>progress quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy named tim steele introduced me to </v>

1320
01:05:49.621 --> 01:05:54.451
<v Speaker 3>this and it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has sent me some books that he found </v>

1321
01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.650
<v Speaker 3>in the 1880 [inaudible] that referenced </v>
<v Speaker 3>this diet.</v>

1322
01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:01.740
<v Speaker 3>So this is oLD schooL and what you do is</v>
<v Speaker 3>you basically eat nothing but potatoes </v>

1323
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:06.160
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't.</v>

1324
01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:10.090
<v Speaker 3>They're plain potatoes so you can roast </v>
<v Speaker 3>them or boil them,</v>

1325
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:11.110
<v Speaker 3>but you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1326
01:06:11.111 --> 01:06:12.970
<v Speaker 3>in the hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hardest core version.</v>

1327
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:17.970
<v Speaker 3>You don't even add salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just plain baked potato or boiled </v>

1328
01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:20.580
<v Speaker 3>potato.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly no butter chives,</v>

1329
01:06:20.581 --> 01:06:22.130
<v Speaker 3>sour cream bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1330
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:25.720
<v Speaker 3>because that increases the reward value </v>
<v Speaker 3>as we were talking about earlier.</v>

1331
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:29.610
<v Speaker 3>The more variety there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more rewarding of food is okay.</v>

1332
01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.010
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1333
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.600
<v Speaker 3>you just eat potatoes and there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>different variations or different ways </v>

1334
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:41.221
<v Speaker 3>of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do it for maybe just three days </v>

1335
01:06:41.221 --> 01:06:41.221
<v Speaker 3>a week and then you can do your normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>

1336
01:06:41.221 --> 01:06:42.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other four days a week,</v>

1337
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:47.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tim talks about a variation called </v>

1338
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:49.921
<v Speaker 3>potatoes by day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means you just eat potatoes for </v>

1339
01:06:49.921 --> 01:06:50.320
<v Speaker 3>breakfast and for lunch and then you eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>a normal dinner.</v>

1340
01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.860
<v Speaker 3>But I'm in my clinic and from tim's </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience working with a lot of people,</v>

1341
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.110
<v Speaker 3>most people will lose an average of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>half pound a day.</v>

1342
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:02.420
<v Speaker 3>And I think there are two there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1343
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:05.080
<v Speaker 3>there are a few things happening here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and why it works.</v>

1344
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.450
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1345
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:12.750
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally playing towards these </v>

1346
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.750
<v Speaker 3>mechanisms that we talked about before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1347
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.850
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reward,</v>

1348
01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.880
<v Speaker 3>the reward value food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is called the key donek system </v>

1349
01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.300
<v Speaker 3>that drives our food craving and </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferences.</v>

1350
01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:20.980
<v Speaker 3>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do a thought experiment.</v>

1351
01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:26.490
<v Speaker 3>If you have two plates of food and on </v>
<v Speaker 3>one plate you have a steamed potato with</v>

1352
01:07:27.221 --> 01:07:32.221
<v Speaker 3>no salt or butter or fat of any kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on this plate on the right you got a</v>

1353
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 3>bag of potato chips or just a plate of </v>
<v Speaker 3>potato chips.</v>

1354
01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Which one are you going to eat less of?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it goes without saying,</v>

1355
01:07:39.701 --> 01:07:41.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're only going to eat the potato when</v>

1356
01:07:41.801 --> 01:07:46.801
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're hungry and you're not going </v>

1357
01:07:46.801 --> 01:07:46.870
<v Speaker 3>to eat probably a bite more than you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>hungry for.</v>

1358
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the potato chips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all bets are off.</v>

1359
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for most people.</v>

1360
01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.680
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens is when you do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>potato diet,</v>

1361
01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:57.040
<v Speaker 3>you get a spontaneous calorie reduction </v>
<v Speaker 3>and by spontaneous,</v>

1362
01:07:57.041 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean not voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not setting out to say,</v>

1363
01:08:01.091 --> 01:08:01.830
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm only gonna.</v>

1364
01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:06.850
<v Speaker 3>Eat a thousand calories today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying I'm going to eat as many </v>

1365
01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:10.130
<v Speaker 3>potatoes as I want to satiate my hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just by definition,</v>

1366
01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:12.550
<v Speaker 3>because of how our brain works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're only going to eat.</v>

1367
01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:15.620
<v Speaker 3>You're going to eat less than you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>typically.</v>

1368
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:19.160
<v Speaker 1>so that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a reduction in calorie intake.</v>

1369
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is that when the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you cook the potato,</v>

1370
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they do this diet is they'll </v>

1371
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.761
<v Speaker 1>just cook like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the potatoes that they need for the </v>

1372
01:08:30.761 --> 01:08:34.480
<v Speaker 1>week on sunday to make it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I have to cook the potato every </v>

1373
01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.441
<v Speaker 1>time they sit down to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they cooked the potatoes and then </v>

1374
01:08:38.441 --> 01:08:40.520
<v Speaker 1>they let them cool and so then each time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can still hit them back up,</v>

1375
01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:41.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1376
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>but they now have a lot of resistant </v>
<v Speaker 1>starch.</v>

1377
01:08:45.141 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Even if you heat them back up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you hit them back up.</v>

1378
01:08:47.571 --> 01:08:52.571
<v Speaker 1>And here's what's really cool about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you heat them up and cooled them </v>

1379
01:08:52.571 --> 01:08:55.870
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each cooling cycle forms more resistant </v>

1380
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:56.390
<v Speaker 1>starch so that by the end of the week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've,</v>

1381
01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.420
<v Speaker 1>if you're heating all the potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backup and then cooling them again,</v>

1382
01:08:59.421 --> 01:09:03.080
<v Speaker 1>each time you're going to have a potato </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's mostly resistant starch,</v>

1383
01:09:03.081 --> 01:09:08.081
<v Speaker 1>which means it will have zero impact on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your blood sugar and it will be like a </v>

1384
01:09:08.081 --> 01:09:09.740
<v Speaker 1>feast for your beneficial gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>microbiome.</v>

1385
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's another reason this diet </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably works.</v>

1386
01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:14.630
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1387
01:09:14.631 --> 01:09:19.631
<v Speaker 1>all about the studies correlating </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupted gut microbiome with obesity </v>

1388
01:09:19.631 --> 01:09:21.590
<v Speaker 1>and diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're basically,</v>

1389
01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:26.980
<v Speaker 1>the way I tell patients is you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're basically going on an all fiber </v>

1390
01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:30.190
<v Speaker 1>diet and you'll eat the skin too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can eat the skin usually discussion,</v>

1391
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:30.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1392
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:36.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin has vitamins in it so people will </v>

1393
01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:37.100
<v Speaker 1>lose up to a half a pound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1394
01:09:37.101 --> 01:09:40.850
<v Speaker 1>between a quarter and a half a pound a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day that they're on the potato diet.</v>

1395
01:09:40.851 --> 01:09:42.260
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

1396
01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1397
01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:48.790
<v Speaker 1>you decide I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to lose one and a half pounds a </v>

1398
01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:51.821
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do it for three days a week and you </v>

1399
01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:53.120
<v Speaker 1>do that for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then by the end of that six month period</v>

1400
01:09:53.121 --> 01:09:54.980
<v Speaker 1>you've lost a pretty significant amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of weight.</v>

1401
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:57.440
<v Speaker 1>If you can keep that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it up,</v>

1402
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:58.450
<v Speaker 1>the blend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the it.</v>

1403
01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:03.530
<v Speaker 1>That's another fascinating aspect about </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet is like how much of our life we </v>

1404
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.190
<v Speaker 1>were willing to forego health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>

1405
01:10:07.191 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 1>all these different things just for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple mouth pleasure for a few moments.</v>

1406
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you think about a pizza that </v>

1407
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:16.190
<v Speaker 1>you would eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how long you need it for?</v>

1408
01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:21.191
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes out of a 24 hour day and </v>

1409
01:10:21.191 --> 01:10:21.770
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel like shit for at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least an hour or two afterwards.</v>

1410
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try to do anything like physical,</v>

1411
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:30.340
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be more than two hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>before finally if you really want to go </v>

1412
01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.310
<v Speaker 1>to the gym or you want to go for a run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1413
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.520
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I think everyone should </v>

1414
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:36.520
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think food should be pleasurable and I</v>

1415
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:36.520
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1416
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.730
<v Speaker 1>the way I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1417
01:10:37.731 --> 01:10:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I love the foods that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1418
01:10:39.621 --> 01:10:41.780
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1419
01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:45.770
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I say I don't suggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anyone wants to start here,</v>

1420
01:10:45.771 --> 01:10:47.600
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's interesting because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets it.</v>

1421
01:10:47.601 --> 01:10:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Some of what we've already been talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how,</v>

1422
01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:55.240
<v Speaker 1>why the modern food environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributes to obesity and how using </v>

1423
01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.700
<v Speaker 1>that knowledge and understanding of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>triggers us to eat,</v>

1424
01:10:58.701 --> 01:11:02.090
<v Speaker 1>we can turn that around and use it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our favor.</v>

1425
01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:07.360
<v Speaker 1>So another strategy that's similar is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just eat that but not quite as extreme </v>

1426
01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.990
<v Speaker 1>as jesus eat the same thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast,</v>

1427
01:11:08.991 --> 01:11:11.510
<v Speaker 1>lunch and dinner for like two or three </v>
<v Speaker 1>days in a week.</v>

1428
01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.520
<v Speaker 1>So you get bored with it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1429
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.790
<v Speaker 1>That seems like all mental tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone would tell you,</v>

1430
01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:21.020
<v Speaker 1>like someone like jocko say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just suck it up and being on there,</v>

1431
01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:26.180
<v Speaker 1>it's using our understanding of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our biology and our in our behavioral </v>

1432
01:11:26.551 --> 01:11:31.551
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to combat the way that the modern food </v>

1433
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:34.680
<v Speaker 1>environment is working against us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about like pre,</v>

1434
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:39.870
<v Speaker 1>pre planned meal programs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of companies that </v>

1435
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:41.310
<v Speaker 1>sell a prepackaged meal delivery </v>
<v Speaker 1>portioned.</v>

1436
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad way.</v>

1437
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:48.110
<v Speaker 1>I think those can play a role too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's kind of a set and forget </v>

1438
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:52.100
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what the portion size </v>

1439
01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:52.100
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

1440
01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1441
01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.880
<v Speaker 1>there's another strategy that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple that's been shown to contribute </v>

1442
01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:55.880
<v Speaker 1>to weight loss and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

1443
01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.660
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it plays to the same mechanisms which is</v>

1444
01:11:57.661 --> 01:12:00.600
<v Speaker 1>to get smaller plates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1445
01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.150
<v Speaker 1>a lot you go to target and you buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>plates like this big,</v>

1446
01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:08.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it don't even fit in some of the </v>

1447
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.570
<v Speaker 1>dishwashers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1448
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't even think it's just </v>

1449
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:13.920
<v Speaker 1>something you wouldn't even think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have a tendency to fill that </v>

1450
01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:13.920
<v Speaker 1>plate up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1451
01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.170
<v Speaker 1>And just for shooting a smaller plate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any eating office,</v>

1452
01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:18.480
<v Speaker 1>smaller plates has been shown to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful impact on weight loss.</v>

1453
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you ever go to a buffet,</v>

1454
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:23.790
<v Speaker 1>like when buffet always take some </v>
<v Speaker 1>obligation to,</v>

1455
01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:28.860
<v Speaker 1>to get your money's worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gorge yourself bizarre combinations</v>

1456
01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:32.690
<v Speaker 1>of food that you would never put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in any other context.</v>

1457
01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:34.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's all there.</v>

1458
01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.420
<v Speaker 1>it's variety is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem.</v>

1459
01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Some people say is like the antichrist </v>
<v Speaker 1>for our,</v>

1460
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:44.160
<v Speaker 1>the way our brain works with food </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's variety.</v>

1461
01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:46.800
<v Speaker 1>It's all like highly rewarding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1462
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:51.860
<v Speaker 1>palatable foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the absolute worst possible </v>

1463
01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:51.860
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about it,</v>

1464
01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:54.510
<v Speaker 1>our entire food environment is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a buffet.</v>

1465
01:12:55.020 --> 01:13:00.020
<v Speaker 1>You can go into any store at any time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get any kind of food to trigger any </v>

1466
01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:00.860
<v Speaker 1>of those cravings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1467
01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you supplement with any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>probiotics outside of regular food?</v>

1468
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will occasionally take probiotics.</v>

1469
01:13:08.641 --> 01:13:13.641
<v Speaker 1>I mostly try to get it through fermented</v>
<v Speaker 1>foods because I think that's probably.</v>

1470
01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:16.500
<v Speaker 1>What do you choose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sauerkraut is a great one.</v>

1471
01:13:16.501 --> 01:13:21.501
<v Speaker 1>Kimchi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do find with full fat fermented dairy </v>

1472
01:13:21.501 --> 01:13:24.951
<v Speaker 1>like kefir or yogurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we make our own yogurt for a </v>

1473
01:13:24.951 --> 01:13:28.200
<v Speaker 1>minute longer so it has more microbes </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat covas is a lesser known.</v>

1474
01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a beverage comes from Russia in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that area.</v>

1475
01:13:31.111 --> 01:13:34.380
<v Speaker 1>It's fermented beets and made into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>juice gust.</v>

1476
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:34.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1477
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:36.580
<v Speaker 1>if you'd like some of these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>ferments,</v>

1478
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1479
01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm just joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like kimchi and most people think it's</v>

1480
01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.670
<v Speaker 1>file.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1481
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Everyone in my house thinks it's vile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the beak of us is good and it's </v>

1482
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:50.030
<v Speaker 1>beats are super nutrient dense so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fermentation brings out even </v>

1483
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:51.620
<v Speaker 1>more nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a super food beverage.</v>

1484
01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Fermentation brings more nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1485
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>

1486
01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:56.730
<v Speaker 1>What did it makes them more </v>
<v Speaker 1>bioavailable?</v>

1487
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1488
01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:58.970
<v Speaker 1>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1489
01:13:59.030 --> 01:14:01.980
<v Speaker 1>what nutrients does a fermenting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1490
01:14:01.981 --> 01:14:02.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1491
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.940
<v Speaker 1>from fermenting creates a vitamin k for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

1492
01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So fermented foods are wanting the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of vitamin k two,</v>

1493
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.360
<v Speaker 1>and that's why a natto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fermented soybean product from </v>

1494
01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Japan is the highest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1495
01:14:14.681 --> 01:14:17.380
<v Speaker 1>pound for pound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ounce for ounce is the highest source of</v>

1496
01:14:17.381 --> 01:14:18.160
<v Speaker 1>vitamin k two.</v>

1497
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:23.160
<v Speaker 1>There is that we know of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cheese is another high source of k </v>

1498
01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.710
<v Speaker 1>two and that's because it's fermented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1499
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:29.140
<v Speaker 1>so most fermented foods have vitamin k </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in beer or wine or any of the other.</v>

1500
01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:32.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1501
01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1502
01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.410
<v Speaker 1>so kimchi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sauerkraut,</v>

1503
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:39.820
<v Speaker 1>neto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this beat stuff eat yogurt,</v>

1504
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:45.030
<v Speaker 1>yogurt or a kefir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a liquid form of yogurt.</v>

1505
01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a kids kiss a certain kinds of</v>

1506
01:14:49.871 --> 01:14:54.871
<v Speaker 1>cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheese doesn't tend to be as beneficial </v>

1507
01:14:54.871 --> 01:14:54.871
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the amount of microbes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in.</v>

1508
01:14:54.871 --> 01:14:55.470
<v Speaker 1>It will come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gucci,</v>

1509
01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:56.650
<v Speaker 1>kombucha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

1510
01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>kombucha.</v>

1511
01:14:59.681 --> 01:15:03.280
<v Speaker 1>There's also water kefir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like dairy kefir,</v>

1512
01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:03.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1513
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.100
<v Speaker 1>it's more like kombucha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's used,</v>

1514
01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:11.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used the kefir cultures to make it </v>

1515
01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every traditional culture almost has a </v>

1516
01:15:14.150 --> 01:15:16.580
<v Speaker 1>fermented food to it because our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors understood even without </v>

1517
01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:17.680
<v Speaker 1>knowing the science that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>

1518
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:18.580
<v Speaker 1>How bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1519
01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:23.581
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must've just trial and error right </v>

1520
01:15:23.581 --> 01:15:26.850
<v Speaker 1>now outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's a normal day in chris's </v>

1521
01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:28.150
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as far as like your diet,</v>

1522
01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:33.180
<v Speaker 1>like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you consume basically the same foods </v>

1523
01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:33.430
<v Speaker 1>all the time or do you mix it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mix it up quite a bit.</v>

1524
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lately I've been experimenting a lot </v>

1525
01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:40.501
<v Speaker 1>with quito and ketogenetic diet fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really interested in fasting right </v>

1526
01:15:41.381 --> 01:15:42.700
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1527
01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:46.940
<v Speaker 1>so like I haven't eaten yet today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had coffee and some,</v>

1528
01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:48.880
<v Speaker 1>some cream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I do again,</v>

1529
01:15:48.881 --> 01:15:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I do find with full fat dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always do that lately.</v>

1530
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm doing that a good solid four to </v>

1531
01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:58.840
<v Speaker 1>five days a week where I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermittent fasting.</v>

1532
01:15:58.841 --> 01:16:00.100
<v Speaker 1>About 14 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I feel great when I do and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1534
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the mental clarity and focus and </v>

1535
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.410
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually.</v>

1536
01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love food preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to cook,</v>

1537
01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's nice to be able to have a break</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that,</v>

1538
01:16:13.410 --> 01:16:14.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to,</v>

1539
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:17.290
<v Speaker 1>not to worry about what I'm going to eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cleaning up and all that stuff.</v>

1540
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:19.630
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1541
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:24.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days my average day is kind of </v>

1542
01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:27.721
<v Speaker 1>like no breakfast fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I might have a wet mark,</v>

1543
01:16:28.661 --> 01:16:32.290
<v Speaker 1>sisson calls a fat bomb salad for lunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

1544
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:34.240
<v Speaker 1>if I have lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have a later lunch.</v>

1545
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be like a salad with a </v>

1546
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.750
<v Speaker 1>little bit of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken,</v>

1547
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.750
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

1548
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:42.400
<v Speaker 1>And then like avocado and olives and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1549
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:46.090
<v Speaker 1>really good healthy fats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1550
01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not doing a key to genic phase,</v>

1551
01:16:49.121 --> 01:16:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a normal dinner which would </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like a portion of protein,</v>

1552
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:57.870
<v Speaker 1>lots of non starchy vegetable and like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet potato or a plantation or uh,</v>

1553
01:16:58.470 --> 01:17:03.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some taro root or one of these paleo </v>

1554
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:05.190
<v Speaker 1>friendly type of starches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you were going quito,</v>

1555
01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.120
<v Speaker 1>how would you switch it up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>

1556
01:17:07.150 --> 01:17:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I would typically have the protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the non starchy vegetables,</v>

1557
01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:13.670
<v Speaker 1>and either like some zucchini noodles or</v>
<v Speaker 1>turnip noodles.</v>

1558
01:17:13.671 --> 01:17:18.671
<v Speaker 1>You can get like a spiralizer and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the noodles really easily and I would </v>

1559
01:17:18.671 --> 01:17:19.490
<v Speaker 1>put some additional fat on those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

1560
01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1561
01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:24.860
<v Speaker 2>vegetable noodles or I might just have </v>
<v Speaker 2>another non starchy vegetable along with</v>

1562
01:17:24.861 --> 01:17:28.130
<v Speaker 2>fat or a salad on top of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're essentially just manipulating the</v>

1563
01:17:28.131 --> 01:17:29.840
<v Speaker 2>fat levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than that,</v>

1564
01:17:29.841 --> 01:17:32.120
<v Speaker 2>you're eating primarily the same type of</v>
<v Speaker 2>foods.</v>

1565
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:37.390
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're manipulating the fat versus </v>

1566
01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:37.390
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do you feel?</v>

1567
01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:42.770
<v Speaker 2>What do you find it difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain the ketogenic diet and how do </v>

1568
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:44.180
<v Speaker 2>you feel when you're on it versus when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not?</v>

1569
01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1570
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:49.570
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm leanne obviously the,</v>

1571
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:55.130
<v Speaker 1>and I have a fast metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do quito for a couple of weeks and</v>

1572
01:17:55.131 --> 01:18:00.131
<v Speaker 1>feel pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it for as long as three </v>

1573
01:18:00.131 --> 01:18:00.131
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1574
01:18:00.131 --> 01:18:04.130
<v Speaker 1>so I've done the full experiment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is after about two or three</v>

1575
01:18:04.131 --> 01:18:09.131
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my exercise tolerance and recovery </v>

1576
01:18:09.131 --> 01:18:11.321
<v Speaker 1>starts to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I start to Have less capacity to Do </v>

1577
01:18:11.321 --> 01:18:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Like more glycolytic activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive movements,</v>

1578
01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.090
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1579
01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.750
<v Speaker 1>even or sprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high intensity types of training.</v>

1580
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.970
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1581
01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:27.980
<v Speaker 1>and I start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sleep starts actually deteriorate a </v>

1582
01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:27.980
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the biggest things.</v>

1583
01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So why would it be beneficial then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's beneficial about it?</v>

1584
01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so too.</v>

1585
01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

1586
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:39.070
<v Speaker 1>not everybody has that response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people just feel better and If </v>

1587
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:43.360
<v Speaker 1>they're able to do it for a sustained </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time and they don't have that </v>

1588
01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:43.360
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1589
01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1590
01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:49.130
<v Speaker 1>the way I'm trying to do it is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>replicating what I think was a typical </v>

1591
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:51.110
<v Speaker 1>in the ancestral environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1592
01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1593
01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:57.890
<v Speaker 1>most hunter gatherer cultures that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>studied a would have naturally had </v>

1594
01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 1>periods of food scarcity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not always starving,</v>

1595
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:05.890
<v Speaker 1>but because they don't have a set with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>live and on the corner or costco or </v>

1596
01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:09.371
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have periods where they </v>

1597
01:19:09.371 --> 01:19:09.371
<v Speaker 1>weren't successful in a hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1598
01:19:09.371 --> 01:19:10.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would go without eating or they eat</v>

1599
01:19:10.161 --> 01:19:12.520
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just built into our,</v>

1600
01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:15.470
<v Speaker 1>our template I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've,</v>

1601
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I do a thing where I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1602
01:19:17.031 --> 01:19:22.031
<v Speaker 1>I'll do intermittent fasting for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>period and I might do a week or two of </v>

1603
01:19:22.031 --> 01:19:25.241
<v Speaker 1>ketosis and then I might just eat my </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal diet for six weeks or two months </v>

1604
01:19:25.241 --> 01:19:30.041
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I might do another week of </v>

1605
01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:30.041
<v Speaker 1>ketosis and I don't schedule it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't plan it,</v>

1606
01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I just let my body tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1607
01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:34.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of feels like all I want to do that</v>

1608
01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:35.150
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1609
01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And are you doing blood tests?</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you doing breath tests?</v>

1610
01:19:38.051 --> 01:19:40.400
<v Speaker 1>How you monitoring your ketones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally,</v>

1611
01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:45.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have the blood ketone monitor and </v>

1612
01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm from all the research that I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point.</v>

1613
01:19:47.031 --> 01:19:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Breath ketone testing is not accurate at</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of ketosis.</v>

1614
01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:56.710
<v Speaker 1>It's accurate at lower levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you get into the therapeutic </v>

1615
01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:56.710
<v Speaker 1>range around two point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1616
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:58.220
<v Speaker 1>one point five to two point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1617
01:19:58.221 --> 01:20:02.270
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of the sweet spot for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>than blood ketones are more accurate.</v>

1618
01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:06.440
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with the blood ketone </v>
<v Speaker 1>strips are super expensive,</v>

1619
01:20:06.441 --> 01:20:09.900
<v Speaker 1>especially if you buy them just like at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the drug store or something like that.</v>

1620
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1621
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1622
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:14.970
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look around and try to find them</v>

1623
01:20:14.971 --> 01:20:16.990
<v Speaker 1>in bulk and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cheaper that way and,</v>

1624
01:20:16.991 --> 01:20:21.991
<v Speaker 1>and frankly at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's true for most people </v>

1625
01:20:21.991 --> 01:20:21.991
<v Speaker 1>once you get used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1626
01:20:21.991 --> 01:20:26.721
<v Speaker 1>and you've done it enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to keep using them over </v>

1627
01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:29.331
<v Speaker 1>and over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of know when you're going </v>

1628
01:20:29.331 --> 01:20:29.331
<v Speaker 1>to be in ketosis when you're not.</v>

1629
01:20:29.331 --> 01:20:31.680
<v Speaker 1>And I've tracked my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my values and I've tracked,</v>

1630
01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:36.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've treated hundreds of patients where </v>

1631
01:20:36.710 --> 01:20:38.301
<v Speaker 1>we've done these kinds of experiments </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this goes back to the discussion </v>

1632
01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:39.450
<v Speaker 1>about ldl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me on a,</v>

1633
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:41.580
<v Speaker 1>on a ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1634
01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:46.610
<v Speaker 1>if I measure my on my typical diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ldl particle number is about $1,200.</v>

1635
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:50.310
<v Speaker 1>So I'll just briefly describe what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because I think some people might not</v>

1636
01:20:50.311 --> 01:20:53.970
<v Speaker 1>be familiar with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you imagine that your,</v>

1637
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.120
<v Speaker 1>your blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your blood stream is like a highway.</v>

1638
01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:03.080
<v Speaker 1>The cars on the highway or the ldl </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles and the passengers in the car </v>

1639
01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:06.690
<v Speaker 1>or the cholesterol that are carried by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ldl particles.</v>

1640
01:21:06.691 --> 01:21:10.370
<v Speaker 1>So for years we've measured the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the passengers,</v>

1641
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:15.390
<v Speaker 1>the cholesterol inside of the particle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now most of the research suggests </v>

1642
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:19.341
<v Speaker 1>that it's actually the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles or cars on the road that is </v>

1643
01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.670
<v Speaker 1>the biggest driver of heart disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>risks,</v>

1644
01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:22.950
<v Speaker 1>not the amount of cholesterol inside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1645
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:27.120
<v Speaker 1>So you can measure this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their labcorp and quest,</v>

1646
01:21:27.121 --> 01:21:30.360
<v Speaker 1>they all have a test panel called an </v>
<v Speaker 1>nmr,</v>

1647
01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:35.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can measure the number of </v>

1648
01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.221
<v Speaker 1>particles that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my normal diet is around 11 or </v>

1649
01:21:37.221 --> 01:21:41.010
<v Speaker 1>$1,200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is technically it's high normal or</v>

1650
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a kind of intermediate range.</v>

1651
01:21:42.811 --> 01:21:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm noT worried about that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1652
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:49.320
<v Speaker 1>but when I go to quito,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ldl goes above 2000,</v>

1653
01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:54.150
<v Speaker 1>which is in the 99th percentile and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and high high risk range.</v>

1654
01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is where I was talking before </v>

1655
01:21:59.410 --> 01:22:02.361
<v Speaker 1>about getting to a point where we can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little more personalized in </v>

1656
01:22:02.361 --> 01:22:04.590
<v Speaker 1>terms of the recommendations that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>make because not everyone who goes quito</v>

1657
01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:05.980
<v Speaker 1>experiences that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1658
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.640
<v Speaker 1>some people do and some people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that is?</v>

1659
01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the one that,</v>

1660
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1661
01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:15.500
<v Speaker 1>the quito type of diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1662
01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:20.770
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it affects my liquids in that way and </v>

1663
01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:24.490
<v Speaker 1>know this is a much larger conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>around does that actually increase my </v>

1664
01:22:24.490 --> 01:22:25.290
<v Speaker 1>risk of heart disease?</v>

1665
01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said before,</v>

1666
01:22:26.431 --> 01:22:30.090
<v Speaker 1>we know that higher ldl on average in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the general population does,</v>

1667
01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:35.120
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if like let's say I have a doppelganger </v>

1668
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:40.310
<v Speaker 1>know genetically identical to me in </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere identical twin and that one </v>

1669
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:42.990
<v Speaker 1>is not eating healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exercising,</v>

1670
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:48.470
<v Speaker 1>not sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing anything to take care of </v>

1671
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:52.161
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he has an ldl p that's high and I </v>

1672
01:22:52.161 --> 01:22:54.270
<v Speaker 1>have the ldl p that's high and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same.</v>

1673
01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Do we think that we're going to be at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same risk of heart disease just </v>

1674
01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:00.510
<v Speaker 1>because that one number on the paper is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same?</v>

1675
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:05.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the assumption that's made in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional research literature.</v>

1676
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think almost anybody just common </v>

1677
01:23:10.410 --> 01:23:10.410
<v Speaker 1>sense would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1678
01:23:10.410 --> 01:23:13.921
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many other factors that </v>

1679
01:23:13.921 --> 01:23:15.820
<v Speaker 1>determine the risk of heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So getting back to this thing.</v>

1680
01:23:15.821 --> 01:23:19.060
<v Speaker 1>So for me with quito,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons,</v>

1681
01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean the main reason I don't do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing is I don't feel well when I keep</v>

1682
01:23:25.151 --> 01:23:25.540
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

1683
01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number two,</v>

1684
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't like doing it long term and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's important.</v>

1685
01:23:30.671 --> 01:23:35.671
<v Speaker 1>And number number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily want to have an ldl </v>

1686
01:23:35.671 --> 01:23:36.730
<v Speaker 1>p of 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do think there are some benefits</v>

1687
01:23:36.731 --> 01:23:41.731
<v Speaker 1>to occasionally doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it was very natural for </v>

1688
01:23:41.731 --> 01:23:43.600
<v Speaker 1>human beings to be in ketosis at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the time.</v>

1689
01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:46.570
<v Speaker 1>And whether you enter into that by just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting,</v>

1690
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:52.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whether you do it with a ketogenic </v>

1691
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.430
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that that really matters.</v>

1692
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:56.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting has some additional benefits </v>

1693
01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.621
<v Speaker 1>above and beyond just ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like autophagy which is a cellular </v>

1694
01:23:58.621 --> 01:24:01.510
<v Speaker 1>cleanup and repair process that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a fasted state.</v>

1695
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>

1696
01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:09.310
<v Speaker 1>if fasting or being in a fasted state </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a normal part of human evolution,</v>

1697
01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:13.210
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense that certain processes </v>
<v Speaker 1>would only happen in that fasted state.</v>

1698
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:18.870
<v Speaker 1>It does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would feel like when I'm talking </v>

1699
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:21.601
<v Speaker 1>to you based on your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would avoid being in ketosis all </v>

1700
01:24:21.601 --> 01:24:22.480
<v Speaker 1>together because it sounds like it sucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1701
01:24:22.481 --> 01:24:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

1702
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Those first two weeks are really great </v>
<v Speaker 1>and feel great.</v>

1703
01:24:26.621 --> 01:24:31.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it starts to shift over to dom </v>

1704
01:24:31.621 --> 01:24:32.760
<v Speaker 1>d'agostino said that there's like a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a,</v>

1705
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:34.480
<v Speaker 1>an adaptation period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1706
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Usually three weeks is the full period </v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people.</v>

1707
01:24:37.871 --> 01:24:39.250
<v Speaker 1>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done a full,</v>

1708
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer experiments.</v>

1709
01:24:40.961 --> 01:24:44.050
<v Speaker 1>So I know it wasn't just a question of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me not being fat adapted.</v>

1710
01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:49.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he was talking about several </v>
<v Speaker 1>months in terms of like athletic </v>

1711
01:24:49.170 --> 01:24:49.170
<v Speaker 1>performance when you were performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to.</v>

1712
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that varies a lot from person to</v>

1713
01:24:51.701 --> 01:24:56.701
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also varies how quickly someone can get </v>

1714
01:24:56.701 --> 01:24:57.310
<v Speaker 1>into and out of ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go into it very quickly.</v>

1715
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:59.590
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the second,</v>

1716
01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.910
<v Speaker 1>if I do one day of fasting or one day of</v>
<v Speaker 1>quito on the second day,</v>

1717
01:25:03.911 --> 01:25:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll generally be at one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point two,</v>

1718
01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:08.770
<v Speaker 1>which most people say is in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic range.</v>

1719
01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:13.771
<v Speaker 1>And then by the third or fourth day I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually be at two without a lot of </v>

1720
01:25:13.771 --> 01:25:17.071
<v Speaker 1>effort and deregulate your protein </v>
<v Speaker 1>intake when you're doing a ketogenic </v>

1721
01:25:17.071 --> 01:25:18.340
<v Speaker 1>diet as well to avoid the protein </v>
<v Speaker 1>converting.</v>

1722
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's highly individual.</v>

1723
01:25:20.351 --> 01:25:21.580
<v Speaker 1>From what I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

1724
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.640
<v Speaker 1>protein doesn't seem to be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant of a lever.</v>

1725
01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I've tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1726
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I did an experiment where I was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting in the morning so I had no </v>

1727
01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.300
<v Speaker 1>protein and then I would have three </v>
<v Speaker 1>ounces of protein only with the salad at</v>

1728
01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:37.660
<v Speaker 1>lunch and then I would have kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal sized portion of protein.</v>

1729
01:25:37.661 --> 01:25:41.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually pretty low protein </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone of my size.</v>

1730
01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

1731
01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:48.271
<v Speaker 1>And then I've done it where I've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>done quito where I've had protein for </v>

1732
01:25:48.271 --> 01:25:48.271
<v Speaker 1>breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch and dinner.</v>

1733
01:25:48.271 --> 01:25:49.810
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to make a big difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1734
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:55.020
<v Speaker 1>but I have patients for whom that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually as big of a leverage </v>

1735
01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:55.060
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1736
01:25:55.090 --> 01:26:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I had tom bill you on the podcast and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the founders of quest </v>

1737
01:26:00.090 --> 01:26:03.220
<v Speaker 1>nutrition and he said one of those quest</v>
<v Speaker 1>bars would knock them out of ketosis.</v>

1738
01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:04.880
<v Speaker 1>But just because of the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein,</v>

1739
01:26:04.881 --> 01:26:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1740
01:26:05.770 --> 01:26:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think they're only like,</v>

1741
01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:08.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

1742
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:10.940
<v Speaker 1>like 18 grams or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the range.</v>

1743
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:15.970
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's so important for us to </v>

1744
01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 1>get over this idea that there's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach that will work for everyone.</v>

1745
01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1746
01:26:18.081 --> 01:26:23.081
<v Speaker 1>You know robb wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen robb wolf's </v>

1747
01:26:23.081 --> 01:26:23.081
<v Speaker 1>experience that he does on his instagram</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his wife?</v>

1748
01:26:23.081 --> 01:26:25.080
<v Speaker 1>They both eat the same thiNgs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a totally different,</v>

1749
01:26:25.130 --> 01:26:30.130
<v Speaker 1>totally different results as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>their blood sugar and his wife </v>

1750
01:26:30.130 --> 01:26:30.470
<v Speaker 1>metabolizes things far quicker than he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

1751
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:35.950
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting because you </v>

1752
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:38.640
<v Speaker 1>seem to people that lived together that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're eating the exact same foods.</v>

1753
01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1754
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:43.670
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>That he's so fascinated by it himself.</v>

1755
01:26:43.671 --> 01:26:45.710
<v Speaker 1>It makes an interesting too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1756
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:47.510
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1757
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:52.660
<v Speaker 1>it's so necessary for us to take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>step because you see so much like,</v>

1758
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasted energy in my opinion of people </v>

1759
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:58.850
<v Speaker 1>arguing back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's often based on like,</v>

1760
01:26:59.210 --> 01:27:01.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe blow goes on a low carb diet.</v>

1761
01:27:01.791 --> 01:27:06.791
<v Speaker 1>has a life changing experience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes like a almost religious zealot </v>

1762
01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:11.860
<v Speaker 1>for the low carb lifestyle and assumes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because it had that effect on him </v>

1763
01:27:12.291 --> 01:27:14.880
<v Speaker 1>that it's going to have that effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else and,</v>

1764
01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:18.320
<v Speaker 1>and just starts proselytizing for low </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

1765
01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not recognizing that for someone else.</v>

1766
01:27:21.831 --> 01:27:25.340
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of my female patients gone low carb</v>

1767
01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:26.440
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

1768
01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:28.240
<v Speaker 1>if they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1769
01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:32.420
<v Speaker 1>working and taking care of kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing crossfit several times a week,</v>

1770
01:27:32.421 --> 01:27:35.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be a disaster for them really</v>

1771
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.560
<v Speaker 1>might not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1772
01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1773
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:39.860
<v Speaker 1>we just gotta we gotta take the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>step.</v>

1774
01:27:40.050 --> 01:27:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take into account by a </v>

1775
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:45.050
<v Speaker 1>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1776
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:47.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic diets because that's not what </v>

1777
01:27:47.370 --> 01:27:48.230
<v Speaker 1>they've been promoting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

1778
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:53.231
<v Speaker 1>that's an issue as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you've gotta be real careful about </v>

1779
01:27:53.231 --> 01:27:56.321
<v Speaker 1>someone who's not citing actual science </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're talking and dismissing the </v>

1780
01:27:56.321 --> 01:27:57.830
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I read someone talking,</v>

1781
01:27:57.831 --> 01:28:02.831
<v Speaker 1>saying that it was a fad and it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get into ketosis that it rarely </v>

1782
01:28:02.831 --> 01:28:02.831
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1783
01:28:02.831 --> 01:28:03.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not true.</v>

1784
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:06.320
<v Speaker 1>That's actually factually wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1785
01:28:06.321 --> 01:28:09.020
<v Speaker 1>it's not hard at all and it happens all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and I've been in it,</v>

1786
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I've done it many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in it right now,</v>

1787
01:28:11.391 --> 01:28:15.860
<v Speaker 1>but I do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me it's a set of boredom.</v>

1788
01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get bored and I want a peanut butter </v>

1789
01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:21.130
<v Speaker 1>and jelly sandwich or something and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

1790
01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:21.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1791
01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Well again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

1792
01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:26.240
<v Speaker 1>that's probably closer to the ancestral </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern of not being in a continually,</v>

1793
01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:27.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1794
01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:29.660
<v Speaker 1>there are some people who need to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it continually,</v>

1795
01:28:29.661 --> 01:28:34.661
<v Speaker 1>like a ketosis can be a life changing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention for a kid with epilepsy for</v>

1796
01:28:34.971 --> 01:28:38.600
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those kids benefit from being a deep</v>

1797
01:28:38.601 --> 01:28:43.601
<v Speaker 1>ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they might actually even need </v>

1798
01:28:43.601 --> 01:28:43.670
<v Speaker 1>exogenous ketones on top of the key to </v>
<v Speaker 1>genic diet,</v>

1799
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:46.070
<v Speaker 1>but they can go from having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1800
01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:51.190
<v Speaker 1>40 seizures in a day or being on like </v>
<v Speaker 1>just brutal antiseizure meds which are </v>

1801
01:28:51.591 --> 01:28:56.591
<v Speaker 1>horrible for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the side effects are so bad to </v>

1802
01:28:56.591 --> 01:29:00.461
<v Speaker 1>being completely off medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can ketogenetic diet and so for them </v>

1803
01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:03.940
<v Speaker 1>that peanut butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not gonna have that sandwich </v>

1804
01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:03.940
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to cause</v>

1805
01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:05.490
<v Speaker 2>a seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was unique in my experience was the</v>

1806
01:29:05.491 --> 01:29:07.080
<v Speaker 2>cognitive benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1807
01:29:07.081 --> 01:29:12.081
<v Speaker 2>this is really fascinating because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt so much more clearheaded and from </v>

1808
01:29:12.081 --> 01:29:16.850
<v Speaker 2>the fog of refined carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that that is a.</v>

1809
01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:23.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's the same or very </v>
<v Speaker 2>close if I just follow a low carb diet,</v>

1810
01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:30.170
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily ketogenic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eliminate refined carbohydrates but </v>

1811
01:29:30.170 --> 01:29:32.670
<v Speaker 2>don't eliminate salads or fruit or </v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

1812
01:29:32.671 --> 01:29:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Like if I want a pair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat a pear,</v>

1813
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:38.910
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the very strict application of it.</v>

1814
01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:44.180
<v Speaker 2>One of the first immediate things that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize is that my hunger is a very </v>

1815
01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.870
<v Speaker 2>different thing when I'm hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that big a deal.</v>

1816
01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:49.920
<v Speaker 2>WhereAs when I was eating a large amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of refined carbohydrates,</v>

1817
01:29:49.921 --> 01:29:51.430
<v Speaker 2>the hunger was ferocious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1818
01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:53.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like,</v>

1819
01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:57.210
<v Speaker 2>like overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like drums playing in the background</v>

1820
01:29:57.260 --> 01:30:00.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's the ketones because the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>can utilize.</v>

1821
01:30:00.351 --> 01:30:05.351
<v Speaker 1>Ketones may even prefer key to glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so when you're producing those </v>

1822
01:30:05.351 --> 01:30:09.551
<v Speaker 1>ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really does take the edge off of </v>

1823
01:30:09.551 --> 01:30:10.220
<v Speaker 1>hunger and it also fuels</v>

1824
01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.340
<v Speaker 2>brain in an odd way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1825
01:30:12.341 --> 01:30:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I find that before I do difficult tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental tasks,</v>

1826
01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:19.180
<v Speaker 2>I like to drink exogenous ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones,</v>

1827
01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:21.490
<v Speaker 2>I like to take them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're actually like it though.</v>

1828
01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1829
01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:23.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1830
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:25.880
<v Speaker 2>What does that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>janice?</v>

1831
01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked them the best.</v>

1832
01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:31.540
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't taste bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink it before I work out.</v>

1833
01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I like those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1834
01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:30:35.650 --> 01:30:37.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I throw some alpha brain in there.</v>

1836
01:30:37.471 --> 01:30:39.310
<v Speaker 2>I just shake it up and it actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>tastes pretty good.</v>

1837
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:30:40.691 --> 01:30:45.691
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely a role for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the ketogenic diet and for ketosis </v>

1839
01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:46.930
<v Speaker 1>in general and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting,</v>

1840
01:30:46.931 --> 01:30:51.931
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had some really interesting benefits </v>

1841
01:30:51.931 --> 01:30:55.201
<v Speaker 1>above and beyond ketosis that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring a lot might work with </v>

1842
01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:55.410
<v Speaker 1>patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1843
01:30:56.290 --> 01:30:58.270
<v Speaker 1>have you heard of the fasting mimicking </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet?</v>

1844
01:30:58.450 --> 01:31:00.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doctor valter longo.</v>

1845
01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:01.310
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1846
01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:06.420
<v Speaker 1>dr longo was at usc center for longevity</v>
<v Speaker 1>superstar scientist and he basically </v>

1847
01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.650
<v Speaker 1>came up with this approach to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1848
01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:16.600
<v Speaker 1>the idea was to get the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting without doing a full water fast.</v>

1849
01:31:16.690 --> 01:31:20.770
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a reduced calorie diet for </v>
<v Speaker 1>three that's done for three to five days</v>

1850
01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:25.920
<v Speaker 1>with specific macronutrient ratios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's done some really interesting </v>

1851
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.000
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of it is an animal,</v>

1852
01:31:27.001 --> 01:31:27.970
<v Speaker 1>so you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1853
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.890
<v Speaker 1>take that with a little bit of a grain </v>
<v Speaker 1>of salt.</v>

1854
01:31:29.891 --> 01:31:31.930
<v Speaker 1>But there has been some in humans as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1855
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:35.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's shown things like in animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>with nms,</v>

1856
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:40.350
<v Speaker 1>just doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting mimicking diet has lead to </v>

1857
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:43.960
<v Speaker 1>regeneration of the myelin sheath and </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what breaks down in ms,</v>

1858
01:31:43.961 --> 01:31:45.850
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't see that,</v>

1859
01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no animals got,</v>

1860
01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:52.140
<v Speaker 1>there's no dre will they have animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>models of ms where they created an ms </v>

1861
01:31:52.211 --> 01:31:54.520
<v Speaker 1>light condition in the animal in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to study it.</v>

1862
01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they show,</v>

1863
01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:58.620
<v Speaker 1>they've shown changes in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1864
01:31:58.630 --> 01:32:00.730
<v Speaker 1>we're actually that read growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1865
01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:02.710
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1866
01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:07.770
<v Speaker 1>it's thought is that this fasting can </v>
<v Speaker 1>promote stem cell regeneration so you </v>

1867
01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:13.171
<v Speaker 1>can actually through fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuild certain parts of your body </v>

1868
01:32:13.171 --> 01:32:14.380
<v Speaker 1>according to this research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1869
01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was the autophagy which I</v>

1870
01:32:16.421 --> 01:32:21.421
<v Speaker 1>mentioned before which is like almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of it as like a cellular </v>

1871
01:32:21.421 --> 01:32:23.590
<v Speaker 1>recycling or clean up or repair process </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens in that fast at state.</v>

1872
01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.650
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look in the research </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

1873
01:32:26.651 --> 01:32:30.910
<v Speaker 1>it's really fascinating because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>more older,</v>

1874
01:32:30.911 --> 01:32:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>older studies.</v>

1875
01:32:32.081 --> 01:32:35.200
<v Speaker 1>There hasn't been as much research until</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently on fasting,</v>

1876
01:32:35.201 --> 01:32:38.740
<v Speaker 1>but fasting has been shown to be a cure </v>
<v Speaker 1>for all kinds of different conditions.</v>

1877
01:32:38.741 --> 01:32:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1878
01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:44.580
<v Speaker 1>severe rheumatoid arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patient can fast and then be completely </v>

1879
01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:46.270
<v Speaker 1>symptom free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course they can't keep that up.</v>

1880
01:32:46.271 --> 01:32:49.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't just fast forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You obviously will die.</v>

1881
01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:53.890
<v Speaker 1>But that alone tells us something </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about fasting and about food</v>

1882
01:32:53.891 --> 01:32:56.020
<v Speaker 1>and how food is impacting those </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>

1883
01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is absolutely fascinating.</v>

1884
01:32:58.390 --> 01:33:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm the consumption of carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dom d'agostino put something up about it</v>

1885
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:08.590
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a low sugar and carbs that they're </v>

1886
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:09.950
<v Speaker 2>closer and closer to connecting sugar </v>
<v Speaker 2>and carbs to cancer.</v>

1887
01:33:11.090 --> 01:33:16.090
<v Speaker 1>This is a pretty controversial area and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say right off the top that I don't </v>

1888
01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:17.350
<v Speaker 1>consider myself to be an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1889
01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:17.930
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1890
01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1891
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably just pass on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's certainly enough </v>

1892
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:27.650
<v Speaker 1>research pointing in that direction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to look at that and they're,</v>

1893
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:30.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even he probably talked about this,</v>

1894
01:33:30.021 --> 01:33:35.021
<v Speaker 1>but drugs like metformin which limit the</v>
<v Speaker 1>availability of glucose are being </v>

1895
01:33:35.021 --> 01:33:36.650
<v Speaker 1>studied even by the nih,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1896
01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:41.680
<v Speaker 1>very traditional mainstream scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations as a therapy therapeutics </v>

1897
01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:47.770
<v Speaker 1>for cancer as is ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dom studying non and others are as well.</v>

1898
01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it'S a little too early to,</v>

1899
01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:55.350
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that all cancer is caused by </v>

1900
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:56.030
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high blood glucose level.</v>

1901
01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.520
<v Speaker 1>The antibodies saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1902
01:33:57.990 --> 01:34:02.990
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying there's a strong </v>

1903
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:04.701
<v Speaker 2>correlation between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you look at the overall </v>

1904
01:34:04.701 --> 01:34:08.271
<v Speaker 2>american diet and the number of chronic </v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases and all the different various </v>

1905
01:34:08.271 --> 01:34:10.860
<v Speaker 2>things that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you correlate all these factors,</v>

1906
01:34:10.861 --> 01:34:14.310
<v Speaker 2>when you think about sedentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle,</v>

1907
01:34:14.311 --> 01:34:19.311
<v Speaker 2>you think about the lack of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then of course you think about diet </v>

1908
01:34:19.311 --> 01:34:19.311
<v Speaker 2>and exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1909
01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:25.220
<v Speaker 2>when do you think people are gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize or how do we get people to </v>

1910
01:34:26.431 --> 01:34:31.431
<v Speaker 2>recognize that what they're eating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the average person is eating is not</v>

1911
01:34:32.371 --> 01:34:37.371
<v Speaker 2>what the body's designed for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this may very well be what has </v>

1912
01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:38.010
<v Speaker 2>triggered this whole cascade of effects.</v>

1913
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:43.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the trillion dollar question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally trillion dollar question </v>

1914
01:34:43.450 --> 01:34:44.090
<v Speaker 1>because we spend three point </v>
<v Speaker 1>$2,000,000,000,000</v>

1915
01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:46.900
<v Speaker 1>on healthcare a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1916
01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.250
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1917
01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an easy way in a hard </v>

1918
01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:57.071
<v Speaker 1>way to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the easy way is that we continue to </v>

1919
01:34:57.071 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>raise awareness through books and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things</v>

1920
01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:00.320
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1921
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1922
01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:06.400
<v Speaker 3>we make proactive changes to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare system that support the most </v>

1923
01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.270
<v Speaker 3>important intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's use an example again,</v>

1924
01:35:09.090 --> 01:35:13.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm imagine it so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you go into the doctor right now,</v>

1925
01:35:13.191 --> 01:35:15.170
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're one of those 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million people that has,</v>

1926
01:35:15.230 --> 01:35:20.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>type two diabetes or prediabetes and </v>

1927
01:35:20.230 --> 01:35:20.230
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1928
01:35:20.230 --> 01:35:23.110
<v Speaker 3>they test your blood sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say your fasting glucose is 96 joe </v>

1929
01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:25.040
<v Speaker 3>and your hemoglobin a one c is five </v>
<v Speaker 3>point five.</v>

1930
01:35:25.041 --> 01:35:26.210
<v Speaker 3>Good news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's normal.</v>

1931
01:35:26.690 --> 01:35:27.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1932
01:35:27.141 --> 01:35:29.540
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the normal range but it's in the</v>

1933
01:35:29.541 --> 01:35:32.480
<v Speaker 3>high end of the normal range in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>current system.</v>

1934
01:35:32.481 --> 01:35:35.930
<v Speaker 3>They'll just tell you it's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might maybe maybe not make any kind</v>

1935
01:35:35.931 --> 01:35:38.840
<v Speaker 3>of dietary recommendations and then send</v>
<v Speaker 3>you on your way.</v>

1936
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is we're not going to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to this until it's not normal.</v>

1937
01:35:43.890 --> 01:35:45.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to pay attention to this</v>

1938
01:35:45.441 --> 01:35:48.410
<v Speaker 3>until you actually do have prediabetes </v>
<v Speaker 3>or diabetes.</v>

1939
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:50.420
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

1940
01:35:50.421 --> 01:35:55.421
<v Speaker 3>wait until you have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course the longer that you </v>

1941
01:35:55.421 --> 01:35:56.390
<v Speaker 3>wait to treat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the harder it is to reverse.</v>

1942
01:35:56.391 --> 01:35:57.470
<v Speaker 3>And then you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when,</v>

1943
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:59.720
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they do find that you have it,</v>

1944
01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:03.190
<v Speaker 3>they just give you a drug rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1945
01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:06.530
<v Speaker 3>give you any kind of real support to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make diet changes.</v>

1946
01:36:06.531 --> 01:36:11.531
<v Speaker 3>So even if the doctor is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does know what to do or what to tell </v>

1947
01:36:11.531 --> 01:36:13.910
<v Speaker 3>you about diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they often don't because they just</v>

1948
01:36:13.911 --> 01:36:15.830
<v Speaker 3>don't have a lot of training in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

1949
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:20.490
<v Speaker 3>And it's also how few people really have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the contents of their body analyzed.</v>

1950
01:36:20.630 --> 01:36:22.460
<v Speaker 3>How many people actually get blood work </v>
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>

1951
01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:22.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1952
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:25.820
<v Speaker 3>I'd say 80 percent don't even know they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have prediabetes,</v>

1953
01:36:26.150 --> 01:36:31.150
<v Speaker 3>but let's assume that they do and let's </v>
<v Speaker 3>assume they get to the doctor and let's </v>

1954
01:36:31.150 --> 01:36:31.550
<v Speaker 3>assume the doctor even knows what to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell them.</v>

1955
01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they tell them that are they,</v>

1956
01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:39.220
<v Speaker 3>does that gonna be enough to make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>person successful in changing their </v>

1957
01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:40.250
<v Speaker 3>diet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially not if their gut biome is</v>

1958
01:36:40.251 --> 01:36:44.060
<v Speaker 3>program to crave that sugar and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have low willpower especially,</v>

1959
01:36:44.061 --> 01:36:46.940
<v Speaker 3>they get very little sleep at work all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1960
01:36:46.941 --> 01:36:48.740
<v Speaker 3>All those factors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those factors.</v>

1961
01:36:48.741 --> 01:36:53.741
<v Speaker 3>And we know they like most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information alone is not enough to </v>

1962
01:36:53.741 --> 01:36:54.080
<v Speaker 3>change behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1963
01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I said that before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's well established scientifically,</v>

1964
01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Just telling someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1965
01:36:58.611 --> 01:37:00.320
<v Speaker 3>you should eat a healthier diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1966
01:37:00.321 --> 01:37:05.321
<v Speaker 3>one percent of people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to retake that information and act </v>

1967
01:37:05.321 --> 01:37:05.810
<v Speaker 3>on it successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially over the long term.</v>

1968
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:11.530
<v Speaker 3>But let's imagine a different scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's imagine you can go into the </v>

1969
01:37:11.530 --> 01:37:11.530
<v Speaker 3>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>

1970
01:37:11.530 --> 01:37:13.040
<v Speaker 3>They test your blood sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1971
01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high normal fasting glucose,</v>

1972
01:37:15.531 --> 01:37:17.300
<v Speaker 3>high normal agency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they sit down,</v>

1973
01:37:17.301 --> 01:37:17.870
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1974
01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.320
<v Speaker 3>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is obviously happening in an </v>

1975
01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:23.320
<v Speaker 3>appointment in this longer than eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>

1976
01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:23.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1977
01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:23.690
<v Speaker 3>They sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

1978
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not prediabetic yet.</v>

1979
01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:28.790
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your blood sugar's starting to creep</v>

1980
01:37:28.791 --> 01:37:33.791
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm worried that if we don't do </v>

1981
01:37:33.791 --> 01:37:33.791
<v Speaker 3>something now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get,</v>

1982
01:37:33.791 --> 01:37:34.460
<v Speaker 3>you're going to become prediabetic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually diabetic.</v>

1983
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:36.710
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1984
01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.890
<v Speaker 3>I could give you a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just putting a bandaid on the</v>

1985
01:37:39.891 --> 01:37:44.891
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm going to do instead is I'm </v>

1986
01:37:44.891 --> 01:37:45.500
<v Speaker 3>gonna hook you up with our health coach </v>
<v Speaker 3>and nutritionist and she,</v>

1987
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:49.730
<v Speaker 3>he or she is going to create a recipe </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you meal plan.</v>

1988
01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.760
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come to your house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to clean out your pantry </v>

1989
01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:54.760
<v Speaker 3>and get up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid of all the bad foodS.</v>

1990
01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:58.840
<v Speaker 3>They're going to go shopping with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and show you actually exactly what you </v>

1991
01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.931
<v Speaker 3>need to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to help you set up these </v>

1992
01:38:02.931 --> 01:38:05.091
<v Speaker 3>meal plans and give you recipes so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know exactly what you should be </v>

1993
01:38:05.091 --> 01:38:08.391
<v Speaker 3>doing or they're going to set you up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this meal planning service that we </v>

1994
01:38:08.391 --> 01:38:09.640
<v Speaker 3>work with and I'm also gonna set you up.</v>

1995
01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:14.660
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get a gym membership and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get set up with a </v>

1996
01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:16.890
<v Speaker 3>personal trainer at that gym and so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can start getting,</v>

1997
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:19.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming more physically active.</v>

1998
01:38:19.650 --> 01:38:24.650
<v Speaker 3>We're going to give you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a online class that talks about sleep </v>

1999
01:38:24.650 --> 01:38:25.980
<v Speaker 3>hygiene and how to get better night's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep.</v>

2000
01:38:25.981 --> 01:38:28.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a six week program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do it for half hour a day,</v>

2001
01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:31.020
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's the good news,</v>

2002
01:38:31.021 --> 01:38:36.021
<v Speaker 3>joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all going to be covered by your </v>

2003
01:38:36.021 --> 01:38:37.811
<v Speaker 3>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to have to pay for any </v>

2004
01:38:37.811 --> 01:38:40.110
<v Speaker 3>of this that you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is totally possible.</v>

2005
01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:45.440
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there any doubt that if even if we </v>

2006
01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.290
<v Speaker 3>spent $10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

2007
01:38:46.291 --> 01:38:51.291
<v Speaker 3>which is more than that would cost even </v>
<v Speaker 3>including the health coach and the fees </v>

2008
01:38:51.291 --> 01:38:52.350
<v Speaker 3>for the gym and the fees for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal trainer.</v>

2009
01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.870
<v Speaker 3>If we spent that amount of money right </v>
<v Speaker 3>up front,</v>

2010
01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:59.820
<v Speaker 3>we could put that per get that person's </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood sugar back to normal level,</v>

2011
01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:03.510
<v Speaker 3>prevent them from ever getting type two </v>
<v Speaker 3>diabetes in the first place,</v>

2012
01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:09.020
<v Speaker 3>give them way more confidence in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own ability to take care of themselves </v>

2013
01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.400
<v Speaker 3>and prevent disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make them feel better and probably every</v>

2014
01:39:11.401 --> 01:39:16.401
<v Speaker 3>other way and save the healthcare system</v>
<v Speaker 3>$640,000</v>

2015
01:39:16.501 --> 01:39:18.300
<v Speaker 3>over the next 45 years.</v>

2016
01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:23.780
<v Speaker 3>We could have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing stopping that from </v>

2017
01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:26.061
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real question is how do you get </v>

2018
01:39:26.061 --> 01:39:26.061
<v Speaker 3>someone to act?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the question.</v>

2019
01:39:26.061 --> 01:39:26.900
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Inspiration.</v>

2020
01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:30.570
<v Speaker 3>I said with the health coach so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not actually.</v>

2021
01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is well defined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had.</v>

2022
01:39:33.451 --> 01:39:38.451
<v Speaker 3>There's so much research on behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>change and evidence based principles </v>

2023
01:39:38.451 --> 01:39:42.231
<v Speaker 3>that support behavior change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there there are techniques like </v>

2024
01:39:42.231 --> 01:39:43.320
<v Speaker 3>motivational interviewing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coaching to strengths.</v>

2025
01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:46.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm a coach into strengths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2026
01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:50.540
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means helping people identify and,</v>

2027
01:39:50.630 --> 01:39:53.880
<v Speaker 3>and work with their strengths rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than trying to fix what's broken.</v>

2028
01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motivational interviewing is what would </v>

2029
01:39:59.770 --> 01:40:02.240
<v Speaker 3>be an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's you have a person works a regular </v>

2030
01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.030
<v Speaker 3>normal job and they've got a big gut and</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to lose.</v>

2031
01:40:03.090 --> 01:40:04.350
<v Speaker 3>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a,</v>

2032
01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:08.010
<v Speaker 3>it's shifting the focus around from </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong,</v>

2033
01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:10.950
<v Speaker 3>which is really disempowering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't do that.</v>

2034
01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:11.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2035
01:40:11.641 --> 01:40:16.641
<v Speaker 3>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have no willpower or whatever to </v>

2036
01:40:16.641 --> 01:40:19.160
<v Speaker 3>helping them become aware of certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality traits or characteristics </v>

2037
01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.860
<v Speaker 3>that they can then use to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>change that they want to make.</v>

2038
01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Motivational interviewing is like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine a woman who's 55,</v>

2039
01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finds out that she has type two diabetes</v>

2040
01:40:30.541 --> 01:40:33.690
<v Speaker 3>and the doctor's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should eat a better diet and she's,</v>

2041
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:38.840
<v Speaker 3>she would like to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's overworked and tired and it </v>

2042
01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.561
<v Speaker 3>feels overwhelming and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's just not really finding the </v>

2043
01:40:42.561 --> 01:40:43.800
<v Speaker 3>motivation to do that in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2044
01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:46.650
<v Speaker 3>but she has grandkids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She loves her grandkids.</v>

2045
01:40:46.651 --> 01:40:51.651
<v Speaker 3>She wants to see them grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wants to be able to play with them </v>

2046
01:40:51.651 --> 01:40:54.531
<v Speaker 3>without becoming blind and immobile from</v>
<v Speaker 3>type two diabetes and so the the per the</v>

2047
01:40:55.450 --> 01:40:57.520
<v Speaker 3>health coach is trained in motivational </v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewing,</v>

2048
01:40:57.521 --> 01:41:02.170
<v Speaker 3>can help her help that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that patient to be able to tie that,</v>

2049
01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:07.200
<v Speaker 3>those deeper values and goals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivations with the health goal so that</v>

2050
01:41:08.891 --> 01:41:11.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not just eating a healthy diet for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2051
01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:16.170
<v Speaker 3>for the sake of eating a healthy diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's eating a healthy diet because I </v>

2052
01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:17.860
<v Speaker 3>really want to see my grandkids grow up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and be able to play with them.</v>

2053
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:23.510
<v Speaker 3>OkAy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and then there are these principles </v>

2054
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:24.400
<v Speaker 3>of behavior change that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are totally well established.</v>

2055
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:29.880
<v Speaker 3>So one is shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The change is a colloquial way of </v>

2056
01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:34.231
<v Speaker 3>putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let's say you're going to start a </v>

2057
01:41:34.231 --> 01:41:36.850
<v Speaker 3>meditation practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way to not do it is to say,</v>

2058
01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.470
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so start doing that.</v>

2059
01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.960
<v Speaker 3>Do an hour of meditation a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck with that.</v>

2060
01:41:41.110 --> 01:41:46.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna fail in 99 point nine </v>

2061
01:41:46.110 --> 01:41:46.300
<v Speaker 3>percent of the cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way to do it might be,</v>

2062
01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.490
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>step one,</v>

2063
01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:53.640
<v Speaker 3>not even that step one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>download the headspace app on your </v>

2064
01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:53.640
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it,</v>

2065
01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.520
<v Speaker 3>that's your first step,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2066
01:41:54.610 --> 01:41:56.740
<v Speaker 3>step two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but get a meditation cushion.</v>

2067
01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:58.330
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Step three,</v>

2068
01:41:58.810 --> 01:42:01.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open the headspace app and do your first</v>

2069
01:42:01.871 --> 01:42:03.040
<v Speaker 3>two minute meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2070
01:42:03.041 --> 01:42:05.890
<v Speaker 3>the headspace app is actually built in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this way where they start,</v>

2071
01:42:05.891 --> 01:42:10.891
<v Speaker 3>you very small and you build up </v>
<v Speaker 3>gradually over time because they know </v>

2072
01:42:10.891 --> 01:42:11.830
<v Speaker 3>about those principles of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

2073
01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:17.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that behavior change works </v>

2074
01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:17.440
<v Speaker 3>better in community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2075
01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:17.440
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2076
01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:22.110
<v Speaker 3>this is a head spinner to obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people have argued is a contagious </v>

2077
01:42:22.110 --> 01:42:26.521
<v Speaker 3>disease because people who have friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are obese are more likely to be </v>

2078
01:42:26.521 --> 01:42:27.280
<v Speaker 3>obese themselves.</v>

2079
01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2080
01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:31.310
<v Speaker 2>that makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2081
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:32.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an example of something,</v>

2082
01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.880
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why that makes a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sense.</v>

2083
01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just did this thing sober october me </v>

2084
01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:40.180
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2085
01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:43.160
<v Speaker 2>and our shaffir tom score,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bert kreischer and I,</v>

2086
01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:45.740
<v Speaker 2>we took 15 hot yoga classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no booze,</v>

2087
01:42:45.741 --> 01:42:50.741
<v Speaker 2>no weed for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because we were doing it all </v>

2088
01:42:50.741 --> 01:42:50.741
<v Speaker 2>together and we kept checking in on each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

2089
01:42:50.741 --> 01:42:55.511
<v Speaker 2>it was very motivating and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one's strayed and we all were </v>

2090
01:42:56.061 --> 01:42:59.870
<v Speaker 2>doing it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We knew that we had,</v>

2091
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:03.530
<v Speaker 2>we had all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a responsibility,</v>

2092
01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.190
<v Speaker 2>we have responsibility to the group and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>

2093
01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:11.240
<v Speaker 2>we knew that we're motivating each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as pushing each other and </v>

2094
01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.380
<v Speaker 2>talking shit to each other and making </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun of each other,</v>

2095
01:43:12.410 --> 01:43:16.790
<v Speaker 2>which is what we do nationally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of it we were like,</v>

2096
01:43:16.791 --> 01:43:18.140
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was great.</v>

2097
01:43:18.141 --> 01:43:20.810
<v Speaker 2>like there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of us were like,</v>

2098
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm never doing yoga again for yoga and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting drunk for a week.</v>

2099
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:29.770
<v Speaker 2>but the real takeaway from it was there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was some measurable motivation and </v>

2100
01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:34.880
<v Speaker 2>inspiration from having three friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it with me.</v>

2101
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's again been improving in the </v>

2102
01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.200
<v Speaker 3>science and even just having one person </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a health coach who can play that </v>

2103
01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.741
<v Speaker 3>role and be accountable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can help you get in touch with the </v>

2104
01:43:46.741 --> 01:43:51.301
<v Speaker 3>real motivation for doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can actually design a program for </v>

2105
01:43:51.301 --> 01:43:55.141
<v Speaker 3>you that's life likely to succeed </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of fail or perhaps online </v>

2106
01:43:55.141 --> 01:43:58.841
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be online groups to get </v>

2107
01:43:58.841 --> 01:43:58.841
<v Speaker 3>involved with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the knowledge and the technology</v>

2108
01:43:58.841 --> 01:44:00.320
<v Speaker 3>to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not,</v>

2109
01:44:00.321 --> 01:44:05.321
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can retrain a health coach in six </v>

2110
01:44:05.321 --> 01:44:08.021
<v Speaker 3>months or a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't need to have nine years of </v>

2111
01:44:08.021 --> 01:44:08.021
<v Speaker 3>premedical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2112
01:44:08.021 --> 01:44:10.190
<v Speaker 3>traIning and biological sciences and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2113
01:44:10.191 --> 01:44:12.200
<v Speaker 3>They just need to be trained in behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

2114
01:44:12.230 --> 01:44:17.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need to be people who can form a </v>

2115
01:44:17.230 --> 01:44:18.110
<v Speaker 3>good relatIonship with somebody else and</v>
<v Speaker 3>build that trust and rapport.</v>

2116
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:20.240
<v Speaker 3>They need to have some knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

2117
01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:23.570
<v Speaker 3>of diet and lifestyle and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like I said,</v>

2118
01:44:23.571 --> 01:44:28.571
<v Speaker 3>imagine that you go into your doctor and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they actually hook you up with someone </v>

2119
01:44:28.571 --> 01:44:29.820
<v Speaker 3>like that who has all that training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2120
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:34.760
<v Speaker 3>if you think of how the healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 3>population as like a pyramid,</v>

2121
01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:36.830
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the top of the pyramid you've got,</v>

2122
01:44:36.831 --> 01:44:41.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are really sick and who were </v>

2123
01:44:41.831 --> 01:44:41.831
<v Speaker 3>in the hospital or in some kind of acute</v>
<v Speaker 3>care setting,</v>

2124
01:44:41.831 --> 01:44:45.290
<v Speaker 3>they absolutely need intensive support </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the conventional medical system.</v>

2125
01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:50.740
<v Speaker 3>Then you go down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got another 25 percent of people </v>

2126
01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:54.131
<v Speaker 3>who have some kind of pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>debilitating chronic disease where they </v>

2127
01:44:54.131 --> 01:44:56.360
<v Speaker 3>need to be seeing a doctor regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then in the bottom 70 percent you've</v>

2128
01:44:56.361 --> 01:44:58.490
<v Speaker 3>got a lot of people who are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>overweight.</v>

2129
01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:01.040
<v Speaker 3>They're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not sleeping very well.</v>

2130
01:45:01.041 --> 01:45:02.570
<v Speaker 3>They got some gut issues.</v>

2131
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:05.210
<v Speaker 3>They got some skin problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2132
01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:10.240
<v Speaker 3>My argument is that those people can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>really well served by well trained </v>

2133
01:45:10.551 --> 01:45:14.210
<v Speaker 3>health coaches and nutritionists who can</v>
<v Speaker 3>work intensively with them on diet,</v>

2134
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:19.510
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle and behavior change and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that those changes are the single </v>

2135
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:22.070
<v Speaker 3>most important step we can take to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevent and reverse disease.</v>

2136
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:25.730
<v Speaker 3>But we also know that just telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>people about it doesn't work.</v>

2137
01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:28.580
<v Speaker 3>You have to create that support system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2138
01:45:28.581 --> 01:45:33.581
<v Speaker 3>our whole food system is so crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's so fraught with peril </v>

2139
01:45:33.581 --> 01:45:35.300
<v Speaker 3>everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a goddamn minefield.</v>

2140
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:37.550
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to eat a healthy diet.</v>

2141
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:41.780
<v Speaker 3>You have to go way out of your way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find what you can consume.</v>

2142
01:45:41.781 --> 01:45:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is over there.</v>

2143
01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you just want to eat a shitty</v>
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>

2144
01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:49.880
<v Speaker 3>it's everywhere in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The the vast majority of the food that's</v>

2145
01:45:49.881 --> 01:45:51.470
<v Speaker 3>available to us is not healthy.</v>

2146
01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2147
01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:57.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you took somebody from our culture </v>

2148
01:45:57.460 --> 01:46:01.751
<v Speaker 3>and drop them into like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this group called the cmo manet </v>

2149
01:46:01.751 --> 01:46:05.501
<v Speaker 3>and Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're a hunter gatherer group that's </v>

2150
01:46:05.501 --> 01:46:05.501
<v Speaker 3>still follows their traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle.</v>

2151
01:46:05.501 --> 01:46:09.131
<v Speaker 3>if you took someone from here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop them in there and just made them </v>

2152
01:46:09.131 --> 01:46:10.910
<v Speaker 3>live that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd get healthy because they wouldn't</v>

2153
01:46:10.911 --> 01:46:11.910
<v Speaker 3>have any choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2154
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:13.610
<v Speaker 3>they would eat what was there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd,</v>

2155
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:16.570
<v Speaker 3>they'd be living outdoors and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have ipads.</v>

2156
01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:20.570
<v Speaker 3>They're staying up and looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>until two in the morning and you know,</v>

2157
01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:25.940
<v Speaker 3>they would be healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but likewise they'd get killed by a </v>

2158
01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:25.940
<v Speaker 3>jaguar or they'd get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2159
01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:27.170
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely possible,</v>

2160
01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:32.920
<v Speaker 3>but if you took one of those people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you drop them into here like woodland </v>

2161
01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:35.600
<v Speaker 3>hills or New York city or san francisco </v>
<v Speaker 3>or anywhere else,</v>

2162
01:46:35.601 --> 01:46:37.880
<v Speaker 3>is there any question that what's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to happen?</v>

2163
01:46:37.881 --> 01:46:40.820
<v Speaker 3>They're the same exact thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to all of us in this,</v>

2164
01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:41.900
<v Speaker 3>in this modern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2165
01:46:41.901 --> 01:46:44.360
<v Speaker 3>we've seen that with the nun when the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the nun.</v>

2166
01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:49.450
<v Speaker 3>One of the more fascinating things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>studying the nun was how small the </v>

2167
01:46:49.450 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>number of people</v>

2168
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:54.480
<v Speaker 2>that got cancer was such an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>small number and they essentially had no</v>

2169
01:46:54.481 --> 01:46:59.481
<v Speaker 2>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were eating fats from seals and </v>

2170
01:46:59.481 --> 01:47:00.480
<v Speaker 2>wail and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could consume.</v>

2171
01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Extremely limited diet environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2172
01:47:04.570 --> 01:47:08.790
<v Speaker 2>very harsh environment and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they had adapted to it and then when</v>

2173
01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.880
<v Speaker 2>western America came into their lives in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like cigarettes,</v>

2174
01:47:14.910 --> 01:47:17.280
<v Speaker 2>shitty food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol,</v>

2175
01:47:17.670 --> 01:47:20.640
<v Speaker 2>refined carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer rates</v>

2176
01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:23.010
<v Speaker 3>through the roof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just through the roof.</v>

2177
01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:26.220
<v Speaker 3>Which is fascinating because their jeans</v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't changed.</v>

2178
01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely the same genes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to change in one </v>

2179
01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:31.820
<v Speaker 3>generation or even two or three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2180
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:32.940
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible.</v>

2181
01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:36.180
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen west and price?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You familiar with his work?</v>

2182
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:38.400
<v Speaker 3>I know the name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was,</v>

2183
01:47:38.401 --> 01:47:42.030
<v Speaker 3>he was a dentist back in like the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties and thirties,</v>

2184
01:47:42.090 --> 01:47:45.120
<v Speaker 3>and he wrote a book called nutrition and</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical degeneration.</v>

2185
01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:48.600
<v Speaker 3>And what he as a dentIst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his main interest was why did,</v>

2186
01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:51.330
<v Speaker 3>why did so many cavities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't seem natural,</v>

2187
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:56.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem normal that were </v>

2188
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:57.120
<v Speaker 3>designed to just develop rotten teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You thought this is stupid.</v>

2189
01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.600
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to go around and study all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these traditional cultures all over </v>

2190
01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:06.831
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And first I want to find out do they </v>

2191
01:48:06.831 --> 01:48:09.171
<v Speaker 3>have cavities and dental decay and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like a narrowing of the dental arch </v>

2192
01:48:09.171 --> 01:48:12.540
<v Speaker 3>and changes in facial structure that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have in the industrialized world.</v>

2193
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:14.880
<v Speaker 3>And the second question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not,</v>

2194
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:17.240
<v Speaker 3>what is the common element,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2195
01:48:17.250 --> 01:48:19.800
<v Speaker 3>with all of these cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's different than our culture.</v>

2196
01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:23.940
<v Speaker 3>And in his book he shows pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first of all,</v>

2197
01:48:23.941 --> 01:48:25.320
<v Speaker 3>the answer to the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2198
01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:28.380
<v Speaker 3>it's not normal for humans to develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>cavities and rotten teeth.</v>

2199
01:48:28.381 --> 01:48:29.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could it be?</v>

2200
01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.400
<v Speaker 3>How could we survive in the natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>world if our teeth are all falling out?</v>

2201
01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:34.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he,</v>

2202
01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:38.580
<v Speaker 3>he went and he took pictures of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people all around the world,</v>

2203
01:48:38.581 --> 01:48:39.580
<v Speaker 3>like in africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2204
01:48:39.581 --> 01:48:41.340
<v Speaker 3>my side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hunter gatherer,</v>

2205
01:48:41.341 --> 01:48:42.440
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2206
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:45.390
<v Speaker 3>people living in a remote part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Switzerland,</v>

2207
01:48:45.391 --> 01:48:50.391
<v Speaker 3>isolated up in the hills that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain their traditional diet and </v>

2208
01:48:50.391 --> 01:48:52.080
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle and all of them had these </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful teeth,</v>

2209
01:48:52.230 --> 01:48:54.690
<v Speaker 3>big wide round faces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dent,</v>

2210
01:48:54.750 --> 01:48:56.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wide dental arches,</v>

2211
01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:58.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these signs of health.</v>

2212
01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:03.680
<v Speaker 3>But he also in the book had pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people from those same areas that had </v>

2213
01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.530
<v Speaker 3>switched to move to the city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2214
01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:08.790
<v Speaker 3>switch to modern lifestyle within one </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>

2215
01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:14.240
<v Speaker 3>You see people with these wide faces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big healthy teeth smiling on one side of</v>

2216
01:49:14.311 --> 01:49:19.311
<v Speaker 3>the page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on the other side of the page you </v>

2217
01:49:19.311 --> 01:49:19.311
<v Speaker 3>see people with these narrow faces like </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine,</v>

2218
01:49:19.311 --> 01:49:19.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2219
01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.260
<v Speaker 3>rotten teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2220
01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:26.420
<v Speaker 3>totally it's crooked teeth and the kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of dental problems that we all have </v>

2221
01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:28.650
<v Speaker 3>where most of us get braces and all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2222
01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:33.860
<v Speaker 3>And that happened in just one generation</v>
<v Speaker 3>of switching from a traditional diet to </v>

2223
01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:35.280
<v Speaker 3>a modern either faced then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2224
01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:40.460
<v Speaker 3>so vitamin k two and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot number of vitamins are </v>

2225
01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:43.080
<v Speaker 3>responsible for facial development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>

2226
01:49:43.170 --> 01:49:48.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look in the book of a western </v>

2227
01:49:48.170 --> 01:49:48.170
<v Speaker 3>prices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2228
01:49:48.170 --> 01:49:48.310
<v Speaker 3>pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see most people</v>

2229
01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:49.720
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2230
01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:51.880
<v Speaker 1>in those traditional worlds have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>broad,</v>

2231
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.040
<v Speaker 1>healthy dental arches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2232
01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:59.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our culture because of nutrient </v>

2233
01:49:59.510 --> 01:50:01.801
<v Speaker 1>deficiencies and we're not eating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy nutrient dense foods are faces </v>

2234
01:50:01.801 --> 01:50:02.530
<v Speaker 1>get more narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our chins received,</v>

2235
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:07.890
<v Speaker 1>we have our mouths become more crowded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why many people can't fit the </v>

2236
01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:13.020
<v Speaker 1>number of normal adult teeth in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth because they're dental arches so </v>

2237
01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:16.561
<v Speaker 1>narrowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's all from that nutritional </v>

2238
01:50:16.561 --> 01:50:16.561
<v Speaker 1>deficiencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2239
01:50:16.561 --> 01:50:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Why I had to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to get adult teeth pulled when I </v>

2240
01:50:20.370 --> 01:50:24.211
<v Speaker 1>was a teenager because my mouth didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have enough room for all of my adult </v>

2241
01:50:24.211 --> 01:50:24.211
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>

2242
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Does the rest of your family have </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar facial structure?</v>

2243
01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2244
01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Largely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:50:31.541 --> 01:50:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can check this out.</v>

2246
01:50:32.591 --> 01:50:34.570
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting things to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the airport.</v>

2247
01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2248
01:50:36.011 --> 01:50:39.670
<v Speaker 1>you just look at people's faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often you'll see like the chin is really</v>

2249
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.460
<v Speaker 1>receded and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2250
01:50:41.461 --> 01:50:44.860
<v Speaker 1>not like a strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see in a narrow face like mine.</v>

2251
01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you,</v>

2252
01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:52.600
<v Speaker 1>you might see a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person from africa or someone who's </v>

2253
01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:52.870
<v Speaker 1>more connected to their traditional diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle,</v>

2254
01:50:52.871 --> 01:50:55.990
<v Speaker 1>they'll typically have a rounder face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more full face,</v>

2255
01:50:56.050 --> 01:51:00.100
<v Speaker 1>broader dental arch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll have straight teeth with wider,</v>

2256
01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.400
<v Speaker 1>wider teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can,</v>

2257
01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:03.580
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone can do this.</v>

2258
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Anyone can see and look and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost predict how long has that person </v>

2259
01:51:08.590 --> 01:51:10.150
<v Speaker 1>been away from their traditional diet </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lifestyle.</v>

2260
01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never knew that.</v>

2261
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:15.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fascinating point.</v>

2262
01:51:15.670 --> 01:51:20.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a big variable in martial arts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to take a punch.</v>

2263
01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Well your face is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty round.</v>

2264
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:27.140
<v Speaker 1>You have a broader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just what you're eating is.</v>

2265
01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:31.180
<v Speaker 1>My mom is very wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a thick mom spiLling pit bull.</v>

2266
01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's probably part of why you're </v>

2267
01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:39.430
<v Speaker 1>probably a good performer is that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got that structure that supports it.</v>

2268
01:51:39.790 --> 01:51:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it has something to do with it </v>

2269
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.790
<v Speaker 1>genetically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2270
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:47.520
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to take a punch is I think </v>

2271
01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:47.800
<v Speaker 1>directly related to the size of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

2272
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2273
01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Guys with smaller jaws and smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>faces,</v>

2274
01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:54.340
<v Speaker 1>they have a much harder time getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>

2275
01:51:54.490 --> 01:51:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't last long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2276
01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.840
<v Speaker 1>like samoans are the best at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2277
01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:01.060
<v Speaker 1>It was just such a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

2278
01:52:01.061 --> 01:52:06.061
<v Speaker 1>instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weston price has a lot of pictures from </v>

2279
01:52:06.061 --> 01:52:06.061
<v Speaker 1>people in the south pacific and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>

2280
01:52:06.061 --> 01:52:07.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of these beautiful.</v>

2281
01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:08.470
<v Speaker 1>You should check it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would love the book.</v>

2282
01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:12.490
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposition of those traditional faces</v>

2283
01:52:12.491 --> 01:52:14.880
<v Speaker 1>with the modern ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>

2284
01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a picture's worth a thousand words,</v>

2285
01:52:18.101 --> 01:52:23.101
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just look at those pictures and </v>

2286
01:52:23.101 --> 01:52:23.101
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>

2287
01:52:23.101 --> 01:52:23.101
<v Speaker 1>TotallY makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2288
01:52:23.101 --> 01:52:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a very weird.</v>

2289
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:30.390
<v Speaker 1>When you think about what we're doing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human body and when you're talking </v>

2290
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:32.110
<v Speaker 1>about the diabetes levels that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

2291
01:52:32.111 --> 01:52:37.111
<v Speaker 1>or prediabetes and chronic disease and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different issues and 40 percent </v>

2292
01:52:37.111 --> 01:52:38.560
<v Speaker 1>obesity rate and the all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>

2293
01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:44.480
<v Speaker 1>it's an epidemic that's sweeping through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire nation and it's largely,</v>

2294
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:51.010
<v Speaker 3>other than health fads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a weight loss videos.</v>

2295
01:52:51.021 --> 01:52:56.021
<v Speaker 3>It's like peripherAlly examined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to call it a slow motion plague.</v>

2296
01:52:56.390 --> 01:53:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because like the bubonic plague,</v>

2297
01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:03.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a fast motion play.</v>

2298
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:08.350
<v Speaker 3>It threatens us in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's literally threatening the </v>

2299
01:53:08.350 --> 01:53:09.380
<v Speaker 3>health of future generations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's shortening our lifespan.</v>

2300
01:53:09.381 --> 01:53:12.050
<v Speaker 3>It's destroying our quality of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big one.</v>

2301
01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you stay alive,</v>

2302
01:53:13.311 --> 01:53:18.311
<v Speaker 3>the quality of life is being devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or as a recent article that came out </v>

2303
01:53:18.311 --> 01:53:20.300
<v Speaker 3>saying just that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like is it was,</v>

2304
01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:22.430
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a paper that looked at,</v>

2305
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:27.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening in our older years and </v>

2306
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.510
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2307
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:30.851
<v Speaker 3>we have a long lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but our quality of life has </v>

2308
01:53:30.851 --> 01:53:33.461
<v Speaker 3>significantly declined in those later </v>
<v Speaker 3>years because we're burdened by all of </v>

2309
01:53:33.461 --> 01:53:33.620
<v Speaker 3>these chronic diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2310
01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:38.621
<v Speaker 3>the average Something like a one in five</v>
<v Speaker 3>are two and five elderly people over 65 </v>

2311
01:53:39.411 --> 01:53:41.360
<v Speaker 3>are taking more than five medications.</v>

2312
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:46.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is the thing you hit on this </v>

2313
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:49.211
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I want to reiterate it because it's </v>

2314
01:53:49.211 --> 01:53:49.970
<v Speaker 3>super important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have accepted chronIc diseases,</v>

2315
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:55.000
<v Speaker 3>normal because it's so common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a really important </v>

2316
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.290
<v Speaker 3>difference between common and normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's common is,</v>

2317
01:53:57.550 --> 01:53:59.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily normal,</v>

2318
01:53:59.691 --> 01:54:04.691
<v Speaker 3>it's now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's now common for people to have </v>

2319
01:54:04.691 --> 01:54:04.691
<v Speaker 3>chronic disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not normal.</v>

2320
01:54:04.691 --> 01:54:06.110
<v Speaker 3>How do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2321
01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:11.140
<v Speaker 3>the tsimané that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a subsistence farming hunter </v>

2322
01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:14.201
<v Speaker 3>gatherer population in Bolivia and </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently there's been some articles in </v>

2323
01:54:14.201 --> 01:54:14.780
<v Speaker 3>the New York times about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

2324
01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:19.781
<v Speaker 3>some anthropologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>medical anthropologists who've gotten </v>

2325
01:54:19.781 --> 01:54:20.540
<v Speaker 3>and doctors and researchers have gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>down there to study them.</v>

2326
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:25.100
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this is one of the last places</v>

2327
01:54:25.101 --> 01:54:28.640
<v Speaker 3>on earth where people are still living </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty traditional diet and lifestyle,</v>

2328
01:54:28.641 --> 01:54:31.010
<v Speaker 3>so we better study this quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2329
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.980
<v Speaker 3>to see what's normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's truly normal for humans.</v>

2330
01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Not common but normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2331
01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:37.720
<v Speaker 3>So they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2332
01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:39.990
<v Speaker 3>paleo type of diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2333
01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:43.040
<v Speaker 3>fruits and vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some meat and fish,</v>

2334
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:45.020
<v Speaker 3>nuts and seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some plantings,</v>

2335
01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.500
<v Speaker 3>other kinds of starches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They walk an average of 17,000</v>

2336
01:54:48.501 --> 01:54:50.300
<v Speaker 3>steps a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is about eight miles.</v>

2337
01:54:50.301 --> 01:54:55.301
<v Speaker 3>So quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They live in sync with the natural </v>

2338
01:54:55.301 --> 01:54:55.301
<v Speaker 3>rhythms of light and dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2339
01:54:55.301 --> 01:54:58.160
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a lot of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>light exposure like we do.</v>

2340
01:54:58.670 --> 01:54:59.960
<v Speaker 3>They sleep seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight hours.</v>

2341
01:54:59.961 --> 01:55:04.961
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the researchers are trying to ask them </v>

2342
01:55:04.961 --> 01:55:04.961
<v Speaker 3>about insomnia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't even have a word for it.</v>

2343
01:55:04.961 --> 01:55:06.590
<v Speaker 3>And their language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they work.</v>

2344
01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:07.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2345
01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're living their normal normal.</v>

2346
01:55:09.650 --> 01:55:12.500
<v Speaker 3>That's as closest we're going to get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a normal human population.</v>

2347
01:55:12.501 --> 01:55:14.720
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they studied,</v>

2348
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:16.100
<v Speaker 3>they studied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2349
01:55:16.130 --> 01:55:17.960
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did blood markers on them for heart</v>

2350
01:55:17.961 --> 01:55:19.040
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not only that,</v>

2351
01:55:19.041 --> 01:55:21.860
<v Speaker 3>they did scans ct scans of their heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2352
01:55:21.861 --> 01:55:26.060
<v Speaker 3>the cfa had calcification of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arteries and they found that the rate of</v>

2353
01:55:26.061 --> 01:55:31.061
<v Speaker 3>heart disease in this population was 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent lower than it was in than it is </v>

2354
01:55:31.061 --> 01:55:31.730
<v Speaker 3>in the us.</v>

2355
01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:34.250
<v Speaker 3>Eighty percent lower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2356
01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Nine and 10 to manet adults that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>studied had absolutely no plaque buildup</v>

2357
01:55:41.721 --> 01:55:46.721
<v Speaker 3>in their arteries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means they have virtually no risk </v>

2358
01:55:46.721 --> 01:55:46.721
<v Speaker 3>of a heart attack as far as we </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand it.</v>

2359
01:55:47.610 --> 01:55:52.610
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before anyone who's listening to this </v>

2360
01:55:52.610 --> 01:55:52.610
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2361
01:55:52.610 --> 01:55:53.970
<v Speaker 3>that's just because hunter gathers all </v>
<v Speaker 3>die when they're 35 years old.</v>

2362
01:55:53.971 --> 01:55:56.250
<v Speaker 3>you know that familiar argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2363
01:55:56.251 --> 01:56:00.810
<v Speaker 3>this study included people between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ages of 40 and 94 years old.</v>

2364
01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.560
<v Speaker 3>What's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tHe researchers estimated that the </v>

2365
01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.261
<v Speaker 3>average simani 80 year old had the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>vascular age as an american in his mid </v>

2366
01:56:09.261 --> 01:56:11.370
<v Speaker 3>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2367
01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:17.180
<v Speaker 3>There's no almost no cognitive disorders</v>
<v Speaker 3>or alzheimer's disease in the </v>

2368
01:56:17.290 --> 01:56:21.600
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a really clear example of what</v>

2369
01:56:21.601 --> 01:56:26.601
<v Speaker 3>happens when you give human beings the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right inputs and they're not exposed to </v>

2370
01:56:26.601 --> 01:56:31.101
<v Speaker 3>all this crap that we're exposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They live long and healthy lives that </v>

2371
01:56:31.101 --> 01:56:35.991
<v Speaker 3>are virtually free of chronic disease </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's despite the fact that they </v>

2372
01:56:35.991 --> 01:56:38.370
<v Speaker 3>have much higher rates of infection than</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do.</v>

2373
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:41.670
<v Speaker 3>They live on a river,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got parasites galore,</v>

2374
01:56:41.671 --> 01:56:43.550
<v Speaker 3>like all of them have parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2375
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:48.060
<v Speaker 3>and yet they still are healthier than us</v>
<v Speaker 3>in almost every way you can measure it.</v>

2376
01:56:48.061 --> 01:56:50.490
<v Speaker 3>They have lower body mass index,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lower blood pressure,</v>

2377
01:56:50.491 --> 01:56:52.770
<v Speaker 3>lower weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't get heart disease.</v>

2378
01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:57.800
<v Speaker 3>They don't get alzheimer's and dementia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not like climbing up the list </v>

2379
01:56:57.800 --> 01:56:58.350
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2380
01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:03.420
<v Speaker 3>of causes of death and tripling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you brought up alzheimer's </v>

2381
01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:05.340
<v Speaker 3>because I read something recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't read the whole article.</v>

2382
01:57:05.341 --> 01:57:09.930
<v Speaker 3>I just read the title of it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>connecting alzheimer's to gut bacteria.</v>

2383
01:57:10.050 --> 01:57:11.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

2384
01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:17.180
<v Speaker 3>There's a strong that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this actually something referred to as </v>

2385
01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:19.020
<v Speaker 3>the gut brain access,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is this very well known connection</v>

2386
01:57:19.021 --> 01:57:21.270
<v Speaker 3>between the gut and the brain and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes both ways.</v>

2387
01:57:21.271 --> 01:57:24.810
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gut can influence the brain strongly</v>

2388
01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.540
<v Speaker 3>and the brain can influence the gut </v>
<v Speaker 3>strongly.</v>

2389
01:57:27.810 --> 01:57:29.640
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2390
01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:33.330
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point is just that what you said,</v>

2391
01:57:33.331 --> 01:57:36.150
<v Speaker 3>when are we going to realize that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>these changes,</v>

2392
01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:41.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making these changes is what we need to </v>

2393
01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:41.220
<v Speaker 3>do to prevent and reverse chronic </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>

2394
01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:41.900
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2395
01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:46.220
<v Speaker 3>we have these examples of people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that show us very clearly that it's</v>

2396
01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:51.260
<v Speaker 3>the way we're living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not our genes that are causing this </v>

2397
01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:53.280
<v Speaker 3>chronic disease epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the easy way would be to,</v>

2398
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:55.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write books about it,</v>

2399
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:57.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have shows like this,</v>

2400
01:57:57.181 --> 01:58:02.181
<v Speaker 3>keep educating people and doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I'm hoping for and </v>

2401
01:58:02.181 --> 01:58:03.140
<v Speaker 3>that's why I wrote my book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2402
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:07.680
<v Speaker 3>but the hard way is that our system </v>
<v Speaker 3>fails,</v>

2403
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:13.070
<v Speaker 3>that it becomes so overburdened by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rising rates of chronic disease and the </v>

2404
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:15.450
<v Speaker 3>unsustainable expenses of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it,</v>

2405
01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:20.540
<v Speaker 3>it basically falls apart and it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2406
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:25.940
<v Speaker 3>we respond in a kind of to it as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crisis that it really is because it </v>

2407
01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:30.111
<v Speaker 3>becomes apparent at that point that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are way that we've been doing it </v>

2408
01:58:30.111 --> 01:58:31.920
<v Speaker 3>has not been working and that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>desperately need to find a new way.</v>

2409
01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:35.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's another possibilitY.</v>

2410
01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:38.160
<v Speaker 3>And which one you think is gonna take </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

2411
01:58:38.161 --> 01:58:43.161
<v Speaker 3>kind of depends on whether you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>glass is half empty or glass is half </v>

2412
01:58:43.161 --> 01:58:43.960
<v Speaker 3>full type of person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2413
01:58:43.961 --> 01:58:46.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from your own personal point of view,</v>

2414
01:58:46.661 --> 01:58:51.661
<v Speaker 3>if you're listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't rely on all those things to </v>

2415
01:58:51.661 --> 01:58:55.561
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just try to go out and do something </v>

2416
01:58:55.561 --> 01:58:55.561
<v Speaker 3>about this for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's how it's really gonna</v>

2417
01:58:55.970 --> 01:59:00.970
<v Speaker 3>you know my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my personal view is it's going to be a </v>

2418
01:59:00.970 --> 01:59:03.601
<v Speaker 3>little of both actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think what's going to happen is </v>

2419
01:59:03.601 --> 01:59:07.410
<v Speaker 3>you're going to start seeing some big </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes on the more local grassroots </v>

2420
01:59:07.410 --> 01:59:09.220
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've already seen stuff like this.</v>

2421
01:59:09.221 --> 01:59:14.221
<v Speaker 3>Examples of be a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a group called iora health and </v>

2422
01:59:14.221 --> 01:59:15.450
<v Speaker 3>denver to primary care group and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2423
01:59:15.490 --> 01:59:18.350
<v Speaker 3>they're reversing type two diabetes with</v>
<v Speaker 3>health coaches now.</v>

2424
01:59:18.370 --> 01:59:23.370
<v Speaker 3>They still see the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they work primarily with a health </v>

2425
01:59:23.370 --> 01:59:23.370
<v Speaker 3>coach who does all those things that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just said.</v>

2426
01:59:23.370 --> 01:59:25.240
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't making that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually go to their house.</v>

2427
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:27.970
<v Speaker 3>They do pantry clean outs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go shopping with them.</v>

2428
01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:31.150
<v Speaker 3>They teach them how to eat well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more than that,</v>

2429
01:59:31.151 --> 01:59:32.230
<v Speaker 3>they just provide the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2430
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:35.740
<v Speaker 3>They're like the accountability buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the person they call them every</v>

2431
01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:37.100
<v Speaker 3>week they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they visit their house.</v>

2432
01:59:37.101 --> 01:59:38.080
<v Speaker 3>So how are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2433
01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:39.300
<v Speaker 3>how can I help?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2434
01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:44.520
<v Speaker 3>and that person's totally empowered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TheY make these changes and they're </v>

2435
01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:47.600
<v Speaker 3>reversing it without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without drugs or with a minimum of </v>

2436
01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:49.630
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a mark hyman who's a doctor,</v>

2437
01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:52.480
<v Speaker 3>pioneer and functional medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He recently,</v>

2438
01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:57.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tapped him to start the center for </v>

2439
01:59:57.580 --> 01:59:57.580
<v Speaker 3>functional medicine at the cleveland </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinic,</v>

2440
01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:02.430
<v Speaker 3>one of the most prestigious </v>
<v Speaker 3>international medical institutions </v>

2441
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:02.730
<v Speaker 3>always on the forefront of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2442
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:06.220
<v Speaker 3>the newest changes in medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when they first started,</v>

2443
02:00:06.610 --> 02:00:11.610
<v Speaker 3>they were in this tiny little space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but within a few months they had like </v>

2444
02:00:11.610 --> 02:00:14.650
<v Speaker 3>3000 patients on their wait list and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they moved to a 17,000</v>

2445
02:00:14.710 --> 02:00:18.520
<v Speaker 3>square foot space and glickman tower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which takes up the whole second floor of</v>

2446
02:00:18.521 --> 02:00:20.080
<v Speaker 3>this building and cleveland clinic.</v>

2447
02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:25.640
<v Speaker 3>And they've got patients from nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries on the waitlist coming from </v>

2448
02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:26.880
<v Speaker 3>all over the world to do the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do functional medicine because they,</v>

2449
02:00:27.090 --> 02:00:32.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people know that the system as it's set </v>

2450
02:00:32.090 --> 02:00:33.070
<v Speaker 3>up isn't really effective for chronic </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>

2451
02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:34.420
<v Speaker 3>It's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2452
02:00:34.421 --> 02:00:36.520
<v Speaker 3>if I get hit by a bus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go to the hospital,</v>

2453
02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:41.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean antibiotics revolutionize how we </v>

2454
02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:43.750
<v Speaker 3>treat infections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have anesthesia made surgery like,</v>

2455
02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:46.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine surgery without anesthesia.</v>

2456
02:00:46.511 --> 02:00:51.511
<v Speaker 3>It was like a bottle of booze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm anti sepsis,</v>

2457
02:00:51.551 --> 02:00:55.990
<v Speaker 3>like cleaning the surgical theaters is </v>
<v Speaker 3>dramatically reduced infections.</v>

2458
02:00:55.991 --> 02:00:58.640
<v Speaker 3>You've got radiology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>radiologic images,</v>

2459
02:00:58.641 --> 02:01:03.641
<v Speaker 3>so that's improved diagnosis of disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So conventional medicine is amazing and </v>

2460
02:01:03.641 --> 02:01:07.180
<v Speaker 3>it's here to stay and we need it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just the wrong tool for the job</v>

2461
02:01:07.410 --> 02:01:09.900
<v Speaker 3>for long for chronic disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nutrition,</v>

2462
02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:11.390
<v Speaker 3>for managing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2463
02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:14.080
<v Speaker 3>using a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going around everywhere with a hammer,</v>

2464
02:01:14.230 --> 02:01:16.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expecting not to work.</v>

2465
02:01:16.030 --> 02:01:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Hammer works really well when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounding a nail and it doesn't work as </v>

2466
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:22.150
<v Speaker 3>well with a screw or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with something else.</v>

2467
02:01:22.690 --> 02:01:27.690
<v Speaker 3>So I mean cleveland clinic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just an amazing proof of concept </v>

2468
02:01:27.690 --> 02:01:29.410
<v Speaker 3>for functional medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then rob wolf,</v>

2469
02:01:29.411 --> 02:01:29.710
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2470
02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:30.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we both know,</v>

2471
02:01:31.330 --> 02:01:34.350
<v Speaker 3>he dId some incredible work with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>city of reno where,</v>

2472
02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:36.480
<v Speaker 3>and the first responders were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2473
02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>they projected that just by doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>intervention.</v>

2474
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:42.700
<v Speaker 1>So what happened was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2475
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:47.770
<v Speaker 1>firefighters and police cops were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were having heart attacks and strokes </v>

2476
02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>and because of the way the pension </v>
<v Speaker 1>plans,</v>

2477
02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are set up if they have to,</v>

2478
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>if the city of reno has to medically </v>
<v Speaker 1>retire these,</v>

2479
02:01:55.190 --> 02:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna spend like millions of </v>

2480
02:02:00.190 --> 02:02:01.100
<v Speaker 1>dollars over the course of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime taking care of them.</v>

2481
02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>so rob went in there with this other </v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

2482
02:02:03.501 --> 02:02:06.140
<v Speaker 1>specialty health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got them on a good,</v>

2483
02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paleo type of diet,</v>

2484
02:02:07.611 --> 02:02:12.611
<v Speaker 1>lower carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got them doing some more physical </v>

2485
02:02:12.611 --> 02:02:15.071
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the estimate that they save the </v>

2486
02:02:15.071 --> 02:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>city of reno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 25 or $30 million dollars</v>

2487
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:21.970
<v Speaker 1>just with this simple intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing a pilot now with the </v>

2488
02:02:21.970 --> 02:02:25.241
<v Speaker 1>berkeley fire department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our clinic with a similar kind of </v>

2489
02:02:25.241 --> 02:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you're going to see all these</v>

2490
02:02:26.121 --> 02:02:31.121
<v Speaker 1>kind of examples of things happening on </v>
<v Speaker 1>local community level because you can </v>

2491
02:02:31.121 --> 02:02:32.120
<v Speaker 1>make changes more quickly that way.</v>

2492
02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:35.720
<v Speaker 1>And then over time some of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to scale up and you know,</v>

2493
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:40.750
<v Speaker 1>we're going to start seeing them maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the state level or the local </v>

2494
02:02:40.750 --> 02:02:43.871
<v Speaker 1>government level and then eventually at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point that's going to get attention</v>

2495
02:02:43.941 --> 02:02:46.730
<v Speaker 1>of people on the federal level who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking around and going,</v>

2496
02:02:46.731 --> 02:02:47.810
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 20,</v>

2497
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:52.910
<v Speaker 1>25 or 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 healthcare expenditures are 35 or 40 </v>

2498
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:54.770
<v Speaker 1>percent of gdp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is completely unsustAinable.</v>

2499
02:02:54.771 --> 02:02:59.771
<v Speaker 1>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not even going to exist as a </v>

2500
02:02:59.771 --> 02:02:59.930
<v Speaker 1>country in 25 years unless we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about this.</v>

2501
02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:03.260
<v Speaker 1>So I kinda think it's gonna gonna gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>go like that.</v>

2502
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it goes towards the,</v>

2503
02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:09.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the model of the cleveland clinic where </v>

2504
02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:12.371
<v Speaker 1>businesses sort of rise up and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of this opportunity to get </v>

2505
02:03:12.371 --> 02:03:14.090
<v Speaker 1>people healthy and to profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2506
02:03:14.091 --> 02:03:16.430
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that's the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things happen.</v>

2507
02:03:16.670 --> 02:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes,</v>

2508
02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:20.210
<v Speaker 1>make it a business or someone can profit</v>
<v Speaker 1>off of it,</v>

2509
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as long as it's affordable for the </v>

2510
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>vast majority of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not unreasonable.</v>

2511
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2512
02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rob has talked about this a lot for </v>

2513
02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2514
02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>if you look at economies of scale and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you looked at things like micro </v>

2515
02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:37.700
<v Speaker 1>microprocessors and dna testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2516
02:03:37.701 --> 02:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>the first human genome sequence was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bill costs like $500,000,000</v>

2517
02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:46.310
<v Speaker 1>right now you can just go out and pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>200 bucks to have the genome sequenced.</v>

2518
02:03:46.311 --> 02:03:51.311
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>microprocessors when they were first </v>

2519
02:03:51.311 --> 02:03:52.580
<v Speaker 1>introduced to computers were as big as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the room and um,</v>

2520
02:03:52.610 --> 02:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars and now anyone can </v>

2521
02:03:57.610 --> 02:04:00.011
<v Speaker 1>go buy a computer for a few hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks while your phone is many times </v>

2522
02:04:00.011 --> 02:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>stronger than is from nasa and the 1960 </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2523
02:04:01.181 --> 02:04:03.300
<v Speaker 1>But we don't see that kind of innovation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in healthcare.</v>

2524
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Like we see expenses going up instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>going down every year.</v>

2525
02:04:07.701 --> 02:04:12.701
<v Speaker 1>It gets more expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a lot of hijacking </v>

2526
02:04:12.701 --> 02:04:12.830
<v Speaker 1>going on with big money and big money </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2527
02:04:12.831 --> 02:04:14.300
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

2528
02:04:14.301 --> 02:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>They don't want anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do this,</v>

2529
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gravy train of money going right </v>

2530
02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>into their pockets when people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

2531
02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:22.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's the key point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2532
02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:23.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rob,</v>

2533
02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:24.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did a,</v>

2534
02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:27.410
<v Speaker 1>what we call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rally to end chronic disease the other</v>

2535
02:04:27.411 --> 02:04:32.411
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then rob came and spoke and so did </v>

2536
02:04:32.411 --> 02:04:32.411
<v Speaker 1>mark hyman from cleveland clinic and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few others,</v>

2537
02:04:32.590 --> 02:04:37.570
<v Speaker 1>and in rob's talk he mentioned that </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare should essentially be free if</v>

2538
02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:38.220
<v Speaker 1>we used,</v>

2539
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:43.220
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we allowed the same forces to that </v>

2540
02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 3>microprocessor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Microprocessors go from being extremely </v>

2541
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.350
<v Speaker 3>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely cheap.</v>

2542
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Dna testing go from being extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive to extremely cheap.</v>

2543
02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:53.130
<v Speaker 3>If we allowed those same forces to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>in on healthcare,</v>

2544
02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:55.110
<v Speaker 3>healthcare would be extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>affordable.</v>

2545
02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:57.930
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you pointed out,</v>

2546
02:04:57.990 --> 02:05:01.140
<v Speaker 3>we have a lot of misaligned incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so insurance companies,</v>

2547
02:05:01.141 --> 02:05:06.141
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they only benefit when the overall </v>

2548
02:05:06.141 --> 02:05:07.080
<v Speaker 3>healthcare expenditures rise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

2549
02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:11.220
<v Speaker 3>the more procedures are ordered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tests are ordered,</v>

2550
02:05:11.490 --> 02:05:14.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>treatments are prescribed.</v>

2551
02:05:14.071 --> 02:05:16.350
<v Speaker 3>The more they know the insurance company</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit.</v>

2552
02:05:16.351 --> 02:05:18.760
<v Speaker 3>That seems counterintuitive to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you would think that</v>

2553
02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:24.020
<v Speaker 2>paying for insurance and the insurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>company is hoping that nothing goes </v>

2554
02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:24.940
<v Speaker 2>wrong because then they'll have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>out far more than that.</v>

2555
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.770
<v Speaker 3>Paying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2556
02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:30.840
<v Speaker 3>There's a great book called catastrophic</v>
<v Speaker 3>care that I recommend for anyone by </v>

2557
02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:31.270
<v Speaker 3>david goldhill for anyone who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in,</v>

2558
02:05:31.271 --> 02:05:34.810
<v Speaker 3>so it really pulls the curtain back on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole system and how it's set up.</v>

2559
02:05:35.410 --> 02:05:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Then you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

2560
02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:39.100
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is it set of the why?</v>

2561
02:05:39.130 --> 02:05:43.450
<v Speaker 3>Why do insurance companies benefit from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from things going wrong?</v>

2562
02:05:44.350 --> 02:05:45.970
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the,</v>

2563
02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:51.240
<v Speaker 3>as the whole edifice or the whole system</v>
<v Speaker 3>of healthcare grows,</v>

2564
02:05:51.550 --> 02:05:54.350
<v Speaker 3>they benefit because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2565
02:05:54.850 --> 02:05:59.850
<v Speaker 3>their recipient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're involved in all of those </v>

2566
02:05:59.850 --> 02:05:59.850
<v Speaker 3>transactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2567
02:05:59.850 --> 02:06:03.610
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have big pharma that um,</v>

2568
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:06.130
<v Speaker 3>is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2569
02:06:06.131 --> 02:06:11.131
<v Speaker 3>their incentive is to sell more drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're for profit corporations and </v>

2570
02:06:11.131 --> 02:06:13.510
<v Speaker 3>their duty is to make a profit for </v>
<v Speaker 3>shareholders and that's how they do it.</v>

2571
02:06:13.511 --> 02:06:17.950
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm selling more drugs is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>always in the same.</v>

2572
02:06:18.110 --> 02:06:22.030
<v Speaker 3>It aligned with the interest of patients</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even have doctors.</v>

2573
02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real issue to me</v>

2574
02:06:23.550 --> 02:06:28.550
<v Speaker 2>that stands out as an example of that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>these stupid fucking commercials that </v>

2575
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:32.451
<v Speaker 2>they have for pharmaceutical drugs where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are having the best time ever </v>

2576
02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:33.930
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at them and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is this is so deceptive.</v>

2577
02:06:33.931 --> 02:06:38.931
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're showing me like best case </v>

2578
02:06:38.931 --> 02:06:38.931
<v Speaker 2>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandpa running,</v>

2579
02:06:38.931 --> 02:06:43.010
<v Speaker 2>pushing the bike and the little kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing and everyone's having the time </v>

2580
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.010
<v Speaker 2>of their life like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2581
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:45.180
<v Speaker 2>I want the time of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I get in on that?</v>

2582
02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Tell the last 15 or 30 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like</v>

2583
02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:50.810
<v Speaker 2>this drug may cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive diarrhea,</v>

2584
02:06:50.811 --> 02:06:52.940
<v Speaker 2>anal bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eyeballs fall out,</v>

2585
02:06:52.941 --> 02:06:55.820
<v Speaker 2>your feet don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite seriously.</v>

2586
02:06:55.821 --> 02:07:00.821
<v Speaker 2>Go on for like 15 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that one that we saw the other </v>

2587
02:07:00.821 --> 02:07:00.950
<v Speaker 2>day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jake humira.</v>

2588
02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that stuff?</v>

2589
02:07:02.150 --> 02:07:04.650
<v Speaker 2>It was for members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said it's like 120 grand for crap.</v>

2590
02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Crappy titus and death is a side effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

2591
02:07:08.091 --> 02:07:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Drug death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suicidal thoughts.</v>

2592
02:07:10.221 --> 02:07:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Contact your physician and he'll tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you a fuck yourself.</v>

2593
02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Wake him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wake him up in the middle of the night </v>

2594
02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:19.120
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me some volume on this.</v>

2595
02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:19.120
<v Speaker 2>We could hear this when I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2596
02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:22.830
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was doing okay too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not looking at was.</v>

2597
02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:29.030
<v Speaker 2>She's managing humira is for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>still have symptoms of moderate to </v>

2598
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:33.080
<v Speaker 2>severe crones disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinical studies,</v>

2599
02:07:33.081 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people on humira saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant symptom</v>

2600
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.980
<v Speaker 4>relief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe achieved remission can tell you </v>

2601
02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:41.740
<v Speaker 4>what significant means.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Tell your doctor if you've been to areas</v>
<v Speaker 4>where certain fungal infections are </v>

2608

<v Speaker 1>successful producer on a television set.</v>

2616

02:08:38.250 --> 02:08:40.020
<v Speaker 1>How manY people work on the set?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at her.</v>

2621
02:08:40.021 --> 02:08:41.040
<v Speaker 1>She's got a folder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2622
02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:44.000
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2623
02:08:44.010 --> 02:08:46.770
<v Speaker 1>because even though she has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>crohn's disease,</v>

2624
02:08:46.771 --> 02:08:51.771
<v Speaker 1>what you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to fucking die in an </v>

2625
02:08:51.771 --> 02:08:52.260
<v Speaker 1>explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imploding,</v>

2626
02:08:52.261 --> 02:08:55.290
<v Speaker 1>rectal or disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>get an infection.</v>

2627
02:08:55.291 --> 02:08:57.290
<v Speaker 1>That would be totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2628
02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:02.520
<v Speaker 1>not not a threat for you or anyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they had taken a drug that </v>

2629
02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:03.630
<v Speaker 1>globally suppresses their immune system </v>
<v Speaker 1>can kill you.</v>

2630
02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

2631
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:06.050
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're,</v>

2632
02:09:06.051 --> 02:09:07.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an infection,</v>

2633
02:09:07.410 --> 02:09:08.250
<v Speaker 1>don't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2634
02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

2635
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Aren't those pretty common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck are you saying like kind of try</v>

2636
02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:16.920
<v Speaker 1>not to get in fact don't get an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infection while you're taking humira.</v>

2637
02:09:16.921 --> 02:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever try to get an infection?</v>

2638
02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you not try to get an infection?</v>

2639
02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2640
02:09:22.201 --> 02:09:26.550
<v Speaker 1>but this is what kills me is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre choice of her being some sort of</v>

2641
02:09:26.551 --> 02:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>a director or producer of a television </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

2642
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:30.510
<v Speaker 1>like they were supposed to relate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2643
02:09:30.511 --> 02:09:34.080
<v Speaker 1>she is so successful and maybe maybe if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take humira,</v>

2644
02:09:34.081 --> 02:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you could also become a producer of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

2645
02:09:36.810 --> 02:09:41.810
<v Speaker 1>There was another one abilify that </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed and it was a antidepressant that </v>

2646
02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:44.850
<v Speaker 1>you give to people that are suicidal </v>
<v Speaker 1>while taking antidepressants.</v>

2647
02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

2648
02:09:46.210 --> 02:09:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2649
02:09:46.630 --> 02:09:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

2650
02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about abilify.</v>

2651
02:09:48.971 --> 02:09:53.971
<v Speaker 1>It's one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the sixth or seventh most </v>

2652
02:09:53.971 --> 02:09:54.240
<v Speaker 1>prescribed drug in the us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an anti psychotic.</v>

2653
02:09:54.630 --> 02:09:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if those two things don't,</v>

2654
02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:03.140
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not resonating and there's a reason </v>

2655
02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:05.391
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have that many psychotics in </v>

2656
02:10:05.391 --> 02:10:06.010
<v Speaker 1>this country where abilify could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2657
02:10:06.150 --> 02:10:08.670
<v Speaker 1>only uses an anti psychotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me some volume.</v>

2658
02:10:08.671 --> 02:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Let's hear this carry on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But other days I still struggled with my</v>

2659
02:10:12.841 --> 02:10:14.940
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was handling it,</v>

2660
02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's just a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been feeling stuck for a long time,</v>

2661
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:23.730
<v Speaker 1>so I talked to my doctor and she added </v>
<v Speaker 1>abilify to my antidepressant.</v>

2662
02:10:23.970 --> 02:10:28.970
<v Speaker 1>She said it could help with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and that some people had </v>

2663
02:10:28.970 --> 02:10:29.580
<v Speaker 1>symptom improvement as early as one to </v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks.</v>

2664
02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I talked to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wiSh I'd done it sooner.</v>

2665
02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Now I feel more in control</v>

2666
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:38.600
<v Speaker 4>of my new for everyone.</v>

<v Speaker 4>of suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>antidepressants can increase these in </v>

2669
02:10:47.291 --> 02:10:47.291
<v Speaker 4>children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>teens,</v>

2670
02:10:47.291 --> 02:10:47.750
<v Speaker 4>and young adults.</v>
<v Speaker 4>elderly dementia,</v>

2671
02:10:47.751 --> 02:10:51.320
<v Speaker 4>patients taking abilify have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>increased risk of death or stroke.</v>

2672
02:10:51.590 --> 02:10:55.580
<v Speaker 4>Call your doctor if you have high fever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stiff muscles and confusion to address a</v>

2673
02:10:55.581 --> 02:11:00.581
<v Speaker 4>possible life threatening condition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or if you have uncontrollable muscle </v>

<v Speaker 4>in extreme cases can lead to coma or </v>

2678
02:11:13.211 --> 02:11:13.211
<v Speaker 4>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which can be serious,</v>

2679
02:11:13.211 --> 02:11:14.150
<v Speaker 4>dizziness on standing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seizures,</v>

2680
02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:16.880
<v Speaker 4>trouble swallowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and impaired judgement or motor skills.</v>

2681
02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:20.970
<v Speaker 4>The person was always hanging over me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That bitch,</v>

2682
02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:25.250
<v Speaker 4>a depressed depression is a concern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you take this shit.</v>

2683
02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:29.960
<v Speaker 4>Most of that commercial was telling </v>
<v Speaker 4>start where they're talking to,</v>

2684
02:11:29.961 --> 02:11:33.830
<v Speaker 4>you cut the segment of the commercial </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the lady comes out,</v>

2685
02:11:33.831 --> 02:11:36.590
<v Speaker 4>the doctor comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>show where the lady doctor is,</v>

2686
02:11:36.591 --> 02:11:41.591
<v Speaker 4>because that's like halfway in the lady </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctor comes out at third and two thirds</v>

2687
02:11:44.151 --> 02:11:47.030
<v Speaker 4>is the lady doctor say you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking die.</v>

2688
02:11:47.070 --> 02:11:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Wait</v>

2689
02:11:47.250 --> 02:11:52.250
<v Speaker 3>is break this down because this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug that's added to a prescription of </v>

2690
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:56.400
<v Speaker 3>someone who's already taking any </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressants to prevent suicidal thoughts</v>

2691
02:11:56.401 --> 02:12:01.401
<v Speaker 3>or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then one of the first side effects </v>

2692
02:12:01.401 --> 02:12:01.590
<v Speaker 3>they said to look out for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suicidal thoughts?</v>

2693
02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2694
02:12:03.550 --> 02:12:08.550
<v Speaker 3>maybe there'll be a third drug that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are already on </v>

2695
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:11.721
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants and abilify can take for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suicidal thoughts that abilify </v>

2696
02:12:11.881 --> 02:12:15.580
<v Speaker 3>wasn't able to get rid of from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>original antidepressant.</v>

2697
02:12:15.581 --> 02:12:20.581
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we're just being cynical and </v>

2698
02:12:20.581 --> 02:12:21.940
<v Speaker 3>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just need to trust in that cartoon </v>

2699
02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:23.760
<v Speaker 3>lady with a great voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is amnesia.</v>

2700
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.790
<v Speaker 3>So loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a good example.</v>

2701
02:12:27.090 --> 02:12:28.950
<v Speaker 3>We've all heard this term evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>based,</v>

2702
02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:29.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2703
02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.520
<v Speaker 3>and the idea is that conventional </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine is evidenced based and </v>

2704
02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:34.520
<v Speaker 3>everything else is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2705
02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:37.290
<v Speaker 3>that's total bs because this an abilify </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a great example.</v>

2706
02:12:37.291 --> 02:12:39.750
<v Speaker 3>It's an anti psychotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it was approved for,</v>

2707
02:12:39.870 --> 02:12:42.420
<v Speaker 3>for psychosis and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a lot of,</v>

2708
02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:46.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean recent events indicate that we do</v>
<v Speaker 3>have quite a few psych psych,</v>

2709
02:12:47.250 --> 02:12:49.000
<v Speaker 3>psychotic people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2710
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:51.090
<v Speaker 3>mass shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

2711
02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:53.640
<v Speaker 3>but not that many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2712
02:12:53.641 --> 02:12:58.641
<v Speaker 3>not enough to make abilify that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventh leading a drug on a sales basis.</v>

2713
02:12:59.790 --> 02:13:01.590
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an insane number.</v>

2714
02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:06.920
<v Speaker 3>So what abilify is prescribed off label,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so off label means a way of using the </v>

2715
02:13:07.261 --> 02:13:12.261
<v Speaker 3>drug that has never been a studier or </v>
<v Speaker 3>approved by the fda for that particular </v>

2716
02:13:12.261 --> 02:13:17.091
<v Speaker 3>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's using a drug in a way that was </v>

2717
02:13:17.091 --> 02:13:17.760
<v Speaker 3>not originally studied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that legal?</v>

2718
02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:23.060
<v Speaker 3>It's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doctors have the authority to prescribe </v>

2719
02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:24.150
<v Speaker 3>medications off label as long as they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>fda approved,</v>

2720
02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:28.110
<v Speaker 3>fda approved for something that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>vast.</v>

2721
02:13:28.111 --> 02:13:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Majority of abilify prescriptions </v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore are label,</v>

2722
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:35.940
<v Speaker 3>which means they've never been studied </v>
<v Speaker 3>or shown to be safe or effective for the</v>

2723
02:13:35.941 --> 02:13:38.100
<v Speaker 3>conditions that it's being prescribed </v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

2724
02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:41.880
<v Speaker 2>So your doctor could legally prescribe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you birth control pills?</v>

2725
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2726
02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:47.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean it would be frowned upon and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe if they did that enough and it was</v>

2727
02:13:47.621 --> 02:13:48.730
<v Speaker 3>causing problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>

2728
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:50.980
<v Speaker 3>they would have to justify why they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it,</v>

2729
02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:52.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's the missing key to abilify</v>

2730
02:13:52.930 --> 02:13:57.910
<v Speaker 2>for men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay female birth control pills,</v>

2731
02:13:57.911 --> 02:13:58.750
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh wow,</v>

2732
02:13:58.751 --> 02:13:59.200
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

2733
02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also means they can use it in a </v>

2734
02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:04.720
<v Speaker 3>population that hasn't been studied for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

2735
02:14:04.721 --> 02:14:06.730
<v Speaker 3>a drug has been studied and approved for</v>
<v Speaker 3>adults.</v>

2736
02:14:06.731 --> 02:14:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It said not safe,</v>

2737
02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:13.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't be used for children and </v>

2738
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:13.950
<v Speaker 3>the elderly because it's never been </v>
<v Speaker 3>studied,</v>

2739
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:15.640
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean it's not being </v>
<v Speaker 3>prescribed for children or the elderly.</v>

2740
02:14:15.641 --> 02:14:18.460
<v Speaker 3>It's still definitely is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2741
02:14:18.670 --> 02:14:23.670
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants have been shown to cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>to suicidal ideation in adolescents and </v>

2742
02:14:23.670 --> 02:14:27.991
<v Speaker 3>teenagers in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yet they are still often used in </v>

2743
02:14:27.991 --> 02:14:27.991
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that group,</v>

2744
02:14:27.991 --> 02:14:30.430
<v Speaker 3>even though they were never studied or </v>
<v Speaker 3>approved for that</v>

2745
02:14:30.530 --> 02:14:32.180
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this one,</v>

2746
02:14:32.181 --> 02:14:33.020
<v Speaker 2>jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bill,</v>

2747
02:14:33.140 --> 02:14:36.500
<v Speaker 2>a bill top selling year seven</v>

2748
02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:38.880
<v Speaker 3>below the top selling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

2749
02:14:38.881 --> 02:14:41.580
<v Speaker 3>It's a toxin while you're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the number seven.</v>

2750
02:14:41.581 --> 02:14:43.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a silly me.</v>

2751
02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:48.690
<v Speaker 2>So the top selling drug is an anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotic,</v>

2752
02:14:48.810 --> 02:14:50.260
<v Speaker 2>is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is real,</v>

2753
02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:52.530
<v Speaker 2>but is it still the top selling drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>will whatever,</v>

2754
02:14:52.590 --> 02:14:57.590
<v Speaker 2>let's not even look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in 2014 it was the top selling drug </v>

2755
02:14:57.590 --> 02:15:02.320
<v Speaker 2>that is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has become the best selling drug in the </v>

2756
02:15:02.671 --> 02:15:03.750
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

2757
02:15:05.530 --> 02:15:10.530
<v Speaker 3>The alarms about the dangerous and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes deadly side effects of anti </v>

2758
02:15:10.530 --> 02:15:14.071
<v Speaker 3>psychotics affecting children and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>elderly among others have been mounting </v>

2759
02:15:14.071 --> 02:15:14.071
<v Speaker 3>for years.</v>

2760
02:15:14.690 --> 02:15:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's terrifying.</v>

2761
02:15:17.890 --> 02:15:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And many of these symptoms could be </v>

2762
02:15:22.890 --> 02:15:26.711
<v Speaker 2>directly related to gut biome gut </v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria and you might be able to nip it</v>

2763
02:15:28.461 --> 02:15:31.520
<v Speaker 2>in the bud with a change in diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2764
02:15:31.610 --> 02:15:35.960
<v Speaker 2>with addressing the sedentary lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 2>rigorous exercise.</v>

2765
02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.450
<v Speaker 2>So let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you asked all these things.</v>

2766
02:15:38.451 --> 02:15:43.451
<v Speaker 2>Meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like what you're prescribing </v>

2767
02:15:43.451 --> 02:15:43.451
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2768
02:15:43.451 --> 02:15:43.451
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't be that easy.</v>

2769
02:15:43.451 --> 02:15:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the first chapter in my </v>

2770
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:51.041
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about a kid named leo that I </v>

2771
02:15:51.041 --> 02:15:51.041
<v Speaker 2>treated my clinic furious back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's eight years old,</v>

2772
02:15:51.041 --> 02:15:52.190
<v Speaker 2>eight years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he came to see me,</v>

2773
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:58.350
<v Speaker 3>we're like a rack when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they came to the office because </v>

2774
02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:58.350
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2775
02:15:58.350 --> 02:16:00.020
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just totally worn down.</v>

2776
02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:05.380
<v Speaker 3>He would throw these epic tantrums where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be screaming and crying and riding </v>

2777
02:16:05.691 --> 02:16:09.440
<v Speaker 3>on the floor for just the most random </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

2778
02:16:09.441 --> 02:16:14.441
<v Speaker 3>like trying to get his shoes tied is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going out the door or you </v>

2779
02:16:14.441 --> 02:16:17.461
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not cutting the crust off his bread </v>

2780
02:16:17.461 --> 02:16:19.270
<v Speaker 3>sandwich and just the right way or </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting a stay on his favorite tee </v>

2781
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:20.240
<v Speaker 3>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a super limited diet.</v>

2782
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:25.270
<v Speaker 3>He had only a handful of foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of them processed and refined like </v>

2783
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.270
<v Speaker 3>toaster waffles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bread,</v>

2784
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:26.510
<v Speaker 3>crackers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cookies,</v>

2785
02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:28.300
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2786
02:16:28.630 --> 02:16:33.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were concerned about nutrient </v>

2787
02:16:33.630 --> 02:16:35.041
<v Speaker 3>deficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every time they tried to </v>

2788
02:16:35.041 --> 02:16:35.041
<v Speaker 3>reintroduce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to introduce a different food,</v>

2789
02:16:35.041 --> 02:16:38.701
<v Speaker 3>he would go ballistic and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the energy to fight him at every </v>

2790
02:16:38.701 --> 02:16:38.701
<v Speaker 3>meal.</v>

2791
02:16:38.701 --> 02:16:40.870
<v Speaker 3>He was really rigid about his behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>and environment.</v>

2792
02:16:40.871 --> 02:16:45.190
<v Speaker 3>So like everything had to be just right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the toys in his room or range in just</v>

2793
02:16:45.191 --> 02:16:45.910
<v Speaker 3>the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2794
02:16:45.970 --> 02:16:49.270
<v Speaker 3>he'd fly off the handle desks in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>classroom.</v>

2795
02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:50.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the right way.</v>

2796
02:16:50.921 --> 02:16:55.921
<v Speaker 3>He'd fly off the handle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was really anxious in unfamiliar </v>

2797
02:16:55.921 --> 02:16:57.460
<v Speaker 3>environments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's hard for them to leave the house</v>

2798
02:16:57.461 --> 02:17:00.610
<v Speaker 3>for even a few hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much less travel or go on vacations.</v>

2799
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:02.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this seems extreme,</v>

2800
02:17:02.051 --> 02:17:04.990
<v Speaker 3>but there are a lot of kids with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of behavioral disorders now.</v>

2801
02:17:04.991 --> 02:17:06.120
<v Speaker 3>He was not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2802
02:17:06.130 --> 02:17:08.560
<v Speaker 3>he's not alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2803
02:17:08.650 --> 02:17:13.650
<v Speaker 3>so they took him to see doctors locally </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they started with the primary care </v>

2804
02:17:13.661 --> 02:17:18.661
<v Speaker 3>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then went to psychiatrist and then </v>

2805
02:17:18.661 --> 02:17:20.641
<v Speaker 3>several behavioral disorder specialists </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually down here at usc or ucla and </v>

2806
02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:24.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2807
02:17:24.371 --> 02:17:29.371
<v Speaker 3>first diagnosed on the autism spectrum </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then eventually ocd and something </v>

2808
02:17:29.371 --> 02:17:33.841
<v Speaker 3>called sensory processing disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like on the autism spectrum </v>

2809
02:17:33.841 --> 02:17:34.960
<v Speaker 3>where they're really sensitive to scent </v>
<v Speaker 3>scent,</v>

2810
02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:36.850
<v Speaker 3>sense input,</v>
<v Speaker 3>touch,</v>

2811
02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:38.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sound cetera.</v>

2812
02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:40.600
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2813
02:17:41.470 --> 02:17:42.940
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctors,</v>

2814
02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:43.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2815
02:17:43.781 --> 02:17:45.820
<v Speaker 3>they were relieved at first to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these diagnoses,</v>

2816
02:17:45.821 --> 02:17:49.030
<v Speaker 3>but very quickly it became apparent that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just labeled sort of symptoms.</v>

2817
02:17:49.031 --> 02:17:52.210
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't anything that actually gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>them information about what to do.</v>

2818
02:17:52.630 --> 02:17:55.600
<v Speaker 3>And then the doc when asked the doctor </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the treatment was,</v>

2819
02:17:55.780 --> 02:18:00.040
<v Speaker 3>the answer was medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they first started with adderall,</v>

2820
02:18:00.041 --> 02:18:05.041
<v Speaker 3>which you mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then rhydlin both stimulants and then </v>

2821
02:18:05.041 --> 02:18:08.791
<v Speaker 3>eventually antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which again have not really been </v>

2822
02:18:08.791 --> 02:18:11.581
<v Speaker 3>approved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's safe or effective in kids and they </v>

2823
02:18:11.581 --> 02:18:12.550
<v Speaker 3>did help at least a little bit with some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the symptoms,</v>

2824
02:18:12.610 --> 02:18:15.520
<v Speaker 3>but then he got a lot of brutal side </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects,</v>

2825
02:18:16.330 --> 02:18:18.400
<v Speaker 3>got pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dry mouth,</v>

2826
02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:20.680
<v Speaker 3>irritability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>headaches,</v>

2827
02:18:20.681 --> 02:18:23.350
<v Speaker 3>and the worst thing was severe sleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>disruption.</v>

2828
02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:25.210
<v Speaker 3>And he had two younger brothers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sisters.</v>

2829
02:18:25.211 --> 02:18:27.130
<v Speaker 3>So it was parents definitely didn't need</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of that.</v>

2830
02:18:27.970 --> 02:18:30.790
<v Speaker 3>And the crazy thing throughout this </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire period,</v>

2831
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:36.030
<v Speaker 3>not one of his doctors even hinted at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the possibility that something in its </v>

2832
02:18:36.030 --> 02:18:39.661
<v Speaker 3>diet or like a disrupted gut microbiome </v>
<v Speaker 3>or nutrient deficiency could even be </v>

2833
02:18:39.661 --> 02:18:40.630
<v Speaker 3>contributing to his symptoms.</v>

2834
02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Nobody even brought that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not the exception.</v>

2835
02:18:43.631 --> 02:18:45.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2836
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:47.170
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2837
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:49.210
<v Speaker 3>his parents weren't thrilled about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2838
02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:55.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't thrilled about medicating </v>

2839
02:18:55.980 --> 02:18:58.351
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they did it because they had no </v>

2840
02:18:58.351 --> 02:18:59.911
<v Speaker 3>other option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And nobody suggested that it could be </v>

2841
02:18:59.911 --> 02:18:59.911
<v Speaker 3>anything other than just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2842
02:19:00.010 --> 02:19:02.110
<v Speaker 3>something wrong with their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their son.</v>

2843
02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:06.010
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fortunately one of his mom's friends had</v>

2844
02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:09.550
<v Speaker 3>sent a couple of articles from my blog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One was on the gut brain axis,</v>

2845
02:19:09.551 --> 02:19:14.551
<v Speaker 3>which we've been talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another was on all of the underlying </v>

2846
02:19:14.551 --> 02:19:17.020
<v Speaker 3>causes of behavioral disorders in kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they brought him to my clinic.</v>

2847
02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did a whole bunch of testing as I do </v>

2848
02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:22.560
<v Speaker 3>with all my new patients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not surprisingly,</v>

2849
02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:24.850
<v Speaker 3>we found he had a disrupted gut </v>
<v Speaker 3>microbiome.</v>

2850
02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:27.860
<v Speaker 3>He had cbo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bacterial overgrowth in the intestine.</v>

2851
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:33.370
<v Speaker 3>He had a non celiac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten sensitivity and gluten was in </v>

2852
02:19:33.370 --> 02:19:33.920
<v Speaker 3>almost every food he was eating.</v>

2853
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:39.190
<v Speaker 3>But he also had an intolerance of some </v>
<v Speaker 3>other proteins like dairy and soy and </v>

2854
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:40.670
<v Speaker 3>corn and buckwheat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which were in the toaster waffles.</v>

2855
02:19:40.671 --> 02:19:42.590
<v Speaker 3>He was eating every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2856
02:19:42.591 --> 02:19:44.400
<v Speaker 3>deficiencies of vitamin d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>

2857
02:19:44.401 --> 02:19:48.200
<v Speaker 3>12 fully and iron because he was eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>just flower,</v>

2858
02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:52.340
<v Speaker 3>basically flour and sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had high levels of arsenic,</v>

2859
02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:56.240
<v Speaker 3>which is a heavy metal because the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>other beverage he would drink aside from</v>

2860
02:19:56.241 --> 02:19:57.860
<v Speaker 3>water was rice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>milk and rice.</v>

2861
02:19:57.861 --> 02:20:01.520
<v Speaker 3>Milk has been shown to have higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels of arsenic,</v>

2862
02:20:01.521 --> 02:20:06.521
<v Speaker 3>so if a kid's just pounding rice milk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could actually start to develop </v>

2863
02:20:06.521 --> 02:20:07.490
<v Speaker 3>levels of arsenic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could be problematic because that's</v>

2864
02:20:07.491 --> 02:20:10.280
<v Speaker 3>crazy because a lot of people think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rice milk as a healthy beverage.</v>

2865
02:20:10.281 --> 02:20:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2866
02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:12.790
<v Speaker 3>so we start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2867
02:20:12.791 --> 02:20:15.680
<v Speaker 3>we started treating him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which wasn't easy because of his ocd,</v>

2868
02:20:15.681 --> 02:20:20.681
<v Speaker 3>like tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really hard to get him to change </v>

2869
02:20:20.681 --> 02:20:20.681
<v Speaker 3>his diet.</v>

2870
02:20:20.681 --> 02:20:24.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we just started focusing just on </v>

2871
02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:26.801
<v Speaker 3>those mechanisms that I talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting him some more nutrients and </v>

2872
02:20:26.801 --> 02:20:27.070
<v Speaker 3>treating his god and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dealing,</v>

2873
02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:32.200
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get some of those things out </v>

2874
02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:33.881
<v Speaker 3>of his food initially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just switching those brands of toaster </v>

2875
02:20:33.881 --> 02:20:37.931
<v Speaker 3>waffles so that at least they were made </v>
<v Speaker 3>from stuff that he wasn't clearly </v>

2876
02:20:37.931 --> 02:20:40.871
<v Speaker 3>reacting to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then gradually over time shifting </v>

2877
02:20:40.871 --> 02:20:40.970
<v Speaker 3>within,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within several weeks,</v>

2878
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:46.600
<v Speaker 3>he was having fewer tantrums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was less set off by the things that </v>

2879
02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:48.380
<v Speaker 3>would have done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About four months into the treatment,</v>

2880
02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:51.140
<v Speaker 3>his teacher called home from school and </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

2881
02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:53.420
<v Speaker 3>where's leo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2882
02:20:53.450 --> 02:20:55.160
<v Speaker 3>what have you done with leo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who's this guy?</v>

2883
02:20:55.161 --> 02:21:00.161
<v Speaker 3>Who was sending the school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has plates because it had been </v>

2884
02:21:00.161 --> 02:21:01.300
<v Speaker 3>horrific for her as as his teacher at </v>
<v Speaker 3>school and you know,</v>

2885
02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:06.340
<v Speaker 3>to the point where it's parents often </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to come pick him up and bring them </v>

2886
02:21:06.340 --> 02:21:06.340
<v Speaker 3>home from school because he was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>disruptive.</v>

2887
02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:11.210
<v Speaker 3>Then I talked to leo's mom maybe six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven months into the treatment.</v>

2888
02:21:11.420 --> 02:21:13.190
<v Speaker 3>By then we had to follow up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>test back.</v>

2889
02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:17.080
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the issues that we set out to </v>
<v Speaker 3>address had been resolved is dieted,</v>

2890
02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:22.180
<v Speaker 3>expanded significantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was eating foods that he would have </v>

2891
02:21:22.180 --> 02:21:24.380
<v Speaker 3>thrown against the wall just a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>months before he was more tolerant,</v>

2892
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:29.710
<v Speaker 3>more affectionate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm less controlling and rigid and just </v>

2893
02:21:29.710 --> 02:21:33.371
<v Speaker 3>better adjusted kid overall and at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of that time his mom said something </v>

2894
02:21:34.521 --> 02:21:37.820
<v Speaker 3>that really struck me and it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's why I wrote the book.</v>

2895
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:40.910
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't more doctors know about this?</v>

2896
02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:46.240
<v Speaker 3>There's so many kids out there like leo </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are suffering from these kinds of </v>

2897
02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:46.880
<v Speaker 3>behavioral disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but neither their parents,</v>

2898
02:21:46.881 --> 02:21:51.881
<v Speaker 3>northern doctors or even looking at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>other stuff like the diet and the gut </v>

2899
02:21:51.881 --> 02:21:56.441
<v Speaker 3>and all these things so it's not even a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration and that's why I want to </v>

2900
02:21:56.441 --> 02:22:00.620
<v Speaker 3>get this book out there because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like we can't know and and,</v>

2901
02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:02.680
<v Speaker 3>and treat what we're not even looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

2902
02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:05.270
<v Speaker 2>What's crazY is what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary,</v>

2903
02:22:05.271 --> 02:22:05.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

2904
02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's common sense,</v>

2905
02:22:07.781 --> 02:22:09.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's food,</v>

2906
02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:10.030
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

2907
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:15.070
<v Speaker 2>you essentially restructured the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ecosystem of this child's body and,</v>

2908
02:22:15.130 --> 02:22:18.470
<v Speaker 2>and brought them back to homeostasis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You brought them back to some sort of,</v>

2909
02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:24.130
<v Speaker 2>some normal functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some and this poor kid was living with a</v>

2910
02:22:25.261 --> 02:22:26.250
<v Speaker 2>diet that</v>

2911
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:29.850
<v Speaker 3>a giant percentage of our country is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is consuming.</v>

2912
02:22:30.210 --> 02:22:35.210
<v Speaker 3>A lot of kids are eating sugar cereals </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning and peanut butter and </v>

2913
02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:39.561
<v Speaker 3>jelly sandwiches and just white bread </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sugar is lunch packs with the </v>

2914
02:22:41.601 --> 02:22:42.780
<v Speaker 3>lunchable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although,</v>

2915
02:22:44.450 --> 02:22:49.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even worse in kids because there's </v>

2916
02:22:49.450 --> 02:22:50.400
<v Speaker 3>this idea that big food has been very </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>

2917
02:22:50.401 --> 02:22:53.730
<v Speaker 3>It perpetuating that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids need special kids foods.</v>

2918
02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:55.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't just eat what we're eating as</v>

2919
02:22:55.681 --> 02:22:57.900
<v Speaker 3>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to prepare kids meals.</v>

2920
02:22:57.901 --> 02:22:59.910
<v Speaker 3>You go to a restaurant and there's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid's menu,</v>

2921
02:23:00.340 --> 02:23:05.340
<v Speaker 3>go to a great restaurant that has meat </v>
<v Speaker 3>and vegetables and all this stuff on </v>

2922
02:23:05.340 --> 02:23:05.730
<v Speaker 3>what is the kid's menu have on it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicken fingers,</v>

2923
02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:08.160
<v Speaker 3>cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pasta with nothing on it.</v>

2924
02:23:08.161 --> 02:23:10.430
<v Speaker 3>Just total crap bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea,</v>

2925
02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:12.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we go out with my daughter,</v>

2926
02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:14.820
<v Speaker 3>they always bring us the kid's menu and </v>
<v Speaker 3>my daughter's like,</v>

2927
02:23:14.850 --> 02:23:15.870
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to see that.</v>

2928
02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:18.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm ordering off this menu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

2929
02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:23.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't need breakfast cereal or pop </v>

2930
02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:23.540
<v Speaker 3>tarts who need this craft kits just need</v>
<v Speaker 3>to eat.</v>

2931
02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:28.250
<v Speaker 3>It's even more important for kids to eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>well than it is for us because their </v>

2932
02:23:28.250 --> 02:23:29.910
<v Speaker 3>brain is still developing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their body's still developing.</v>

2933
02:23:30.390 --> 02:23:35.390
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean someday we'll go to the doctor </v>

2934
02:23:35.390 --> 02:23:35.390
<v Speaker 3>and you have a chronic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2935
02:23:35.390 --> 02:23:39.380
<v Speaker 3>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first questions are going to be </v>

2936
02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:39.380
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you eating?</v>

2937
02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:40.350
<v Speaker 3>How are you living?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait,</v>

2938
02:23:40.351 --> 02:23:42.630
<v Speaker 3>let's do some tests to find out how your</v>
<v Speaker 3>gut is.</v>

2939
02:23:42.690 --> 02:23:45.180
<v Speaker 3>Let's do some tests to see if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrient deficient.</v>

2940
02:23:45.181 --> 02:23:50.181
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's actually look at the causes </v>

2941
02:23:50.181 --> 02:23:52.011
<v Speaker 3>instead of just assuming that every </v>
<v Speaker 3>chronic disease is a deficiency of a </v>

2942
02:23:52.011 --> 02:23:53.350
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2943
02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:56.490
<v Speaker 3>That's basically how it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have high cholesterol,</v>

2944
02:23:56.491 --> 02:24:01.491
<v Speaker 3>you have a stat and deficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we better correct that by giving you </v>

2945
02:24:01.491 --> 02:24:01.491
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2946
02:24:01.491 --> 02:24:02.130
<v Speaker 3>You have high blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a diarrhetic deficiency.</v>

2947
02:24:02.131 --> 02:24:03.510
<v Speaker 3>We're going to give you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have depression,</v>

2948
02:24:03.511 --> 02:24:06.420
<v Speaker 3>you have an antidepressant deficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to give you that drug.</v>

2949
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:10.200
<v Speaker 3>Basically how it's looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is how it's looked at.</v>

2950
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:14.040
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat food,</v>

2951
02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:16.560
<v Speaker 3>eat real food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat food.</v>

2952
02:24:16.980 --> 02:24:17.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if people,</v>

2953
02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:23.100
<v Speaker 3>if we ate real food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like probably that could shave off like </v>

2954
02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:27.770
<v Speaker 3>a couple trillion dollars from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>health care and how much more effective </v>

2955
02:24:27.770 --> 02:24:30.540
<v Speaker 3>would we be at whatever we're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much healthier would people be?</v>

2956
02:24:30.541 --> 02:24:32.410
<v Speaker 3>How much happier would people be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2957
02:24:32.450 --> 02:24:37.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not just about health in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrow sense of the lIke the absence of </v>

2958
02:24:37.450 --> 02:24:41.301
<v Speaker 3>symptoms or the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about your ability to </v>

2959
02:24:41.301 --> 02:24:42.330
<v Speaker 3>perform at work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ability to relate to your kids,</v>

2960
02:24:42.420 --> 02:24:43.920
<v Speaker 3>to your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2961
02:24:43.950 --> 02:24:48.950
<v Speaker 3>wonder how much of the antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the people that are prescribed are </v>

2962
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:51.420
<v Speaker 3>people that are experiencing depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to do with their diet.</v>

2963
02:24:52.620 --> 02:24:54.690
<v Speaker 3>I would say quite a high percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2964
02:24:54.691 --> 02:24:59.691
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there are situational factors </v>

2965
02:24:59.691 --> 02:24:59.691
<v Speaker 3>that cause depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2966
02:24:59.691 --> 02:25:04.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for someone who is poor and lives in an </v>

2967
02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:05.850
<v Speaker 3>economically and socially depressed area</v>
<v Speaker 3>and is fighting,</v>

2968
02:25:05.940 --> 02:25:08.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>systemic oppression,</v>

2969
02:25:08.610 --> 02:25:11.110
<v Speaker 3>there's good reason to be depressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

2970
02:25:11.130 --> 02:25:16.130
<v Speaker 3>So nevertheless a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given what we understand now about this </v>

2971
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:20.631
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory model of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also true that that is the very </v>

2972
02:25:21.031 --> 02:25:22.980
<v Speaker 3>least going to exacerbate it and make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2973
02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:28.440
<v Speaker 3>but in some cases may be the primary </v>
<v Speaker 3>driver of depression and I can't tell </v>

2974
02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:31.180
<v Speaker 3>you how many patients I've had who've </v>
<v Speaker 3>had depression that they thought was.</v>

2975
02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:34.960
<v Speaker 3>IT was something wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something broken about them.</v>

2976
02:25:35.370 --> 02:25:36.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

2977
02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:39.430
<v Speaker 3>they're not cut out for this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't fit in here.</v>

2978
02:25:39.431 --> 02:25:41.410
<v Speaker 3>That sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we go in,</v>

2979
02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:42.430
<v Speaker 3>we see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2980
02:25:42.490 --> 02:25:47.490
<v Speaker 3>you've got a severe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be 12 or fully deficiency that affects </v>

2981
02:25:47.490 --> 02:25:47.490
<v Speaker 3>your neurotransmitter levels.</v>

2982
02:25:47.490 --> 02:25:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a disrupted gut microbiome.</v>

2983
02:25:49.061 --> 02:25:50.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got,</v>

2984
02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:52.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a blood sugar abnormalities.</v>

2985
02:25:52.601 --> 02:25:53.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hypo thyroid.</v>

2986
02:25:53.621 --> 02:25:56.830
<v Speaker 3>We know 20 or 30 percent of patients </v>
<v Speaker 3>with depression have hypo thyroid.</v>

2987
02:25:56.831 --> 02:25:58.810
<v Speaker 3>So just correcting that could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could correct it.</v>

2988
02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:04.200
<v Speaker 3>Can we address all Those things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden that person's no longer </v>

2989
02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:04.720
<v Speaker 3>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've had people say things like,</v>

2990
02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:10.200
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the last 20 years I thought </v>

2991
02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:10.200
<v Speaker 3>something was wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was broken.</v>

2992
02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:14.521
<v Speaker 3>I thought like I really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was me and something was really </v>

2993
02:26:14.521 --> 02:26:15.730
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy word too.</v>

2994
02:26:15.731 --> 02:26:20.731
<v Speaker 3>The problem with depression is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a diagnosis and that if you just said </v>

2995
02:26:20.731 --> 02:26:21.910
<v Speaker 3>feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel bad,</v>

2996
02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:23.530
<v Speaker 3>would not be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2997
02:26:23.531 --> 02:26:25.640
<v Speaker 3>he's been diagnosed with feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2998
02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:28.690
<v Speaker 3>But that's essential with depression is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so blanket.</v>

2999
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:31.600
<v Speaker 3>It can cover a host of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurological issues,</v>

3000
02:26:31.601 --> 02:26:36.601
<v Speaker 3>physiological issues or behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues that are there because of your </v>

3001
02:26:36.601 --> 02:26:37.540
<v Speaker 3>environment and your life experiences.</v>

3002
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:40.390
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was not an unintentional thing,</v>

3003
02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:43.330
<v Speaker 3>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a drug companies creating it as</v>

3004
02:26:43.331 --> 02:26:48.331
<v Speaker 3>a disease to that because diseases </v>
<v Speaker 3>require medications to be fixed in our </v>

3005
02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:51.070
<v Speaker 3>culture and this happens across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>board and it's not,</v>

3006
02:26:51.470 --> 02:26:52.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3007
02:26:52.301 --> 02:26:54.670
<v Speaker 3>the story of viagara and how that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed.</v>

3008
02:26:54.900 --> 02:26:57.670
<v Speaker 3>It was some sort of a blood pressure </v>
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>

3009
02:26:57.671 --> 02:26:58.540
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3010
02:26:58.660 --> 02:27:00.510
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3011
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:01.430
<v Speaker 3>jack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jackpot.</v>

3012
02:27:02.050 --> 02:27:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they found like,</v>

3013
02:27:03.731 --> 02:27:05.920
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't working very well for what we</v>

3014
02:27:05.921 --> 02:27:07.060
<v Speaker 3>designed it for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3015
02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:10.810
<v Speaker 3>but it's got some pretty interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects and so,</v>

3016
02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:15.960
<v Speaker 3>but they knew it wasn't enough to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>then go out there and start selling it </v>

3017
02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:15.960
<v Speaker 3>for two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got to say,</v>

3018
02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:18.340
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a drug that will help you know,</v>

3019
02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:20.220
<v Speaker 3>make you perform better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3020
02:27:20.260 --> 02:27:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't enough.</v>

3021
02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:27.240
<v Speaker 3>What they had to do is create a disease </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it could be prescribed for because </v>

3022
02:27:27.341 --> 02:27:27.700
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

3023
02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:28.800
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3024
02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:30.590
<v Speaker 3>and you know how they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hired a,</v>

3025
02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:35.700
<v Speaker 3>an advertising agency and the ad agency </v>
<v Speaker 3>came up with the term erectile </v>

3026
02:27:35.700 --> 02:27:37.270
<v Speaker 3>dysfunction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No way.</v>

3027
02:27:37.271 --> 02:27:38.980
<v Speaker 3>And created this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No way.</v>

3028
02:27:38.981 --> 02:27:43.981
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's publicly available information </v>

3029
02:27:43.981 --> 02:27:46.480
<v Speaker 3>agency named a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not the only case where this has</v>

3030
02:27:46.481 --> 02:27:50.140
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they create this disease category and</v>

3031
02:27:50.141 --> 02:27:55.141
<v Speaker 3>then they get it out into the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they advertise it to people and to </v>

3032
02:27:55.141 --> 02:27:58.240
<v Speaker 3>doctors and so all of a sudden people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are going in with a magazine or like,</v>

3033
02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:02.440
<v Speaker 3>this is me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have erectile dysfunction,</v>

3034
02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:07.860
<v Speaker 3>and I know now there's a drug called </v>
<v Speaker 3>viagara that I need because I have </v>

3035
02:28:07.860 --> 02:28:09.520
<v Speaker 3>erectile dysfunction and the doctor has </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen the.</v>

3036
02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:12.430
<v Speaker 3>They have their own brochure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pull out their brochure and it says</v>

3037
02:28:12.431 --> 02:28:14.500
<v Speaker 3>erectile dysfunction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here are the signs and symptoms.</v>

3038
02:28:14.501 --> 02:28:15.070
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>

3039
02:28:15.071 --> 02:28:15.520
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check,</v>

3040
02:28:15.521 --> 02:28:16.090
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3041
02:28:16.091 --> 02:28:18.730
<v Speaker 3>This patient's got erectile ed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's a drug.</v>

3042
02:28:19.630 --> 02:28:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Is it legal for an advertising</v>

3043
02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:25.490
<v Speaker 1>agency to name a disorder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3044
02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that it's illegal in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single country in the world except for </v>

3045
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:33.530
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand and the United States to </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise drugs to to consumers.</v>

3046
02:28:33.970 --> 02:28:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Please New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be the first change.</v>

3047
02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Please turn around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make us look terrible at first because </v>

3048
02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:45.420
<v Speaker 1>this is the result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscious is the result of allowing </v>

3049
02:28:45.420 --> 02:28:48.320
<v Speaker 1>drugs to be advertised is that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising agencies creating conditions</v>

3050
02:28:48.350 --> 02:28:51.560
<v Speaker 1>that then require drugs to be treated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking amazing.</v>

3051
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:54.800
<v Speaker 1>What else has been named by advertising </v>
<v Speaker 1>agencies?</v>

3052
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Off the top of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3053
02:28:56.631 --> 02:28:58.550
<v Speaker 1>but I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next time I'm on this show,</v>

3054
02:28:58.551 --> 02:29:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll definitely have a list for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>

3055
02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that that's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's legal.</v>

3056
02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:05.600
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3057
02:29:05.610 --> 02:29:07.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another book I read a while back,</v>

3058
02:29:08.210 --> 02:29:13.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the quote in the book was really </v>

3059
02:29:13.210 --> 02:29:13.520
<v Speaker 1>revealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was by the ceo of merck,</v>

3060
02:29:13.521 --> 02:29:15.980
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies in the world.</v>

3061
02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:17.780
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going To paraphrase,</v>

3062
02:29:17.781 --> 02:29:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the exact words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the gist of it was the real money in</v>

3063
02:29:22.671 --> 02:29:24.710
<v Speaker 1>drugs is in selling them to healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3064
02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:28.280
<v Speaker 1>So he hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had realized that,</v>

3065
02:29:28.370 --> 02:29:33.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we basically saturated the market of </v>

3066
02:29:33.370 --> 02:29:33.410
<v Speaker 1>medications that can be used to treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick people.</v>

3067
02:29:33.890 --> 02:29:38.890
<v Speaker 1>So the only way we can continue to grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>and expand is to come up with ways to </v>

3068
02:29:38.890 --> 02:29:42.791
<v Speaker 1>sell drugs to healthy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did they first started prescribing </v>

3069
02:29:42.791 --> 02:29:43.090
<v Speaker 1>ended up presence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3070
02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:48.120
<v Speaker 1>well the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ssri is I think go back to the </v>

3071
02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:48.120
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late eighties,</v>

3072
02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:52.991
<v Speaker 1>early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had other kinds of </v>

3073
02:29:52.991 --> 02:29:55.301
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants before that called try </v>
<v Speaker 1>cyclic antidepressants and other types </v>

3074
02:29:55.301 --> 02:29:55.880
<v Speaker 1>of medications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've been around for awhile,</v>

3075
02:29:56.630 --> 02:30:00.170
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is like this creation of ed,</v>

3076
02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:05.440
<v Speaker 1>erectile dysfunction as a disease was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of kind of selling drugs to healthy </v>

3077
02:30:05.991 --> 02:30:07.680
<v Speaker 1>people because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3078
02:30:07.690 --> 02:30:12.690
<v Speaker 1>they basically shifted them from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy people that otherwise wouldn't </v>

3079
02:30:12.690 --> 02:30:15.140
<v Speaker 1>see themselves as someone who needed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug to people who are not who,</v>

3080
02:30:15.430 --> 02:30:16.760
<v Speaker 1>who now have a condition.</v>

3081
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what I understand,</v>

3082
02:30:18.921 --> 02:30:23.921
<v Speaker 1>pro vigil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the initial creation of </v>

3083
02:30:23.921 --> 02:30:27.041
<v Speaker 1>provigil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to come up with a </v>

3084
02:30:27.041 --> 02:30:27.041
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drug for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for um,</v>

3085
02:30:27.041 --> 02:30:30.500
<v Speaker 1>cognitive function and they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sell it as such,</v>

3086
02:30:30.501 --> 02:30:33.110
<v Speaker 1>so they had to come up with some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reason why people need it.</v>

3087
02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:35.210
<v Speaker 1>So they went with narcolepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3088
02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:37.250
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3089
02:30:37.251 --> 02:30:40.280
<v Speaker 1>you have people who have been arguing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stat and should be put in the water</v>

3090
02:30:40.281 --> 02:30:41.500
<v Speaker 1>supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3091
02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There literally blew the fuck.</v>

3092
02:30:44.061 --> 02:30:49.061
<v Speaker 1>Says that as a doctor in the uk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a monster who lit not cause </v>

3093
02:30:49.061 --> 02:30:53.380
<v Speaker 1>eating a salad right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking monster put it in the water </v>

3094
02:30:53.691 --> 02:30:54.900
<v Speaker 1>supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Qmap is up.</v>

3095
02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:57.350
<v Speaker 1>That's poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's seriously.</v>

3096
02:30:57.560 --> 02:31:00.080
<v Speaker 1>I advocated for that and it wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>

3097
02:31:00.081 --> 02:31:05.081
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't an exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a few years back.</v>

3098
02:31:06.981 --> 02:31:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

3099
02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I have a blog article about it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>his argument was these,</v>

3100
02:31:12.561 --> 02:31:17.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these drugs are so effective for </v>

3101
02:31:17.561 --> 02:31:19.631
<v Speaker 1>reducing the risk of heart disease that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we should just be giving them to </v>

3102
02:31:19.631 --> 02:31:20.220
<v Speaker 1>everybody despite whether they</v>

3103
02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:25.340
<v Speaker 3>want to take them or not because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't that don't they seriously </v>

3104
02:31:25.340 --> 02:31:26.280
<v Speaker 3>disrupt performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Physical performance.</v>

3105
02:31:26.570 --> 02:31:31.570
<v Speaker 3>The bigger question is whether statens </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually extend lifespan in people </v>

3106
02:31:31.570 --> 02:31:36.160
<v Speaker 3>without preexisting heart disease and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of the research suggests that not </v>

3107
02:31:36.290 --> 02:31:40.150
<v Speaker 3>that the answer to that question is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>or very in a,</v>

3108
02:31:40.151 --> 02:31:45.151
<v Speaker 3>in an almost non insignificant way and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to balance that with the </v>

3109
02:31:45.151 --> 02:31:46.890
<v Speaker 3>potential side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the increased risk of diabetes,</v>

3110
02:31:46.891 --> 02:31:51.891
<v Speaker 3>particularly in women with and now we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have 100 million people with diabetes </v>

3111
02:31:51.891 --> 02:31:53.650
<v Speaker 3>and then the muscle fatigue and myopathy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

3112
02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:56.490
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3113
02:31:56.491 --> 02:31:58.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think this is,</v>

3114
02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:03.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean we go off on this when we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about misaligned incentives and </v>

3115
02:32:03.580 --> 02:32:05.160
<v Speaker 3>all of these things we've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about are just examples of how what's in</v>

3116
02:32:05.161 --> 02:32:10.161
<v Speaker 3>the best interests of a drug company de </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not necessarily in the best interest </v>

3117
02:32:10.161 --> 02:32:12.320
<v Speaker 3>of us as patients or as for dr.</v>

3118
02:32:12.440 --> 02:32:14.820
<v Speaker 3>When he goes back to what you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying about teeth,</v>

3119
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:17.970
<v Speaker 3>tooth decay and fluoride in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3120
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Like how much tooth decay is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of our diet.</v>

3121
02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:25.110
<v Speaker 3>And it's not because of fluoride is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Florida is not good for you.</v>

3122
02:32:25.410 --> 02:32:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Well you look especially in large </v>
<v Speaker 3>quantities and you can get away with it </v>

3123
02:32:30.410 --> 02:32:30.410
<v Speaker 3>in some of the quantities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in our water supply.</v>

3124
02:32:30.410 --> 02:32:32.880
<v Speaker 3>But from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not really.</v>

3125
02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:33.990
<v Speaker 3>We don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3126
02:32:33.991 --> 02:32:38.991
<v Speaker 3>I know this might sound controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do we think that our 100 gatherer </v>

3127
02:32:40.141 --> 02:32:45.141
<v Speaker 3>ancestors were brushing their teeth </v>
<v Speaker 3>twice a day and flossing twice a day </v>

3128
02:32:45.141 --> 02:32:45.720
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably had horrible breath.</v>

3129
02:32:46.110 --> 02:32:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here'S the thing,</v>

3130
02:32:47.810 --> 02:32:52.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is an oral microbiome just like </v>

3131
02:32:52.810 --> 02:32:55.851
<v Speaker 3>there is a microbiome in the gut and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what's likely and,</v>

3132
02:32:55.941 --> 02:32:59.130
<v Speaker 3>and they've archeologists have know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>

3133
02:32:59.131 --> 02:33:04.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they uncover remains from the </v>

3134
02:33:04.131 --> 02:33:04.131
<v Speaker 3>traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3135
02:33:04.131 --> 02:33:05.430
<v Speaker 3>our ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our paleolithic ancestors,</v>

3136
02:33:05.431 --> 02:33:10.431
<v Speaker 3>they have great healthy jaws and teeth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not egyptians.</v>

3137
02:33:11.350 --> 02:33:12.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

3138
02:33:12.181 --> 02:33:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was civilization already.</v>

3139
02:33:13.771 --> 02:33:15.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grinding food,</v>

3140
02:33:15.630 --> 02:33:20.630
<v Speaker 3>talking about further back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>further back in our history prior to </v>

3141
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:22.140
<v Speaker 3>agriculture right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of that.</v>

3142
02:33:22.141 --> 02:33:25.530
<v Speaker 3>And so what that suggests is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3143
02:33:25.710 --> 02:33:30.710
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I brushed my teeth and floss and not </v>

3144
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:31.290
<v Speaker 3>suggesting that people shouldn't now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there hasn't been some improvement,</v>

3145
02:33:31.291 --> 02:33:32.580
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3146
02:33:32.581 --> 02:33:37.581
<v Speaker 3>the fact that weston price went around </v>
<v Speaker 3>to all these traditional cultures and </v>

3147
02:33:37.581 --> 02:33:40.500
<v Speaker 3>found that they had beautiful healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>teeth and wide dental arches.</v>

3148
02:33:40.501 --> 02:33:43.710
<v Speaker 3>They weren't brushing their teeth twice </v>
<v Speaker 3>a day and flossing twice a day,</v>

3149
02:33:44.130 --> 02:33:49.130
<v Speaker 3>but they had root underlying foundation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of health and a healthy microbiome,</v>

3150
02:33:49.441 --> 02:33:54.441
<v Speaker 3>not only in their gut but in oral </v>
<v Speaker 3>microbiome that lead to healthy teeth.</v>

3151
02:33:54.570 --> 02:33:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Even without that kind of dental hygiene</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dental care.</v>

3152
02:33:58.830 --> 02:34:00.660
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3153
02:34:00.890 --> 02:34:04.590
<v Speaker 3>there are now oral probiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dental probiotics,</v>

3154
02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:09.000
<v Speaker 3>which are chewable tablets that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

3155
02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:14.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pop one in your mouth after you </v>

3156
02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:14.020
<v Speaker 3>brush your teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you chew.</v>

3157
02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:16.290
<v Speaker 3>And I've had patients who had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>having recurring cavities,</v>

3158
02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:18.230
<v Speaker 3>dental issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period per</v>

3159
02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:23.520
<v Speaker 1>periodontal periodontal issues that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>by chewing one of these dental </v>

3160
02:34:24.011 --> 02:34:29.011
<v Speaker 1>probiotics twice a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had like a complete reversal on </v>

3161
02:34:29.011 --> 02:34:29.011
<v Speaker 1>their dental health where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3162
02:34:29.011 --> 02:34:31.990
<v Speaker 1>they go from having like a cavity every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time they go to the dentist to having no</v>

3163
02:34:31.991 --> 02:34:32.830
<v Speaker 1>cavities at all</v>

3164
02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:37.910
<v Speaker 2>because that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of those woo subjects where </v>

3165
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.910
<v Speaker 2>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3166
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:38.680
<v Speaker 2>you fucking crystal hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3167
02:34:38.681 --> 02:34:40.430
<v Speaker 2>when you start talking about fluoride in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water.</v>

3168
02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:42.130
<v Speaker 2>But do we really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3169
02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:47.140
<v Speaker 2>we definitely need to somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean the water of bacteria and treat </v>

3170
02:34:47.961 --> 02:34:50.540
<v Speaker 2>the water so that it doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>pollutants in it,</v>

3171
02:34:50.570 --> 02:34:52.910
<v Speaker 2>but that can be done with filtration </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

3172
02:34:52.911 --> 02:34:54.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the wild,</v>

3173
02:34:54.590 --> 02:34:56.660
<v Speaker 2>not in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meAning like the toumani,</v>

3174
02:34:56.661 --> 02:35:00.260
<v Speaker 2>but people that live in camps for months</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a time,</v>

3175
02:35:00.261 --> 02:35:02.600
<v Speaker 2>like friends of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go on these back country trips.</v>

3176
02:35:03.020 --> 02:35:06.090
<v Speaker 2>They use water filters to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll take a walk,</v>

3177
02:35:06.290 --> 02:35:11.290
<v Speaker 2>they'll take like a wallow that like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>elk have been stomping around and muddy </v>

3178
02:35:11.721 --> 02:35:16.721
<v Speaker 2>water and they'll put this water through</v>
<v Speaker 2>this filtration system and make it so </v>

3179
02:35:16.721 --> 02:35:20.171
<v Speaker 2>you can drink it and there's stary pens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have these pens that you could spin</v>

3180
02:35:21.531 --> 02:35:26.531
<v Speaker 2>the pan around the water for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>predetermined period of time and it </v>

3181
02:35:26.531 --> 02:35:26.531
<v Speaker 2>kills everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's bacteria.</v>

3182
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:31.750
<v Speaker 2>All the bacteria in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of different filtration </v>

3183
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:34.781
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pumps that they use on creeks to keep </v>

3184
02:35:34.781 --> 02:35:36.230
<v Speaker 2>beaver fever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that stuff called?</v>

3185
02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Giardia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Giardia from beaver.</v>

3186
02:35:38.181 --> 02:35:43.181
<v Speaker 2>Shit in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this all can be done without </v>

3187
02:35:43.181 --> 02:35:43.181
<v Speaker 2>chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my point.</v>

3188
02:35:43.181 --> 02:35:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the chemicals that we have in the </v>

3189
02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:47.450
<v Speaker 2>water there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be terrible for you.</v>

3190
02:35:47.630 --> 02:35:51.590
<v Speaker 2>They're not necessary and especially in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of flUoride,</v>

3191
02:35:51.591 --> 02:35:52.970
<v Speaker 2>it might be completely misguided.</v>

3192
02:35:53.740 --> 02:35:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Have you read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the book on this big thick book</v>

3193
02:35:57.221 --> 02:35:59.620
<v Speaker 1>on fluoride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bryson,</v>

3194
02:35:59.621 --> 02:36:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the last name of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>author.</v>

3195
02:36:01.420 --> 02:36:02.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a yellow cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3196
02:36:02.561 --> 02:36:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he mentioned something about how</v>

3197
02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:08.850
<v Speaker 1>in this this comes up in other contexts </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

3198
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:10.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

3199
02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:15.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that have something that's </v>

3200
02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:16.660
<v Speaker 1>toxic that they would otherwise have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay for to dispose of.</v>

3201
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I have figured out ways to actually sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff to the food industry or to </v>

3202
02:36:21.850 --> 02:36:25.090
<v Speaker 1>another industry that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then puts it in some products.</v>

3203
02:36:25.091 --> 02:36:28.150
<v Speaker 1>So industrial seed oils like soybean </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>

3204
02:36:28.151 --> 02:36:29.830
<v Speaker 1>cottonseed oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of things.</v>

3205
02:36:29.831 --> 02:36:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Originally were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were not considered foods.</v>

3206
02:36:32.110 --> 02:36:37.110
<v Speaker 1>They were waste products from ag </v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture from text growing those </v>

3207
02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:38.460
<v Speaker 1>crops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

3208
02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:43.480
<v Speaker 1>the brilliance of those that have those </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies at that time was figuring out </v>

3209
02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:48.391
<v Speaker 1>a way to turn those things that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have otherwise been seen as waste into </v>

3210
02:36:48.391 --> 02:36:50.020
<v Speaker 1>like a food product that they could then</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell.</v>

3211
02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:54.370
<v Speaker 1>And make money off of really those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

3212
02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:57.100
<v Speaker 1>those are amongst the worst because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3213
02:36:57.250 --> 02:36:59.380
<v Speaker 1>those are ubiquitous in the american </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

3214
02:36:59.381 --> 02:37:01.990
<v Speaker 1>like if you pick up any package food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see,</v>

3215
02:37:01.991 --> 02:37:02.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soybean oil,</v>

3216
02:37:02.981 --> 02:37:04.100
<v Speaker 1>corn oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corn oil,</v>

3217
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:05.410
<v Speaker 1>cottonseed oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

3218
02:37:05.411 --> 02:37:09.430
<v Speaker 1>There's all these highly processed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>refined omega six vegetable oils.</v>

3219
02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:14.500
<v Speaker 1>And those vegetable oils are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for your body to process well </v>

3220
02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:14.650
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3221
02:37:14.651 --> 02:37:16.790
<v Speaker 1>they're almost completely devoid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients.</v>

3222
02:37:16.791 --> 02:37:17.330
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3223
02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:22.420
<v Speaker 1>some of them have vitamin e,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have almost no other nutrients </v>

3224
02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:22.420
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3225
02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:26.860
<v Speaker 1>and historically humans had consumed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance of omega six and omega three </v>

3226
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:30.130
<v Speaker 1>oils that was somewhere between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3227
02:37:30.170 --> 02:37:34.160
<v Speaker 1>one to one ratio or maybe a four to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>in favor of omega six.</v>

3228
02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:35.370
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3229
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:39.230
<v Speaker 1>the amount of omega six oils that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>consume today is much higher,</v>

3230
02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:44.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes like a 20 to one ratio of </v>

3231
02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:44.260
<v Speaker 1>omega six to omega three.</v>

3232
02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:48.670
<v Speaker 1>And this is a controversial topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was just a research study </v>

3233
02:37:48.670 --> 02:37:51.611
<v Speaker 1>published that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to suggest that these oils </v>

3234
02:37:51.611 --> 02:37:54.140
<v Speaker 1>actually may not be as harmful as as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they were,</v>

3235
02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:57.260
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't had a chance to read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>full text of the study yet.</v>

3236
02:37:57.261 --> 02:37:59.690
<v Speaker 1>And you have to look at the overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight of the evidence,</v>

3237
02:37:59.691 --> 02:38:04.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got 40 studies showing that </v>

3238
02:38:04.691 --> 02:38:05.840
<v Speaker 1>there are harmful and then one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that they're not well.</v>

3239
02:38:06.050 --> 02:38:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to consider that in the </v>

3240
02:38:11.050 --> 02:38:11.050
<v Speaker 1>whole context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3241
02:38:11.050 --> 02:38:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you got to find out who funded that </v>

3242
02:38:15.370 --> 02:38:16.700
<v Speaker 1>study and there are a lot of questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask and whether even the studies said</v>

3243
02:38:16.701 --> 02:38:18.230
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people say it said,</v>

3244
02:38:18.231 --> 02:38:20.390
<v Speaker 1>which is often not the case when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look into it.</v>

3245
02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:25.480
<v Speaker 1>That fluoride one's really freaking me </v>
<v Speaker 1>out now that we're talking about it </v>

3246
02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:25.690
<v Speaker 1>because I wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

3247
02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:28.100
<v Speaker 1>how would you ever stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the.</v>

3248
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Hasn't there been connections or </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlations between fluoride and low </v>

3249
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.670
<v Speaker 2>iq?</v>

3250
02:38:35.090 --> 02:38:36.590
<v Speaker 1>That sounds familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

3251
02:38:36.591 --> 02:38:38.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not topic I've looked into in </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail.</v>

3252
02:38:38.691 --> 02:38:41.240
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to say something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not correct,</v>

3253
02:38:41.300 --> 02:38:43.730
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the difference in you and me.</v>

3254
02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I think I heard fluoride exposure in </v>
<v Speaker 2>utero linked to your iq in bed study </v>

3255
02:38:53.021 --> 02:38:55.390
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you go scroll up a little bit there,</v>

3256
02:38:55.450 --> 02:38:56.660
<v Speaker 2>jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me.</v>

3257
02:38:56.670 --> 02:38:57.330
<v Speaker 2>They'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3258
02:38:57.490 --> 02:39:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Increased levels of prenatal fluoride </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposure may be associated with lower </v>

3259
02:39:02.490 --> 02:39:05.290
<v Speaker 2>cognitive function in children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New study says published tuesday and the</v>

3260
02:39:05.291 --> 02:39:10.291
<v Speaker 2>journal of environmental health </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspectives evaluated nearly 300 sets </v>

3261
02:39:10.291 --> 02:39:14.581
<v Speaker 2>of mothers and children in Mexico and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tested children twice for cognitive </v>

3262
02:39:14.581 --> 02:39:18.571
<v Speaker 2>development over the course of 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida is not added to public water </v>

3263
02:39:18.571 --> 02:39:22.711
<v Speaker 2>supplies in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are exposed to it through </v>

3264
02:39:22.711 --> 02:39:24.100
<v Speaker 2>naturally occurring fluoride in water </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fluoridated salt and supplements.</v>

3265
02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3266
02:39:25.630 --> 02:39:26.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

3267
02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean this highlight something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we haven't talked about much at all</v>

3268
02:39:29.081 --> 02:39:31.470
<v Speaker 1>in terms of aspect of the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

3269
02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:35.050
<v Speaker 1>It's problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is toxins being one of them,</v>

3270
02:39:35.051 --> 02:39:37.600
<v Speaker 1>but also things like mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bisphenol a,</v>

3271
02:39:37.601 --> 02:39:40.720
<v Speaker 1>bpa which is in the plastic water </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottles,</v>

3272
02:39:40.930 --> 02:39:43.150
<v Speaker 1>seats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's this?</v>

3273
02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of us locales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're lit.</v>

3274
02:39:45.060 --> 02:39:47.290
<v Speaker 1>We're lead poisoning is worse than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3275
02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that new study on India?</v>

3276
02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it was new delhi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what,</v>

3277
02:39:55.781 --> 02:39:58.150
<v Speaker 1>but air pollution in India</v>

3278
02:39:58.430 --> 02:40:01.490
<v Speaker 2>at an all time high and they show these </v>
<v Speaker 2>photographs of this city and</v>

3279
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:04.160
<v Speaker 1>it is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't see anything.</v>

3280
02:40:04.161 --> 02:40:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I can't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see a building 100 yards ahead</v>

3281
02:40:07.431 --> 02:40:07.930
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3282
02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.000
<v Speaker 1>So I mean air pollution has been linked </v>
<v Speaker 1>to obesity and cardiovascular disease </v>

3283
02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:13.040
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't even think,</v>

3284
02:40:13.050 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 1>not just respiratory,</v>

3285
02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:19.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like systemic inflammatory </v>

3286
02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:21.890
<v Speaker 3>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with toxins is our </v>

3287
02:40:21.890 --> 02:40:25.860
<v Speaker 3>initial understanding of toxic toxicity </v>
<v Speaker 3>was only like acute toxicity.</v>

3288
02:40:25.861 --> 02:40:30.861
<v Speaker 3>Like what happens if you get so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>mercury in your body so quickly that it </v>

3289
02:40:30.861 --> 02:40:34.581
<v Speaker 3>causes like an acute problem and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>assume that um,</v>

3290
02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:35.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

3291
02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:38.520
<v Speaker 3>if you don't see acute toxicity then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no problem.</v>

3292
02:40:38.521 --> 02:40:43.521
<v Speaker 3>Like There's nothing in between acute </v>
<v Speaker 3>toxicity and just normal that we know </v>

3293
02:40:43.521 --> 02:40:46.320
<v Speaker 3>now that like there was a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting study a couple years back.</v>

3294
02:40:46.321 --> 02:40:51.321
<v Speaker 3>I wrote about this on my blog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the title was something like </v>

3295
02:40:51.321 --> 02:40:52.050
<v Speaker 3>mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fish consumption and kids.</v>

3296
02:40:52.750 --> 02:40:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Look at this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The video came out today,</v>

3297
02:40:55.751 --> 02:40:57.700
<v Speaker 1>this is a really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3298
02:40:57.730 --> 02:41:02.730
<v Speaker 1>air pollution caused car accident pile </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in new delhi that these people are </v>

3299
02:41:02.730 --> 02:41:06.991
<v Speaker 1>trying to get people out of the car and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a couple of seconds it's just like </v>

3300
02:41:06.991 --> 02:41:09.040
<v Speaker 1>a snow storm here in America and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars and it comes slamming into them.</v>

3301
02:41:09.350 --> 02:41:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to tell them to hurry up </v>

3302
02:41:14.350 --> 02:41:14.350
<v Speaker 1>and get the fuck out of there before </v>
<v Speaker 1>another one comes in.</v>

3303
02:41:14.350 --> 02:41:14.530
<v Speaker 1>It happens like three or four times in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>row right here.</v>

3304
02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

3305
02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:22.480
<v Speaker 1>So these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these people are standing there and </v>

3306
02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:23.360
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

3307
02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:24.770
<v Speaker 1>mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a freeway.</v>

3308
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

3309
02:41:27.580 --> 02:41:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Now they gotta get the fuck out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>another one's coming.</v>

3310
02:41:31.780 --> 02:41:33.950
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

3311
02:41:34.850 --> 02:41:39.850
<v Speaker 1>This is all just air pollution there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

3312
02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:42.310
<v Speaker 1>This is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

3313
02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:45.770
<v Speaker 1>they're in a fog on a mountain road and </v>
<v Speaker 1>were on the highway.</v>

3314
02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:49.970
<v Speaker 1>this is what is the name of this video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can watch on twitter.</v>

3315
02:41:49.971 --> 02:41:54.971
<v Speaker 1>I define on twitter litter going around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dassault right before the show </v>

3316
02:41:54.971 --> 02:41:54.971
<v Speaker 1>starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was like,</v>

3317
02:41:55.220 --> 02:41:57.980
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New delhi car accident,</v>

3318
02:41:58.430 --> 02:41:59.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air pollution.</v>

3319
02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>

3320
02:42:01.460 --> 02:42:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And they're telling these people get out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the car.</v>

3321
02:42:03.210 --> 02:42:08.210
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you go up to try to warn </v>

3322
02:42:08.210 --> 02:42:09.090
<v Speaker 3>people it's they can't see you there </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

3323
02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what if someone takes a turn </v>

3324
02:42:14.180 --> 02:42:14.180
<v Speaker 1>and it hits those people to the side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh god,</v>

3325
02:42:14.180 --> 02:42:15.240
<v Speaker 1>this is horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about where it ends right here.</v>

3326
02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

3327
02:42:17.620 --> 02:42:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

3328
02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:23.170
<v Speaker 3>these are like the mercury thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3329
02:42:23.171 --> 02:42:24.910
<v Speaker 3>the idea for a long time was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3330
02:42:25.150 --> 02:42:27.280
<v Speaker 3>if your blood levels below 10 parts per </v>
<v Speaker 3>million,</v>

3331
02:42:27.281 --> 02:42:28.600
<v Speaker 3>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence,</v>

3332
02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:29.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

3333
02:42:29.290 --> 02:42:34.290
<v Speaker 3>there's no issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this new study came out and they </v>

3334
02:42:34.290 --> 02:42:35.530
<v Speaker 3>looked at kids and they looked at </v>
<v Speaker 3>cortisol levels,</v>

3335
02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:39.820
<v Speaker 3>which and in and inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory markers and they found that</v>

3336
02:42:39.821 --> 02:42:44.821
<v Speaker 3>kids that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that had mercury levels that were even </v>

3337
02:42:44.821 --> 02:42:45.430
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as low as a one,</v>

3338
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:50.670
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost 10 times lower than the level of </v>

3339
02:42:50.670 --> 02:42:54.061
<v Speaker 3>concern had higher levels of cortisol </v>
<v Speaker 3>and higher levels of inflammatory </v>

3340
02:42:54.061 --> 02:42:57.260
<v Speaker 3>markers and they and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that totally turned things on the,</v>

3341
02:42:57.261 --> 02:42:58.030
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on their head.</v>

3342
02:42:58.031 --> 02:43:00.160
<v Speaker 3>It was like all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3343
02:43:00.580 --> 02:43:05.580
<v Speaker 3>lower levels of the talks of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>toxins than we thought were problematic </v>

3344
02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:08.080
<v Speaker 3>are actually problematic and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they dove in and look deeper,</v>

3345
02:43:08.081 --> 02:43:10.270
<v Speaker 3>they found a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3346
02:43:10.271 --> 02:43:14.170
<v Speaker 3>some of the kids who were affected had </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain genetic polymorphisms,</v>

3347
02:43:14.171 --> 02:43:19.171
<v Speaker 3>like there was something that made them </v>
<v Speaker 3>more susceptible or maybe they had </v>

3348
02:43:19.171 --> 02:43:22.621
<v Speaker 3>nutrient deficiencies that made them </v>
<v Speaker 3>less able to detoxify the mercury as </v>

3349
02:43:22.631 --> 02:43:24.130
<v Speaker 3>they normally should be able to.</v>

3350
02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:28.240
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what further complicates it is that,</v>

3351
02:43:28.830 --> 02:43:33.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the symptoms that you see with high </v>

3352
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:34.090
<v Speaker 3>levels of toxin can actually be </v>
<v Speaker 3>different at low levels.</v>

3353
02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:39.420
<v Speaker 3>So let's say researchers design a study </v>
<v Speaker 3>to see the toxic effects of mercury </v>

3354
02:43:39.420 --> 02:43:43.651
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the exposure is severe and they're </v>

3355
02:43:43.651 --> 02:43:47.281
<v Speaker 3>looking for certain studies and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they start lowering the dose of mercury </v>

3356
02:43:47.281 --> 02:43:51.300
<v Speaker 3>to see when those effects go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will completely miss the effects </v>

3357
02:43:52.001 --> 02:43:57.001
<v Speaker 3>that are caused by the low doses of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mercury because they're are different </v>

3358
02:43:57.001 --> 02:43:57.160
<v Speaker 3>than the effects that they were studying</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the higher doses.</v>

3359
02:43:57.910 --> 02:44:02.910
<v Speaker 3>So this caused a problem for years where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was assumed that the low doses were </v>

3360
02:44:02.910 --> 02:44:07.051
<v Speaker 3>harmless because they weren't observing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same effects they saw at the high </v>

3361
02:44:07.051 --> 02:44:09.790
<v Speaker 3>doses and now they know this and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've redesigned studies to look,</v>

3362
02:44:09.850 --> 02:44:12.220
<v Speaker 3>just cast a wider net and see what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

3363
02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:17.220
<v Speaker 3>And sure enough at those lower levels of</v>
<v Speaker 3>toxins they're seeing all kinds of </v>

3364
02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:19.330
<v Speaker 3>effects that are actually in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite of the effect that you see with</v>

3365
02:44:19.331 --> 02:44:23.740
<v Speaker 3>the high dose of the toxin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you adjusted like where you live or</v>

3366
02:44:23.741 --> 02:44:25.780
<v Speaker 3>anything because of all this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3367
02:44:25.781 --> 02:44:26.830
<v Speaker 3>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3368
02:44:26.831 --> 02:44:29.290
<v Speaker 3>when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just bought a house a couple of years</v>

3369
02:44:29.290 --> 02:44:31.000
<v Speaker 3>ago and we just um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3370
02:44:31.001 --> 02:44:35.080
<v Speaker 3>we had a choice of where to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wanted to live in berkeley.</v>

3371
02:44:35.081 --> 02:44:38.000
<v Speaker 3>That's where my offices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we ended up living up on,</v>

3372
02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:42.040
<v Speaker 3>on top of the hill and that was somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 3>intentional for me.</v>

3373
02:44:42.041 --> 02:44:47.041
<v Speaker 3>It's right near tilden park,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a outdoor regional park space </v>

3374
02:44:47.041 --> 02:44:48.300
<v Speaker 3>with a lot of green area and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3375
02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:51.180
<v Speaker 3>and there are parts of berkeley that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3376
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:53.140
<v Speaker 3>where the air quality is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad.</v>

3377
02:44:53.141 --> 02:44:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Like surprising if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know that area,</v>

3378
02:44:55.871 --> 02:44:58.570
<v Speaker 3>if you go online to some of these air </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality ratings sites,</v>

3379
02:44:58.571 --> 02:45:01.600
<v Speaker 3>you can see that parts of berkeley or </v>
<v Speaker 3>like c minus or d,</v>

3380
02:45:02.070 --> 02:45:07.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's so much industry there </v>

3381
02:45:07.070 --> 02:45:08.230
<v Speaker 3>and the chevron plan and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is where it gets really,</v>

3382
02:45:08.530 --> 02:45:10.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inequalities is brutal because guess</v>

3383
02:45:10.991 --> 02:45:15.991
<v Speaker 3>who ends up often living in the areas </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are most toxic are the people who </v>

3384
02:45:15.991 --> 02:45:20.910
<v Speaker 3>are economically disadvantaged and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the least influential when it </v>

3385
02:45:20.910 --> 02:45:24.310
<v Speaker 3>comes to any kind of political power to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to change,</v>

3386
02:45:24.340 --> 02:45:25.930
<v Speaker 3>make changes in those areas.</v>

3387
02:45:25.930 --> 02:45:28.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3388
02:45:28.171 --> 02:45:33.171
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're disproportionately affected </v>

3389
02:45:33.171 --> 02:45:33.580
<v Speaker 3>by that because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's watching out for them.</v>

3390
02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:34.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's,</v>

3391
02:45:34.921 --> 02:45:35.410
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of</v>

3392
02:45:35.410 --> 02:45:37.750
<v Speaker 2>factors we could talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

3393
02:45:37.751 --> 02:45:38.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3394
02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:44.220
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so important that there's people </v>

3395
02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:44.220
<v Speaker 2>like you out there that are highlighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

3396
02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:46.570
