52
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I about this.</v>

53
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about staying hope on the way up here.</v>

54
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

55
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>our friend Mike was selling weed,</v>

56
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>but then one time he worked at CAA and he goes,</v>

57
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:08.401
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

58
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the interns over to him,</v>

59
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.403
<v Speaker 1>he blew up.</v>

60
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.420
<v Speaker 1>He ended up being Whitney Houston's manager and you know,</v>

61
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.890
<v Speaker 1>and the tour manager and he,</v>

62
00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>he's looking for powder.</v>

63
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>So every day they would come over and I would sell Bobby Brown and Whitney</v>

64
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Houston.</v>

65
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>they would come over like $1,100 which was per diem money.</v>

67
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I was taking Whitney's per diem money,</v>

68
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

69
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Every day they come over with a little white envelope and give me the per diem</v>

70
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.601
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

71
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and I go up to the Martell cartel and I buy 14 grams of Blo,</v>

72
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>take an eight ball out and cut it and then give it to Whitney Houston.</v>

73
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And they were fucking going crazy.</v>

74
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:41.041
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

75
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>this went on for 30 40 days,</v>

76
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.740
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't snort all the blog was,</v>

77
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't start it.</v>

78
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>It was just too much.</v>

79
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>So I was giving it to Maldon Martinez,</v>

80
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:52.520
<v Speaker 1>the whole dad.</v>

81
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.630
<v Speaker 1>She's done.</v>

82
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the coke that killed her.</v>

83
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

84
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.263
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

85
00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.980
