00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.670
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck,</v>

3
00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:03.061
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>we're a weird,</v>

5
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.013
<v Speaker 1>so weird.</v>

6
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>What a stupid culture.</v>

7
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

8
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop thinking about the guy,</v>

9
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>the farted at the sink at the airport.</v>

10
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>We talked about it for 10 minutes afterwards.</v>

11
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Dudes Fart when they pee and then go to the bathroom.</v>

12
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Constantly far to in public restrooms.</v>

13
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:23.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>But we were at the sink and the dude was washing his hands and he cut a monster</v>

15
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>fart.</v>

16
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>And I told Tommy about it and I was like,</v>

17
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:30.751
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

18
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:31.584
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

19
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>he broke.</v>

20
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.203
<v Speaker 1>He broke the rules.</v>

21
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I walked out just before this happened.</v>

23
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I unfortunately missed the incident,</v>

24
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>but you said it immediately and I was,</v>

25
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>I kept wrapping my head around it and I think what I've come to the conclusion</v>

26
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>is that if you do that,</v>

27
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>all I'm looking for is for you to acknowledge it.</v>

28
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Oops.</v>

29
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>You need to say something.</v>

31
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I want you to say something about that because I was thinking about how,</v>

32
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.281
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>an old guy one time farted next to me in,</v>

34
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.233
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>like on a tram and then the airport.</v>

37
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.321
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

38
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

39
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>he led a fucking pretty big fart.</v>

40
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at him and he goes,</v>

41
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.963
<v Speaker 1>snuck out of me.</v>

42
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.631
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

43
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:06.901
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

44
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>And I kind of took away like,</v>

45
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.710
<v Speaker 1>you know what was upsetting him that yes.</v>

46
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.271
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

47
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>well thank you for acknowledging your,</v>

48
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>you're fart right now.</v>

49
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>This guy was just washing his hands and he just,</v>

51
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.030
<v Speaker 1>the sink is not the year.</v>

52
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they get a pass there.</v>

53
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

54
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

55
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

56
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Definitely are know who does that to you?</v>

57
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely a gray area.</v>

58
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely a greater,</v>

59
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>people fart all the time at the urinals.</v>

60
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.960
<v Speaker 1>That's so common.</v>

61
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I hear a lot of farms get done zip up walk all the way around and washing your</v>

63
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>hands in the middle of Washington as you just unload and no one said a word.</v>

64
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:38.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

65
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:39.654
<v Speaker 1>everyone just,</v>

66
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>just let it go and then we got outside.</v>

67
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:42.961
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

68
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:43.411
<v Speaker 1>Yo Dude,</v>

69
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel about this?</v>

70
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop thinking of that.</v>

71
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>And then we're trying to figure out what kind of farts girls cut when they're in</v>

72
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom and whether or not they washed their hands before nine each other.</v>

73
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Probably not as much.</v>

74
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.651
<v Speaker 1>Not as much,</v>

75
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>but they definitely drop heat in there.</v>

76
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Once they close that door or then they allow themselves.</v>

77
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

78
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.670
<v Speaker 1>they allow themselves to,</v>

79
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>to fucking farted up,</v>

80
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.973
<v Speaker 1>let me know.</v>

81
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

82
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>they really let them rip.</v>

83
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Once they get in that door that closed that door,</v>

85
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:10.404
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

86
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.011
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

87
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:11.844
<v Speaker 1>if you're taking a shit,</v>

88
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.093
<v Speaker 1>you got to Fart.</v>

89
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder if they fart while they're washing their hands.</v>

90
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>These are the things that I think of it.</v>

91
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.993
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

93
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.260
<v Speaker 1>I wonder about what we need and the more of this moral,</v>

94
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>do you mask your farts when you should shit in a public restaurant?</v>

95
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.560
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

96
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

97
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Let it out.</v>

98
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.770
<v Speaker 1>You gotta do what you want to hold up</v>

99
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.193
<v Speaker 1>an idiot.</v>

100
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>She's Jesus Christ.</v>

101
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>You have it on your phone.</v>

102
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I love girl farts.</v>

103
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.871
<v Speaker 1>40 year old man.</v>

104
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>He's got it on his phone.</v>

105
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.633

00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>There's been far porn forever.</v>

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.560

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>We played some a fart clips on our show and we were talking about it and the guy</v>

119
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:56.220

123
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.031
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

124
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just back to the taboo of it that the pretty girl is not supposed</v>

125
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

128
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Like that it's,</v>

129
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

130
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>To be in a dirty girl and he loves,</v>

131
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:11.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>a pretty girl doing it is like the ultimate thing.</v>

133
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about people's,</v>

135
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>like they want people to be naughty,</v>

136
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.553
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

137
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Just because we feel so,</v>

138
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>most people at least feel so confined by the rules.</v>

139
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.021
<v Speaker 1>And I think women,</v>

140
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>so even more so than men,</v>

141
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>women even more so than men because,</v>

142
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>society wants you to be a lady and he wants a certain way.</v>

144
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

145
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

146
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>and they're slut shaming.</v>

147
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to be a slut.</v>

148
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to do what you want to do.</v>

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's what you have to do.</v>

297
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to take a 10 minute heater.</v>

298
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes you just,</v>

299
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 1>you take a shit and it comes up clump,</v>

300
00:06:59.391 --> 00:06:59.691
<v Speaker 1>clump,</v>

301
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:00.021
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

302
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:00.261
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

303
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more up there.</v>

304
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.590
<v Speaker 1>God dammit happened on the flight yesterday.</v>

305
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.431
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

306
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I sat down and was one of them wanting to go to sleep and I was like,</v>

307
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I gotta take a shit.</v>

308
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>And it was during takeoff.</v>

309
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 1>So then you're like waiting for it to hit 10,000 feet,</v>

310
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:13.251
<v Speaker 1>and then you're,</v>

312
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>you're waiting for them to turn the seatbelt sign off.</v>

313
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 1>And I go in there like,</v>

314
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be,</v>

315
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.160
<v Speaker 1>this is like a fucking marathon shit.</v>

316
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't have time for it,</v>

317
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 1>so I really dropped half of it off just like a fall asleep.</v>

318
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

319
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 1>And then later on I finished.</v>

320
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

321
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty,</v>

322
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.161
<v Speaker 1>pretty dramatic.</v>

323
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the weird things about your body is that there's like this</v>

324
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 1>intangible sense of how much shit is in there.</v>

325
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

326
00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>like when you're taking a shit,</v>

327
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Speaker 1>like you have that feeling,</v>

328
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 1>that weird feeling like I smell a shit or I feel shit bro and I feel a shit</v>

329
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.364
<v Speaker 1>cooking in the oven.</v>

330
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.170
<v Speaker 1>And then once you're taking that shit you got this pressure thing like you know</v>

331
00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>it's in there and you know what's up there and there's a certain amount like God</v>

332
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.171
<v Speaker 1>damn it,</v>

333
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:55.004
<v Speaker 1>this isn't ready.</v>

334
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 1>This is his diet it.</v>

335
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

336
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

337
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to,</v>

338
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to up to empty it and then I'll come back later.</v>

339
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

340
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

341
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 1>and that's the worst you'd like when it's all gone.</v>

342
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

343
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Certain foods to will trigger just amazing amounts of shit.</v>

344
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 1>The commodity you where you're just like,</v>

345
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>is my body mostly shit?</v>

346
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Like am I just a walking talking shit machine?</v>

347
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes I'll like,</v>

348
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>the amount that will come out of me is just incredible to me.</v>

349
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I cannot get over what's coming out of me.</v>

350
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 1>If you think about how much food you eat though,</v>

351
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.260
<v Speaker 1>if you sink,</v>

352
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 1>sink,</v>

353
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 1>think of like the your entire day.</v>

354
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>If you shit once a day thinking about breakfast in there and then lunch in there</v>

355
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.180
<v Speaker 1>and then your dinner in there,</v>

356
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:40.181
<v Speaker 1>like this giant mound of food that goes into your body and then snack,</v>

357
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>like you might have a protein bar along the way and then you'll have all this</v>

358
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 1>you drink thing.</v>

359
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 1>He might drink milk which has got some solids in there and then slowly but</v>

360
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:50.470
<v Speaker 1>surely compress that into just laws.</v>

361
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Big ropey shit logs.</v>

362
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.051
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

363
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not really bigger.</v>

364
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Now picture a pretty girl squatting over your face and letting that all over</v>

365
00:08:58.141 --> 00:08:58.974
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

366
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.453
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

367
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 1>well that's a under glass like big thing.</v>

368
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 1>People guys coffee from guys like women shitting on class coffee tables.</v>

369
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

370
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean I always heard that about Stallone.</v>

371
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

372
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>those like one of those rumors probably made up.</v>

373
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like the Richard Gere durable thing.</v>

374
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

375
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Someone decided to to say it and then it sounds cool.</v>

376
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 1>So people are repeat it.</v>

377
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

378
00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:24.040
<v Speaker 1>it was still own likes.</v>

379
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 1>She likes to get under tables and girls take big juicy shifts on those tables.</v>

380
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 1>She loves him cause you want to fuck them.</v>

381
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Just wants them to shit.</v>

382
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to watch people,</v>

383
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

384
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It's over a glass table just to see it come out.</v>

385
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe once for sure.</v>

386
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>What about a guy like Joey Diaz,</v>

387
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 1>which I think that's the one that would be at the top of my list.</v>

388
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>What if he fell and landed on a table on the table shattered and you died.</v>

389
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.471
<v Speaker 1>That'd be horrible.</v>

390
00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Class went through.</v>

391
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Your next shit was in your eyeballs and you'd died knowing that shit was all</v>

392
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:51.320
<v Speaker 1>over your face and feeling the,</v>

393
00:09:51.321 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 1>the hot blood rush out of your neck.</v>

394
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.933
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

395
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I slept at too much sodium.</v>

396
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that it would be much more interesting to watch the shit.</v>

397
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Then some model.</v>

398
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see him have explosive diarrhea on a glass table.</v>

399
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:05.131
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

400
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:08.610
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see a girl who's like addicted to stimulants,</v>

401
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 1>like who's trying to be really skinny.</v>

402
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.040
<v Speaker 1>How just how little she actually shifts my hair comes out.</v>

403
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Probably shocking to see like a little tiny poops.</v>

404
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Curly squarely turned slightly bile.</v>

405
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.010
<v Speaker 1>The yellow smell to it.</v>

406
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going on?</v>

407
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

408
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.551
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

409
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:24.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>

410
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.083
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

411
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Half of her shit,</v>

412
00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:27.564
<v Speaker 1>his pills,</v>

413
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.310
<v Speaker 1>how do come out?</v>

414
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

415
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Like non dissolved pills.</v>

416
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.633
<v Speaker 1>Clumps.</v>

417
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

418
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it would be fun to watch a couple of times.</v>

419
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.983
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Watch,</v>

420
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about fun,</v>

421
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 1>but maybe fascinating.</v>

422
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

423
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I think as an art exhibit,</v>

424
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:45.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about art allows weekend,</v>

426
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.390
<v Speaker 1>it'd be great to set up a live exhibit.</v>

427
00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought of this where you have like 10 people 50 feet up and their</v>

428
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 1>button naked and they have different body types and they're sitting on glass</v>

429
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.300
<v Speaker 1>toilets with glass tubes coming down.</v>

430
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 1>And then the exhibit as you walk around and they all shit,</v>

431
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 1>like that'd be kind of fun.</v>

432
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 1>And they flush it and you see these glass tubes fill up with shit and come</v>

433
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.583
<v Speaker 1>tumbling down.</v>

434
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you do a septic at the bottom,</v>

435
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>a giant large tank filled with shit that's all glass.</v>

436
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>And you have different colored hair and you're like,</v>

437
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.931
