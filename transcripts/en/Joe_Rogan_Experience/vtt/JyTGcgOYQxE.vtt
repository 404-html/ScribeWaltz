1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Go see a boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even want that to be the </v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.993
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.890
<v Speaker 2>We live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we live?</v>

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just talking about a sober </v>

6
00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:11.494
<v Speaker 2>October and a red sphere and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>speculation that he may be in fact a </v>

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.430
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running some shenanigans.</v>

8
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.623
<v Speaker 2>We do not know.</v>

9
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be shenanigans at play here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>

10
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>He went to strong the first day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know still.</v>

11
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that you could sustain </v>
<v Speaker 1>that amount of that heart rate for that.</v>

12
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.310
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to look at his graph </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was at 80 plus percent of his</v>

13
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:35.860
<v Speaker 2>max heart rate for more than an hour and</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes.</v>

14
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Which a look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might just be trying to kill himself.</v>

15
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.750
<v Speaker 2>He's got a strong will.</v>

16
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

17
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Shifty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hung.</v>

18
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.333
<v Speaker 1>Is He shifty and honest because he'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually come out with this is what I </v>

19
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.334
<v Speaker 1>did and of course I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys knew I was doing it the whole </v>

20
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he'll say.</v>

21
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.861
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

22
00:00:58.861 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

23
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to do that.</v>

24
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he is shifty and like he,</v>

25
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

26
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>he's a prankster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a prankster,</v>

27
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely going to do some weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff to get ahead in this.</v>

28
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>But he also knows he's gonna lose to</v>

<v Speaker 2>then open it in front of everybody.</v>

31
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:25.650

<v Speaker 2>People were bail you out of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gagging and throwing up.</v>

33
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.263
<v Speaker 2>It's like a public health hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to like have shit </v>

34
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.740

<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that.</v>

40
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.250
<v Speaker 1>I just now heard that story like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be like a headline that's shit in</v>

41
00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:58.750
<v Speaker 1>a box and brought it into a room where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the live podcast was taking place.</v>

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:02.890
<v Speaker 1>It was a small room to room with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred people in it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

47
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.273
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he entered into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>contest at all and it doesn't work out </v>

48
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 2>at all for 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he's like,</v>

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a fitness contest and the loser </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to do something.</v>

50
00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:20.124
<v Speaker 2>We haven't totally determined what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>loser has to do or he wants us to like </v>

51
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 2>drink each other's piss.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your pis are lifted.</v>

53
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.920
<v Speaker 1>He might not lose right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Seger is in the bottom.</v>

54
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Thompson goes at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think tom is gonna try.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean your obviously set to witness </v>

56
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.100
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think Tom's going sneak up.</v>

57
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>He's playing it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You looked at his wrist yesterday.</v>

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how long he's going to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>it up because like birds,</v>

83
00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:45.650
<v Speaker 2>very competitive up to a point like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the weight loss challenge.</v>

<v Speaker 2>in one bit per tried.</v>

85
00:03:50.841 --> 00:03:51.674
<v Speaker 2>He tried to sprint towards the end but </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was too little too late and Thomas </v>

86
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.760
<v Speaker 2>talking shit the entire time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know what you're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna fuck off until the very </v>

88
00:03:58.281 --> 00:03:59.480
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you get to try to catch up,</v>

89
00:03:59.481 --> 00:04:01.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was right.</v>

90
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Bert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if birds will,</v>

92
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:07.650
<v Speaker 1>can be broken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been broken before.</v>

93
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's not as will.</v>

94
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.560
<v Speaker 2>It's the discipline aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

95
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 2>when you're dealing with an entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>

96
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 2>you have 31 days of having to get after </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

97
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 2>So how often do you get after it </v>
<v Speaker 2>normally?</v>

98
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

99
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference between me and Bert is I </v>

100
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:26.314
<v Speaker 2>work out almost every day already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me it's just like those days off </v>

101
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:31.024
<v Speaker 2>don't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I've decided to do on my days </v>

102
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:33.724
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just do shit that I wouldn't </v>

103
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.044
<v Speaker 2>normally do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll do the elliptical machine for </v>

104
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 2>two hours or I'll do something else or </v>
<v Speaker 2>just I'll do something else,</v>

105
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.340
<v Speaker 2>but the whole time I'm thinking I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to break.</v>

106
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck your Mickey Mantle Gene.</v>

107
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys were talking about like who you</v>

108
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:50.804
<v Speaker 1>think about when you're really trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get past that point where you're either </v>

109
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.650
<v Speaker 1>your kickboxing or even on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elliptical,</v>

110
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.820
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you've got to get angry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of Bert right now</v>

111
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 2>talking about right now I'm thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bert,</v>

112
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 2>thinking of her breaking bird breaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

113
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.743
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are all addicts in different </v>

114
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>ways and this is so interesting to watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're right.</v>

115
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>You already work out a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're an extremely healthy guy,</v>

116
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>but you're now going to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Ex.</v>

117
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.113
<v Speaker 1>I can see the excitement on all of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take this to just an excruciating </v>

118
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>level because it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets obsessive and it gets fun.</v>

119
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Like you can work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing I'm excited to talk</v>

120
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>to you at the beginning of this when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still pumped up about it and it's</v>

121
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>like you get a high from working out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>three and half hours a day.</v>

122
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Seventeen days from now I'm going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a beaten man.</v>

123
00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:41.304
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

124
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.550
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to get a surge at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end when it gets close again,</v>

125
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.990
<v Speaker 1>but 17 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

126
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:47.520
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to be a fun day for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

127
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

128
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

129
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows,</v>

130
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did she ever see.</v>

131
00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:53.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a really interesting documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Eddie Izzard.</v>

132
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Izzard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is not a guy,</v>

133
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.570
<v Speaker 2>and really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should you see it?</v>

134
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know what he's done.</v>

135
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so impressive.</v>

136
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he did was he ran around Europe.</v>

137
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 3>He did a marathon a day with no </v>
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

138
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no training.</v>

139
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't in shape.</v>

140
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 3>He was overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his feet weren't prepared,</v>

141
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 3>his feet got destroyed and I watched </v>
<v Speaker 3>this in the beginning.</v>

142
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 3>I watched us like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is he going to do this?</v>

143
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 3>And then towards the end I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

144
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 3>this guy is a force of will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just sheer will.</v>

145
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.943
<v Speaker 3>I mean his lifestyle is not that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercising consistently and this is </v>

146
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:29.444
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just going to do a little bit more </v>

147
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 3>and really push himself hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

148
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 3>no exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

149
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:38.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he exercised at all or if </v>
<v Speaker 3>he did it was just,</v>

150
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.480
<v Speaker 3>he just had a normal body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

151
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.380
<v Speaker 3>it didn't have a body of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

152
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.760
<v Speaker 1>somebody's looking at me go a marathon a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

153
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Anyone could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

154
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.440
<v Speaker 1>it's so mental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental.</v>

155
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I think a lot of comedians </v>

156
00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:54.034
<v Speaker 1>have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm just doing the thing what </v>

157
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.560
<v Speaker 1>comedians do of patting themselves on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back for being more interesting than</v>

158
00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:01.720
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we do all the time.</v>

159
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Like we're so much more broken and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have more willpower,</v>

160
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.493
<v Speaker 1>but I think that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get obsessed with exercise too and I </v>

161
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:09.544
<v Speaker 1>really get into it and I kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember Louis C k doing some </v>

162
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:13.054
<v Speaker 1>interview where he said that he runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>five miles a day because on that fourth </v>

163
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:17.950
<v Speaker 1>mile when he doesn't want to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth,</v>

164
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.880
<v Speaker 1>he thinks about like a day where he'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be on set and want to just call it a day</v>

165
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and not push through and it's like how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all relates.</v>

166
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Or you'll be in the middle of an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>set and you'll be tired and you just.</v>

167
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Everything can relate to being on set or</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of a set and that run five</v>

168
00:07:34.301 --> 00:07:35.134
<v Speaker 1>miles a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making yourself do that means you can </v>

169
00:07:36.851 --> 00:07:39.490
<v Speaker 1>get through anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I run a lot and I have,</v>

170
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.563
<v Speaker 1>I think of it the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just endurance to perform for an </v>

171
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.540
<v Speaker 1>hour every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think that's insane that we do that.</v>

172
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.970
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have more energy,</v>

173
00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:49.980
<v Speaker 3>definitely can put out more during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

174
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.920
<v Speaker 3>So if you are in better shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have more cardio,</v>

175
00:07:52.921 --> 00:07:55.650
<v Speaker 3>you won't get exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be able to put out more energy,</v>

176
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.410
<v Speaker 3>you'll be more vibrant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more robust,</v>

177
00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

178
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.390
<v Speaker 3>you really kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in some ways if you're doing like</v>

179
00:08:03.391 --> 00:08:04.224
<v Speaker 3>an hour a night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're doing two shows a </v>

180
00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:06.210
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

181
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.750
<v Speaker 3>You owe it to yourself to have an energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>reserve.</v>

182
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 1>It's just the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that running,</v>

184
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.983
<v Speaker 1>running so monotonous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's so many times where you </v>

185
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:17.924
<v Speaker 1>could go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just not do this and I can just </v>

186
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.173
<v Speaker 1>start walking and who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But something about pushing yourself </v>

187
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>through a run when you could give up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>always you never regret it.</v>

188
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll say that you never regret keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>running when you could just walk</v>

189
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 3>a moving meditation and a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

190
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.613
<v Speaker 3>You're forcing your mind to take control</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your body and you're forcing your </v>

191
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:45.470
<v Speaker 3>mind to ignore all of the aches and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pains and all the,</v>

192
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.323
<v Speaker 3>the desire to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when people say that run </v>

193
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 3>marathons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that you just have to.</v>

194
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Like my friend John Joseph says it best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

195
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 3>you got to tell you your mind as to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body who the</v>

196
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 2>fuck the bosses</v>

197
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.280
<v Speaker 1>God it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did dancing with the stars.</v>

198
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got eliminated last week.</v>

199
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so physically exhausting for.</v>

200
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.110
<v Speaker 1>It was a month of my life every day for </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day dancing.</v>

201
00:09:12.111 --> 00:09:14.870
<v Speaker 1>And I've never danced before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

202
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:16.723
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize how mental it all </v>

203
00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:23.950
<v Speaker 1>really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like athletics is,</v>

204
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.823
<v Speaker 1>it's so mental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it because I've never </v>

205
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:29.390
<v Speaker 1>been an athlete my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before I got into this competition I</v>

206
00:09:29.391 --> 00:09:30.224
<v Speaker 1>was like reading all the books about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like why I am where I am physically </v>

207
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.230
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I better figure out a way to mentally</v>

208
00:09:36.231 --> 00:09:39.230
<v Speaker 1>overcome some stuff and I was able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

209
00:09:39.231 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all that I,</v>

210
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a lot of times and it broke </v>
<v Speaker 1>me in many ways mentally and physically.</v>

211
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.970
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was my sober October for sure.</v>

212
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.013
<v Speaker 1>It was my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you working on every single day and </v>

213
00:09:53.031 --> 00:09:54.890
<v Speaker 1>giving it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to beat Bert.</v>

214
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing,</v>

215
00:09:57.271 --> 00:09:58.104
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a bunch of dancing lessons for a </v>

216
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:04.870
<v Speaker 2>movie that I was in called zookeeper </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Kevin James Way back in the day.</v>

217
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.973
<v Speaker 2>And I had to learn how to dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I had to learn how to dance </v>

218
00:10:08.681 --> 00:10:11.050
<v Speaker 2>with Leslie Bibb from Talladega Nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

219
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.810
<v Speaker 2>my ex girlfriend and was trying to win </v>
<v Speaker 2>back from Kevin in the movie,</v>

220
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.110
<v Speaker 2>so I had to learn how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was a scene where we dance in</v>

221
00:10:17.111 --> 00:10:19.910
<v Speaker 2>this ballroom and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.070
<v Speaker 2>if you realize how difficult it is for </v>
<v Speaker 2>ours,</v>

223
00:10:24.071 --> 00:10:26.530
<v Speaker 2>we're practicing these moves and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking monotonous.</v>

224
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.410
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about dancing.</v>

225
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.393
<v Speaker 2>So it's something like I had to force </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself to do that I didn't really want </v>

226
00:10:33.911 --> 00:10:34.744
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not that I don't give a fuck </v>

227
00:10:35.471 --> 00:10:37.930
<v Speaker 2>about other dancing's fun if you just do</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want,</v>

228
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 2>but when you're doing this very specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern to certain music and you did.</v>

229
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

230
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the scene,</v>

231
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.400
<v Speaker 1>James.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

232
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.150
<v Speaker 2>look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

233
00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:57.860
<v Speaker 2>We had to practice this shit over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over again for weeks and weeks.</v>

234
00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.333
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

235
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

236
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.790
<v Speaker 2>it was exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot to it.</v>

237
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.590
<v Speaker 1>That was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard.</v>

238
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Dancing is so hard and just like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

239
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

240
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about it.</v>

241
00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:19.914
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

242
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.993
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something when I want to be </v>

243
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 1>good at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will give everything to be good at it.</v>

244
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.403
<v Speaker 1>And here's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a natural ability to begin </v>

245
00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone goes,</v>

246
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of knack for this,</v>

247
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well I'm good.</v>

248
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:35.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I walked into this,</v>

249
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever been like,</v>

250
00:11:36.961 --> 00:11:39.150
<v Speaker 1>you've got rhythm girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever.</v>

251
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever given me even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightest nudge towards any kind of,</v>

252
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing,</v>

253
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having any musical ability or having any</v>

254
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:50.250
<v Speaker 1>dance ability if anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been shamed my whole life.</v>

255
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.860
<v Speaker 1>And then they asked me to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally my whole life.</v>

256
00:11:52.861 --> 00:11:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I've never danced at weddings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't dance at concerts because I just</v>

257
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.943
<v Speaker 1>know that I'm going to be made fun of in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some way and obviously no one's even </v>

258
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:01.340
<v Speaker 1>thinking about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my head it's,</v>

259
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.040
<v Speaker 1>it's my most insecure thing to do.</v>

260
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.430
<v Speaker 1>I would rather have sex on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

261
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>on tv 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then do dancing with the stars.</v>

262
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.230
<v Speaker 1>If there was a sign me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

263
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was my biggest fear,</v>

264
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 1>but you can't turn down these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're offered to you.</v>

265
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.743
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if there's something that </v>

266
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:23.080
<v Speaker 1>scares you that much as as this did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

267
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 1>what do I have diluted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to die doing this.</v>

268
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:27.423
<v Speaker 1>What's the worst that could happen is </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm voted off first and they say really </v>

269
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 1>means to the judges say mean things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about my style from.</v>

270
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got mean to me.</v>

271
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.430
<v Speaker 1>They got really means me fucking super </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious.</v>

272
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:43.923
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got eliminated less than like a week </v>

273
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 1>ago from this show that I gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything to and I and I went in saying</v>

274
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm a terrible dancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm doing,</v>

275
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 1>and I did a whole dance and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mess up.</v>

276
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Joe Like I and I got very injured the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day before.</v>

277
00:12:58.031 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get out of bed.</v>

278
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I had to have help because I tore </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in my back and I overcame,</v>

279
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.003
<v Speaker 1>came at mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked myself out of having an injury </v>

280
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.600
<v Speaker 1>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I meditated my way out of it,</v>

281
00:13:10.601 --> 00:13:13.740
<v Speaker 1>which I've done with several different </v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries in my life of just like I,</v>

282
00:13:13.741 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to be better.</v>

283
00:13:14.741 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I have to dance on live TV tonight and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't move.</v>

284
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't brush my hair because my arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>was hurting so bad that morning,</v>

285
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Speaker 1>so I just started saying to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're strong,</v>

286
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you're prepared and this is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're strong,</v>

287
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:27.220
<v Speaker 1>you're prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ZZ,</v>

288
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.210
<v Speaker 1>and I sent it 3000 times out loud in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>makeup chair all day,</v>

289
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:34.750
<v Speaker 1>walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly going from this kind of injury,</v>

290
00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:37.660
<v Speaker 1>walking like in the morning to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

291
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm prepared,</v>

292
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:39.850
<v Speaker 1>this is easy.</v>

293
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 1>And then I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then at the end of the day I was,</v>

294
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I danced on live TV and I cured myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally.</v>

295
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.830
<v Speaker 1>It was insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were so mean to me.</v>

296
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Especially len goodman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British,</v>

297
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 1>old Cranky Judge Frisch guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British guys always assholes.</v>

298
00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.613
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really hurtful and I took it in </v>

299
00:14:01.721 --> 00:14:03.480
<v Speaker 1>stride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was very.</v>

300
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.950
<v Speaker 1>He called me awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

301
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to walk away from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

302
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 1>not being like a white girl dancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>meme,</v>

303
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.203
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I just didn't want people to be </v>

304
00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:11.471
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

305
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:15.640
<v Speaker 1>white girls can't dance because I know I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't dance in and I just didn't want to</v>

306
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:17.350
<v Speaker 1>be made fun of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he made fun of me.</v>

307
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.213
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look awkward because at the end of </v>

308
00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:21.130
<v Speaker 1>it I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can dance.</v>

309
00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Like it was just me being funny because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I obviously can't.</v>

310
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:24.364
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just completed a dance that if you </v>

311
00:14:25.961 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that terrible.</v>

312
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I was very injured that morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was proud of myself and he goes,</v>

313
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.490
<v Speaker 1>you will awkward and you can't dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't dance.</v>

314
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:36.420
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said other things that I just,</v>

315
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.263
<v Speaker 1>I kind of blacked out during it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so sad and I was just holding </v>

316
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:42.580
<v Speaker 1>onto Tom Bergeron for dear life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

317
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 1>and then I got eliminated first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's so funny to me because I took on</v>

318
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:47.914
<v Speaker 1>this challenge being like the worst that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could happen is that I get eliminated </v>

319
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:52.970
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I surely won't do because that's,</v>

320
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't be that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be better than somebody,</v>

321
00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:01.120
<v Speaker 1>somebody 13 of 13 people and I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the worst.</v>

322
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.700
<v Speaker 1>My worst fear did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got made fun of on TV.</v>

323
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I got eliminated first and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being on a reality show,</v>

324
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:13.871
<v Speaker 1>like have you done a reality show where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like and the next to the first,</v>

325
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.490
<v Speaker 1>the first contestant eliminated from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show and then there's dinner and there's</v>

326
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.900
<v Speaker 1>a spotlight on you and I'm staring at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage,</v>

327
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:22.670
<v Speaker 1>like just a slat in the stage.</v>

328
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm just staring there being like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to say Nikki and gloves,</v>

329
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.880
<v Speaker 1>they're going to say Nikki and Globe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they Nikki and Gla.</v>

330
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 1>And it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a reality show right now.</v>

331
00:15:30.651 --> 00:15:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Getting eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so surreal and it sucked.</v>

332
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.943
<v Speaker 1>It sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm still obviously very much </v>

333
00:15:39.681 --> 00:15:41.480
<v Speaker 1>feeling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I loved the show.</v>

334
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>

335
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:43.814
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do different dances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like was ready to really because I </v>

336
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:48.074
<v Speaker 1>just learned how to learn how to dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had to learn how to learn how to </v>

337
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 1>because I'd never danced before in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

338
00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:56.300
<v Speaker 1>never learned the mark arena like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took myself out of any kind of dancing</v>

339
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 1>that was offered to me in school because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

340
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bad dancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want.</v>

341
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:01.934
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make fun of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never dance and I sign up for the </v>

342
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learn a dance.</v>

343
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I nail it as much as I can nail </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

344
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I was very proud of myself and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get eliminated and it,</v>

345
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I'm still,</v>

346
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm just.</v>

347
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.940
<v Speaker 3>Has Anybody ever done it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two years in a row?</v>

348
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.430
<v Speaker 3>I would love to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was almost.</v>

349
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.413
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want you start taking dancing </v>

350
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.290
<v Speaker 3>lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to.</v>

351
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.193
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you do that and then come back</v>
<v Speaker 3>next year and shove it up that British </v>

352
00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:29.560
<v Speaker 3>guys ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they'd want me back.</v>

353
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.423
<v Speaker 3>I bet they would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they have a hard time getting </v>

354
00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:35.510
<v Speaker 3>people to do that show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did they let me go so soon then joe?</v>

355
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Because it didn't feel like it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of my</v>

356
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.693
<v Speaker 1>sing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt,</v>

357
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:40.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get eliminated from one of </v>

358
00:16:42.371 --> 00:16:45.460
<v Speaker 1>these shows that you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

359
00:16:45.461 --> 00:16:48.340
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone at the top doesn't like me.</v>

360
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.170
<v Speaker 1>There's something else involved here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not okay.</v>

361
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.550
<v Speaker 3>It's probably just butt out of 13 </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

362
00:16:56.551 --> 00:16:58.560
<v Speaker 3>They liked me the least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

363
00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.760
<v Speaker 3>maybe just being honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had the worst performance.</v>

364
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

365
00:17:05.011 --> 00:17:05.291
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

366
00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:06.300
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't look.</v>

367
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.763
<v Speaker 3>If I was on with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably would have had the worst </v>

368
00:17:08.821 --> 00:17:10.140
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking dance.</v>

369
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.033
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like you think about your base </v>

370
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.900
<v Speaker 3>that you're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not a person who dances.</v>

371
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.193
<v Speaker 3>This is a totally new thing for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if now you have this in your head </v>

372
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.233
<v Speaker 3>and you decide to take dancing lessons </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you do it on a regular basis just </v>

373
00:17:24.421 --> 00:17:25.980
<v Speaker 3>once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twice a week for a year,</v>

374
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.620
<v Speaker 3>you can be fucking amazing by time next </v>
<v Speaker 3>year rolls around.</v>

375
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.623
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to see if they allow people to </v>

376
00:17:32.341 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 3>enter a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>continue.</v>

377
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.720
<v Speaker 3>They will will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

378
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.573
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking hard to get people to do </v>

379
00:17:36.091 --> 00:17:38.010
<v Speaker 3>that show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people say no.</v>

380
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.230
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a massive commitment.</v>

381
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:42.703
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't have the courage </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the time or the interest in sending </v>

382
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.590
<v Speaker 3>twice and got the same place</v>

383
00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.280
<v Speaker 1>looking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

384
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.170
<v Speaker 1>that was a different host to the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

385
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.153
<v Speaker 1>It was a different host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different judges because the first time </v>

386
00:17:58.711 --> 00:17:59.544
<v Speaker 1>I did it I was in college and I liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no reason for me to even get </v>

387
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 1>as far as I got.</v>

388
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was rigged.</v>

389
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.900
<v Speaker 3>What did you ever host or hostess?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

390
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:09.743
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the judges and there was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a real issue of with one </v>

391
00:18:13.831 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 3>season,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not with mine,</v>

392
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.560
<v Speaker 3>but with Brett Butler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drew Carey and a couple other people.</v>

393
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.203
<v Speaker 3>They protested because the person they </v>
<v Speaker 3>voted for did not make it through </v>

394
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:25.914
<v Speaker 3>because the producers decided that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew better and because they wanted the </v>

395
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:31.434
<v Speaker 3>television show to be more interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they wanted someone more </v>

396
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 3>controversial or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was.</v>

397
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.640
<v Speaker 3>So it was this huge deal where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

398
00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:39.474
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are we here as judges if you're not </v>

399
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 3>even counting our vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is all a puppet show,</v>

400
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's happening here?</v>

401
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:47.963
<v Speaker 3>And then there was also conflict because</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the guys who was a producer was </v>

402
00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:53.730
<v Speaker 3>also a manager of some of the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were on the show and people like,</v>

403
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:55.360
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

404
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:56.723
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of issues with that </v>

405
00:18:58.651 --> 00:18:58.900
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

406
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's every realities,</v>

407
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's a context.</v>

408
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.453
<v Speaker 3>There's rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would tell people like that want </v>

409
00:19:07.611 --> 00:19:09.520
<v Speaker 3>it to be on fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they would say,</v>

410
00:19:09.521 --> 00:19:10.680
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you get me on fear factor?</v>

411
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:15.190
<v Speaker 3>I'd say it stopped right now there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very specific rules about game shows.</v>

412
00:19:15.191 --> 00:19:18.700
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't even talk to you if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be on the show.</v>

413
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

414
00:19:20.111 --> 00:19:22.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get you on the show because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like you and I'm gonna help you.</v>

415
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.850
<v Speaker 3>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

416
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Even if you want to be on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't talk to me because if,</v>

417
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.880
<v Speaker 3>if I have to go to court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that?</v>

418
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:31.480
<v Speaker 3>That show quiz show?</v>

419
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

420
00:19:32.501 --> 00:19:33.334
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie was based upon that </v>

421
00:19:34.881 --> 00:19:35.714
<v Speaker 1>controversy,</v>

422
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.873
<v Speaker 3>fraudulent show because during that show</v>
<v Speaker 3>they decided this one guy who was </v>

423
00:19:39.941 --> 00:19:40.774
<v Speaker 3>winning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they decided it was a great thing to </v>

424
00:19:41.951 --> 00:19:42.784
<v Speaker 3>have him keep winning and so they rig </v>
<v Speaker 3>the show and because of that there's </v>

425
00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:50.401
<v Speaker 3>actual federal laws about how you </v>
<v Speaker 3>organize and run game shows.</v>

426
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.140
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real laws behind.</v>

427
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.270
<v Speaker 1>So then that's why I think I can't go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

428
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this idea.</v>

429
00:19:59.681 --> 00:20:04.681
<v Speaker 1>I would like to tell ABC I am interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in coming back and any of this</v>

430
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.340
<v Speaker 3>and I guarantee you you can go back.</v>

431
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I would love to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the best time.</v>

432
00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:10.983
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be a dancer now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I stopped doing comedy because I </v>

433
00:20:14.201 --> 00:20:15.034
<v Speaker 1>just wanted to focus solely on dancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I started doing comedy towards the </v>

434
00:20:18.641 --> 00:20:21.400
<v Speaker 1>end because you do something for hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day that you're terrible at.</v>

435
00:20:21.401 --> 00:20:22.234
<v Speaker 1>You want to go do something you're good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at just to like get your ego back in </v>

436
00:20:25.331 --> 00:20:26.164
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was beaten down for hours a </v>

437
00:20:27.761 --> 00:20:28.594
<v Speaker 1>day of just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrible and I was able to get to a </v>

438
00:20:30.701 --> 00:20:33.110
<v Speaker 1>place where I could kind of have my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

439
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.980
<v Speaker 1>my teacher gloves of Django is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best dancers in the world.</v>

440
00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.270
<v Speaker 1>He would just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been a teacher teaching dance</v>

441
00:20:40.271 --> 00:20:42.820
<v Speaker 1>since he was 14 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

442
00:20:42.821 --> 00:20:47.821
<v Speaker 1>I've never met someone who is so bad at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've never met</v>

443
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.940
<v Speaker 4>someone who's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

444
00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:51.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm special needs dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if this were a,</v>

445
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.330
<v Speaker 4>I would be on the short bus for dancers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't have whatever it takes.</v>

446
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.350
<v Speaker 4>But I worked hard enough that I was able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to learn a very difficult to know.</v>

447
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.343
<v Speaker 2>Stop you there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you don't have what it </v>

448
00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:03.570
<v Speaker 2>takes as you've never exercised it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

449
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.410
<v Speaker 2>You know how to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not ambulatory,</v>

450
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't</v>

451
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.133
<v Speaker 4>to say that I'm disabled in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but whatever some people are born with </v>

452
00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:17.010
<v Speaker 4>that gives them a natural rhythm and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like ability to dance.</v>

453
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

454
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming out a little of that and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of it is just a bunch of dancing and</v>

455
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:25.770
<v Speaker 2>they danced at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

456
00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:26.604
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you never played basketball </v>

457
00:21:28.311 --> 00:21:29.340
<v Speaker 2>and you went and played basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

458
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.350
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible.</v>

459
00:21:30.351 --> 00:21:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was going to kick ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

460
00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:32.743
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

461
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.670
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people feel like that about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

462
00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of people think if I ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought out,</v>

463
00:21:36.591 --> 00:21:38.130
<v Speaker 2>fuck people up like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

464
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that good luck.</v>

465
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.773
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing is I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kept saying down the barrel of the </v>

466
00:21:43.881 --> 00:21:44.714
<v Speaker 4>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

467
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.540
<v Speaker 4>if you're watching at home being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why can't this girl do this?</v>

468
00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:48.374
<v Speaker 4>Because it would be like clapping that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't get or walking and clapping </v>

469
00:21:51.921 --> 00:21:52.754
<v Speaker 4>together and I could just picture people</v>
<v Speaker 4>at home watching me struggle and be </v>

470
00:21:55.491 --> 00:21:55.941
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

471
00:21:55.941 --> 00:21:56.774
<v Speaker 4>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I say to the computer when I watch </v>

472
00:21:58.441 --> 00:21:59.600
<v Speaker 4>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm like,</v>

473
00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.320
<v Speaker 4>until you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know how hard this is.</v>

474
00:22:03.321 --> 00:22:03.800
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

475
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.820
<v Speaker 4>everyone assumes that they can do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>just like stand up.</v>

476
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.903
<v Speaker 4>But here's the difference with standup </v>
<v Speaker 4>is like I had people just like you did </v>

477
00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.260
<v Speaker 4>throughout your childhood and growing up</v>
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>

478
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:18.020
<v Speaker 4>you're funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got like no one's ever been like,</v>

479
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.330
<v Speaker 4>you should dance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like No.</v>

480
00:22:20.331 --> 00:22:21.164
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we have a natural knack at what we </v>

481
00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:23.924
<v Speaker 4>do that's kept us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that made us even try it in the first </v>

482
00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:28.034
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

483
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.710
<v Speaker 4>Who was the first person that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember being like,</v>

484
00:22:30.711 --> 00:22:31.544
<v Speaker 4>you're funny.</v>

485
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.643
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

486
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 2>there's like one guy in specific that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still very good friends with.</v>

487
00:22:36.431 --> 00:22:39.490
<v Speaker 2>His name's Steve Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an ophthalmologist actually.</v>

488
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

489
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:45.730
<v Speaker 2>we were friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 15 and he was probably in his late</v>

490
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:50.170
<v Speaker 2>twenties and we were training together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing martial arts together and he</v>

491
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:51.004
<v Speaker 2>was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just do impressions of our </v>

492
00:22:52.241 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 2>friends and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was like,</v>

493
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:55.780
<v Speaker 2>you should be a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

494
00:22:55.781 --> 00:22:57.610
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no way,</v>

495
00:22:57.611 --> 00:22:58.444
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

496
00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:58.891
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

497
00:22:58.891 --> 00:22:59.724
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say fucked up things that you think </v>

498
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:01.744
<v Speaker 2>are funny because you're fucked up too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like regular people are gonna think I'm </v>

499
00:23:04.811 --> 00:23:05.940
<v Speaker 2>an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

500
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.070
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to make people laugh that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were around me.</v>

501
00:23:09.071 --> 00:23:11.260
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started going,</v>

502
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.143
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to an open mic night and then I </v>

503
00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:14.410
<v Speaker 2>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

504
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 2>there's like a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like martial arts.</v>

505
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a whole process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning.</v>

506
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't think of it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought people were just really good,</v>

507
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.413
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

508
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Jerry Seinfeld.</v>

509
00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:25.234
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in high was senior in high </v>

510
00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:29.560
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl that I was dating,</v>

511
00:23:29.561 --> 00:23:32.080
<v Speaker 2>we went to see Jerry Seinfeld at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradise.</v>

512
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:32.914
<v Speaker 2>It was this big club and in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember sitting there thinking </v>

513
00:23:35.771 --> 00:23:37.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's incredible.</v>

514
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.090
<v Speaker 2>He's just talking and all these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are laughing.</v>

515
00:23:40.091 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Like this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a,</v>

516
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.530
<v Speaker 2>what a crazy ability to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

517
00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

518
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.483
<v Speaker 2>that blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a couple of years later I was </v>

519
00:23:47.871 --> 00:23:49.490
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's weird.</v>

520
00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.840
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

521
00:23:52.841 --> 00:23:56.230
<v Speaker 4>I would love to see a picture of you in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that crowd that night.</v>

522
00:23:56.231 --> 00:23:58.250
<v Speaker 4>Never having been on stage with a mic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

523
00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.060
<v Speaker 4>and then look at you now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so crazy.</v>

524
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.280
<v Speaker 4>Those moments of like in your life where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were at a Jerry Seinfeld show going,</v>

525
00:24:06.281 --> 00:24:09.160
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could never do that.</v>

526
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.200
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so nuts.</v>

527
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.123
<v Speaker 4>It was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now you're just like you and Jerry </v>

528
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Seinfeld to me are like one in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's the same,</v>

529
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.810
<v Speaker 4>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's cool.</v>

530
00:24:19.811 --> 00:24:23.890
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying is that you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people in your early on.</v>

531
00:24:23.891 --> 00:24:24.724
<v Speaker 4>You need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never have done standup comedy </v>

532
00:24:25.601 --> 00:24:27.160
<v Speaker 4>had someone not been like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should be a comedian.</v>

533
00:24:27.161 --> 00:24:30.790
<v Speaker 4>I was desperate for anyone to give me </v>
<v Speaker 4>any kind of direction.</v>

534
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.103
<v Speaker 4>And then some one person says at one </v>
<v Speaker 4>ophthalmologist says it and then it </v>

535
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.120
<v Speaker 4>becomes your career and that's why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>always.</v>

536
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.770
<v Speaker 4>I always try to just tell what I'd see </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like something in someone.</v>

537
00:24:41.771 --> 00:24:44.950
<v Speaker 4>I try to say that because you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're the one person that's going to</v>

538
00:24:44.951 --> 00:24:45.784
<v Speaker 4>get them to go do it.</v>

539
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.693
<v Speaker 2>I do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to talk like 100 people into </v>

540
00:24:48.181 --> 00:24:49.200
<v Speaker 2>being comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

541
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

542
00:24:50.221 --> 00:24:52.350
<v Speaker 2>What was trying to tell friends that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have that are funny,</v>

543
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should just try it.</v>

544
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Just go up at an open mic night and give</v>
<v Speaker 2>it a shot.</v>

545
00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.730
<v Speaker 2>I would just say do it if you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

546
00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:00.564
<v Speaker 2>do it now because you're going to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually and you're going to regret </v>

547
00:25:02.521 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 2>not doing it sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might not do.</v>

548
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.440
<v Speaker 2>There was a nurse that used to work at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this doctor's office or to go to.</v>

549
00:25:07.441 --> 00:25:10.260
<v Speaker 2>She was fucking hilarious and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>always telling him,</v>

550
00:25:10.261 --> 00:25:12.960
<v Speaker 2>listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should fucking do comedy.</v>

551
00:25:12.961 --> 00:25:15.450
<v Speaker 2>You really should try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she never did it,</v>

552
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.843
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went there for years and she </v>

553
00:25:18.901 --> 00:25:19.734
<v Speaker 2>thought about doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to call them to open mic </v>

554
00:25:20.821 --> 00:25:20.970
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll meet you there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

558
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll help you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll introduce you to the whole process.</v>

559
00:25:27.241 --> 00:25:29.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you.</v>

560
00:25:29.341 --> 00:25:31.320
<v Speaker 2>There's a signup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People go up.</v>

561
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not meant to do it.</v>

562
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:34.463
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

563
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.020
<v Speaker 2>what's that expression?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can lead a horse to water,</v>

564
00:25:37.021 --> 00:25:38.880
<v Speaker 2>but you can't make them drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

565
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.590

<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

566
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.453
<v Speaker 2>but just I think you have to be fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to want that kind of rejection and </v>

567
00:25:46.501 --> 00:25:49.140
<v Speaker 2>humiliation that we got in the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

568
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.980
<v Speaker 2>The early days too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people see you now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Rowdy drunk.</v>

589
00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.180
<v Speaker 4>Kansas City is a fun place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a fun place.</v>

590
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 4>I was just there couple weeks ago</v>

591
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:49.010
<v Speaker 2>and I did some crazy outdoor place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some outdoor amphitheater was awesome.</v>

592
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

593
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really great.</v>

594
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know it was outdoor until </v>
<v Speaker 2>we got there.</v>

595
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.083
<v Speaker 2>It was</v>

596
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.750
<v Speaker 1>one of those gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you like I had done?</v>

597
00:26:57.751 --> 00:26:58.584
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read any of the emails about </v>

598
00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

599
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I didn't pay attention to is me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Santina.</v>

600
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.520
<v Speaker 2>Santina was outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

601
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:07.140
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not outside.</v>

602
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.350
<v Speaker 2>What's outside?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was strange.</v>

603
00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started in Kansas City,</v>

604
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.070
<v Speaker 1>but that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been relating it recently.</v>

605
00:27:16.071 --> 00:27:20.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like working on a bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging people early on because I do</v>

606
00:27:20.391 --> 00:27:22.880
<v Speaker 1>look at the people that told me you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be a comedian when I.</v>

607
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.163
<v Speaker 1>right before I tried it because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be an actress and then I was </v>

608
00:27:26.091 --> 00:27:28.790
<v Speaker 1>like not really good at this and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

609
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.173
<v Speaker 1>I don't care enough to get good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I see what it takes to be great at </v>

610
00:27:33.711 --> 00:27:36.470
<v Speaker 1>being an actress and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>

611
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.750
<v Speaker 1>But then someone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're funny,</v>

612
00:27:38.751 --> 00:27:40.670
<v Speaker 1>you should try standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that was like,</v>

613
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

614
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.480
<v Speaker 1>I care enough about this to like go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the worst of it and get good.</v>

615
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:45.763
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

616
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.730
<v Speaker 1>I've been exploring recently unstaged </v>
<v Speaker 1>like blow jobs.</v>

617
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:50.723
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking through and I think </v>

618
00:27:51.561 --> 00:27:54.920
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>great at them.</v>

619
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.880
<v Speaker 1>I've never been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

620
00:27:55.881 --> 00:27:58.760
<v Speaker 1>you're the best at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've never been a girl who's like,</v>

621
00:27:58.761 --> 00:28:01.970
<v Speaker 1>I love giving blow jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always heard girls,</v>

622
00:28:01.971 --> 00:28:03.680
<v Speaker 1>like there's some girls that say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

623
00:28:03.681 --> 00:28:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I love second deck and I've always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

624
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.170
<v Speaker 1>say that to you or does it say it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys?</v>

625
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.580
<v Speaker 1>They say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

626
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.943
<v Speaker 1>it just out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always called bullshit on it </v>

627
00:28:12.981 --> 00:28:15.590
<v Speaker 1>because I just think it's like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just serving a guy and you.</v>

628
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.453
<v Speaker 1>There's no way that you can enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not that comfortable of a </v>

629
00:28:18.561 --> 00:28:20.570
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you get some,</v>

630
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:21.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

631
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.810
<v Speaker 1>the compersion where you enjoy someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else's.</v>

632
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's that,</v>

633
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.020
<v Speaker 1>but now I realize that the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between me and those girls is that those</v>

634
00:28:30.021 --> 00:28:31.850
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time they gave a blow job,</v>

635
00:28:31.851 --> 00:28:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee or one of the first times </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was like,</v>

636
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you're amazing at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really good at this,</v>

637
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.340
<v Speaker 1>because when a girl is told or anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>has told early on the first time they do</v>

638
00:28:43.341 --> 00:28:46.790
<v Speaker 1>something that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a natural talent at this,</v>

639
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:47.863
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

640
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

641
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.230
<v Speaker 1>And then you do it again and again </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're like,</v>

642
00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm good at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my thing.</v>

643
00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.650
<v Speaker 1>And then you get good at it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

644
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.513
<v Speaker 1>it's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no one ever said that to me about </v>

645
00:28:57.711 --> 00:28:58.544
<v Speaker 1>blowjobs early on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always just kind of like a means </v>

646
00:29:00.861 --> 00:29:01.694
<v Speaker 1>to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like if someone would have </v>

647
00:29:03.261 --> 00:29:04.700
<v Speaker 1>just been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lied to me.</v>

648
00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:07.010
<v Speaker 1>So I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked guys now like,</v>

649
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:07.873
<v Speaker 1>just lie to every girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a blow job and it's like </v>

650
00:29:09.441 --> 00:29:10.310
<v Speaker 1>mediocre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be like,</v>

651
00:29:10.311 --> 00:29:11.144
<v Speaker 1>you're the best at this ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the best job I've ever </v>

652
00:29:13.221 --> 00:29:16.340
<v Speaker 1>received because she will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it'll make her feel good.</v>

653
00:29:16.341 --> 00:29:17.174
<v Speaker 1>What's it gonna hurt that she thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the best at this thing that she's </v>

654
00:29:18.981 --> 00:29:21.290
<v Speaker 1>not that great at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she'll do it a lot because she'll be</v>

655
00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:22.124
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm great at this and this guy thinks </v>

656
00:29:23.151 --> 00:29:23.984
<v Speaker 1>I'm the greatest at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she'll do it a lot and then by doing </v>

657
00:29:25.761 --> 00:29:28.730
<v Speaker 1>a lot she'll get better and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wins.</v>

658
00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

659
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:31.813
<v Speaker 2>Or she could just suck a lot of dicks </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people will lie to her and then her </v>

660
00:29:35.541 --> 00:29:38.150
<v Speaker 2>self esteem gets shattered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she runs into the one dude and said,</v>

661
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:39.740
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck told you you're good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

662
00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Nobody told me I was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

663
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.670
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not good at this at all.</v>

664
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 2>It's all teeth and you're choking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>

665
00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.093
<v Speaker 4>Maybe maybe even a girl that is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>good at them can meet a guy that's like </v>

666
00:29:53.671 --> 00:29:55.890
<v Speaker 4>you're tailing because everyone likes </v>
<v Speaker 4>different styles.</v>

667
00:29:55.891 --> 00:29:57.960
<v Speaker 4>So I think that you run that risk </v>
<v Speaker 4>regardless.</v>

668
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some guys just like really bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>blow jobs.</v>

669
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:00.964
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some guys like blowjobs from </v>

670
00:30:02.141 --> 00:30:03.970
<v Speaker 2>someone who seems like they've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>done it before,</v>

671
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:05.990
<v Speaker 2>that way they don't feel like they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 90th in line.</v>

672
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a really good point.</v>

673
00:30:07.921 --> 00:30:08.754

<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

690
00:30:42.671 --> 00:30:45.240
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like a gay guy and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman together.</v>

691
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.143
<v Speaker 4>Jay Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gay guy should know how to suck a dick </v>

692
00:30:48.331 --> 00:30:49.164
<v Speaker 4>because he has one.</v>

693
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.590
<v Speaker 4>I've read everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've watched tutorials.</v>

694
00:30:52.591 --> 00:30:54.510
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just not getting through to me.</v>

695
00:30:54.511 --> 00:30:56.130
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't,</v>

696
00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.870
<v Speaker 4>I try and I'm not like bad at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

697
00:30:58.871 --> 00:31:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm bad at them,</v>

698
00:31:00.481 --> 00:31:01.314
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I always was apprehensive </v>

699
00:31:02.551 --> 00:31:03.384
<v Speaker 4>because I think the first thing I heard </v>
<v Speaker 4>about blow jobs was that the first </v>

700
00:31:05.851 --> 00:31:06.684
<v Speaker 4>complaint I would hear around me was too</v>
<v Speaker 4>much teeth and I've always had like </v>

701
00:31:09.541 --> 00:31:14.541
<v Speaker 4>really big teeth in some like smile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have vague teeth that abnormal,</v>

702
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:15.743
<v Speaker 4>but I always just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had buck teeth as a kid so I was </v>

703
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 4>always called me like a beaver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

704
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.740
<v Speaker 4>my teeth are going to get in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the way of this,</v>

705
00:31:22.741 --> 00:31:24.840
<v Speaker 4>so I immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was my biggest issue.</v>

706
00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:29.550
<v Speaker 4>And then you learn that like that's easy</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like work around and then so anyway.</v>

707
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.030
<v Speaker 4>But my friend said that she learned this</v>
<v Speaker 4>new trick where she wouldn't,</v>

708
00:31:33.031 --> 00:31:33.864
<v Speaker 4>she's hooking up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'll do a role play of like will you </v>

709
00:31:36.121 --> 00:31:39.630
<v Speaker 4>teach me how to do a blow job?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she's actually wanting them to teach</v>

710
00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:43.260
<v Speaker 4>her and so it's a hot thing where like </v>
<v Speaker 4>she gets to role play.</v>

711
00:31:43.261 --> 00:31:44.094
<v Speaker 4>But she honestly doesn't know and gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the guy tells her exactly what </v>

712
00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:47.604
<v Speaker 4>to do and then if she messes up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like part of the character as </v>

713
00:31:50.161 --> 00:31:53.610
<v Speaker 4>opposed to her being bad at blow jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's my next thing.</v>

714
00:31:53.611 --> 00:31:56.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the guys invested in the project.</v>

715
00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you mess up your own,</v>

716
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.530
<v Speaker 4>you're just part of your character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just being good at the roleplay.</v>

717
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.410
<v Speaker 4>It's because you're innately better.</v>

718
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.730
<v Speaker 2>But then when you break up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

719
00:32:05.731 --> 00:32:07.860
<v Speaker 2>listen asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sucked 100 Dick before you.</v>

720
00:32:07.861 --> 00:32:10.050
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to make you feel better.</v>

721
00:32:10.051 --> 00:32:13.170
<v Speaker 2>You fucking loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But either way they were all bigger than</v>

722
00:32:13.171 --> 00:32:14.590
<v Speaker 2>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of.</v>

723
00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.710
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

724
00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.540
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

725
00:32:18.541 --> 00:32:19.291
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

726
00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:22.490
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of thoughts about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously I'm,</v>

727
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.170
<v Speaker 4>well your act is very much like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

728
00:32:25.171 --> 00:32:27.690
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I hate being pegged,</v>

729
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:32.730
<v Speaker 4>no pun intended as like a sex comic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

730
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:34.523
<v Speaker 4>cause I just did this ABC show dancing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the stars and the whole time I'm </v>

731
00:32:37.531 --> 00:32:39.350
<v Speaker 4>trying to be on my very best behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

732
00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 4>I want</v>

733
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.680
<v Speaker 1>to play the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be the sex girl.</v>

734
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Get kicked off in the first episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to offend children watching</v>

735
00:32:47.241 --> 00:32:48.074
<v Speaker 1>at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

736
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I've never talked about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people go,</v>

737
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

738
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.690
<v Speaker 1>you do nightclub comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there for adults.</v>

739
00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking about what I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>

740
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.133
<v Speaker 1>Obviously what we all know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think sometimes people are like </v>

741
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:00.404
<v Speaker 1>year the sex coming because like I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's the most interesting topic </v>

742
00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:03.914
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm talking about it becomes </v>

743
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:06.644
<v Speaker 1>a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

744
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.520
<v Speaker 1>You get labeled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

745
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.670
<v Speaker 1>It sucks because I have ambitions beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a comedian who talks about sex,</v>

746
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.950
<v Speaker 1>but already I brought it there with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is my wheelhouse.</v>

747
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm most comfortable talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to talk about.</v>

748
00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of opinions about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to behave myself so much on</v>

749
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:28.850
<v Speaker 1>dancing with the stars because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be labeled as that.</v>

750
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.550
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also was like,</v>

751
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 1>didn't have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 21.</v>

752
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

753
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:33.873
<v Speaker 1>I was not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I didn't because I was all </v>

754
00:33:37.881 --> 00:33:39.980
<v Speaker 1>through high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like scared of guys.</v>

755
00:33:39.981 --> 00:33:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I was just scared of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimacy,</v>

756
00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:43.040
<v Speaker 1>scared of boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>

757
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:43.933
<v Speaker 1>didn't kiss a boy until I was 17 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even then it was like one shot deal and </v>

758
00:33:47.271 --> 00:33:48.104
<v Speaker 1>then I didn't do it for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I got an eating disorder which </v>

759
00:33:50.251 --> 00:33:51.084
<v Speaker 1>like push men away because I looked like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a skeleton and then as soon as I was </v>

760
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:56.000
<v Speaker 1>able than I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had sex.</v>

761
00:33:56.001 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 1>But it was years and years and until I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started like drinking,</v>

762
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.783
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I quit drinking and I couldn't </v>

763
00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:06.380
<v Speaker 1>have sex again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about how many</v>

764
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.490
<v Speaker 2>the people have gotten laid because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>booze.</v>

765
00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.453
<v Speaker 2>Every one dming Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember when there was this </v>

766
00:34:12.231 --> 00:34:13.064
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous time just a few years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they were trying to push this </v>

767
00:34:15.111 --> 00:34:17.480
<v Speaker 2>narrative that if you have sex with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's been drinking,</v>

768
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:18.314
<v Speaker 2>that you're a rapist even if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking to this is this weird third </v>

769
00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:27.440
<v Speaker 2>wave feminist nonsense where they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like adults going to grown adults have a</v>

770
00:34:27.441 --> 00:34:28.274
<v Speaker 2>couple of drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to do that because </v>

771
00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:30.314
<v Speaker 2>they can't consent because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking and so people were literally </v>

772
00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:34.304
<v Speaker 2>calling people and accusing people of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rape because they had sex with each </v>

773
00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.540
<v Speaker 2>other while they were both drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

774
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.453
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a.</v>

775
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:42.013
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's it was a real weird time and </v>

776
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:44.893
<v Speaker 2>they've abandoned it because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous and the pushback was so </v>

777
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:48.044
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're responsible for yourself </v>

778
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.310
<v Speaker 2>every other time when you're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're driving,</v>

779
00:34:52.311 --> 00:34:54.080
<v Speaker 2>you're responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get in a fight,</v>

780
00:34:54.081 --> 00:34:54.914
<v Speaker 2>you're responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're responsible during all those </v>

781
00:34:56.841 --> 00:34:57.674
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somehow or another if you and a </v>

782
00:34:58.941 --> 00:34:59.774
<v Speaker 2>person or exchanging pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you are not responsible for your </v>

783
00:35:03.681 --> 00:35:06.590
<v Speaker 2>actions and you can't consent to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've been drinking and then it</v>

784
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:09.950
<v Speaker 2>becomes rape and it's only really only </v>
<v Speaker 2>rape.</v>

785
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.873
<v Speaker 2>In the case of the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never raped a girl rape the guy </v>

786
00:35:13.131 --> 00:35:13.964
<v Speaker 2>because the guy was drunk.</v>

787
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:14.843
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though I know stories of where </v>

788
00:35:17.791 --> 00:35:20.190
<v Speaker 1>that's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where a guy wakes up from a blackout and</v>

789
00:35:20.191 --> 00:35:22.450
<v Speaker 1>a girl is stuck in this deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

790
00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>

791
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:24.150
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

792
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.620
<v Speaker 1>do I know if it was the other way </v>
<v Speaker 1>around?</v>

793
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

794
00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:27.423
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

795
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

796
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.400
<v Speaker 1>But obviously it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

797
00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.610
<v Speaker 1>And no one would be having sex if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

798
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.950
<v Speaker 1>if we didn't have alcoholic few people.</v>

799
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 5>So few people because 30 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people having sex,</v>

800
00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:44.043
<v Speaker 5>think about casual sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's my whole point right now is like </v>

801
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 5>I can't have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm single.</v>

802
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:49.650
<v Speaker 5>I can't even have casual sex because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>sober.</v>

803
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.560
<v Speaker 5>So how long have you been sober?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seven.</v>

804
00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.340
<v Speaker 5>It'll be seven years in December.</v>
<v Speaker 5>From alcohol?</v>

805
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.453
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

806
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:55.723
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And before then I was hooking up a left </v>

807
00:35:58.611 --> 00:36:00.620
<v Speaker 4>and right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so fun.</v>

808
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.950
<v Speaker 4>I was blacking out just to have sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was scared of intimacy.</v>

809
00:36:03.951 --> 00:36:05.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm realizing all of this now is like,</v>

810
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.670
<v Speaker 5>I know the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're doing all that.</v>

811
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go through therapy.</v>

812
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:10.910
<v Speaker 4>I work on myself constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I meditate,</v>

813
00:36:10.911 --> 00:36:12.630
<v Speaker 4>I do all the things and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

814
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'm any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am better for it,</v>

815
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:19.970
<v Speaker 4>but I realized that I'm not getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not having sex and it's not fun like</v>

816
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:22.440
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hooking up with ex boyfriends,</v>

817
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.410
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's because there's no pressure there</v>

818
00:36:25.411 --> 00:36:26.244
<v Speaker 4>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is new and am I going to catch </v>

819
00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:28.164
<v Speaker 4>feelings?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they've already been had or </v>

820
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:32.940
<v Speaker 4>the or the bubble up again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just get to scratch an itch.</v>

821
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.590
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

822
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but having new sex casually,</v>

823
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 4>like I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even imagine doing that.</v>

824
00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:42.024
<v Speaker 4>But I had so much when I drank because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it just makes everything easier and I </v>

825
00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:50.340
<v Speaker 4>used to just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I asked the crowd sometimes.</v>

826
00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:52.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you guys ever.</v>

827
00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 4>Who here has had sex for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 4>with someone?</v>

828
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:56.783
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both of you were stone cold sober first </v>

829
00:36:58.081 --> 00:36:58.914
<v Speaker 4>time sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally two people raised their hand </v>

830
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.890
<v Speaker 4>and in the main room and go</v>

831
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.250
<v Speaker 5>of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

832
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.430
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

833
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.140
<v Speaker 5>you're so right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one listening at home right now.</v>

834
00:37:09.141 --> 00:37:11.540
<v Speaker 5>Wherever you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever had sex for the first time</v>

835
00:37:11.541 --> 00:37:14.540
<v Speaker 5>with someone where you're both sober?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't happen in our society.</v>

836
00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>alcohol gets abused for sure,</v>

837
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.280
<v Speaker 5>but it also gets used,</v>
<v Speaker 5>used correctly.</v>

838
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:20.783
<v Speaker 5>There's good things to alc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a technology that </v>

839
00:37:22.521 --> 00:37:23.354
<v Speaker 5>alleviates a lot of your inhibitions and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes people feel better and that's </v>

840
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.210
<v Speaker 5>it for that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>

841
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.410
<v Speaker 5>Are you an addict?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

842
00:37:30.411 --> 00:37:32.570
<v Speaker 5>is it possible that you could drink a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit?</v>

843
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.333
<v Speaker 5>I'd be fine drinking a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I would first thing you say </v>

844
00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:38.610
<v Speaker 5>before you wake up in the gutter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly</v>

845
00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.920
<v Speaker 4>how I am with weed and I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I start out and I go,</v>

846
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:48.230
<v Speaker 4>I'll just get high as a treat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

847
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:52.510
<v Speaker 4>after a set and then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be fun to be high for the set and</v>

848
00:37:52.511 --> 00:37:55.240
<v Speaker 4>then it's like it'd be fun to be high </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I wake up in the morning.</v>

849
00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.133
<v Speaker 4>And so it always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it always snowballs into I'm high all </v>

850
00:37:59.171 --> 00:38:00.610
<v Speaker 4>day and then I have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

851
00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Sober October and I quit for a month and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then build it back up again.</v>

852
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.440
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're doing right now </v>
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>

853
00:38:05.441 --> 00:38:06.580
<v Speaker 5>We'd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you say you're sober,</v>

854
00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.070
<v Speaker 5>sober with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

855
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:09.783
<v Speaker 4>I smoke a little weed and I've gone </v>
<v Speaker 4>years in the seven years of not smoking </v>

856
00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:14.880
<v Speaker 4>weed and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm back on it.</v>

857
00:38:14.881 --> 00:38:17.160
<v Speaker 4>I quit for dancing with the stars </v>
<v Speaker 4>because my short term memory</v>

858
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:20.710
<v Speaker 5>was shit and you can't learn dance steps</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're high.</v>

859
00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.390
<v Speaker 5>I thought I might like help me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

860
00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:28.570
<v Speaker 5>I think if you already knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you had it locked in your memory then</v>

861
00:38:28.571 --> 00:38:30.730
<v Speaker 5>it would be good because you'd feel it </v>
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

862
00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:34.040
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was terrible for me.</v>

863
00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:34.874
<v Speaker 4>So I quit for three weeks and the second</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got eliminated I started again and </v>

864
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:40.243
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's been a week of me smoking weed </v>

865
00:38:41.561 --> 00:38:45.370
<v Speaker 4>again and it's already like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

866
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.590
<v Speaker 4>the snowball effect is in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is in play,</v>

867
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 4>but we does not derail my work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes me work out more.</v>

868
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.613
<v Speaker 4>It makes me think in a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>creative way and it eventually impedes </v>

869
00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.250
<v Speaker 4>me when it starts to interfere with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>voice.</v>

870
00:39:00.251 --> 00:39:01.084
<v Speaker 4>If I start getting like horse more </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm doing radio every morning </v>

871
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:05.950
<v Speaker 4>and then I'm going to make you hoarse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

872
00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:08.680
<v Speaker 4>Because I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to inhale or something.</v>

873
00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:11.560
<v Speaker 4>I just want you use edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>

874
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:13.280
<v Speaker 4>but those aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked like,</v>

875
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.630
<v Speaker 4>I like to feel it in my lungs and feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>it immediately.</v>

876
00:39:16.631 --> 00:39:19.990
<v Speaker 4>If there was an immediate edible I'd do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

877
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.620
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like those too.</v>

878
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.020
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those fuck up my voice too.</v>

879
00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:27.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I'm doing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

880
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.430
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

881
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:31.264
<v Speaker 4>I so wish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with alcohol I will say like I just </v>

882
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 4>could see it snowballing into a point </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I would quit again,</v>

883
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.370
<v Speaker 4>but I just have never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I miss drinking a lot for the sex thing,</v>

884
00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:45.730
<v Speaker 4>for the dancing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just dancing to music in general.</v>

885
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 4>Like is more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you drunk just life,</v>

886
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:53.380
<v Speaker 4>like first who drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like life is pretty great for drinks,</v>

887
00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.230
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sending text messages.</v>

888
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.153
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to send reaching out to </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys they don't want to talk to in the </v>

889
00:39:59.771 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 4>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of that anxiety.</v>

890
00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.910
<v Speaker 4>The hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm avoiding is the hangover</v>

891
00:40:03.911 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 4>and with we need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a hangover.</v>

892
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.360
<v Speaker 4>You can hang from weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

893
00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.240
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for sure.</v>

894
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.480
<v Speaker 4>And does it make you want to quit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>question everything?</v>

895
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:15.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you keep your drinking in check?</v>

896
00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.053
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never had a problem with drinking </v>

897
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.190
<v Speaker 3>in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never been like,</v>

898
00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.330
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a drink.</v>

899
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.780
<v Speaker 3>I've never been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

900
00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:25.903
<v Speaker 3>like sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>October was the first time I did </v>

901
00:40:27.471 --> 00:40:30.800
<v Speaker 3>absolutely nothing for a whole month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't smoke a joint,</v>

902
00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.440
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

903
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.790
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

904
00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:36.403
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was interesting about it was the </v>

905
00:40:39.351 --> 00:40:41.120
<v Speaker 3>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

906
00:40:41.121 --> 00:40:45.920
<v Speaker 3>because the dreams come hard and fast </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're off the weed and they,</v>

907
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:49.130
<v Speaker 3>because apparently I talked to this Guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Matthew Walker,</v>

908
00:40:49.131 --> 00:40:54.131
<v Speaker 3>who is a dream specialist and he was on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the podcast discussing the importance of</v>

909
00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.540
<v Speaker 3>sleep sleep specialist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say,</v>

910
00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:01.220
<v Speaker 3>but he was saying that marijuana impede </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain aspects of rem sleep,</v>

911
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.820
<v Speaker 3>which is when you do all your dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you,</v>

912
00:41:04.821 --> 00:41:06.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get off the marijuana,</v>

913
00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.753
<v Speaker 3>your brain apparently makes up for lost </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and hits you with some crazy </v>

914
00:41:11.691 --> 00:41:12.524
<v Speaker 3>fucking dream talking frogs and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>Unicorns and roller coasters that go </v>

915
00:41:17.481 --> 00:41:22.481
<v Speaker 3>straight to heaven and fucking bananas </v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams or my gut.</v>

916
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.833
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is this time for a sober </v>

917
00:41:26.391 --> 00:41:27.224
<v Speaker 3>October,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was way tapered off by the time this </v>

918
00:41:31.581 --> 00:41:32.414
<v Speaker 3>rolled around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I a little pot in Toronto on </v>

919
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean a little like I took like one</v>

920
00:41:37.701 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 3>or two hits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a drink,</v>

921
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.383
<v Speaker 3>maybe two drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I had one drink when I went on </v>

922
00:41:43.621 --> 00:41:48.621
<v Speaker 3>stage and then I had a couple glasses of</v>
<v Speaker 3>wine after the show who went out to this</v>

923
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.970
<v Speaker 3>restaurant after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

924
00:41:51.971 --> 00:41:52.804
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was an easy one because I was kind </v>

925
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:55.091
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

926
00:41:55.091 --> 00:42:00.091
<v Speaker 3>I think I slowed down after last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think doing that a sober October thing</v>

927
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:03.650
<v Speaker 3>made me realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

928
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:08.140
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some of that school that right.</v>

929
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:12.920
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately that is all my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics did drugs.</v>

930
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.480
<v Speaker 3>All of them picks Kennison prior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone did drugs.</v>

931
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.440
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were all.</v>

932
00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean prior was coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never touched coke but Kennison was</v>

933
00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:22.514
<v Speaker 3>coke too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Hicks was more psychedelics and I </v>

934
00:42:24.621 --> 00:42:27.080
<v Speaker 3>mean he did coke and alcohol and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that other stuff before,</v>

935
00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:28.010
<v Speaker 3>but there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was all.</v>

936
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.600
<v Speaker 3>They were all like these wild fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Ron White is a good friend of mine,</v>

937
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:36.500
<v Speaker 3>always drunk and there's like this part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that life that,</v>

938
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so it's so attractive because </v>

939
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 3>it's just like this wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loose,</v>

940
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 3>carefree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rebellious,</v>

941
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:48.590
<v Speaker 3>figured out tomorrow life and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the life of the comic.</v>

942
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:54.050
<v Speaker 3>But I realized like after last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so by October that there's a lot of that</v>

943
00:42:54.051 --> 00:42:56.710
<v Speaker 3>stuff you could do if you're sober and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

944
00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.470
<v Speaker 3>I think as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can abuse alcohol,</v>

945
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:02.420
<v Speaker 3>but you can also use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

946
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.710
<v Speaker 3>you can use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

947
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.920
<v Speaker 3>you can have a couple drinks and feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>good and you enjoy the moment more.</v>

948
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

949
00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.040
<v Speaker 3>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something to it,</v>

950
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:14.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's really a matter of your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality and discipline.</v>

951
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like how much and how much of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>addict are you?</v>

952
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much,</v>

953
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.513
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what holes are missing in your brain </v>

954
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:27.560
<v Speaker 3>that get filled up with that booze and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like once you take the booze away,</v>

955
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:32.500
<v Speaker 3>there's this gaping chasm that you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to fill in.</v>

956
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you got to figure out who you are.</v>

957
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Because I know some people that can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have anything,</v>

958
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.490
<v Speaker 3>they have one drink and then they're off</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the races and they're doing math.</v>

959
00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

960
00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.600
<v Speaker 1>that's not me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

961
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

962
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I would get blackout drunk a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well after a couple beers,</v>

963
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.860
<v Speaker 3>like were you less secure then the newer</v>
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

964
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

965
00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.193
<v Speaker 1>way less secure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think being sober has helped me </v>

966
00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:00.623
<v Speaker 1>become more secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because you're forced to be in the </v>

967
00:44:02.401 --> 00:44:04.500
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

968
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I worry about my depression too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with adding booze on to depression,</v>

969
00:44:10.141 --> 00:44:12.480
<v Speaker 1>which I feel like I have a good handle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of right now.</v>

970
00:44:12.481 --> 00:44:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to lose it because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that like,</v>

971
00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously alcohol is a depressant and so</v>

972
00:44:19.951 --> 00:44:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people that I,</v>

973
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

974
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I get really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really depressed and like in a dangerous</v>

975
00:44:27.661 --> 00:44:29.130
<v Speaker 1>way where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta watch it.</v>

976
00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:30.203
<v Speaker 1>Like I got to be vigilant about </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditating every day to keep my </v>

977
00:44:32.701 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 1>depression at bay because</v>

978
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.000
<v Speaker 2>what do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's a genetic thing?</v>

979
00:44:37.001 --> 00:44:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it runs in your family?</v>

980
00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.653
<v Speaker 1>I think it must run in my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have stuff that I haven't </v>

981
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:42.774
<v Speaker 1>even like get found out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like there's some suspicious deaths </v>

982
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:48.810
<v Speaker 1>in my family that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that suicide?</v>

983
00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I'm like,</v>

984
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's described.</v>

985
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does your depression feeling?</v>

986
00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.180
<v Speaker 1>It feels like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

987
00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I get suicidal thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like I just,</v>

988
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I should kill myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like kill yourself.</v>

989
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:09.790
<v Speaker 1>It would be fun to kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come from literally soothing.</v>

990
00:45:09.791 --> 00:45:10.624
<v Speaker 1>It soothes me to think about killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself when I'm in my worst depressive </v>

991
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.080
<v Speaker 1>stages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is,</v>

992
00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:19.660
<v Speaker 1>I compare it to like sniffles when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting a cold,</v>

993
00:45:19.661 --> 00:45:21.370
<v Speaker 1>like I have a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little thought will go,</v>

994
00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.260
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot yourself in the head.</v>

995
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Like it literally comes into my head </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sniffle where you're like,</v>

996
00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting sick again.</v>

997
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to meditate now and then it'll.</v>

998
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:34.780
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally it's like that.</v>

999
00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.920
<v Speaker 1>And what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's before the shoot yourself.</v>

1000
00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

1001
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem is like,</v>

1002
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:45.040
<v Speaker 1>it just is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1003
00:45:45.041 --> 00:45:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be.</v>

1004
00:45:46.481 --> 00:45:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be,</v>

1005
00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:49.954
<v Speaker 1>it's circumstantial little bit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm feeling lonely that day or I </v>

1006
00:45:53.441 --> 00:45:54.274
<v Speaker 1>didn't get a thing that I wanted or I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really do think it's like the </v>

1007
00:45:58.661 --> 00:46:01.120
<v Speaker 1>weather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I just can't even describe it.</v>

1008
00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I remember Sarah Solomon talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>her depression.</v>

1009
00:46:02.921 --> 00:46:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just a cloud comes over you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're just like,</v>

1010
00:46:04.961 --> 00:46:06.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here it comes.</v>

1011
00:46:06.401 --> 00:46:10.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of how it feels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I totally have it under control when</v>

1012
00:46:10.541 --> 00:46:11.374
<v Speaker 1>I'm meditating everyday doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get a single one of those </v>

1013
00:46:13.451 --> 00:46:15.310
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like if I skip a day,</v>

1014
00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.820
<v Speaker 1>if I don't do tm one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those thoughts keep,</v>

1015
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:19.743
<v Speaker 1>they come in and then if I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you see if you get into a real </v>

1016
00:46:23.471 --> 00:46:24.880
<v Speaker 1>bad spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1017
00:46:24.881 --> 00:46:26.090
<v Speaker 1>those thoughts start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1018
00:46:26.091 --> 00:46:26.924
<v Speaker 1>and I've never even so much as made an </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt or even planned to make an </v>

1019
00:46:30.101 --> 00:46:30.934
<v Speaker 1>attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's never gotten to that even </v>

1020
00:46:31.811 --> 00:46:32.644
<v Speaker 1>close to that for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I realized that these are the same </v>

1021
00:46:35.861 --> 00:46:36.694
<v Speaker 1>kind of thoughts that people that end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this start with like there's some </v>

1022
00:46:39.611 --> 00:46:42.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1023
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:43.683
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a people who love me and care about </v>

1024
00:46:45.701 --> 00:46:46.534
<v Speaker 1>me get so upset when I talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that more people struggle </v>

1025
00:46:48.671 --> 00:46:50.260
<v Speaker 1>with these thoughts then talk about.</v>

1026
00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.093
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm eager to share it because I don't </v>

1027
00:46:53.081 --> 00:46:55.720
<v Speaker 1>think I'm ever going to kill myself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's.</v>

1028
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.823
<v Speaker 1>But I think that like a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at risk and I don't think that </v>

1029
00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:01.384
<v Speaker 1>people talk about that enough then </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I do have these thoughts and I </v>

1030
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.670
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even like I go,</v>

1031
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:08.560
<v Speaker 1>what can I do to make myself feel bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1032
00:47:08.561 --> 00:47:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I could kill myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And literally it's like kill yourself.</v>

1033
00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.313
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little voice or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've struggled with mental illness </v>

1034
00:47:13.841 --> 00:47:15.790
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I had anorexia where it was like,</v>

1035
00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:16.930
<v Speaker 1>don't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1036
00:47:16.931 --> 00:47:18.040
<v Speaker 1>where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's that?</v>

1037
00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:19.750
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a voice.</v>

1038
00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Did you have,</v>

1039
00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:21.563
<v Speaker 2>don't eat because you thought you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>overweight or don't eat because you </v>

1040
00:47:24.571 --> 00:47:26.520
<v Speaker 2>thought you'd be more attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he looks like</v>

1041
00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a rail,</v>

1042
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean this vague direction vague or was</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just like an obsession?</v>

1043
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started out like,</v>

1044
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:37.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1045
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.340
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should be skinny.</v>

1046
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Everyone should be skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admire,</v>

1047
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I like wanted to be famous someday and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at,</v>

1048
00:47:43.801 --> 00:47:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I admire like I idolize everyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines,</v>

1049
00:47:47.111 --> 00:47:47.944
<v Speaker 1>the whole classic thing of like looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally in magazines and I want to </v>

1050
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:51.364
<v Speaker 1>look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate myself pinching my sides being </v>

1051
00:47:52.901 --> 00:47:55.210
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not like that then I'm worthless.</v>

1052
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Having a mom who constantly hated her </v>
<v Speaker 1>body was skinnier than me and constantly</v>

1053
00:47:59.891 --> 00:48:02.350
<v Speaker 1>said she was fat and things like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you just,</v>

1054
00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:06.580
<v Speaker 1>you have things modeled for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I grew up thinking skinny equals more</v>

1055
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:10.600
<v Speaker 1>lovable and then I lost weight just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1056
00:48:10.601 --> 00:48:11.434
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my senior year I lost weight because of </v>

1057
00:48:12.361 --> 00:48:13.194
<v Speaker 1>boy liked me that I liked who I liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and I was like very nervous about </v>

1058
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:15.910
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1059
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:16.181
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1060
00:48:16.181 --> 00:48:18.730
<v Speaker 1>when you just get nervous so you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't eat that day.</v>

1061
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.100
<v Speaker 1>And I had a date with this guy was my </v>
<v Speaker 1>first date ever.</v>

1062
00:48:21.101 --> 00:48:23.260
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that day I didn't eat because I was just</v>

1063
00:48:23.261 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 1>nervous and then the next day it showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on me because someone goes,</v>

1064
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you look great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

1065
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1066
00:48:29.411 --> 00:48:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't eat yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can do that again.</v>

1067
00:48:32.111 --> 00:48:34.120
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically the same thing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1068
00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:38.180
<v Speaker 1>you're really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're open to suggestion.</v>

1069
00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm really good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I,</v>

1070
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is I,</v>

1071
00:48:46.181 --> 00:48:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I am open to suggestion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is I am good at,</v>

1072
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 1>at losing weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

1073
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I can stick to a diet and I can black </v>
<v Speaker 1>and white things.</v>

1074
00:48:54.011 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I can say I'm not drinking for seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

1075
00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I can quit things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can quit eating and I have good.</v>

1076
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:03.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I learned that like Oh for the first</v>

1077
00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:04.870
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I could do this.</v>

1078
00:49:04.871 --> 00:49:05.704
<v Speaker 1>And so I just stopped eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the for a while you get like </v>

1079
00:49:08.471 --> 00:49:09.304
<v Speaker 1>super hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was very popular for a couple of </v>

1080
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.450
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then for a hot second,</v>

1081
00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:14.284
<v Speaker 1>I was hot for a second and then I got so</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary skinny and then I couldn't stop </v>

1082
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were just like,</v>

1083
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't.</v>

1084
00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey you looked great like a week ago.</v>

1085
00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Like right now it's kind of of concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1086
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.270
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know what to do because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat I'll just get fat again.</v>

1087
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:30.550
<v Speaker 1>And so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all I know now.</v>

1088
00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 1>And then it becomes if you eat your week</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes obsessive compulsive</v>

1089
00:49:34.001 --> 00:49:34.834
<v Speaker 1>and then it's not even about being fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore because you look in the mirror </v>

1090
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:38.320
<v Speaker 1>and I would look in the mirror and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1091
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.790
<v Speaker 1>you're disgusting.</v>

1092
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I looked like I w I look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust pictures.</v>

1093
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.493
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how bad I looked at photos </v>
<v Speaker 1>from back then to make sure that you </v>

1094
00:49:47.591 --> 00:49:50.980
<v Speaker 1>don't ever get back to that spot again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't ever get back to that spot again</v>

1095
00:49:50.981 --> 00:49:55.240
<v Speaker 1>because I'm too vain to do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know like what I see it coming.</v>

1096
00:49:55.241 --> 00:49:58.420
<v Speaker 1>It's the same way of like pot when I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starting to interfere with my life,</v>

1097
00:49:58.421 --> 00:49:58.991
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1098
00:49:58.991 --> 00:50:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you need to stop drinking and smoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot.</v>

1099
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:02.980
<v Speaker 1>And when I see myself get too skinny now</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1100
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:05.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to stop working in chaos,</v>

1101
00:50:05.471 --> 00:50:07.000
<v Speaker 1>but you kind of have a handle on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1102
00:50:07.001 --> 00:50:07.834
<v Speaker 1>I totally have a handle on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't ever be anorexic or die of </v>

1103
00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:14.360
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all these things I won't,</v>

1104
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go a different way.</v>

1105
00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:16.684
<v Speaker 1>But like those things aren't going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get me because they almost got me </v>

1106
00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:19.564
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1107
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean anorexia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have died.</v>

1108
00:50:22.241 --> 00:50:23.074
<v Speaker 1>I was going to die from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I planned on dying from it and </v>

1109
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 1>planned on time from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Joe,</v>

1110
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.173
<v Speaker 1>I was starving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sucks to be starving and on doing </v>

1111
00:50:31.901 --> 00:50:34.010
<v Speaker 1>this because I wanted to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1112
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.770
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a slow suicide.</v>

1113
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

1114
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:39.680
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

1115
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:41.180
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>21.</v>

1116
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:45.080
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped weighing myself because it was</v>

1117
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:46.760
<v Speaker 1>so dangerous to get attached to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

1118
00:50:46.761 --> 00:50:51.020
<v Speaker 1>But the last time I remember wearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself I was 98 pounds.</v>

1119
00:50:51.021 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 1>That was when I was admitted to a psych </v>
<v Speaker 1>ward when I was 18 and</v>

1120
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm five nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do you weigh now?</v>

1121
00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm 1:35</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and I'm skinny now.</v>

1122
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:02.250
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

1123
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:03.283
<v Speaker 2>you're not stretching imagination like </v>
<v Speaker 2>35 pounds lighter than this plus more </v>

1124
00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.390
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1125
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I was so thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so like,</v>

1126
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.590
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere I went people would point and</v>

1127
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:19.424
<v Speaker 1>whisper and talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those things where it was </v>

1128
00:51:20.571 --> 00:51:21.081
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1129
00:51:21.081 --> 00:51:22.570
<v Speaker 1>you've seen girls out and about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1130
00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Do those to go to my yoga class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was terrifying.</v>

1131
00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.650
<v Speaker 2>She was so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looked like.</v>

1132
00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean she was a small person too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was only like five,</v>

1133
00:51:31.921 --> 00:51:35.370
<v Speaker 2>one or five to and she looked like she </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably weighed 80 pounds.</v>

1134
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:36.833
<v Speaker 2>It was awful.</v>

1135
00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:38.680
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way people.</v>

1136
00:51:38.681 --> 00:51:39.514
<v Speaker 1>And I see girls like that now and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do the same thing that people used to </v>

1137
00:51:42.341 --> 00:51:44.680
<v Speaker 1>say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like just eat a sandwich bitch.</v>

1138
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing with Kim?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't say that,</v>

1139
00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:48.304
<v Speaker 1>but I don't even relate to the person I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was when I wasn't eating because the </v>

1140
00:51:52.181 --> 00:51:54.640
<v Speaker 1>only way you can say is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not eat,</v>

1141
00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:57.850
<v Speaker 1>I could not do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was almost like if you were to like,</v>

1142
00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:00.700
<v Speaker 1>if a protein shake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like drinking poison.</v>

1143
00:52:00.701 --> 00:52:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm gonna die if I drink this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that hard to,</v>

1144
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:04.660
<v Speaker 1>to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get.</v>

1145
00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1146
00:52:07.121 --> 00:52:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I was admitted to a hospital because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going away to school.</v>

1147
00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost all this weight and like a couple</v>

1148
00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.473
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it went away quickly for me and it </v>

1149
00:52:15.401 --> 00:52:16.570
<v Speaker 1>got scary fast.</v>

1150
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.823
<v Speaker 1>The school called my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents were in denial because they </v>

1151
00:52:19.301 --> 00:52:21.430
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to believe that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter was like dying.</v>

1152
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:25.000
<v Speaker 1>So they were kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were concerned.</v>

1153
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:26.920
<v Speaker 1>But like I was lying to them about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1154
00:52:26.921 --> 00:52:27.754
<v Speaker 1>I'm going out to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be here for dinner </v>

1155
00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.070
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just lying,</v>

1156
00:52:30.071 --> 00:52:30.904
<v Speaker 1>lying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lying.</v>

1157
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:32.583
<v Speaker 1>I went to the doctor to get a physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was going away to school in </v>

1158
00:52:34.241 --> 00:52:36.010
<v Speaker 1>the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was July.</v>

1159
00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I went to go get a physical and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulse.</v>

1160
00:52:38.321 --> 00:52:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I have like a low pulse anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I Brady Cardia.</v>

1161
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:46.360
<v Speaker 1>It's I think it's 37 to 42 resting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an issue.</v>

1162
00:52:46.361 --> 00:52:48.300
<v Speaker 1>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called Brady Cardia.</v>

1163
00:52:48.301 --> 00:52:51.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a low resting pulse rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1164
00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.380
<v Speaker 1>An exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1165
00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I exercise a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even when I don't exercise a lot,</v>

1166
00:52:55.181 --> 00:52:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I still just have a low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do a lot of cardio?</v>

1167
00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of cardio now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1168
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.513
<v Speaker 1>but I really liked this elite athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resting heart rate's like Lance </v>

1169
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:04.691
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really proud of it,</v>

1170
00:53:04.691 --> 00:53:08.590
<v Speaker 1>but I do nothing to support it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I run every day but not like enough</v>

1171
00:53:08.591 --> 00:53:09.424
<v Speaker 1>to boast that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it saved my life because I didn't </v>

1172
00:53:12.581 --> 00:53:13.414
<v Speaker 1>know I had a low pulse rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I went in for this thing that </v>

1173
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:17.203
<v Speaker 1>this physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctor clearly could see I was </v>

1174
00:53:19.481 --> 00:53:22.120
<v Speaker 1>anorexic because they looked at me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weighed me,</v>

1175
00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:27.210
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have any kind of data to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep me,</v>

1176
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 1>but until they took my pulse and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

1177
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.473
<v Speaker 1>if you leave you're going to die and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a liability to us </v>

1178
00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:36.870
<v Speaker 1>because we know so you can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to owe you a 50 1:50</v>

1179
00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:38.440
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it is where you're committed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a second one.</v>

1180
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:42.150
<v Speaker 1>So I went in for a checkup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was taken on a golf cart,</v>

1181
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:43.003
<v Speaker 1>the golf cart to the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital where I was checked into a </v>

1182
00:53:47.281 --> 00:53:48.120
<v Speaker 1>psych ward.</v>

1183
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:50.700
<v Speaker 1>And my mom's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1184
00:53:50.701 --> 00:53:51.600
<v Speaker 1>she's not in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1185
00:53:51.601 --> 00:53:54.930
<v Speaker 1>yes she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was admitted there and I had to</v>

1186
00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:58.230
<v Speaker 1>stay there for a couple of weeks I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1187
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.530
<v Speaker 1>And then I lied to get out of it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate just enough to get out.</v>

1188
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.393
<v Speaker 1>And then I went to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I convinced my parents I was okay to go </v>

1189
00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:06.900
<v Speaker 1>away to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I wasn't nearly died.</v>

1190
00:54:06.901 --> 00:54:10.650
<v Speaker 1>They're just starving myself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercising too much and that.</v>

1191
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:11.484
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is how I got out of it was that so </v>

1192
00:54:14.161 --> 00:54:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to die because I was hungry all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1193
00:54:16.351 --> 00:54:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Being hungry socks and I couldn't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how to eat.</v>

1194
00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know even know how to begin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

1195
00:54:21.241 --> 00:54:22.074
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every night I would just pray that I </v>

1196
00:54:23.281 --> 00:54:24.114
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't wake up because I would go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed freezing cold because you have no </v>

1197
00:54:26.821 --> 00:54:28.020
<v Speaker 1>fat so you're cold.</v>

1198
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.390
<v Speaker 1>You have to wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to school in Colorado.</v>

1199
00:54:30.391 --> 00:54:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I was ill prepared for the weather and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also I had no fat on my buddy was.</v>

1200
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:34.943
<v Speaker 1>It was an awful existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I did stand up comedy for the </v>

1201
00:54:37.591 --> 00:54:38.424
<v Speaker 1>first time because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I went to school my </v>

1202
00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:45.620
<v Speaker 1>freshman year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so crazy looking like I was.</v>

1203
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:46.483
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like the nightmare before </v>

1204
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack skeletal.</v>

1205
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Yet that is what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

1206
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I look at pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1207
00:54:54.091 --> 00:54:55.500
<v Speaker 1>how did you have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

1208
00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:56.573
<v Speaker 1>but I did because I became really funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted people to go look over </v>

1209
00:55:01.441 --> 00:55:02.730
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look at me,</v>

1210
00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:03.564
<v Speaker 1>so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a shy kid in high school when I </v>

1211
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.653
<v Speaker 1>was not anorexic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when I needed to make friends </v>

1212
00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:09.780
<v Speaker 1>because I was one school loan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1213
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.913
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just develop this really over the </v>

1214
00:55:11.791 --> 00:55:13.890
<v Speaker 1>top personality so people don't notice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm so thin.</v>

1215
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:17.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's when I became funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really funny,</v>

1216
00:55:17.341 --> 00:55:18.174
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always like,</v>

1217
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:21.210
<v Speaker 1>dormantly funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's when it became like outwardly</v>

1218
00:55:21.211 --> 00:55:22.044
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People started telling me how it should </v>

1219
00:55:22.681 --> 00:55:24.690
<v Speaker 1>be a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My freshman year I tried it,</v>

1220
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I did it one time and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1221
00:55:26.701 --> 00:55:27.534
<v Speaker 1>I have a reason to live now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a purpose and I know that </v>

1222
00:55:29.131 --> 00:55:32.570
<v Speaker 1>sounds so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cliche to say like,</v>

1223
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:33.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me comedy.</v>

1224
00:55:33.661 --> 00:55:34.494
<v Speaker 1>Gave me a reason to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really did because I didn't know </v>

1225
00:55:35.641 --> 00:55:36.660
<v Speaker 1>what that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1226
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:38.920
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to become a teacher?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

1227
00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not passionate about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

1228
00:55:40.651 --> 00:55:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1229
00:55:41.851 --> 00:55:42.960
<v Speaker 1>So then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

1230
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I have to gain some weight if I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to now have a career.</v>

1231
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:48.720
<v Speaker 1>So then I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a therapist.</v>

1232
00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to beat this.</v>

1233
00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I started reading books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a therapist and I found this one</v>

1234
00:55:52.111 --> 00:55:56.190
<v Speaker 1>therapist who told me the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really broke through,</v>

1235
00:55:56.191 --> 00:55:58.560
<v Speaker 1>which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have anorexia,</v>

1236
00:55:58.561 --> 00:56:00.750
<v Speaker 1>everyone's just eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't you eat something?</v>

1237
00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:01.584
<v Speaker 1>And you feel very in control of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're the one to blame </v>

1238
00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:05.304
<v Speaker 1>for it because you're the one that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing not to eat and you're the one </v>

1239
00:56:07.321 --> 00:56:08.880
<v Speaker 1>that's choosing to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1240
00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:12.300
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I felt all this shame about like,</v>

1241
00:56:12.301 --> 00:56:16.050
<v Speaker 1>why can't I cured myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I giving myself this thing that's</v>

1242
00:56:16.051 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 1>ruining my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this therapist was like,</v>

1243
00:56:18.391 --> 00:56:20.220
<v Speaker 1>think of it as like cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you got,</v>

1244
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:21.083
<v Speaker 1>you got sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something invaded your life and </v>

1245
00:56:23.711 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 1>there is a demon inside you telling you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't eat and it's not you.</v>

1246
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't listen to that voice.</v>

1247
00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:34.860
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as I was able to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disassociate my illness from like,</v>

1248
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:37.150
<v Speaker 1>it's my choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my doing,</v>

1249
00:56:37.151 --> 00:56:37.984
<v Speaker 1>I'm not eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was able to see it as like the </v>

1250
00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:41.314
<v Speaker 1>exorcist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that little girl has like a demon </v>

1251
00:56:43.121 --> 00:56:44.660
<v Speaker 1>inside insider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like dominique pitch,</v>

1252
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:45.693
<v Speaker 1>eat if you eat your week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I was able to go shut up </v>

1253
00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:49.930
<v Speaker 1>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I was able to eat again.</v>

1254
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:50.793
<v Speaker 1>It was like one nugget of one way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceiving my illness that was able for </v>

1255
00:56:56.771 --> 00:56:59.290
<v Speaker 1>me to like crack it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it took many years to like.</v>

1256
00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:04.420
<v Speaker 1>And I still struggle with controlling </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues over food,</v>

1257
00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'll never be anorexic again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1258
00:57:07.211 --> 00:57:08.620
<v Speaker 1>it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was um,</v>

1259
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:11.820
<v Speaker 1>it was a mixture of comedy and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy that</v>

1260
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:13.053
<v Speaker 3>with alcoholics too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's one of the reasons why </v>

1261
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:16.720
<v Speaker 3>alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they talk about,</v>

1262
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:17.554
<v Speaker 3>they talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's a disease and people who </v>

1263
00:57:19.091 --> 00:57:21.220
<v Speaker 3>aren't alcoholics who are judgmental </v>
<v Speaker 3>global.</v>

1264
00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:23.770
<v Speaker 3>It's not a fucking disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cancer's a disease.</v>

1265
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Leukemia disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd as weak.</v>

1266
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.620
<v Speaker 3>But if they treat it like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

1267
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:31.450
<v Speaker 3>then you can cure it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you,</v>

1268
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:33.910
<v Speaker 3>if you treat it like your week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you just shit on yourself.</v>

1269
00:57:33.911 --> 00:57:34.270
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1270
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:36.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm weak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want another drink.</v>

1271
00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.950
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it about me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I need this booze?</v>

1272
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 3>And there's this weird cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this loop,</v>

1273
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:45.290
<v Speaker 3>this that goes on in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1274
00:57:45.291 --> 00:57:46.390
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to drink.</v>

1275
00:57:46.391 --> 00:57:47.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to drag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dammit.</v>

1276
00:57:47.471 --> 00:57:48.970
<v Speaker 3>I drank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never gonna drink again.</v>

1277
00:57:48.971 --> 00:57:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm drinking again.</v>

1278
00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:53.710
<v Speaker 3>And then these people that just get </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely out of control.</v>

1279
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:57.250
<v Speaker 3>One of the ways that helps them is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>treat it like it's disease.</v>

1280
00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

1281
00:57:58.851 --> 00:58:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way that I'd never seen.</v>

1282
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:03.583
<v Speaker 1>I had seen so many doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until that one guy told me to think </v>

1283
00:58:06.351 --> 00:58:07.184
<v Speaker 1>of it in like literally did the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he put a chair in the corner of </v>

1284
00:58:09.951 --> 00:58:11.720
<v Speaker 1>the room and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to your disease,</v>

1285
00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:13.990
<v Speaker 1>tell it what it's done to your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had to.</v>

1286
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.140
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is too.</v>

1287
00:58:15.141 --> 00:58:16.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1288
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.230
<v Speaker 1>It took me 30 seconds until I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sobbing,</v>

1289
00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:23.750
<v Speaker 1>screaming at this empty chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

1290
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.823
<v Speaker 1>I mean it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever talked about this on </v>

1291
00:58:25.981 --> 00:58:27.550
<v Speaker 1>stage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1292
00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.453
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird because I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm still too in it or I </v>

1293
00:58:34.281 --> 00:58:35.360
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1294
00:58:35.361 --> 00:58:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to someday and when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>am able to,</v>

1295
00:58:38.121 --> 00:58:41.210
<v Speaker 1>it'll be like a real huge moment in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>career in life.</v>

1296
00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:42.373
<v Speaker 1>But even me being able to talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on podcasts like this or in platforms </v>

1297
00:58:46.251 --> 00:58:50.180
<v Speaker 1>like this is new to me still and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done it before,</v>

1298
00:58:50.181 --> 00:58:52.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1299
00:58:52.131 --> 00:58:57.131
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like I still suffer with so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of these things that I'm like,</v>

1300
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:59.210
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird to talk about it.</v>

1301
00:58:59.211 --> 00:59:00.044
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to have a little bit more </v>

1302
00:59:00.921 --> 00:59:02.540
<v Speaker 1>distance from the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's been.</v>

1303
00:59:02.541 --> 00:59:05.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm 34 now and I get had anorexia when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 18.</v>

1304
00:59:05.271 --> 00:59:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm still like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still too new,</v>

1305
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.900
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes things</v>

1306
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:11.850
<v Speaker 3>16 years seemed like a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1307
00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:16.620
<v Speaker 3>But it goes by quick happens very quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1308
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1309
00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I just like to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1310
00:59:20.891 --> 00:59:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just still.</v>

1311
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm still so angry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And still,</v>

1312
00:59:26.091 --> 00:59:27.950
<v Speaker 1>there's still pieces of it that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1313
00:59:27.951 --> 00:59:28.784
<v Speaker 1>how did I get this and how did I have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>save myself instead of someone else </v>

1314
00:59:32.451 --> 00:59:37.451
<v Speaker 1>coming in and saving me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why didn't someone intervene before?</v>

1315
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Can't though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can they?</v>

1316
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:41.143
<v Speaker 3>I mean now it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard for someone to convince </v>

1317
00:59:43.931 --> 00:59:46.890
<v Speaker 3>someone you need to stop drinking or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to get your shit together,</v>

1318
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:48.520
<v Speaker 3>you need to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to do that.</v>

1319
00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:51.290
<v Speaker 1>You need to hit your own bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1320
00:59:51.291 --> 00:59:52.440
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1321
00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I feel like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

1322
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:57.833
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still things about it that are </v>

1323
01:00:00.511 --> 01:00:02.620
<v Speaker 1>really painful to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it,</v>

1324
01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:06.120
<v Speaker 1>when I am dealing with something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that on stage,</v>

1325
01:00:06.121 --> 01:00:06.954
<v Speaker 1>I think the pain still shows and I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be funny with it yet because I'm still </v>

1326
01:00:09.661 --> 01:00:10.494
<v Speaker 1>so angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm still just like angry about </v>

1327
01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:16.300
<v Speaker 1>it because I also feel like I'm still a </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim to um,</v>

1328
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>body dysmorphia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like crazy.</v>

1329
01:00:18.721 --> 01:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Like that's my new thing where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just see something in the mirror.</v>

1330
01:00:22.561 --> 01:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1331
01:00:23.611 --> 01:00:24.444
<v Speaker 1>yesterday you felt the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go from a 24 hour timeframe from </v>

1332
01:00:29.131 --> 01:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fat,</v>

1333
01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll look in the mirror and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fat,</v>

1334
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>and then the next day I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too thin.</v>

1335
01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1336
01:00:35.671 --> 01:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>those things can't be possible within 24</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of themselves.</v>

1337
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>So your crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1338
01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:42.061
<v Speaker 1>so that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1339
01:00:42.061 --> 01:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm still dealing with stuff like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to be on the other side of it</v>

1340
01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:45.894
<v Speaker 1>and be able to tell girls like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're beautiful and your body doesn't </v>

1341
01:00:47.971 --> 01:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>matter and it's what's up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That counts.</v>

1342
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>But I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not there yet.</v>

1343
01:00:52.741 --> 01:00:54.830
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1344
01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>to really talk about it.</v>

1345
01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

1346
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's one way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1347
01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:04.124
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody's got their own weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that's causing them to have </v>

1348
01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:09.260
<v Speaker 3>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a B to b,</v>

1349
01:01:09.261 --> 01:01:11.540
<v Speaker 3>an alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to be addicted to whatever.</v>

1350
01:01:11.541 --> 01:01:12.374
<v Speaker 3>You're addicted to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one you have to figure out </v>

1351
01:01:16.041 --> 01:01:16.874
<v Speaker 3>the person and then figure out how this </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease or whatever it is a sort of </v>

1352
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:24.980
<v Speaker 3>interface with that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is it that happened to you that</v>

1353
01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:28.460
<v Speaker 3>made this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing attractive where it fits into</v>

1354
01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:30.070
<v Speaker 3>your slots and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1355
01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:30.993
<v Speaker 3>and distracts you from all the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are freaking me the fuck out about </v>

1356
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.960
<v Speaker 3>your existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1357
01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:39.950
<v Speaker 3>it is a coping mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was so simple that like,</v>

1358
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.850
<v Speaker 3>oh well then people are anorexic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell them this and then they go,</v>

1359
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:44.840
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1360
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.033
<v Speaker 3>I mean the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there was like a protocol that you </v>

1361
01:01:47.481 --> 01:01:48.314
<v Speaker 3>could just establish right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you just got to take these steps and </v>

1362
01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:52.754
<v Speaker 3>then you'll be fixed.</v>

1363
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they might work for some people.</v>

1364
01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would really doesn't help,</v>

1365
01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:02.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't help that it's so prevalent.</v>

1366
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Like there's so many people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues like that.</v>

1367
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.173
<v Speaker 3>And the other way too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's people that are </v>

1368
01:02:08.121 --> 01:02:10.450
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilders that are crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can't they,</v>

1369
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:12.680
<v Speaker 3>they the same gang big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>

1370
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.030
<v Speaker 3>It has the same goals with giant fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>boobs that they think they need triple f</v>

1371
01:02:17.031 --> 01:02:17.864
<v Speaker 3>boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the way people see themselves </v>

1372
01:02:20.461 --> 01:02:23.100
<v Speaker 3>versus the way other people see them as </v>
<v Speaker 3>very strange.</v>

1373
01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.373
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what I've been watching the show </v>

1374
01:02:25.201 --> 01:02:27.060
<v Speaker 3>botched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you watched that show?</v>

1375
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched that show.</v>

1376
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.570
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the same.</v>

1377
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

1378
01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:35.060
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what they don't see what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing at.</v>

1379
01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1380
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:37.103
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is poor lady who was on the other </v>

1381
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:43.020
<v Speaker 3>day who is getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's getting her nose fixed because she</v>

1382
01:02:43.021 --> 01:02:46.500
<v Speaker 3>had so many surgeries that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows collapsed and it was just like,</v>

1383
01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.420
<v Speaker 3>oh Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1384
01:02:48.421 --> 01:02:53.421
<v Speaker 3>And they had to take a chunk out of her </v>
<v Speaker 3>rib and they rebuilt her nose up.</v>

1385
01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:57.090
<v Speaker 3>It came out great at the end obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is why they put it on television.</v>

1386
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:59.610
<v Speaker 3>She fixed her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1387
01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:04.690
<v Speaker 4>Unless you don't fix inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that bitch done done.</v>

1388
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:09.303
<v Speaker 4>Unless you're fixing what's up here </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's making you look at yourself in </v>

1389
01:03:11.531 --> 01:03:12.980
<v Speaker 4>the mirror and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm uglier.</v>

1390
01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.600
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I'm in a mad dash to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe is like,</v>

1391
01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.540
<v Speaker 4>fix yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1392
01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:22.570
<v Speaker 4>just know to yet to get to love myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough through therapy meditation,</v>

1393
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:27.580
<v Speaker 4>just to love myself on the inside enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I don't.</v>

1394
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.410
<v Speaker 4>Because as I age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you age,</v>

1395
01:03:29.411 --> 01:03:30.244
<v Speaker 4>especially in this business,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things aren't as good for what as you </v>

1396
01:03:32.951 --> 01:03:33.671
<v Speaker 4>age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a woman,</v>

1397
01:03:33.671 --> 01:03:37.960
<v Speaker 4>things get shittier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you become less valuable to society</v>

1398
01:03:37.961 --> 01:03:38.794
<v Speaker 4>based on the fact that you're aging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just funny in this business and in </v>

1399
01:03:41.591 --> 01:03:42.424
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember the first time I </v>

1400
01:03:44.441 --> 01:03:45.274
<v Speaker 4>remember one time I was hanging out in </v>
<v Speaker 4>high school with my girlfriends and I </v>

1401
01:03:47.201 --> 01:03:51.520
<v Speaker 4>remember her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This girl's mom always used to just kind</v>

1402
01:03:51.521 --> 01:03:52.354
<v Speaker 4>of say things that she envied our youth </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot and when you're young you're just </v>

1403
01:03:55.301 --> 01:03:55.751
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1404
01:03:55.751 --> 01:03:56.930
<v Speaker 4>Old Lady,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you gonna?</v>

1405
01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>

1406
01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:02.200
<v Speaker 4>You're saying these sad things and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>just walking out of the room silently,</v>

1407
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:03.383
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But she would say these things in one </v>

1408
01:04:04.061 --> 01:04:05.620
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one thing she said really got to me,</v>

1409
01:04:05.621 --> 01:04:06.454
<v Speaker 4>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you girls are also young and thin and </v>

1410
01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:11.050
<v Speaker 4>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1411
01:04:11.051 --> 01:04:11.884
<v Speaker 4>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the last time a man held the </v>

1412
01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:17.590
<v Speaker 4>door for me and then she just left the </v>
<v Speaker 4>room and I'm like,</v>

1413
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.960
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a day that that just stops.</v>

1414
01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous.</v>

1415
01:04:21.131 --> 01:04:23.440
<v Speaker 3>I hold them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course for old ladies all time,</v>

1416
01:04:23.441 --> 01:04:24.274
<v Speaker 3>that's stupid,</v>

1417
01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.220
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she meant that was the last time</v>

1418
01:04:27.221 --> 01:04:30.640
<v Speaker 4>a man who wanted to fuck her and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1419
01:04:30.641 --> 01:04:34.560
<v Speaker 4>when that's in the air when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>door being held for you by a guy who was</v>

1420
01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:35.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bug you,</v>

1421
01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.220
<v Speaker 4>but why is that gender specific?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>

1422
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:40.540
<v Speaker 4>that's with men with women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men Too.</v>

1423
01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:42.100
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my dad recently said to me,</v>

1424
01:04:42.101 --> 01:04:42.934
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] don't even look at me </v>

1425
01:04:43.361 --> 01:04:44.910
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Dad's like an attractive guy and he's</v>

1426
01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.753
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like invisible to women and I can </v>

1427
01:04:46.821 --> 01:04:49.780
<v Speaker 4>see like a sadness in it and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't want to.</v>

1428
01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:51.123
<v Speaker 4>I know that that's all that will happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually because that is just the way </v>

1429
01:04:54.251 --> 01:04:56.160
<v Speaker 4>things go once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A guy might be,</v>

1430
01:04:56.161 --> 01:05:00.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm an older ladies and I'd like to bang</v>
<v Speaker 4>her and I will love that guy so much and</v>

1431
01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:00.874
<v Speaker 4>I know those guys are out there and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>hear hear from those guys a lot when I </v>

1432
01:05:03.251 --> 01:05:05.620
<v Speaker 4>talk about this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those guys are sick.</v>

1433
01:05:05.621 --> 01:05:07.250
<v Speaker 4>Just like you were when you were 18 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>

1434
01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.193
<v Speaker 4>I hope they never fixed that thickness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Please share it with the old ladies are </v>

1435
01:05:15.191 --> 01:05:16.820
<v Speaker 4>so needy though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1436
01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.760
<v Speaker 4>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1437
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>thank you for that is don't fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need those guys.</v>

1438
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.190
<v Speaker 1>But I just know that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's on the horizon,</v>

1439
01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.053
<v Speaker 1>that attention from men and women and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just society will start to wane and </v>

1440
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:32.854
<v Speaker 1>you'll become more invisible physically </v>
<v Speaker 1>to other people and I just hope at that </v>

1441
01:05:36.071 --> 01:05:36.904
<v Speaker 1>point I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I liked myself enough and so </v>

1442
01:05:39.071 --> 01:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like running at that.</v>

1443
01:05:41.711 --> 01:05:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Trying to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like myself enough on the inside,</v>

1444
01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:45.064
<v Speaker 1>which I really have gotten so far ahead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what I thought I could ever do in </v>

1445
01:05:50.171 --> 01:05:51.004
<v Speaker 1>terms of loving myself and working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself and getting sober and all the </v>

1446
01:05:53.261 --> 01:05:55.550
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I still feel like it's not enough.</v>

1447
01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:56.384
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still deal with insecurities and I'm </v>

1448
01:05:58.871 --> 01:05:59.860
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit,</v>

1449
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm aging and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to not feel this.</v>

1450
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to not care that I'm aging </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much.</v>

1451
01:06:06.731 --> 01:06:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be one of these women </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a hates aging.</v>

1452
01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm kind of,</v>

1453
01:06:11.810 --> 01:06:15.620
<v Speaker 3>well you have to be very careful in you </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel about aging,</v>

1454
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.090
<v Speaker 3>aging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think about it</v>

1455
01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:21.910
<v Speaker 1>really don't tell you don't because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem ageless.</v>

1456
01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Like honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone just said your age,</v>

1457
01:06:23.891 --> 01:06:24.724
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think of Joe is having an </v>

1458
01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:28.240
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly don't like.</v>

1459
01:06:28.241 --> 01:06:29.074
<v Speaker 1>You seem like an ageless person to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because you don't give a </v>

1460
01:06:31.061 --> 01:06:31.894
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1461
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:35.510
<v Speaker 3>You don't think of it you this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is gonna sound ridiculous,</v>

1462
01:06:35.511 --> 01:06:39.690
<v Speaker 3>but you have to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to realize that the entire,</v>

1463
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:44.360
<v Speaker 3>your life from birth to death is a blink</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an eye.</v>

1464
01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:49.700
<v Speaker 3>It is a very short period of time in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of the entire life of the planet,</v>

1465
01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.380
<v Speaker 3>the life of the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the life of the universe.</v>

1466
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:59.210
<v Speaker 3>It is a blink of an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for you to be with wear blinders and</v>

1467
01:06:59.211 --> 01:07:04.211
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on one tiny little window of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual viability,</v>

1468
01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:08.090
<v Speaker 3>it's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous because the whole,</v>

1469
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:09.303
<v Speaker 3>your whole existence is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so bizarre looking at people's </v>

1470
01:07:13.551 --> 01:07:15.590
<v Speaker 3>bizarre like how the fuck do your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 3>work?</v>

1471
01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:16.483
<v Speaker 3>You're looking through your eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>light is refracted through your lenses </v>

1472
01:07:19.581 --> 01:07:22.700
<v Speaker 3>and your cornea and you're seeing things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know that if I reach,</v>

1473
01:07:22.701 --> 01:07:24.710
<v Speaker 3>I can grab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This can is right there.</v>

1474
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:29.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean all of that is bizarre and so to </v>
<v Speaker 3>to concentrate on this one thing,</v>

1475
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.040
<v Speaker 3>when will people stop wanting to stick </v>
<v Speaker 3>their Dick in the me?</v>

1476
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.500
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy that I even like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a crazy.</v>

1477
01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a perspective issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1478
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:40.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the,</v>

1479
01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.490
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wider you get away from that and one</v>

1480
01:07:43.491 --> 01:07:45.590
<v Speaker 3>of the best ways to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychedelic drugs,</v>

1481
01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:46.873
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic drugs are one of the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>best ways to broaden your perspective </v>

1482
01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:52.640
<v Speaker 3>because the experience is so tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tonically,</v>

1483
01:07:52.641 --> 01:07:57.641
<v Speaker 3>alien and so giant and connects you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire universe itself that when you</v>

1484
01:07:59.090 --> 01:07:59.923
<v Speaker 3>come back down to earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems so preposterous and then you </v>

1485
01:08:03.021 --> 01:08:05.440
<v Speaker 3>see this dance that everybody's involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1486
01:08:05.441 --> 01:08:06.274
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with putting on fake butts and fucking </v>

1487
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:09.463
<v Speaker 3>get your lips done and all the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are doing just to try to </v>

1488
01:08:12.201 --> 01:08:16.760
<v Speaker 3>attract more sexual attention and </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing that this is so,</v>

1489
01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.610
<v Speaker 3>so such a short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that freaked me out is</v>

1490
01:08:19.611 --> 01:08:20.444
<v Speaker 3>what I call monster face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's when women get their face pulled </v>

1491
01:08:23.661 --> 01:08:28.160
<v Speaker 3>back so far that their mouth looks like </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bigger because there had been doing</v>

1492
01:08:28.161 --> 01:08:28.994
<v Speaker 3>this and so it looks like they could </v>
<v Speaker 3>just open their mouth up like venom and </v>

1493
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Speaker 3>fucking get your whole head in there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>chop your fucking head off.</v>

1494
01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.053
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>

1495
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:37.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a sickness.</v>

1496
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.410
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get that stuff done,</v>

1497
01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:40.244
<v Speaker 4>you end up looking like other people who</v>
<v Speaker 4>have had it done so you get a certain </v>

1498
01:08:43.101 --> 01:08:44.810
<v Speaker 4>type of face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all know the face.</v>

1499
01:08:44.811 --> 01:08:46.680
<v Speaker 4>You're describing like a deep sea </v>
<v Speaker 4>monster,</v>

1500
01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:47.750
<v Speaker 4>a deep sea fish.</v>

1501
01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:48.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And shoot things into their cheeks and </v>

1502
01:08:50.071 --> 01:08:52.540
<v Speaker 3>make your cheeks puff up because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminates some of the wrinkles.</v>

1503
01:08:52.541 --> 01:08:56.400
<v Speaker 3>But then it looks like you've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>beaten up literally like you got fucking</v>

1504
01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.590
<v Speaker 3>stung with a swarm of bees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better.</v>

1505
01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

1506
01:09:00.150 --> 01:09:00.983
<v Speaker 3>You know also doesn't work because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing called the fibonacci </v>

1507
01:09:02.681 --> 01:09:05.200
<v Speaker 3>sequence and when you look at a person's</v>
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>

1508
01:09:05.201 --> 01:09:07.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a golden ratio of the nose to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the eyes,</v>

1509
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:10.090
<v Speaker 3>the chin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as soon as you fuck with anything,</v>

1510
01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.180
<v Speaker 3>soon as you switch one of those up like </v>
<v Speaker 3>lips,</v>

1511
01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:12.910
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey.</v>

1512
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at say like Serena </v>
<v Speaker 3>Williams,</v>

1513
01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.650
<v Speaker 3>her lips match her face and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1514
01:09:17.651 --> 01:09:20.380
<v Speaker 3>there's a natural order to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at Arusha fear,</v>

1515
01:09:20.381 --> 01:09:23.080
<v Speaker 3>his nose matches his chin matches his </v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

1516
01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:26.680
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a ratio that it fits in and when</v>

1517
01:09:26.681 --> 01:09:29.380
<v Speaker 3>you get a nose job and you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have a big nose,</v>

1518
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:31.350
<v Speaker 3>people look at you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1519
01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.410
<v Speaker 3>What if you have like a Persian face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

1520
01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:35.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big,</v>

1521
01:09:35.561 --> 01:09:36.394
<v Speaker 3>robust Persian face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have this little fucking Pixie </v>

1522
01:09:39.911 --> 01:09:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Irish knows people like what the fuck is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on with her face?</v>

1523
01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.010
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

1524
01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.053
<v Speaker 4>But Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many people that have worked </v>

1525
01:09:49.691 --> 01:09:52.300
<v Speaker 4>on that you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all know bad plastic surgery,</v>

1526
01:09:52.301 --> 01:09:55.690
<v Speaker 4>but there's some that so good and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>think of these people as being born that</v>

1527
01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:58.840
<v Speaker 4>way mean there's dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1528
01:09:58.841 --> 01:10:00.220
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a perfect one.</v>

1529
01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>girls always bring her up,</v>

1530
01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:05.050
<v Speaker 4>let it out later that she was a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a monster now.</v>

1531
01:10:05.051 --> 01:10:08.290
<v Speaker 4>She's gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's some stuff that works,</v>

1532
01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.273
<v Speaker 4>but you're so right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I want to talk to you about </v>

1533
01:10:10.691 --> 01:10:13.660
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics because when did you first </v>
<v Speaker 4>do them?</v>

1534
01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.640
<v Speaker 4>Most 30 when you were 30.</v>

1535
01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.010
<v Speaker 3>I think I was a little younger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No?</v>

1536
01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1537
01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:20.944
<v Speaker 3>When I was 13 I started smoking pot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then a psychedelics dogs came after </v>

1538
01:10:23.891 --> 01:10:24.480
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1539
01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.390
<v Speaker 4>And did you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously that,</v>

1540
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:28.343
<v Speaker 4>that was before the time when people </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought psychedelics were a way to like </v>

1541
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:32.663
<v Speaker 4>heal yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I feel like this is kind of like a </v>

1542
01:10:34.381 --> 01:10:37.430
<v Speaker 4>new movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that psychedelics are the answer.</v>

1543
01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:38.413
<v Speaker 3>You're around the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back then you would get that </v>

1544
01:10:40.171 --> 01:10:40.780
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1545
01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:43.150
<v Speaker 4>Were you around the right people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that how you got introduced to them?</v>

1546
01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:43.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1547
01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:44.603
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was around a lot of it because of the </v>

1548
01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:51.930
<v Speaker 3>fact that I was a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also because of the fact that,</v>

1549
01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1550
01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:58.220
<v Speaker 3>I was relatively famous back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1551
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.000
<v Speaker 3>not famous famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like pee.</v>

1552
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:01.380
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on television.</v>

1553
01:11:01.381 --> 01:11:06.381
<v Speaker 3>I've done some things so people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to like turn you onto things,</v>

1554
01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1555
01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:10.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would go to parties or meet people</v>

1556
01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.540
<v Speaker 3>and they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1557
01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:12.151
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1558
01:11:12.151 --> 01:11:13.350
<v Speaker 3>have you ever done mushrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>

1559
01:11:13.351 --> 01:11:13.530
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1560
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:15.090
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever heard of DMT?</v>

1561
01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:15.924
<v Speaker 3>And the like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a few different things </v>

1562
01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:21.030
<v Speaker 3>that would happen and you'd be around </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people who had gone to jail for it</v>

1563
01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:24.510
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're like real psychedelic heads.</v>

1564
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.840
<v Speaker 3>And once I was around a few of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized like,</v>

1565
01:11:27.841 --> 01:11:30.000
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole nother world out there.</v>

1566
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:30.983
<v Speaker 3>And then I discovered Timothy leary and </v>
<v Speaker 3>John Lilly and this flotation tank </v>

1567
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.250
<v Speaker 3>became a giant part of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1568
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:39.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1569
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:44.270
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna and Dennis Mckenna and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the various psychedelic wizards that</v>

1570
01:11:44.281 --> 01:11:48.570
<v Speaker 3>are out there that I've been sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressing that there's,</v>

1571
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole world out there that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not seeing.</v>

1572
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.943
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're living life inside this </v>
<v Speaker 3>very strange tent is a very thin </v>

1573
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:02.670
<v Speaker 3>membrane tent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you just unzip that tent and step</v>

1574
01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:03.504
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire wilderness of the universe </v>

1575
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:05.784
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most people live their life inside </v>

1576
01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:09.024
<v Speaker 3>this very thin walled tent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they think that that tent sort of </v>

1577
01:12:12.151 --> 01:12:14.980
<v Speaker 3>defines the actual universe itself when </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1578
01:12:14.981 --> 01:12:15.814
<v Speaker 3>it's so small and so limited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a chance that you opened that </v>

1579
01:12:20.221 --> 01:12:21.054
<v Speaker 3>tent and you don't like what you see and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you've fucked your whole life up </v>

1580
01:12:23.221 --> 01:12:24.054
<v Speaker 3>because I think that's most people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>apprehension about shure specifically </v>

1581
01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:29.250
<v Speaker 3>come back.</v>

1582
01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll sit bear it.</v>

1583
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:32.093
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been a lot of people that were </v>

1584
01:12:33.301 --> 01:12:34.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1585
01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:35.563
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that know friends that </v>

1586
01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.673
<v Speaker 3>will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The issue is with psychosis and people </v>

1587
01:12:41.161 --> 01:12:41.994
<v Speaker 3>that have schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that have legitimate mental </v>

1588
01:12:45.241 --> 01:12:46.740
<v Speaker 3>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental health issues.</v>

1589
01:12:46.890 --> 01:12:50.460
<v Speaker 3>And they did the argument is correlation</v>
<v Speaker 3>or causation.</v>

1590
01:12:50.461 --> 01:12:51.570
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the argument is,</v>

1591
01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:56.630
<v Speaker 3>does the psychedelic drugs caused mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>illness or do a certain amount of people</v>

1592
01:12:57.721 --> 01:12:58.554
<v Speaker 3>already have mental illness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's much more likely that </v>

1593
01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:06.390
<v Speaker 3>the percentage of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia remained static.</v>

1594
01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it like this,</v>

1595
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.490
<v Speaker 3>the number of people who smoke </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana,</v>

1596
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.473
<v Speaker 3>who are also schizophrenia mirrors the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of people or schizophrenia </v>

1597
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:17.003
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not that marijuana causes </v>

1598
01:13:18.541 --> 01:13:20.610
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a one out of 100 or whatever the</v>

1599
01:13:20.611 --> 01:13:22.800
<v Speaker 3>number is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just have this issue,</v>

1600
01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.540
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1601
01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:27.900
<v Speaker 3>And for those people it's critical that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they avoid psychedelic drugs,</v>

1602
01:13:27.901 --> 01:13:32.901
<v Speaker 3>that they avoid marijuana and probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>even alcohol or many even maybe bunch of</v>

1603
01:13:33.151 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 3>other psychotropic drugs as well because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could.</v>

1604
01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.713
<v Speaker 3>You've got an imbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like someone who has a liver </v>

1605
01:13:38.731 --> 01:13:39.564
<v Speaker 3>disease has an imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like someone who has a lung </v>

1606
01:13:42.721 --> 01:13:43.554
<v Speaker 3>disorder can breathe well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone assisting fibrosis or someone </v>

1607
01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:46.854
<v Speaker 3>who has any number of diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to kind of think of it that </v>

1608
01:13:48.751 --> 01:13:51.450
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an ailment of the mind.</v>

1609
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.450
<v Speaker 3>And so if you add this unknown element </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that ailment,</v>

1610
01:13:54.451 --> 01:13:56.940
<v Speaker 3>like five grams of dried mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1611
01:13:56.941 --> 01:13:58.770
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows what could happen?</v>

1612
01:13:58.771 --> 01:14:02.040
<v Speaker 3>You might never come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the question.</v>

1613
01:14:02.041 --> 01:14:02.874
<v Speaker 3>The other part of your question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible you could open that tent </v>

1614
01:14:05.281 --> 01:14:07.440
<v Speaker 3>and not like what you see and fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life?</v>

1615
01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1616
01:14:09.421 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Even if you don't have or a mental</v>

1617
01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:13.413
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have a view of the world </v>

1618
01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:16.174
<v Speaker 2>that's untenable with the experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have under the influence of </v>

1619
01:14:20.141 --> 01:14:22.300
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that might be the.</v>

1620
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:23.143
<v Speaker 2>Your view of the world is bullshit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been living your life with this </v>

1621
01:14:26.501 --> 01:14:29.770
<v Speaker 2>fucking Norman Rockwell nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 2>floating around your head because you've</v>

1622
01:14:29.771 --> 01:14:30.604
<v Speaker 2>been so influenced by media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by songs and by television shows and </v>

1623
01:14:34.451 --> 01:14:35.141
<v Speaker 2>buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1624
01:14:35.141 --> 01:14:38.440
<v Speaker 2>I want to live like the kids on friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even live like that.</v>

1625
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all fucked up.</v>

1626
01:14:40.631 --> 01:14:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1627
01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:44.530
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jennifer Aniston seems to be not aging.</v>

1628
01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 2>That's pitches is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my girl.</v>

1629
01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I want to be around her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to find out what she's doing.</v>

1630
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:51.750
<v Speaker 2>What kind of cream are you using?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cream.</v>

1631
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.010
<v Speaker 2>It's lasers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck she's doing.</v>

1632
01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:56.230
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 50 years old.</v>

1633
01:14:56.231 --> 01:14:57.064
<v Speaker 2>She looks like she's 12.</v>

1634
01:14:57.850 --> 01:14:58.683
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would feel bad if you had sex with </v>

1635
01:15:00.951 --> 01:15:01.784
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're having sex with an 18 year </v>

1636
01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:04.000
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looks amazing.</v>

1637
01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:06.760
<v Speaker 2>She literally hasn't really done Matthew</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perry.</v>

1638
01:15:06.761 --> 01:15:07.594
<v Speaker 2>Looks like he's been to hell and back </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that motherfucker went head first </v>

1639
01:15:11.711 --> 01:15:15.700
<v Speaker 2>into a sand storm and he got his face </v>
<v Speaker 2>ripped off.</v>

1640
01:15:15.730 --> 01:15:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Like he's been just doing math every day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and smoking cigarettes.</v>

1641
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.823
<v Speaker 2>One lighting the other from the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's awake until the time he goes to </v>

1642
01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:25.144
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like total dog shit and she </v>

1643
01:15:30.281 --> 01:15:32.370
<v Speaker 2>looks fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they were.</v>

1644
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.960
<v Speaker 2>They worked together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were both young together.</v>

1645
01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Shared some skin care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fuck.</v>

1646
01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:41.710
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is like a perfect example.</v>

1647
01:15:42.130 --> 01:15:44.620
<v Speaker 2>It is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even she can't keep it together.</v>

1648
01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:45.454
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's on like some new marriage and I </v>

1649
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:51.050
<v Speaker 2>got divorced and it's like there's this </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos to this business and this what you</v>

1650
01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:52.160
<v Speaker 2>were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1651
01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.053
<v Speaker 2>like I've talked about this many times </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the podcast at this business is nuts </v>

1652
01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:59.110
<v Speaker 2>because it takes people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>insecure already and then puts them in a</v>

1653
01:15:59.111 --> 01:16:01.090
<v Speaker 2>position where they have to get chosen </v>
<v Speaker 2>for things.</v>

1654
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:04.780
<v Speaker 2>So you have to audition and people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to decide whether they like you next.</v>

1655
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:05.663
<v Speaker 2>Nikki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

1656
01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1657
01:16:07.061 --> 01:16:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Nikki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a central show.</v>

1658
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:13.450

<v Speaker 2>didn't work out.</v>

1659
01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.590
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1660
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:17.910
<v Speaker 5>there was an internal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't any good.</v>

1661
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.010
<v Speaker 5>You were on dancing with the stars for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hot minute.</v>

1662
01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1665
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.903
<v Speaker 5>What was that all about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I've reminded him of a </v>

1666
01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:33.040
<v Speaker 5>granddaughter who has called him in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>judges that are such assholes.</v>

1667

1668
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:44.290
<v Speaker 2>anorexic standup comedian who likes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink and blackout.</v>

<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well thanks a lot Niki.</v>

1675
01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1676
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.440
<v Speaker 2>you'll</v>

1677
01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.273
<v Speaker 5>kind of just watched the show that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're auditioning for and see someone </v>

1678
01:17:03.141 --> 01:17:04.700
<v Speaker 5>else in the role and that's how you'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1679
01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.960
<v Speaker 5>scream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you.</v>

1680
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

1681
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.880
<v Speaker 4>then you walk out feeling like a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 4>percent dog shit.</v>

1682
01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:14.983
<v Speaker 4>Like you're from the top of your head to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom of your toes is just dog </v>

1683
01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:18.224
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we do this stuff and you got people </v>

1684
01:17:22.521 --> 01:17:26.350
<v Speaker 4>commenting on it and tweeting at you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying mean.</v>

1685
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.233
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm in this business because </v>

1686
01:17:30.051 --> 01:17:32.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm insecure and I want people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>strangers to love me.</v>

1687
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 4>And then I don't even accept the love </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they give.</v>

1688
01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:37.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't care about the tweets that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>nice.</v>

1689
01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:41.750
<v Speaker 4>I reject those and I think you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I think,</v>

1690
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:44.563
<v Speaker 4>which I don't read comments or anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've been really good about like </v>

1691
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:47.263
<v Speaker 4>self care of that's not ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>bring me joy is going through the </v>

1692
01:17:49.761 --> 01:17:52.500
<v Speaker 4>comments of a youtube video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1693
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.570
<v Speaker 4>but still mean things get through and </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1694
01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:56.404
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I am a really strong person to be </v>

1695
01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:03.890
<v Speaker 4>where I am in this business and have </v>
<v Speaker 4>gotten as far as I've got,</v>

1696
01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:09.620
<v Speaker 4>but it breaks me at times still and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>scared and I'm spent.</v>

1697
01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:12.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm so excited to do psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding me?</v>

1698
01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:13.753
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1699
01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:18.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I.</v>

1700
01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Well I want to do it with a shaman if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're available,</v>

1701
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:23.803
<v Speaker 4>but I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do it in like a really </v>

1702
01:18:25.011 --> 01:18:29.060
<v Speaker 4>controlled way because I do think it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the next frontier for me in terms of,</v>

1703
01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:31.520
<v Speaker 4>because I'm done with therapy talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>therapy.</v>

1704
01:18:31.521 --> 01:18:33.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is too slow of a process.</v>

1705
01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.113
<v Speaker 4>I did mushrooms once but it was not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good experience because it wasn't bad </v>

1706
01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.260
<v Speaker 4>setting a very small amount and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to really have a good trip.</v>

1707
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Even though it was a small amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>still a bad experience.</v>

1708
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.390
<v Speaker 4>It was just bad because I was hanging </v>
<v Speaker 4>out with two people that are coupled.</v>

1709
01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:48.333
<v Speaker 4>That got into a fight while I was with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and they kicked me out onto the </v>

1710
01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:53.210
<v Speaker 4>street in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While they were on mushrooms,</v>

1711
01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:54.590
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to fight on mushrooms.</v>

1712
01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.453
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just got kind of tense hanging out with </v>

1713
01:18:56.721 --> 01:18:57.554
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were supposed to just like us three </v>

1714
01:18:58.221 --> 01:19:02.180
<v Speaker 4>chill on their roof and like look at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>skyline and just have a nice night.</v>

1715
01:19:02.181 --> 01:19:03.014
<v Speaker 4>But then his girlfriend got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were in a weird kind of bickering </v>

1716
01:19:05.571 --> 01:19:06.320
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1717
01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I left.</v>

1718
01:19:07.791 --> 01:19:10.610
<v Speaker 4>I had been arrested the night before for</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking weed on the street,</v>

1719
01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.880
<v Speaker 4>so I'd spent six hours in a holding cell</v>
<v Speaker 4>the night before.</v>

1720
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:16.160
<v Speaker 4>But I had planned to do mushrooms the </v>
<v Speaker 4>day after and the guy was like,</v>

1721
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:18.740
<v Speaker 4>you should still do and we'll celebrate </v>
<v Speaker 4>you getting out of jail.</v>

1722
01:19:18.741 --> 01:19:19.940
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1723
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.240
<v Speaker 4>So I did mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was broke.</v>

1724
01:19:23.241 --> 01:19:25.040
<v Speaker 4>I had just been arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1725
01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was on the street and I remember I</v>

1726
01:19:27.891 --> 01:19:28.724
<v Speaker 4>called my parents because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just felt like the way that smoking </v>

1727
01:19:32.331 --> 01:19:34.310
<v Speaker 4>weed is portrayed in movies where it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1728
01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.410
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things coming at you.</v>

1729
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:37.040
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1730
01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.720
<v Speaker 4>that's the way I felt on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1731
01:19:38.721 --> 01:19:39.554
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's the normal way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I felt like everyone was just </v>

1732
01:19:41.091 --> 01:19:43.040
<v Speaker 4>like in my face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called my mom and I go,</v>

1733
01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.320
<v Speaker 4>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on mushrooms right now.</v>

1734
01:19:45.321 --> 01:19:46.154
<v Speaker 4>I'm on the upper east side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to get to my friend </v>

1735
01:19:47.211 --> 01:19:48.080
<v Speaker 4>Mike's House.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>

1736
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:49.123
<v Speaker 4>who do you think you're talking to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't call your mom and say you're </v>

1737
01:19:53.091 --> 01:19:53.924
<v Speaker 4>on much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she was like for once in our life </v>

1738
01:19:54.921 --> 01:19:56.810
<v Speaker 4>she had boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If she goes,</v>

1739
01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.280
<v Speaker 4>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to your father.</v>

1740
01:19:58.281 --> 01:19:59.630
<v Speaker 4>And so then I talked to my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1741
01:19:59.631 --> 01:20:00.980
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on most rooms that I don't know.</v>

1742
01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:01.814
<v Speaker 4>And he kind of talked me down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just went home and chugged a </v>

1743
01:20:03.561 --> 01:20:05.360
<v Speaker 4>bottle of wine because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be.</v>

1744
01:20:05.361 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 4>I want to feel something else other than</v>
<v Speaker 4>this because I felt too much.</v>

1745
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:09.353
<v Speaker 4>I felt a lot of love in that scared me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this was before I quit drinking a </v>

1746
01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 4>lot of love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that scared you?</v>

1747
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:15.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like calling my friends being </v>

1748
01:20:16.321 --> 01:20:18.180
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you,</v>

1749
01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:20.640
<v Speaker 4>like it in a way that I'd never felt </v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

1750
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:22.710
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like this feeling,</v>

1751
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:23.731
<v Speaker 4>chug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chug,</v>

1752
01:20:23.731 --> 01:20:26.320
<v Speaker 4>chug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what.</v>

1753
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's because you were alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was.</v>

1754
01:20:28.670 --> 01:20:31.150
<v Speaker 4>I was going through a lot of things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like I was,</v>

1755
01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:36.170
<v Speaker 4>I think it was billy mic at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was not a good time in my life.</v>

1756
01:20:37.711 --> 01:20:42.200
<v Speaker 4>I had to be doing psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now I think I,</v>

1757
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.100
<v Speaker 4>I've read enough about them and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1758
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:46.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are soldiers who have ptsd that go</v>

1759
01:20:46.711 --> 01:20:51.711
<v Speaker 4>through talk therapy for years and have </v>
<v Speaker 4>no have minimal amounts of progress and,</v>

1760
01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:53.653
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1761
01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:57.480
<v Speaker 4>and then they do one thing of dmt and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

1762
01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's something there.</v>

1763
01:21:00.061 --> 01:21:03.600
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait for whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do IOWASCA.</v>

1764
01:21:03.601 --> 01:21:05.030
<v Speaker 4>I want to do DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to,</v>

1765
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.050
<v Speaker 4>I want to open up those doors.</v>

1766
01:21:07.670 --> 01:21:08.503
<v Speaker 3>Great for soldiers to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's their maps is doing some really </v>

1767
01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:15.680
<v Speaker 3>serious trials right now with MDM may </v>
<v Speaker 3>assisted therapy.</v>

1768
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:19.550
<v Speaker 3>So they're taking people with PTSD,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's soldiers,</v>

1769
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:20.623
<v Speaker 3>victims of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're taking them through a MTMA </v>

1770
01:21:24.981 --> 01:21:28.340
<v Speaker 3>assisted therapy and they're having some</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty dramatic results.</v>

1771
01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.283
<v Speaker 4>I think it is like the next big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so excited about it for certain </v>

1772
01:21:32.351 --> 01:21:33.920
<v Speaker 4>people and myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I just</v>

1773
01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:36.020
<v Speaker 3>done Mtma ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1774
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:37.343
<v Speaker 3>I only did it once and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rebound the next day was horrific </v>

1775
01:21:40.891 --> 01:21:43.590
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the worst hangovers I've</v>

1776
01:21:43.591 --> 01:21:45.420
<v Speaker 3>ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it wasn't just a hangover,</v>

1777
01:21:45.421 --> 01:21:46.650
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1778
01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:49.980
<v Speaker 3>I felt really stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't read.</v>

1779
01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.073
<v Speaker 3>Like I was trying to read a magazine the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next day I couldn't read and then I had </v>

1780
01:21:52.801 --> 01:21:56.340
<v Speaker 3>to perform that night and I kind of ate </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit on stage and um,</v>

1781
01:21:56.430 --> 01:22:01.050
<v Speaker 3>but I'll never forget the lessons from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the experience.</v>

1782
01:22:01.051 --> 01:22:01.884
<v Speaker 3>It was very powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a really illuminated how much </v>

1783
01:22:05.971 --> 01:22:06.804
<v Speaker 3>insecurity hinders you and inhibits your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to communicate with people and </v>

1784
01:22:12.451 --> 01:22:14.940
<v Speaker 3>flavors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you interact with people.</v>

1785
01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:20.210
<v Speaker 3>And how much of my own aggression and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I would interact with people was</v>

1786
01:22:21.331 --> 01:22:23.220
<v Speaker 3>basically just me being scared.</v>

1787
01:22:23.530 --> 01:22:24.520
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1788
01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:27.700
<v Speaker 4>I want to know what Joe Rogan was before</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics,</v>

1789
01:22:27.701 --> 01:22:30.280
<v Speaker 4>like what are the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>socially,</v>

1790
01:22:30.281 --> 01:22:32.650
<v Speaker 4>the hurdles that you've overcome?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1791
01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:34.420
<v Speaker 4>what were you like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were the things that you're like,</v>

1792
01:22:34.421 --> 01:22:36.010
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I was like that.</v>

1793
01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm dying to know this.</v>

1794
01:22:37.450 --> 01:22:38.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1795
01:22:38.441 --> 01:22:39.274
<v Speaker 3>when I was young I was super insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents split up when I was really </v>

1796
01:22:41.801 --> 01:22:45.130
<v Speaker 3>young and then we moved around a lot so </v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't have like a base of friends.</v>

1797
01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:46.053
<v Speaker 3>And then I found martial arts when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a young teenager and what martial arts </v>

1798
01:22:51.101 --> 01:22:56.101
<v Speaker 3>did was it gave me something that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally felt like I wasn't a loser at.</v>

1799
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:59.770
<v Speaker 3>It was like the first thing that I ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>did where I was like,</v>

1800
01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:00.430
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1801
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:02.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be really good at something.</v>

1802
01:23:02.681 --> 01:23:05.110
<v Speaker 3>And I got good at it really quickly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was obsessed.</v>

1803
01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.153
<v Speaker 3>I was completely addicted and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>training every day and it became my </v>

1804
01:23:09.671 --> 01:23:10.504
<v Speaker 3>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my identity was that I was really </v>

1805
01:23:12.941 --> 01:23:16.180
<v Speaker 3>good at martial arts and so to be really</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at martial arts,</v>

1806
01:23:16.181 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 3>especially in competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be,</v>

1807
01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:19.773
<v Speaker 3>you have to be very aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be ruthless and you have to </v>

1808
01:23:23.051 --> 01:23:28.051
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to embrace this sort of the,</v>

1809
01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:29.613
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an undeniable violence and </v>

1810
01:23:32.081 --> 01:23:33.490
<v Speaker 3>kicking someone in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's very,</v>

1811
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.270
<v Speaker 3>it's very violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like martial arts competitions,</v>

1812
01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.113
<v Speaker 3>extremely violent and you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to embrace that and the embracing </v>

1813
01:23:40.961 --> 01:23:43.030
<v Speaker 3>of that and the terror and the fear of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all,</v>

1814
01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:47.200
<v Speaker 3>just that it shaped my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my developmental period.</v>

1815
01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.470
<v Speaker 3>So like when I was 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16,</v>

1816
01:23:50.471 --> 01:23:51.161
<v Speaker 3>17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

1817
01:23:51.161 --> 01:23:51.731
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

1818
01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:52.900
<v Speaker 3>21,</v>
<v Speaker 3>22,</v>

1819
01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:56.530
<v Speaker 3>that was my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was all I did until I started doing</v>

1820
01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:57.364
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my entire form formative period was </v>

1821
01:24:02.111 --> 01:24:05.410
<v Speaker 3>based on violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all,</v>

1822
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.910
<v Speaker 3>it was all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

1823
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.560
<v Speaker 3>it was martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very controlled and well I wasn't</v>

1824
01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:15.160
<v Speaker 3>like a bad person who is a beating </v>
<v Speaker 3>people up or anything like that.</v>

1825
01:24:15.161 --> 01:24:19.840
<v Speaker 3>But my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was ready to go all the time.</v>

1826
01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:20.973
<v Speaker 3>Like it was all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was always any edit around any </v>

1827
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:24.274
<v Speaker 3>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be something the next person </v>

1828
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.513
<v Speaker 3>might say the wrong thing and you might </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize you're going to have to fight </v>

1829
01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:30.940
<v Speaker 3>them or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>

1830
01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:36.330
<v Speaker 3>and that took a long time to let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That took a long time to like shake off.</v>

1831
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Are you easily angered?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you get into fights?</v>

1832
01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really get into.</v>

1833
01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:43.310
<v Speaker 2>I was smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I will avoid fights.</v>

1834
01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:45.410
<v Speaker 2>So you were 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were anxious?</v>

1835
01:24:45.411 --> 01:24:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1836
01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:47.173
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1837
01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:50.180
<v Speaker 2>my personality developed through </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

1838
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:51.703
<v Speaker 2>Me really develop through martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>competition through from the time I was </v>

1839
01:24:54.531 --> 01:24:57.530
<v Speaker 2>15 to Thomas Twenty one I traveled the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire country.</v>

1840
01:24:57.531 --> 01:24:59.360
<v Speaker 2>It was all I did was fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>tournament's.</v>

1841
01:24:59.810 --> 01:25:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I fought all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fought like,</v>

1842
01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:03.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have girlfriends?</v>

1843
01:25:03.721 --> 01:25:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean you were upset you were you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really going to Olympic athlete?</v>

1844
01:25:07.281 --> 01:25:10.070
<v Speaker 2>You were an elite elite athlete at 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you?</v>

1845
01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:10.923
<v Speaker 2>What was your 15?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the time I was 17 I was boy when </v>

1846
01:25:14.061 --> 01:25:16.110
<v Speaker 2>I was 18 I won the state championship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1847
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:17.383
<v Speaker 2>to get to that point is my social life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and elite was going to say it had to </v>

1848
01:25:21.081 --> 01:25:24.530
<v Speaker 2>have just been know it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was awkward and weird.</v>

1849
01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:25.543
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like with girls and stuff early on </v>

1850
01:25:27.771 --> 01:25:28.910
<v Speaker 2>were you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do okay.</v>

1851
01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:30.530
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1852
01:25:30.531 --> 01:25:31.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>

1853
01:25:31.761 --> 01:25:32.594
<v Speaker 2>I had girlfriends in high school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there was a dry period after high </v>

1854
01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:36.764
<v Speaker 2>school for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then once I started doing standup </v>

1855
01:25:39.681 --> 01:25:42.380
<v Speaker 2>comedy then then it was easy and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wet period.</v>

1856
01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Then it was crazy that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1857
01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:47.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is nuts.</v>

1858
01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:48.380
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1859
01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.273
<v Speaker 2>my life was all about competing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>being at a gym so there wasn't like a </v>

1860
01:25:53.121 --> 01:25:56.870
<v Speaker 2>lot of time to meet people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all very strange.</v>

1861
01:25:57.130 --> 01:25:57.963
<v Speaker 2>But there's this getting over that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hurt the hurdle of that bizarre </v>

1862
01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:04.400
<v Speaker 2>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there a moment</v>

1863
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.220
<v Speaker 4>though when you came out of a trip or </v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1864
01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.093
<v Speaker 4>Was there a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a nugget that you took where you </v>

1865
01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:09.621
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1866
01:26:09.621 --> 01:26:10.454
<v Speaker 4>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was there a certain trip that you like </v>

1867
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:13.123
<v Speaker 4>look to and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I emerged a different person and what </v>

1868
01:26:14.991 --> 01:26:15.340
<v Speaker 4>does that,</v>

1869
01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:16.173
<v Speaker 3>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them highlighted unnecessary </v>

1870
01:26:18.421 --> 01:26:20.160
<v Speaker 3>tension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Highlighted.</v>

1871
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:23.083
<v Speaker 4>What was the last one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you learn in the last trip you </v>

1872
01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:25.184
<v Speaker 4>had?</v>

1873
01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:30.290
<v Speaker 3>The last one I had was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was almost a reef,</v>

1874
01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.430
<v Speaker 3>a reaffirmation more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1875
01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:36.451
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1876
01:26:36.451 --> 01:26:37.284
<v Speaker 3>I remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I hadn't done it in about a year </v>

1877
01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:41.700
<v Speaker 3>and a half to two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1878
01:26:41.701 --> 01:26:42.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all,</v>

1879
01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:43.733
<v Speaker 3>we did dmt three or four times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did like a a trip and then we went </v>

1880
01:26:48.421 --> 01:26:49.980
<v Speaker 3>back in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went back in again.</v>

1881
01:26:50.010 --> 01:26:51.480
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember his three or four </v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

1882
01:26:51.481 --> 01:26:55.350
<v Speaker 3>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just made me realize like,</v>

1883
01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.940
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1884
01:26:56.941 --> 01:26:57.774
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just the though the world that </v>

1885
01:26:59.701 --> 01:27:04.701
<v Speaker 3>you're living in is like a thin veneer </v>
<v Speaker 3>over this gigantic,</v>

1886
01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:06.923
<v Speaker 3>impossible realm of souls of love and </v>
<v Speaker 3>expectation and and understanding and </v>

1887
01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:19.560
<v Speaker 3>information and that that's what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe is made of and that you're sort</v>

1888
01:27:19.561 --> 01:27:23.160
<v Speaker 3>of trapped in this very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rudimentary,</v>

1889
01:27:23.161 --> 01:27:27.390
<v Speaker 3>tactile existence where you can pick </v>
<v Speaker 3>things up and put them on scales and you</v>

1890
01:27:27.391 --> 01:27:30.390
<v Speaker 3>can measure things with a ruler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the rest of the universe is not made</v>

1891
01:27:30.391 --> 01:27:31.224
<v Speaker 3>of that stuff.</v>

1892
01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.720
<v Speaker 3>The rest of the universe is made out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

1893
01:27:33.930 --> 01:27:38.030
<v Speaker 3>The rest of the universe is made out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and there's dimensions that you</v>

1894
01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:42.210
<v Speaker 3>you can't travel to with your feet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a car,</v>

1895
01:27:42.211 --> 01:27:45.420
<v Speaker 3>with a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's portals that you go through</v>

1896
01:27:45.421 --> 01:27:46.254
<v Speaker 3>and these portals of chemical portals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your brain literally is wired for </v>

1897
01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:51.150
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

1898
01:27:51.151 --> 01:27:51.984
<v Speaker 3>your brain produces dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the most potent of all </v>

1899
01:27:54.601 --> 01:27:55.434
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's literally made by the human body </v>

1900
01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:59.610
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's everywhere.</v>

1901
01:27:59.611 --> 01:28:02.670
<v Speaker 3>It's in all sorts of plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of plants.</v>

1902
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:04.103
<v Speaker 3>It's in every animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like all these different creatures </v>

1903
01:28:06.331 --> 01:28:08.010
<v Speaker 3>create it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have it.</v>

1904
01:28:08.011 --> 01:28:09.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Europe.</v>

1905
01:28:09.690 --> 01:28:12.750
<v Speaker 3>It's actually made by your third eye </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1906
01:28:12.751 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1907
01:28:14.490 --> 01:28:17.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a group out of New Mexico called</v>

1908
01:28:17.491 --> 01:28:18.324
<v Speaker 3>the Cottonwood Research Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're doing these tests on all </v>

1909
01:28:23.971 --> 01:28:24.804
<v Speaker 3>sorts of tests to find out the source of</v>
<v Speaker 3>DMT and they've isolated in the pineal </v>

1910
01:28:29.191 --> 01:28:33.930
<v Speaker 3>gland of rats and this is the first time</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've ever shown it in a live rat that</v>

1911
01:28:33.931 --> 01:28:35.640
<v Speaker 3>it exists in the pineal gland.</v>

1912
01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:37.740
<v Speaker 3>The pineal gland is literally your third</v>
<v Speaker 3>eye,</v>

1913
01:28:37.770 --> 01:28:40.350
<v Speaker 3>like that thing from eastern mysticism </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this right here,</v>

1914
01:28:40.351 --> 01:28:44.820
<v Speaker 3>this little audio here and reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually is a retina in the lens.</v>

1915
01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.440
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an eyeball,</v>

1916
01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:51.000
<v Speaker 3>and this is in the Egyptian would call </v>
<v Speaker 3>it the seed of the soul.</v>

1917
01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.073
<v Speaker 3>And this one spot in your head is </v>
<v Speaker 3>producing the most potent psychedelic </v>

1918
01:28:56.521 --> 01:29:00.300
<v Speaker 3>chemical known to man as well as it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>produced by your liver and your lungs,</v>

1919
01:29:00.450 --> 01:29:02.370
<v Speaker 3>like your body's psychedelic chemical </v>
<v Speaker 3>factory.</v>

1920
01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:06.120
<v Speaker 3>And this one psychedelic chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe,</v>

1921
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:07.043
<v Speaker 3>and there's been some recent research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a recent paper that was put </v>

1922
01:29:09.301 --> 01:29:13.470
<v Speaker 3>out that showed that they think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>during periods of extreme stress,</v>

1923
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:14.573
<v Speaker 3>like would periods if your body body's </v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced that you might be dying or </v>

1924
01:29:17.161 --> 01:29:17.994
<v Speaker 3>that there's something happening that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you may be releasing this psychedelic </v>

1925
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:22.014
<v Speaker 3>chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it might be the portal to the </v>

1926
01:29:23.701 --> 01:29:24.534
<v Speaker 3>afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it might be the way that carries </v>

1927
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:28.223
<v Speaker 3>your consciousness through to the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension when your body passes for </v>

1928
01:29:32.411 --> 01:29:33.244
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1929
01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.070
<v Speaker 4>when you're in distress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it feels like it's getting ready</v>

1930
01:29:36.071 --> 01:29:37.100
<v Speaker 4>to watch your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your mom.</v>

1931
01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:38.080
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's like,</v>

1932
01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:39.490
<v Speaker 3>this might be it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this might be it.</v>

1933
01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>

1934
01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:43.120
<v Speaker 3>They think that's the source of near </v>
<v Speaker 3>death experiences.</v>

1935
01:29:43.121 --> 01:29:43.954
<v Speaker 3>When people have these phenomenal loving</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences where they crossover to the </v>

1936
01:29:47.591 --> 01:29:48.424
<v Speaker 3>other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they come back and they think that </v>

1937
01:29:50.111 --> 01:29:51.350
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know when,</v>

1938
01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:52.213
<v Speaker 3>the way the way people describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another issue with psychedelic </v>

1939
01:29:54.641 --> 01:29:55.870
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>

1940
01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Describe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you describe it,</v>

1941
01:29:57.341 --> 01:29:59.620
<v Speaker 3>it's so crude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the words,</v>

1942
01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.150
<v Speaker 3>the way I've described it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I say,</v>

1943
01:30:01.151 --> 01:30:01.984
<v Speaker 3>it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You enter into another dimension filled </v>

1944
01:30:04.061 --> 01:30:04.894
<v Speaker 3>with complex geometric patterns that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>made out of love and understanding that </v>

1945
01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:09.780
<v Speaker 3>that's what it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still.</v>

1946
01:30:09.781 --> 01:30:12.580
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a nonsense thing to describe,</v>

1947
01:30:12.970 --> 01:30:16.000
<v Speaker 3>but when you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talked to these people that have had</v>

1948
01:30:16.001 --> 01:30:19.540
<v Speaker 3>near death experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all feel relieved in some sort of a</v>

1949
01:30:19.541 --> 01:30:20.374
<v Speaker 3>strange way.</v>

1950
01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:22.240
<v Speaker 3>They all feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a lot of them do.</v>

1951
01:30:22.241 --> 01:30:26.230
<v Speaker 3>I should say that when it does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it does happen,</v>

1952
01:30:26.231 --> 01:30:28.120
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be okay.</v>

1953
01:30:28.121 --> 01:30:28.954
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a thing that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you go to this other place where </v>

1954
01:30:31.361 --> 01:30:33.070
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no shoes,</v>

1955
01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:35.880
<v Speaker 3>there's no tables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no electricity in this house,</v>

1956
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.903
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's made out of whatever the fuck the </v>

1957
01:30:39.710 --> 01:30:41.700
<v Speaker 3>world's made out of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's made out of the,</v>

1958
01:30:41.710 --> 01:30:45.040
<v Speaker 3>the whatever the universe actually has </v>
<v Speaker 3>below the wiring.</v>

1959
01:30:45.041 --> 01:30:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Like you lift up the circuit board and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

1960
01:30:46.721 --> 01:30:48.850
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you peer behind the green curtain.</v>

1961
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:50.590
<v Speaker 4>So at this point for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

1962
01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:53.110
<v Speaker 4>when you did it the last time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was almost like a tune up of like,</v>

1963
01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:54.093
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember now seen this before and I </v>

1964
01:30:57.191 --> 01:30:59.590
<v Speaker 4>needed to be reminded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then how does that.</v>

1965
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:04.060
<v Speaker 4>Sorry if I'm asking questions that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've probably already answered,</v>

1966
01:31:04.061 --> 01:31:08.440
<v Speaker 4>but like how does the next week of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life after a trip of this,</v>

1967
01:31:08.441 --> 01:31:10.720
<v Speaker 4>like how do your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does your decision making change?</v>

1968
01:31:10.721 --> 01:31:11.180
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's up</v>

1969
01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:11.930
<v Speaker 3>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1970
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:12.763
<v Speaker 3>That's up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's up to everybody when everyone is </v>

1971
01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:16.820
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for me it's a,</v>

1972
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:20.130
<v Speaker 3>it was like a big deep breath and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1973
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:22.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be okay.</v>

1974
01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:25.130
<v Speaker 3>The last time I did like a real serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic trip.</v>

1975
01:31:25.131 --> 01:31:27.650
<v Speaker 3>I've done a little bit of acid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of mushrooms,</v>

1976
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.903
<v Speaker 3>but the last time that a serious one was</v>
<v Speaker 3>right before I've filmed triggered and </v>

1977
01:31:32.451 --> 01:31:34.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1978
01:31:34.101 --> 01:31:35.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

1979
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.400
<v Speaker 3>it just lets you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1980
01:31:37.401 --> 01:31:38.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1981
01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:41.900
<v Speaker 3>just just do your best to try to be nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is nonsense.</v>

1982
01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:43.960
<v Speaker 3>This whole thing is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1983
01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:46.490
<v Speaker 3>don't concentrate on the fact that in 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1984
01:31:46.491 --> 01:31:48.890
<v Speaker 3>no one's going to want to fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you know that your,</v>

1985
01:31:48.891 --> 01:31:49.724
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your tits gonna fall off or just you're </v>

1986
01:31:51.171 --> 01:31:52.540
<v Speaker 3>alive right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1987
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:53.383
<v Speaker 3>you are existing right now in the one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the craziest experiences that the world </v>

1988
01:31:58.611 --> 01:32:03.611
<v Speaker 3>has ever being a human being in 2018 in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States of America.</v>

1989
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a fucking bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathway.</v>

1990
01:32:06.971 --> 01:32:09.010
<v Speaker 3>You're on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of us,</v>

1991
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:12.010
<v Speaker 3>every single person listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can listen to this podcast,</v>

1992
01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.100
<v Speaker 3>you are in the rarest moment in human </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

1993
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:20.430
<v Speaker 3>You are literally at the cost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the very peak of this insane merging,</v>

1994
01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:26.740
<v Speaker 3>the same merging of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of information,</v>

1995
01:32:26.770 --> 01:32:29.320
<v Speaker 3>of understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of expression,</v>

1996
01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:32.770
<v Speaker 3>all the stuff that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the stuff that we're seeing going on</v>

1997
01:32:32.771 --> 01:32:33.604
<v Speaker 3>right now socially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the me too movement or </v>

1998
01:32:36.011 --> 01:32:37.180
<v Speaker 3>whether it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1999
01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 3>know social justice warriors and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are woke and crying out,</v>

2000
01:32:42.251 --> 01:32:43.084
<v Speaker 3>racist for listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this bubbling up of our culture is </v>

2001
01:32:45.671 --> 01:32:48.720
<v Speaker 3>all this recognition of this ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate this,</v>

2002
01:32:48.721 --> 01:32:49.554
<v Speaker 3>this radical new ability to express your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas that is being done by some people </v>

2003
01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:57.130
<v Speaker 3>that are responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people that are very responsible,</v>

2004
01:32:57.250 --> 01:33:00.340
<v Speaker 3>but everyone gets a shot and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like youtube comments.</v>

2005
01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:02.800
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2006
01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Clark culture is youtube comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll the world is youtube comments.</v>

2007
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:12.750
<v Speaker 3>Our interaction is this unique ability </v>
<v Speaker 3>where anybody can express themselves and</v>

2008
01:33:13.391 --> 01:33:18.391
<v Speaker 3>some people have larger signals like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like shift fear or like you know,</v>

2009
01:33:19.530 --> 01:33:21.220
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who has a podcast,</v>

2010
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:24.820
<v Speaker 3>they have a larger signal and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a youtube video that's a larger</v>

2011
01:33:24.821 --> 01:33:27.070
<v Speaker 3>signaling of a comedy central show </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a larger signal,</v>

2012
01:33:27.190 --> 01:33:28.023
<v Speaker 3>but everyone has a signal and everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting for relevance and everyone's </v>

2013
01:33:31.751 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 3>fighting for attention and acceptance </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there they're fighting for their own</v>

2014
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:36.964
<v Speaker 3>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just want to exist and they're </v>

2015
01:33:38.561 --> 01:33:39.394
<v Speaker 3>yelling out and sometimes the yelling </v>
<v Speaker 3>out like a baby and sometimes the </v>

2016
01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:42.574
<v Speaker 3>yelling out like a wise person on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain who has some new information </v>

2017
01:33:45.670 --> 01:33:46.503
<v Speaker 3>and it's all happening at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's all just and we're sorting it </v>

2018
01:33:49.871 --> 01:33:53.530
<v Speaker 3>out like in some things don't stick like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole,</v>

2019
01:33:53.531 --> 01:33:55.090
<v Speaker 3>if you're having sex and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking,</v>

2020
01:33:55.091 --> 01:33:56.830
<v Speaker 3>you're a rapist like that didn't stick.</v>

2021
01:33:57.490 --> 01:33:58.323
<v Speaker 3>But some of them do stay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them you can't say retarded </v>

2022
01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:01.690
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one's sticking,</v>

2023
01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:02.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2024
01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:03.333
<v Speaker 3>and people are realizing there's certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you can do and certain </v>

2025
01:34:05.411 --> 01:34:06.244
<v Speaker 3>things you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certain things we accept certain things </v>

2026
01:34:07.871 --> 01:34:08.704
<v Speaker 3>we can't accept anymore and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>figuring it out and we're figuring it </v>

2027
01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:12.400
<v Speaker 3>out in real time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

2028
01:34:12.401 --> 01:34:13.234
<v Speaker 3>at a radical pace that's never existed </v>
<v Speaker 3>before in human history where something </v>

2029
01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:17.793
<v Speaker 3>that was acceptable just 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 years ago is completely unacceptable </v>

2030
01:34:21.221 --> 01:34:22.054
<v Speaker 3>now that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a time like that </v>

2031
01:34:23.441 --> 01:34:24.274
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never been a time in the entire world </v>

2032
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:27.663
<v Speaker 3>since people started talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a time where change </v>

2033
01:34:30.621 --> 01:34:31.454
<v Speaker 3>is taking place at such a radical pace </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're a part of it and I'm a part </v>

2034
01:34:35.051 --> 01:34:36.880
<v Speaker 3>of it and everyone is listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a part of it.</v>

2035
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:40.090
<v Speaker 3>We're all together in this and no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows where the fuck is going.</v>

2036
01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:42.063
<v Speaker 4>I love that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that the reason all this </v>

2037
01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.630
<v Speaker 4>is happening right now is because we are</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

2038
01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:48.880
<v Speaker 4>we're just communicating at a more rapid</v>
<v Speaker 4>pace.</v>

2039
01:34:48.881 --> 01:34:51.550
<v Speaker 4>That's all it boils down to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're absolutely right.</v>

2040
01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:54.340
<v Speaker 4>It's the communication revolution.</v>

2041
01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:55.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:34:55.670 --> 01:34:56.650
<v Speaker 3>And if so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone says,</v>

2043
01:34:56.651 --> 01:34:57.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2044
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:58.430
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2045
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Were you sad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense.</v>

2046
01:34:59.661 --> 01:35:00.310
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2047
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:01.143
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2048
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:02.263
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to get it right all the </v>

2049
01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:04.760
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no one does.</v>

2050
01:35:04.761 --> 01:35:07.430
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an oracle fucking human.</v>

2051
01:35:07.431 --> 01:35:11.000
<v Speaker 3>I was born in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's getting this right,</v>

2052
01:35:11.150 --> 01:35:14.940
<v Speaker 4>but you are being held to that standard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all are now something.</v>

2053
01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.840
<v Speaker 3>What's good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's good to that too.</v>

2054
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:20.400
<v Speaker 3>The good is you realize like when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible,</v>

2055
01:35:20.401 --> 01:35:23.820
<v Speaker 3>like if you make a mistake or you say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something incorrect or you say something</v>

2056
01:35:23.821 --> 01:35:25.110
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just trying to be funny.</v>

2057
01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:27.190
<v Speaker 3>It came out bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2058
01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.370
<v Speaker 3>the blow back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's you know,</v>

2059
01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.353
<v Speaker 3>this is how people feel about that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's disproportionate because your </v>

2060
01:35:33.931 --> 01:35:35.480
<v Speaker 3>signals disproportionate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2061
01:35:35.481 --> 01:35:37.440
<v Speaker 3>your ability to express yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 3>disproportionate.</v>

2062
01:35:37.650 --> 01:35:39.870
<v Speaker 3>So the blow back is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>disproportion as well.</v>

2063
01:35:40.050 --> 01:35:44.340
<v Speaker 3>So it feels awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just an affirmation,</v>

2064
01:35:44.341 --> 01:35:45.540
<v Speaker 3>just letting you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2065
01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:46.853
<v Speaker 3>this is not what p and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes people are completely </v>

2066
01:35:48.841 --> 01:35:49.830
<v Speaker 3>wrong about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2067
01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:52.950
<v Speaker 3>white girls can't wear hoop earrings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cultural appropriation.</v>

2068
01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:53.793
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's bad signals out there because a </v>

2069
01:35:55.081 --> 01:35:56.520
<v Speaker 3>lot of bad signals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2070
01:35:56.670 --> 01:35:58.580
<v Speaker 3>where you're racist if you wear a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kimono,</v>

2071
01:35:58.770 --> 01:36:01.200
<v Speaker 3>just a of like really dumb bad signals.</v>

2072
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:06.590
<v Speaker 3>But there's also a lot of exchange and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll all work itself out.</v>

2073
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:10.650
<v Speaker 3>We just have to be really careful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't lynch a lot of people along the</v>

2074
01:36:10.651 --> 01:36:11.484
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the wood that we don't get </v>

2075
01:36:13.051 --> 01:36:13.884
<v Speaker 3>convinced that our ideas are 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way things should be and that we </v>

2076
01:36:18.991 --> 01:36:23.940
<v Speaker 3>listened to all these various ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's ideas about trans people or</v>

2077
01:36:23.941 --> 01:36:27.720
<v Speaker 3>gay people or women or men or anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2078
01:36:27.721 --> 01:36:28.554
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's super important now that </v>

2079
01:36:30.571 --> 01:36:31.404
<v Speaker 3>people think before they act and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they think before they cast judgment </v>

2080
01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:40.490
<v Speaker 3>that we have to communicate because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's things are fucking flying at us.</v>

2081
01:36:40.831 --> 01:36:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Like fish coming down a river and trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to catch them with your hands.</v>

2082
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:44.880
<v Speaker 3>And there's this too many of them.</v>

2083
01:36:45.490 --> 01:36:47.170
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2084
01:36:47.171 --> 01:36:49.600
<v Speaker 4>you're broadcasting every single day for</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

2085
01:36:49.601 --> 01:36:51.550
<v Speaker 4>Do you say things sometimes that come </v>
<v Speaker 4>back?</v>

2086
01:36:51.551 --> 01:36:52.384
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you say things that come back to </v>

2087
01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:55.960
<v Speaker 4>haunt you or you said this and that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong,</v>

2088
01:36:55.961 --> 01:36:57.370
<v Speaker 4>that you said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is why you're wrong.</v>

2089
01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:59.470
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you ever catch yourself and go,</v>

2090
01:36:59.471 --> 01:37:01.400
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't have said that all time.</v>

2091
01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.260
<v Speaker 4>What do you do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's of I made a mistake.</v>

2092
01:37:05.261 --> 01:37:06.370
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I misspoke.</v>

2093
01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:07.151
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But not.</v>

2094
01:37:07.151 --> 01:37:09.880
<v Speaker 4>This was not an oracle.</v>

2095
01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.940
<v Speaker 3>If you keep talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people go,</v>

2096
01:37:11.941 --> 01:37:12.750
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2097
01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:13.583
<v Speaker 3>Nikki's just the person that says things</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes what you don't mean to say </v>

2098
01:37:17.401 --> 01:37:19.860
<v Speaker 3>dumb things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're like being a human being.</v>

2099
01:37:19.861 --> 01:37:20.694
<v Speaker 3>It's just a flawed exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're super flawed and we're </v>

2100
01:37:23.731 --> 01:37:24.564
<v Speaker 3>working with language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like a really awkward way to </v>

2101
01:37:27.721 --> 01:37:30.070
<v Speaker 3>express intent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2102
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:33.090
<v Speaker 3>it's awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is sometimes the right.</v>

2103
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:34.303
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the right word is not there </v>

2104
01:37:35.251 --> 01:37:37.670
<v Speaker 3>for you and you use a lot of likes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2105
01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:38.720
<v Speaker 3>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2106
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.220
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a and people like,</v>

2107
01:37:41.221 --> 01:37:43.050
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are listening,</v>

2108
01:37:43.051 --> 01:37:44.610
<v Speaker 3>they're on the fucking stair climber and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll go,</v>

2109
01:37:44.611 --> 01:37:46.590
<v Speaker 3>you shut the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk too much,</v>

2110
01:37:46.591 --> 01:37:47.424
<v Speaker 3>you complain too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know their signal like they're </v>

2111
01:37:49.621 --> 01:37:50.454
<v Speaker 3>mad that they don't have a signal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're fucking screaming at you for </v>

2112
01:37:52.410 --> 01:37:54.810
<v Speaker 3>your flawed signal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a responsibility?</v>

2113
01:37:54.811 --> 01:37:56.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot going</v>

2114
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:57.450
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot going on.</v>

2115
01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:02.480
<v Speaker 4>There is and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have,</v>

2116
01:38:02.850 --> 01:38:03.683
<v Speaker 4>I have a radio show every day that I do </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I do podcast and even sitting here </v>

2117
01:38:07.671 --> 01:38:08.421
<v Speaker 4>now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2118
01:38:08.421 --> 01:38:09.254
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to regret saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've just gotten to a point where </v>

2119
01:38:10.941 --> 01:38:11.774
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will apologize if I say something </v>

2120
01:38:12.621 --> 01:38:16.010
<v Speaker 4>stupid and wrong and offend someone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I really feel bad about it,</v>

2121
01:38:16.011 --> 01:38:21.011
<v Speaker 4>but like I have to lead from a place of </v>
<v Speaker 4>guidance at this point in my life.</v>

2122
01:38:21.051 --> 01:38:24.140
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm a secret psychopath,</v>

2123
01:38:24.141 --> 01:38:25.430
<v Speaker 4>which I think a lot of us are always </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2124
01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:27.770
<v Speaker 4>am I a bad person?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Deep down,</v>

2125
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:29.143
<v Speaker 4>do you ever have that fee?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you use to have that feeling where </v>

2126
01:38:30.811 --> 01:38:31.644
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are going to figure out that I'm </v>

2127
01:38:32.991 --> 01:38:34.670
<v Speaker 4>a fucking psychopath?</v>

2128
01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:35.573
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wish that I was like Tony </v>

2129
01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Danza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Danza was always smiling and he was</v>

2130
01:38:41.861 --> 01:38:43.300
<v Speaker 2>always nice to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2131
01:38:43.301 --> 01:38:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I want to kill everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Tony Danza is also nice and smiling.</v>

2132
01:38:46.931 --> 01:38:47.764
<v Speaker 2>I just want to fucking smash people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Danza just seems like such a nice </v>

2133
01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:51.131
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like God,</v>

2134
01:38:51.131 --> 01:38:51.964
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was like Tony Danza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think that when I was like 19 </v>

2135
01:38:53.831 --> 01:38:54.520
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

2136
01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.790
<v Speaker 4>I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally relate to that.</v>

2137
01:38:56.791 --> 01:38:57.624
<v Speaker 4>I see people and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why can't I just be like her and just </v>

2138
01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.170
<v Speaker 4>smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smiling and say funny,</v>

2139
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:04.073
<v Speaker 4>nice things that don't offend anyone but</v>
<v Speaker 4>also everyone likes what you say and it </v>

2140
01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:11.160
<v Speaker 4>still gets people jazzed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not offending anyone.</v>

2141
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:15.600
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel good to offend people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I say things all the time that do,</v>

2142
01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:18.270
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not going to stop because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2143
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:19.343
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

2144
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:22.970
<v Speaker 2>but you're offending people but also </v>
<v Speaker 2>making a large amount laugh.</v>

2145
01:39:23.110 --> 01:39:23.943
<v Speaker 2>Know the problem is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have 100 people in the room and </v>

2146
01:39:26.031 --> 01:39:29.630
<v Speaker 2>10 of them get offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 of them are fucking slap in the table</v>

2147
01:39:29.631 --> 01:39:31.420
<v Speaker 2>and laughing their ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2148
01:39:31.421 --> 01:39:34.010
<v Speaker 2>You got to accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just part of the game.</v>

2149
01:39:34.190 --> 01:39:35.660
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I play.</v>

2150
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:36.643
<v Speaker 2>We play a strange game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in one of the weirdest businesses </v>

2151
01:39:38.631 --> 01:39:40.360
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the business of talking shit.</v>

2152
01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:41.593
<v Speaker 2>We're shit.</v>

2153
01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:46.140
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love talking shop and I can't stop.</v>

2154
01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:47.400
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you get,</v>

2155
01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:52.500
<v Speaker 4>do you get in trouble talking shit like </v>
<v Speaker 4>di Di do you feel?</v>

2156
01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:54.600
<v Speaker 4>Because I feel like sometimes when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk shit about people,</v>

2157
01:39:54.601 --> 01:39:56.970
<v Speaker 4>it's obviously I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about myself and I'm,</v>

2158
01:39:56.971 --> 01:39:59.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm just projecting like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh she's,</v>

2159
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.923
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really talking shit backstage where </v>

2160
01:40:01.651 --> 01:40:04.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anyone will ever tell this</v>
<v Speaker 4>to anyone.</v>

2161
01:40:04.590 --> 01:40:05.710
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a,</v>

2162
01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:09.150
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to be like not a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing to do is talk shit.</v>

2163
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:11.820
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not healthy for hands on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I love it.</v>

2164
01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:13.530
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a hobby.</v>

2165
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:14.340
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

2166
01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:17.460
<v Speaker 2>You're making fun of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're making fun of things and it makes</v>

2167
01:40:17.461 --> 01:40:18.294
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking shit and it doesn't </v>

2168
01:40:19.861 --> 01:40:21.630
<v Speaker 2>make any sense and no one wants to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit with you,</v>

2169
01:40:21.930 --> 01:40:24.310
<v Speaker 2>but if you go to Nicky and Nicky said </v>
<v Speaker 2>some hilarious,</v>

2170
01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:29.470
<v Speaker 4>that's all your soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fun and when you see both,</v>

2171
01:40:29.471 --> 01:40:30.304
<v Speaker 4>hate someone together and you could just</v>
<v Speaker 4>send each other snap screenshots of </v>

2172
01:40:33.491 --> 01:40:34.324
<v Speaker 4>their instagram and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look how sad this bitches when really </v>

2173
01:40:37.150 --> 01:40:39.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm just seeing myself in her</v>

2174
01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:44.090
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when you're saying oftentimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you absolutely hope you never are,</v>

2175
01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.033
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that you fear that you are and you </v>

2176
01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:48.500
<v Speaker 4>think you might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

2177
01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:49.353
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's me hating a tiny piece of myself </v>

2178
01:40:51.071 --> 01:40:51.904
<v Speaker 4>that I'm trying so hard to keep it at </v>
<v Speaker 4>bay will be parent or sad or you're </v>

2179
01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:57.400
<v Speaker 4>hating me.</v>

2180
01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Human behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's flawed.</v>

2181
01:40:59.140 --> 01:40:59.973
<v Speaker 2>That's where you're heading.</v>

2182
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.823
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't want to be flawed and </v>

2183
01:41:01.761 --> 01:41:05.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm secretly feeling flawed because I am</v>
<v Speaker 4>flawed because we all are,</v>

2184
01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.300
<v Speaker 4>but it's part of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a way to</v>

2185
01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:09.310
<v Speaker 2>forest that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll never going to do that again,</v>

2186
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:11.850
<v Speaker 2>but talking shit about people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing</v>

2187
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:15.100
<v Speaker 4>hold yourself accountable because then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't talk shit if you do it.</v>

2188
01:41:15.101 --> 01:41:17.500
<v Speaker 4>So it keeps you in check.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a really good point.</v>

2189
01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:18.800
<v Speaker 4>So it's good to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:23.840
<v Speaker 4>There's some group text messages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you mean my God,</v>

2191
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:26.383
<v Speaker 4>where are you only talk about one person</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that we only go to that mass text to </v>

2192
01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:32.950
<v Speaker 4>talk shit about that one person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2193
01:41:32.951 --> 01:41:33.784
<v Speaker 4>have you ever talked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever sent a text to someone </v>

2194
01:41:35.561 --> 01:41:38.710
<v Speaker 4>that you were talking shit like shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the person?</v>

2195
01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:39.560
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it happens.</v>

2196
01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.870
<v Speaker 4>There are stories of people sending.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this one girl the other day told me</v>

2197
01:41:43.871 --> 01:41:45.160
<v Speaker 4>like in a makeup chair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

2200
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:53.860
<v Speaker 4>That was like Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buffalo is a fat piece of shit today.</v>

2201
01:41:54.370 --> 01:41:55.203
<v Speaker 4>Kimberly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She would wear that dress like that </v>

2202
01:41:56.621 --> 01:42:00.970
<v Speaker 4>specific to her and she was working with</v>
<v Speaker 4>her and had to work with her the rest of</v>

2203
01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:01.804
<v Speaker 4>the day.</v>

2204
01:42:02.590 --> 01:42:06.050
<v Speaker 4>It happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

2207
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:13.480

<v Speaker 4>when you write that name,</v>

2208
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:16.360
<v Speaker 4>when you're writing a name and a text,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so easy to just.</v>

2209
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:19.870
<v Speaker 4>That person is probably in your phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>too to send it to them.</v>

2210
01:42:20.330 --> 01:42:22.060

<v Speaker 2>It feels good too.</v>

2263
01:44:14.211 --> 01:44:15.830
<v Speaker 2>It feels the opposite of talking shit</v>

2264
01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:16.860
<v Speaker 4>if you're not lying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2265
01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:19.380
<v Speaker 4>It makes us more in that line as long as</v>

<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2268
01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:23.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2269
01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the petty instinct is to talk shit.</v>

2270
01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:27.373
<v Speaker 2>That's the petty instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people deserve it and some people </v>

2271
01:44:29.691 --> 01:44:30.300
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2272
01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:31.730
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's different motivations,</v>

2273
01:44:31.731 --> 01:44:33.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes you talk and shit because</v>

2274
01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:36.620
<v Speaker 2>you're really jealous of someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're jealous of their effort,</v>

2275
01:44:36.710 --> 01:44:38.990
<v Speaker 2>their work ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their success,</v>

2276
01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:40.310
<v Speaker 2>the way they look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a,</v>

2277
01:44:40.311 --> 01:44:41.144
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank.</v>

2278
01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:44.240
<v Speaker 2>You're jealous of something about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's generally for me,</v>

2279
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:46.690
<v Speaker 4>root of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I'm going to be honest,</v>

2280
01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:48.760
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I recently got busted talking shit about</v>

2281
01:44:48.761 --> 01:44:49.594
<v Speaker 4>someone and I told and she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it got back to me from another friend </v>

2282
01:44:52.751 --> 01:44:54.400
<v Speaker 4>and I wrote their own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2283
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:55.263
<v Speaker 4>I'm jealous of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're cool and you're who I want to be </v>

2284
01:44:57.911 --> 01:44:58.744
<v Speaker 4>and I want to be friends with you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't seem to want to be friends </v>

2285
01:45:00.431 --> 01:45:01.264
<v Speaker 4>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I decided I hated you and that you </v>

2286
01:45:02.741 --> 01:45:03.574
<v Speaker 4>weren't to be trusted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I told people that and it wasn't </v>

2287
01:45:04.991 --> 01:45:06.670
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It completely wasn't true.</v>

2288
01:45:06.671 --> 01:45:07.504
<v Speaker 4>As threatened by you and you're hot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that you exist in the same </v>

2289
01:45:10.361 --> 01:45:12.790
<v Speaker 4>business as me and it makes me jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what did she say?</v>

2290
01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:15.100
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally get that.</v>

2291
01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.860
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at first she goes,</v>

2292
01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:20.020
<v Speaker 4>at first she just thumbs down my </v>
<v Speaker 4>apology,</v>

2293
01:45:20.021 --> 01:45:20.854
<v Speaker 4>which I loved.</v>

2294
01:45:21.130 --> 01:45:22.450
<v Speaker 4>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to be good.</v>

2295
01:45:22.690 --> 01:45:24.360
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love good.</v>

2296
01:45:24.370 --> 01:45:25.810
<v Speaker 4>I love apologizing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>

2297
01:45:25.811 --> 01:45:30.400
<v Speaker 4>like admitting when I've been jealous or</v>
<v Speaker 4>petty and I will continue to do so.</v>

2298
01:45:30.401 --> 01:45:33.670
<v Speaker 4>But if I'm caught I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can be.</v>

2299
01:45:33.671 --> 01:45:34.504
<v Speaker 4>So it got back to me that I said about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this girl that she shouldn't be trusted </v>

2300
01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:39.753
<v Speaker 4>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know why I would say that </v>

2301
01:45:41.141 --> 01:45:41.974
<v Speaker 4>about her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no evidence to back that up </v>

2302
01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.400
<v Speaker 4>equals I was just petty and jealous in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that moment.</v>

2303
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:46.660
<v Speaker 4>So I wrote her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2304
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.823
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what was going through my </v>

2305
01:45:48.731 --> 01:45:50.170
<v Speaker 4>mind that week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2306
01:45:50.171 --> 01:45:51.580
<v Speaker 4>I did say that about you because</v>

2307
01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:54.160
<v Speaker 2>standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a standard instinct.</v>

2308
01:45:54.161 --> 01:45:56.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a standard emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So common.</v>

2309
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2310
01:45:57.991 --> 01:46:01.570
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as a woman in this business,</v>

2311
01:46:01.571 --> 01:46:04.720
<v Speaker 4>like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I support women's so much,</v>

2312
01:46:04.721 --> 01:46:05.554
<v Speaker 4>but I'm aware of every woman who is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>who was doing the same thing I'm doing </v>

2313
01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:12.310
<v Speaker 4>in this book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm aware who are the up and comers</v>

2314
01:46:12.311 --> 01:46:14.230
<v Speaker 4>and I'd take them under my wing and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>build them up.</v>

2315
01:46:14.231 --> 01:46:15.064
<v Speaker 4>But I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm aware of like there's a part of me </v>

2316
01:46:17.081 --> 01:46:22.081
<v Speaker 4>that's like crazy deep breath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was me seeing a headline of them on</v>

2317
01:46:26.771 --> 01:46:30.240
<v Speaker 4>deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just like,</v>

2318
01:46:31.050 --> 01:46:34.270
<v Speaker 4>I know have a new show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that it's good for all of us.</v>

2319
01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:37.410
<v Speaker 2>We have a new show and it's in the slot </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your show was in.</v>

2320
01:46:38.210 --> 01:46:39.043
<v Speaker 4>You know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally have to unfollow girls </v>

2321
01:46:41.721 --> 01:46:44.120
<v Speaker 4>sometimes who I'm friends with who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2322
01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:44.983
<v Speaker 4>who are comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are my peers and who I respect and </v>

2323
01:46:48.441 --> 01:46:49.274
<v Speaker 4>think they're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to unfollow them if I see that </v>

2324
01:46:51.031 --> 01:46:51.864
<v Speaker 4>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm working a lot right now and they're </v>

2325
01:46:54.271 --> 01:46:55.104
<v Speaker 4>putting it out there that they're like </v>
<v Speaker 4>really busy with work and I just got </v>

2326
01:46:57.241 --> 01:46:58.074
<v Speaker 4>kicked off dancing with the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to unfollow them because I start </v>

2327
01:47:02.251 --> 01:47:03.084
<v Speaker 4>to feel sad about myself and I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather just remove that from my feed </v>

2328
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:10.140
<v Speaker 4>then and then it's a really awkward </v>
<v Speaker 4>follow when I know that or they messaged</v>

2329
01:47:10.141 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 4>me on one of those things and they see </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not following them because it's like</v>

2330
01:47:12.930 --> 01:47:13.763
<v Speaker 4>we all know we follow each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know and sometimes I'll just tell </v>

2331
01:47:16.171 --> 01:47:20.100
<v Speaker 4>them I've unfollowed you because you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you make me feel sad about my own career</v>

2332
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:22.243
<v Speaker 4>over that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easier to just take them out of my </v>

2333
01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:25.110
<v Speaker 4>feed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2334
01:47:25.111 --> 01:47:27.960
<v Speaker 4>but that's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am looking to get over it.</v>

2335
01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:29.470
<v Speaker 4>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am</v>

2336
01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:32.900
<v Speaker 2>just just use it as informal as </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiration.</v>

2337
01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Use them as fuel to work harder.</v>

2338
01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:36.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2339
01:47:36.871 --> 01:47:40.220
<v Speaker 4>But I would also like to not see their </v>
<v Speaker 4>tour dates scheduled.</v>

2340
01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.390
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

2341
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:44.720
<v Speaker 4>That one go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a good one to accept.</v>

2342
01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I probably,</v>

2343
01:47:47.461 --> 01:47:50.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably going to unfollow one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All,</v>

2344
01:47:50.190 --> 01:47:51.023
<v Speaker 4>all you guys with your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with your workouts and your calorie </v>

2345
01:47:53.101 --> 01:47:58.101
<v Speaker 4>counts that you post mad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'd even post the big one.</v>

2346
01:47:58.201 --> 01:48:02.580
<v Speaker 4>I didn't triggering as fuck to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are like,</v>

2347
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:05.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hate their bodies and stuff.</v>

2348
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.610
<v Speaker 4>It can be very triggering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like when I see girls,</v>

2349
01:48:08.611 --> 01:48:10.230
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just ran a marathon.</v>

2350

<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

2351
01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:14.640
<v Speaker 4>I can't have you in my life bragging </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this shit.</v>

2352
01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:15.773
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go to the gym too and I don't tweet </v>

<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>tweet tweet about it because I don't </v>

2355
01:48:24.391 --> 01:48:26.190
<v Speaker 4>want to trigger people and I don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be the.</v>

2356
01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:28.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be what I am so jealous </v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2357
01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:30.173
<v Speaker 4>but I should brag about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I also liked that some people are </v>

2358
01:48:33.421 --> 01:48:34.770
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at what I did at the gym.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but I can't.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like capital 100 exclamation points.</v>

2386
01:49:53.950 --> 01:49:56.980
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that dude focused.</v>

2387
01:49:57.730 --> 01:49:59.860
<v Speaker 2>I see that I want to go work out right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2388
01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:02.640
<v Speaker 4>Are you insecure about anything right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now in your life?</v>

2389
01:50:03.210 --> 01:50:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are always insecure,</v>

2390
01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:05.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's not something that's </v>

2391
01:50:07.351 --> 01:50:07.951
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2392
01:50:07.951 --> 01:50:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm always insecure about my act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always working on it,</v>

2393
01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:11.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always trying to pick it apart and </v>

2394
01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.450
<v Speaker 2>look at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone who hates it.</v>

2395
01:50:16.170 --> 01:50:18.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm always trying to like where's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flaws?</v>

2396
01:50:18.450 --> 01:50:19.283
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And always trying.</v>

2397
01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:20.950
<v Speaker 4>I heard you talking about that the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>day of like,</v>

2398
01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:23.800
<v Speaker 4>now that you've done your specialists </v>
<v Speaker 4>out and like watching it,</v>

2399
01:50:23.801 --> 01:50:26.590
<v Speaker 4>now you come up with new tags.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God</v>

2400
01:50:26.730 --> 01:50:28.000
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

2401
01:50:28.001 --> 01:50:31.120
<v Speaker 2>But that's so because you're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing and learning and getting better.</v>

2402
01:50:31.121 --> 01:50:33.940
<v Speaker 2>And I think comedy is like a living </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2403
01:50:34.210 --> 01:50:37.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like as a live you keep watering </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it keeps growing,</v>

2404
01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes you have to trim things to</v>

2405
01:50:39.551 --> 01:50:41.050
<v Speaker 2>make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like a Bush,</v>

2406
01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:42.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trim a little here,</v>

2407
01:50:42.461 --> 01:50:43.690
<v Speaker 2>trimodal there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets fuller,</v>

2408
01:50:44.230 --> 01:50:44.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2409
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:47.810
<v Speaker 2>but then also grows and gets bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2410
01:50:48.190 --> 01:50:50.470
<v Speaker 2>but then you got to release it at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain point in time.</v>

2411
01:50:50.490 --> 01:50:51.200
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

2412
01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:54.220
<v Speaker 2>my schedule seems to be two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be.</v>

2413
01:50:54.221 --> 01:50:55.054
<v Speaker 2>I develop a full solid hour and a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I hammered that motherfucker </v>

2414
01:50:58.661 --> 01:50:59.494
<v Speaker 2>like a Samurai sword for the next eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>months and then I film it and then four </v>

2415
01:51:02.741 --> 01:51:04.780
<v Speaker 2>months later it airs and then I start</v>

2416
01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:08.260
<v Speaker 4>credit card ashy and bet in the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>specialists in the last one.</v>

2417
01:51:08.430 --> 01:51:10.650
<v Speaker 4>The last one that's triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one was.</v>

2418
01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:15.660
<v Speaker 4>So I've seen that your stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how do you write,</v>

2419
01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:19.120
<v Speaker 4>like do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you literally write right or.</v>

2420
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2421
01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you how right.</v>

2422
01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:22.213
<v Speaker 2>Use One of the things that I use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been using over the last couple of </v>

2423
01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:27.133
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always write like in Microsoft word </v>

2424
01:51:28.881 --> 01:51:29.714
<v Speaker 2>and shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I use this program called scrivener </v>

2425
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:34.700
<v Speaker 2>that I really like and the reason why I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really like it,</v>

2426
01:51:34.730 --> 01:51:38.990
<v Speaker 2>especially when I'm doing new stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it's set up.</v>

2427
01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2428
01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.193
<v Speaker 2>was this,</v>

2429
01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:42.253
<v Speaker 4>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know the bed that is in the new one </v>

2430
01:51:44.691 --> 01:51:48.170
<v Speaker 4>that I love that you've just done the </v>
<v Speaker 4>women inventing things.</v>

2431
01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:53.000
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That bit I saw that grow.</v>

2432
01:51:53.001 --> 01:51:53.834
<v Speaker 4>That was a devastating bit because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first time I saw it it was like already </v>

2433
01:51:57.621 --> 01:52:00.620
<v Speaker 4>like one of those bits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are you as a comedian?</v>

2434
01:52:00.621 --> 01:52:02.090
<v Speaker 4>You Watch and you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

2435
01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.680
<v Speaker 4>What am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of those,</v>

2436
01:52:03.710 --> 01:52:04.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've all,</v>

2437
01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:05.900
<v Speaker 4>we've all been in the back of the room </v>
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>

2438
01:52:05.901 --> 01:52:07.670
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's what's happening?</v>

2439
01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:08.653
<v Speaker 4>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was like early stages of that bit </v>

2440
01:52:10.821 --> 01:52:12.740
<v Speaker 4>and then it became something so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

2441
01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:15.770
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen your special yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm excited to see where it landed,</v>

2442
01:52:16.370 --> 01:52:18.200
<v Speaker 4>but that wasn't an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an incredible bed.</v>

2443
01:52:18.710 --> 01:52:20.060
<v Speaker 4>But where does that start for you?</v>

2444
01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:23.010
<v Speaker 2>So this is what this in Scrivener,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see here,</v>

2445
01:52:23.011 --> 01:52:25.560
<v Speaker 2>like all on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all my new stuff.</v>

2446
01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:26.633
<v Speaker 2>So these are all the categories and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>click on each category and when I go to </v>

2447
01:52:29.431 --> 01:52:33.460
<v Speaker 2>each category I have all the material </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've written out about each side.</v>

2448
01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:36.580
<v Speaker 2>End caps was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not cool to kick robot.</v>

2449
01:52:40.090 --> 01:52:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what that's about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peta?</v>

2450
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Peta released a statement because Boston</v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamics</v>

2451
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.010
<v Speaker 3>has created these robots that are self </v>
<v Speaker 3>balancing.</v>

2452
01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:49.963
<v Speaker 3>So they have like a gyroscope in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these scientists were kicking these </v>

2453
01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:54.613
<v Speaker 3>robots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these four legged robots and Peta </v>

2454
01:52:56.631 --> 01:52:59.810
<v Speaker 3>released a statement saying that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not cool to kick robots.</v>

2455
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2456
01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.030
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>

2457
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking weak pussies.</v>

2458
01:53:04.161 --> 01:53:04.994
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be problem number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the robots take over these fucking </v>

2459
01:53:08.471 --> 01:53:10.400
<v Speaker 3>people are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna open up the door.</v>

2460
01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>robots are alive and they're,</v>

2461
01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.550
<v Speaker 3>they're sentient and you can't kick </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2462
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:17.690
<v Speaker 3>You know they're going to eat your </v>
<v Speaker 3>family fuck.</v>

2463
01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:19.680
<v Speaker 3>And the same point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2464
01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:21.980
<v Speaker 3>they're coming up with these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2465
01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:24.860
<v Speaker 3>more and more advanced artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

2466
01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:26.990
<v Speaker 3>So this is how right write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these,</v>

2467
01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:31.340
<v Speaker 3>this is essentially stage two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Stage one is,</v>

2468
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:33.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do everything in Microsoft word,</v>

2469
01:53:33.141 --> 01:53:35.600
<v Speaker 3>so this is in Microsoft word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of these are.</v>

2470
01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:38.890
<v Speaker 4>And it's just like you just loose </v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts.</v>

2471
01:53:38.891 --> 01:53:40.920
<v Speaker 4>You're not really editing as you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2472
01:53:40.930 --> 01:53:41.860
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like</v>

2473
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:43.370
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one is this?</v>

2474
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:46.010
<v Speaker 3>This one is um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a lot.</v>

2475
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:47.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write you gotta write.</v>

2476
01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:50.000
<v Speaker 3>This is how I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2477
01:53:50.001 --> 01:53:52.580
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got to do two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to Ad Lib,</v>

2478
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:55.190
<v Speaker 3>you got to do it on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to work things out on stage.</v>

2479
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:56.263
<v Speaker 3>But I think you're foolish to not write </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well because I think there's so much </v>

2480
01:54:00.201 --> 01:54:03.860
<v Speaker 3>to be gained by sitting in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer working on your act.</v>

2481
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.903
<v Speaker 3>That's one step.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another step is you have to review your </v>

2482
01:54:07.131 --> 01:54:09.140
<v Speaker 3>act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to listen to it or watch it.</v>

2483
01:54:09.141 --> 01:54:09.974
<v Speaker 3>Preferably watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I learned a lot watching the </v>

2484
01:54:12.141 --> 01:54:14.600
<v Speaker 3>editing when I was editing this special </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I snapped.</v>

2485
01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:15.453
<v Speaker 3>I had a snip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided I wanted to be an hour and my </v>

2486
01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:20.240
<v Speaker 3>set was like an hour and 17 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I said let me just cut,</v>

2487
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.750
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want it to just fuck it.</v>

2488
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:24.560
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just one hour,</v>

2489
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:27.080
<v Speaker 3>boom and done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had caught a couple of bits out,</v>

2490
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:30.890
<v Speaker 3>but when I did that I was like watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>the videos.</v>

2491
01:54:30.891 --> 01:54:31.431
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2492
01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:35.480
<v Speaker 3>I should really videotape everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should watch the video because it's so</v>

2493
01:54:35.481 --> 01:54:38.910
<v Speaker 3>much more immersive than just audio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

2494
01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:42.560
<v Speaker 3>You only get so much out of audio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of know my expressions,</v>

2495
01:54:42.561 --> 01:54:45.470
<v Speaker 3>all the different things that I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I see them I go,</v>

2496
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:46.333
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better if I move like this or it's </v>

2497
01:54:47.541 --> 01:54:51.170
<v Speaker 3>better if I pause there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's better if I raise my eyebrows.</v>

2498
01:54:51.171 --> 01:54:53.250
<v Speaker 3>It's better if I look concerned.</v>

2499
01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:58.880
<v Speaker 4>Don't realize how much of comedy is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical thing until you do watch it.</v>

2500
01:55:00.131 --> 01:55:02.650
<v Speaker 4>You're so right and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're right about writing it down.</v>

2501
01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:03.513
<v Speaker 4>Anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had to do a transcript because I </v>

2502
01:55:04.691 --> 01:55:07.520
<v Speaker 4>don't write anything down Longhand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I've had to do a transcript for</v>

2503
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:10.270
<v Speaker 4>tonight show or like just for laughs </v>
<v Speaker 4>festival and see it.</v>

2504
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Then you start writing new tags and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2505
01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:14.680
<v Speaker 4>all this took was for me to write it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

2506
01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:16.420
<v Speaker 4>but then what do you do for Microsoft </v>
<v Speaker 4>word?</v>

2507
01:55:16.421 --> 01:55:19.870
<v Speaker 4>Then you take it to take it to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>scrivener and then what do you do there?</v>

2508
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.870
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

2509
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:20.703
<v Speaker 3>put it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd take the stuff from Microsoft word </v>

2510
01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:23.133
<v Speaker 3>and then I trim it down and when I trim </v>
<v Speaker 3>it down I put it in Scribnar and when I </v>

2511
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:29.680
<v Speaker 3>trim it down and put it in Scribnar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm essentially doing is saying,</v>

2512
01:55:29.681 --> 01:55:31.180
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is ready,</v>

2513
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:34.450
<v Speaker 3>this is ready to play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then what it's scrivener do.</v>

2514
01:55:34.810 --> 01:55:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left my notebook in a hotel room.</v>

2515
01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:40.060
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's going to freak out.</v>

2516
01:55:40.930 --> 01:55:41.763
<v Speaker 3>So then from there I write things out on</v>
<v Speaker 3>an actual notebook and the actual </v>

2517
01:55:47.581 --> 01:55:48.414
<v Speaker 3>notebook is basically just to get my set</v>
<v Speaker 3>list in order and to make sure I </v>

2518
01:55:53.101 --> 01:55:56.520
<v Speaker 3>highlight all the different tags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's three stages.</v>

2519
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:57.743
<v Speaker 3>There's the Microsoft word stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically just free form free </v>

2520
01:56:01.411 --> 01:56:04.230
<v Speaker 3>association writing things down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2521
01:56:04.410 --> 01:56:07.530
<v Speaker 3>there's no structure to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it comes out like a bit.</v>

2522
01:56:07.531 --> 01:56:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's just nonsense that never </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes anywhere.</v>

2523
01:56:10.181 --> 01:56:10.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2524
01:56:10.290 --> 01:56:12.690
<v Speaker 5>You needed to get out anyway so you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could get to others.</v>

2525
01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will.</v>

2526
01:56:13.610 --> 01:56:14.620
<v Speaker 3>You just urging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2527
01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:16.130
<v Speaker 3>well it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you need it,</v>

2528
01:56:16.131 --> 01:56:20.330
<v Speaker 3>but it's like there's a road and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>onto and as you're on that road all of a</v>

2529
01:56:20.331 --> 01:56:21.111
<v Speaker 3>sudden like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh look,</v>

2530
01:56:21.111 --> 01:56:24.720
<v Speaker 3>I found a bag of gold and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't find that bag of gold.</v>

2531
01:56:24.721 --> 01:56:26.750
<v Speaker 3>If you stay home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta walk,</v>

2532
01:56:26.751 --> 01:56:27.584
<v Speaker 3>you gotTa get out there and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the writing does with the </v>

2533
01:56:29.721 --> 01:56:32.690
<v Speaker 3>writing does it allows you to pick up </v>
<v Speaker 3>these little bags of gold along the way.</v>

2534
01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:33.793
<v Speaker 3>And then I'd take these little bags of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gold when I pile them up and then I </v>

2535
01:56:35.901 --> 01:56:39.470
<v Speaker 3>throw them into the fortress and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fortress is like scrivener,</v>

2536
01:56:39.710 --> 01:56:43.640
<v Speaker 3>so then I can move those bits around </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what is it?</v>

2537
01:56:43.670 --> 01:56:44.860
<v Speaker 3>Why is that different than Microsoft </v>
<v Speaker 3>word?</v>

2538
01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:48.020
<v Speaker 3>The reason why it's different is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's set up in columns,</v>

2539
01:56:48.021 --> 01:56:48.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2540
01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:49.363
<v Speaker 3>So you see how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also as corkboard see Jamie's </v>

2541
01:56:52.011 --> 01:56:52.844
<v Speaker 3>got it up on the big screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the court records see how it's </v>

2542
01:56:55.431 --> 01:56:59.450
<v Speaker 3>set up right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like each one of these things,</v>

2543
01:56:59.451 --> 01:57:00.284
<v Speaker 3>if you go to the left side here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each one of these categories I can move </v>

2544
01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:05.120
<v Speaker 3>and I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can change,</v>

2545
01:57:05.121 --> 01:57:10.121
<v Speaker 3>I can have that bit in the beginning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then once I'm in the bit I could also go</v>

2546
01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:15.050
<v Speaker 3>to this and that sets me up with a cork </v>
<v Speaker 3>board so I can have like,</v>

2547
01:57:15.051 --> 01:57:19.800
<v Speaker 3>I could set up little note,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like little a setlists.</v>

2548
01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Well like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like up there little notepad things.</v>

2549
01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:26.750
<v Speaker 3>So I can write down these on these index</v>
<v Speaker 3>cards.</v>

2550
01:57:26.930 --> 01:57:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Like don't forget this or this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>important here or this tagline,</v>

2551
01:57:31.170 --> 01:57:33.820
<v Speaker 3>huge try switching this around and</v>

2552
01:57:33.890 --> 01:57:34.723
<v Speaker 5>it's just this constant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But are you already like this or you </v>

2553
01:57:38.031 --> 01:57:39.650
<v Speaker 5>already this kind of an organized </v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

2554
01:57:39.651 --> 01:57:41.010
<v Speaker 5>Have you always been this way or did you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get.</v>

2555
01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:42.173
<v Speaker 5>You have to know this is a discipline </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that if you can teach yourself to </v>

2556
01:57:46.791 --> 01:57:48.500
<v Speaker 5>be like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I just feel like some people are</v>

2557
01:57:48.501 --> 01:57:50.510
<v Speaker 5>made that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not me.</v>

2558
01:57:50.690 --> 01:57:51.410
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2559
01:57:51.410 --> 01:57:54.080
<v Speaker 5>not like this at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is just look at your backpack.</v>

2560
01:57:54.081 --> 01:57:59.081
<v Speaker 5>You just brought out in every pocket as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a thing and a pen as just cleaned it up.</v>

2561
01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:00.733
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like that.</v>

2562
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:01.131
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2563
01:58:01.131 --> 01:58:02.590
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you caught that three days ago,</v>

2564
01:58:02.591 --> 01:58:03.950
<v Speaker 5>he's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wires are coming out.</v>

2565
01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:04.813
<v Speaker 5>Are like chaos and domestic guns really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes me and so many people </v>

2566
01:58:10.311 --> 01:58:13.250
<v Speaker 5>listening feel so good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I cleaned it up a lot,</v>

2567
01:58:13.251 --> 01:58:14.750
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of times your house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2568
01:58:14.751 --> 01:58:17.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean I know you probably have people </v>
<v Speaker 5>come in and clean,</v>

2569
01:58:17.061 --> 01:58:17.894
<v Speaker 5>but like if you're in a hotel room over </v>
<v Speaker 5>the weekend and don't have a maid </v>

2570
01:58:19.731 --> 01:58:20.900
<v Speaker 5>service,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are we looking at?</v>

2571
01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:21.853
<v Speaker 5>Chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything's spread out all over the </v>

2572
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:28.350
<v Speaker 5>place and you throw it hits the ground</v>

2573
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I'm in a room like a hotel room.</v>

2574
01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:35.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's basically like battle camp.</v>

2575
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready to roll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2576
01:58:36.911 --> 01:58:38.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to care what it looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

2577
01:58:38.450 --> 01:58:39.283
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here like I'm want a clear path to </v>

2578
01:58:40.581 --> 01:58:41.920
<v Speaker 3>the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2579
01:58:41.921 --> 01:58:43.060
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a desk.</v>

2580
01:58:43.061 --> 01:58:46.330
<v Speaker 3>As soon as I get into the hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I set the computer down the desk,</v>

2581
01:58:46.331 --> 01:58:49.810
<v Speaker 3>I plug it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get connected to the Wifi and then I,</v>

2582
01:58:49.930 --> 01:58:50.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on how long I'm there for </v>

2583
01:58:52.121 --> 01:58:54.970
<v Speaker 3>what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm going to do and then you know,</v>

2584
01:58:55.450 --> 01:58:56.960
<v Speaker 3>I get to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2585
01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:58.480
<v Speaker 3>if I'm there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm there to work.</v>

2586
01:58:58.690 --> 01:59:01.350
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I set everything up,</v>

2587
01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:02.353
<v Speaker 4>spent time folding shirts and socks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit and put different things in </v>

2588
01:59:05.871 --> 01:59:06.704
<v Speaker 4>compartments.</v>

2589
01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:09.770
<v Speaker 3>No full shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also buy these shirts.</v>

2590
01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.313
<v Speaker 3>There's a company that I work with </v>
<v Speaker 3>called Mizzen and main and they make </v>

2591
01:59:13.701 --> 01:59:17.130
<v Speaker 3>these shirts that are like Super Flexi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have you ever seen me wear,</v>

2592
01:59:17.410 --> 01:59:21.910
<v Speaker 3>wear these shirts on stage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wore it on my last special special.</v>

2593
01:59:22.090 --> 01:59:25.790
<v Speaker 3>They're like pajamas there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pull on them and they have a flex to</v>

2594
01:59:25.791 --> 01:59:28.610
<v Speaker 3>them so they don't feel like anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they never get wrinkly.</v>

2595
01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:33.110
<v Speaker 3>So I could roll that bitch up in a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw it into the suitcase and then pull</v>

2596
01:59:33.111 --> 01:59:34.640
<v Speaker 3>it out and wear it and you would never </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

2597
01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's just,</v>

2598
01:59:36.741 --> 01:59:37.574
<v Speaker 3>they're the best to wear because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on stage they don't feel like </v>

2599
01:59:39.861 --> 01:59:41.960
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel like you're wearing nothing.</v>

2600
01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:43.880
<v Speaker 3>What is this again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ms Dot and main.</v>

2601
01:59:43.881 --> 01:59:46.550
<v Speaker 3>Is the name of the competition?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they make women's stuff?</v>

2602
01:59:46.610 --> 01:59:49.280
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not know find out.</v>

2603
01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:53.420
<v Speaker 3>So I wear them and I wear these jeans </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have like flex to them.</v>

2604
01:59:53.630 --> 01:59:56.270
<v Speaker 3>So the genes are like pajamas too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the jeans,</v>

2605
01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:58.250
<v Speaker 3>they're literally like sweatpants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you pull them,</v>

2606
01:59:58.251 --> 02:00:00.560
<v Speaker 3>they snap so they don't get wrinkly </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

2607
02:00:00.690 --> 02:00:04.200
<v Speaker 4>And what's your like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your regimen,</v>

2608
02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:06.930
<v Speaker 4>like your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your skincare regimen.</v>

2609
02:00:06.931 --> 02:00:09.840
<v Speaker 4>Do you spend a lot of time on that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>before you go to bed?</v>

2610
02:00:09.841 --> 02:00:13.050
<v Speaker 4>Are you washing your face?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you applying oils and creams?</v>

2611
02:00:13.051 --> 02:00:14.950
<v Speaker 4>Like are you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2612
02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:16.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you don't attend a lot of times you </v>

2613
02:00:17.191 --> 02:00:20.070
<v Speaker 4>don't waste a lot of time doing stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't.</v>

2614
02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:25.200
<v Speaker 4>You're very utilitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like not just botox.</v>

2615
02:00:25.201 --> 02:00:26.540
<v Speaker 4>If that's you mean I'm a man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2616
02:00:26.670 --> 02:00:27.503
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely don't think you look like </v>

2617
02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:30.113
<v Speaker 4>your best self.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm saying like you literally see </v>

2618
02:00:31.981 --> 02:00:34.320
<v Speaker 4>major list to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand you like,</v>

2619
02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:35.693
<v Speaker 4>but it is interesting to me because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have thought you were very </v>

2620
02:00:37.291 --> 02:00:38.124
<v Speaker 4>meticulous with like organization and </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasted a lot of time organizing things </v>

2621
02:00:41.431 --> 02:00:42.264
<v Speaker 4>and I like that you don't.</v>

2622
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:43.171
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2623
02:00:43.171 --> 02:00:43.620
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2624
02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:46.260
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to have both.</v>

2625
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:48.420
<v Speaker 3>There has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look if you're a comic,</v>

2626
02:00:48.450 --> 02:00:49.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're good.</v>

2627
02:00:49.471 --> 02:00:52.650
<v Speaker 3>Especially I think there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of you that has to be impulsive.</v>

2628
02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:54.113
<v Speaker 3>It has to be reckless and impulsive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be like one move away from </v>

2629
02:00:58.591 --> 02:01:02.430
<v Speaker 3>ruining your life all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to keep it under control.</v>

2630
02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:03.413
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have a wolf and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>it behind like this flimsy chain link </v>

2631
02:01:06.121 --> 02:01:07.400
<v Speaker 3>fence that you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2632
02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:08.453
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to wire this fucking shot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to work and I hope the </v>

2633
02:01:10.301 --> 02:01:11.134
<v Speaker 3>wolf doesn't get out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's literally what it's got to be </v>

2634
02:01:12.931 --> 02:01:13.764
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you also have to have </v>

2635
02:01:14.281 --> 02:01:18.690
<v Speaker 3>discipline and I think those two </v>
<v Speaker 3>counterbalance each other and one of the</v>

2636
02:01:18.691 --> 02:01:21.600
<v Speaker 3>things that's helped my act tremendously</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the last few years.</v>

2637
02:01:22.170 --> 02:01:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I think my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my I think triggered was my best special</v>

2638
02:01:25.351 --> 02:01:27.600
<v Speaker 3>ever and I think this one is better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2639
02:01:27.810 --> 02:01:29.340
<v Speaker 3>I think strange times better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>triggered.</v>

2640
02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:30.413
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that over the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>three or four years that have really </v>

2641
02:01:32.431 --> 02:01:37.350
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on is this process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The process of organizing and being very</v>

2642
02:01:37.351 --> 02:01:40.370
<v Speaker 3>meticulous about like how I structure</v>

2643
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:43.580
<v Speaker 2>my material and then doing a lot of sets</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2644
02:01:43.610 --> 02:01:46.010
<v Speaker 2>You got to do that and then fuck around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go on stage.</v>

2645
02:01:46.050 --> 02:01:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to go on stage high.</v>

2646
02:01:48.170 --> 02:01:51.050
<v Speaker 2>I like to fuck around because those are </v>
<v Speaker 2>workout sets in,</v>

2647
02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:53.540
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in those moments of chaos.</v>

2648
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes a thing will come out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't there before.</v>

2649
02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:01.690
<v Speaker 2>It just popped out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that motherfucker might be my.</v>

2650
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:02.833
<v Speaker 2>That might be my Bruce Jenner bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might be my closing bit in those </v>

2651
02:02:05.631 --> 02:02:07.340
<v Speaker 2>bits are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're rare,</v>

2652
02:02:07.341 --> 02:02:10.310
<v Speaker 2>they're strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're theory theorial.</v>

2653
02:02:10.311 --> 02:02:12.710
<v Speaker 2>They come out of the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where they're from.</v>

2654
02:02:12.711 --> 02:02:17.711
<v Speaker 2>And you have to nurture that and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from chaos and that come that this</v>

2655
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:23.390
<v Speaker 2>is not necessarily a discipline thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the creativity in the madness</v>

2656
02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:25.153
<v Speaker 2>has to sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to share space with the </v>

2657
02:02:27.771 --> 02:02:30.980
<v Speaker 2>discipline they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to go back and forth with each</v>

2658
02:02:30.981 --> 02:02:31.370
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

2659
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:32.203
<v Speaker 2>So we've always thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people have always thought of </v>

2660
02:02:34.851 --> 02:02:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Comedians as being like sad people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drunks are messy,</v>

2661
02:02:38.391 --> 02:02:41.420
<v Speaker 2>people are not disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have their shit together.</v>

2662
02:02:41.421 --> 02:02:46.421
<v Speaker 2>But why I don't think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm always going to be fucked up.</v>

2663
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:47.151
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2664
02:02:47.151 --> 02:02:49.910
<v Speaker 2>So how about I be fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also keep it together,</v>

2665
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:52.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I always have these thoughts,</v>

2666
02:02:52.130 --> 02:02:54.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I still have crazy thoughts.</v>

2667
02:02:54.501 --> 02:02:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's your,</v>

2668
02:02:55.551 --> 02:02:57.020
<v Speaker 2>what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you fucked up?</v>

2669
02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your fucked up thoughts for?</v>

2670
02:02:59.001 --> 02:02:59.834
<v Speaker 2>Probably definitely have brain damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>will probably definitely have like some </v>

2671
02:03:02.751 --> 02:03:06.800
<v Speaker 2>sort of head trauma induced damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's going on.</v>

2672
02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Does that manifest itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2673
02:03:09.210 --> 02:03:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2674
02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:17.780
<v Speaker 2>really not totally like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also I work out so much that I drain</v>

2675
02:03:19.551 --> 02:03:21.320
<v Speaker 2>all that shit out of my system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You meditate,</v>

2676
02:03:21.321 --> 02:03:22.154
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2677
02:03:22.450 --> 02:03:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time doing the float </v>
<v Speaker 2>tank too.</v>

2678
02:03:25.490 --> 02:03:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I have a float tank right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That helps a lot.</v>

2679
02:03:28.750 --> 02:03:29.583
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that if I did slow down and </v>

2680
02:03:31.551 --> 02:03:32.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're running.</v>

<v Speaker 4>of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could just run forever.</v>

2690

02:05:03.631 --> 02:05:05.460
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know that's the thing.</v>

02:05:08.071 --> 02:05:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I bet less crazy than the average person</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're free to express ourselves.</v>

2726
02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:15.540
<v Speaker 2>The average person has to live this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking bizarre,</v>

2727
02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:19.310
<v Speaker 2>contained life where you show up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same place everyday.</v>

2728
02:05:19.410 --> 02:05:20.243
<v Speaker 2>Do something you don't want to do every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day with a bunch of people you probably </v>

2729
02:05:22.501 --> 02:05:23.334
<v Speaker 2>don't even like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're all backstabbing and weird </v>

2730
02:05:25.711 --> 02:05:29.190
<v Speaker 2>with each other and you're just doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a paycheck.</v>

2731
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:30.211
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

2732

<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2733
02:05:30.631 --> 02:05:31.464
<v Speaker 2>you're spending the majority of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>time here on this heavenly body hurling </v>

2734
02:05:35.491 --> 02:05:37.800
<v Speaker 2>through infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something you don't want to do.</v>

2735
02:05:38.850 --> 02:05:39.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more crazy what you and I are </v>

2736
02:05:41.401 --> 02:05:43.050
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least we're doing something we love.</v>

2737
02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:45.570
<v Speaker 2>And then that feeling that you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2738
02:05:45.571 --> 02:05:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I've seen you crush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2739
02:05:47.131 --> 02:05:47.964
<v Speaker 2>You go on stage in the main room and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking crush and you say thank you </v>

2740
02:05:52.381 --> 02:05:54.390
<v Speaker 2>goodnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was like,</v>

2741
02:05:54.630 --> 02:05:58.530
<v Speaker 2>that is that feeling of making all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people happy.</v>

2742
02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Have they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went out,</v>

2743
02:06:00.750 --> 02:06:03.450
<v Speaker 2>they got babysitters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got together,</v>

2744
02:06:03.451 --> 02:06:05.610
<v Speaker 2>they dressed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went to dinner,</v>

2745
02:06:05.611 --> 02:06:08.970
<v Speaker 2>they got to the comedy store or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordered drinks.</v>

2746
02:06:08.971 --> 02:06:12.300
<v Speaker 2>They sat down there and you fulfilled </v>
<v Speaker 2>their expectations.</v>

2747
02:06:12.301 --> 02:06:15.630
<v Speaker 2>You gave them what they wanted to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen you do it.</v>

2748
02:06:15.631 --> 02:06:17.970
<v Speaker 2>And that feeling that you get when that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

2749
02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:23.450
<v Speaker 2>it's indescribable and drag you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your 300 people happy.</v>

2750
02:06:23.971 --> 02:06:25.860
<v Speaker 2>You made them all laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>

2751
02:06:25.870 --> 02:06:29.190
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing like it on earth for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2752
02:06:29.191 --> 02:06:31.110
<v Speaker 2>don't you see people that never get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill and you go,</v>

2753
02:06:31.111 --> 02:06:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you poor pitch.</v>

2754
02:06:32.890 --> 02:06:33.723
<v Speaker 2>Never get it to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just go through your life as a </v>

2755
02:06:34.981 --> 02:06:36.510
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never get to kill,</v>

2756
02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:38.903
<v Speaker 2>kill.</v>

2757
02:06:39.070 --> 02:06:42.670
<v Speaker 4>How do you go through life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to die.</v>

2758
02:06:42.730 --> 02:06:43.563
<v Speaker 4>I was like on a path to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll probably just kill myself some day </v>

2759
02:06:46.301 --> 02:06:50.670
<v Speaker 4>if I don't find a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then killing gave me a purpose,</v>

2760
02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:52.650
<v Speaker 4>kill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Going onstage.</v>

2761
02:06:52.770 --> 02:06:54.100
<v Speaker 4>Killing on stage was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2762
02:06:54.101 --> 02:06:57.340
<v Speaker 4>now I have a reason to live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like fucked up.</v>

2763
02:06:57.370 --> 02:06:58.930
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucked up.</v>

2764
02:06:58.931 --> 02:07:02.620
<v Speaker 4>But it keeps me going and I and I get to</v>
<v Speaker 4>continue to do it.</v>

2765
02:07:02.650 --> 02:07:03.483
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a struggle to do and that's </v>

2766
02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:07.960
<v Speaker 4>exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But don't you like the art of comedy?</v>

2767
02:07:07.961 --> 02:07:09.670
<v Speaker 4>Like didn't you'd like it before you </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever did it?</v>

2768
02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:12.070
<v Speaker 4>Hell yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The greatest.</v>

2769
02:07:12.430 --> 02:07:13.840
<v Speaker 4>It's such a good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2770
02:07:13.841 --> 02:07:14.674
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it just never seemed like an option </v>

2771
02:07:16.481 --> 02:07:17.314
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't even like look at stand </v>

2772
02:07:18.411 --> 02:07:18.671
<v Speaker 4>ups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2773
02:07:18.671 --> 02:07:19.504
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something I could ever do and </v>

2774
02:07:20.621 --> 02:07:23.110
<v Speaker 4>then get anybody does until you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some people that are like,</v>

2775
02:07:23.111 --> 02:07:23.944
<v Speaker 4>I love what I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I did was a memorized comedy and I </v>

2776
02:07:26.441 --> 02:07:29.530
<v Speaker 4>performed it for my class and I won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>memorize people stand up.</v>

2777
02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:32.830
<v Speaker 4>It was never even something I paid </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to until people were like,</v>

2778
02:07:32.831 --> 02:07:34.810
<v Speaker 4>you should do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I paid attention to it.</v>

2779
02:07:35.070 --> 02:07:37.750
<v Speaker 4>I could do routines and Conan and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

2780
02:07:37.751 --> 02:07:38.860
<v Speaker 4>but stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was.</v>

2781
02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I was never really aware of what w.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What were you,</v>

2782
02:07:41.831 --> 02:07:43.600
<v Speaker 4>what was your exposure to it early on?</v>

2783
02:07:44.110 --> 02:07:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was about,</v>

2784
02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:46.113
<v Speaker 2>I think I was 13 or 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents took me to see live in the </v>

2785
02:07:48.731 --> 02:07:51.190
<v Speaker 2>sunset strip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2786
02:07:51.550 --> 02:07:52.383
<v Speaker 2>It was a in the movie theater and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Pryor and it was absolutely the </v>

2787
02:07:56.801 --> 02:07:58.600
<v Speaker 2>first time I'd ever seen anything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2788
02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:00.030
<v Speaker 2>Cool parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2789
02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:01.110
<v Speaker 2>hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2790
02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:02.613
<v Speaker 2>and that moment when I was in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience watching that and in dying </v>

2791
02:08:06.761 --> 02:08:09.550
<v Speaker 2>laughing and looking around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I really,</v>

2792
02:08:09.551 --> 02:08:13.270
<v Speaker 2>really distinctly remember looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just looking at the screen,</v>

2793
02:08:13.271 --> 02:08:14.104
<v Speaker 2>but looking at all the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like slapping the chair and moving </v>

2794
02:08:17.621 --> 02:08:18.454
<v Speaker 2>around and holding their chest and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking how insane is it that this guy </v>

2795
02:08:22.151 --> 02:08:22.984
<v Speaker 2>can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this guy can just talk and just </v>

2796
02:08:26.141 --> 02:08:28.390
<v Speaker 2>through talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2797
02:08:28.450 --> 02:08:33.430
<v Speaker 2>he's making me laugh way harder than any</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie I'd ever seen in my life.</v>

2798
02:08:33.610 --> 02:08:34.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think it came around.</v>

2799
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:35.703
<v Speaker 2>I think that movie came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think live with the census came out </v>

2800
02:08:38.441 --> 02:08:39.274
<v Speaker 2>around the same time as stripes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of my all time favorite </v>

2801
02:08:42.161 --> 02:08:43.660
<v Speaker 2>comedies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I remember thinking,</v>

2802
02:08:43.661 --> 02:08:46.870
<v Speaker 2>why isn't stripes as funny as that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking?</v>

2803
02:08:46.871 --> 02:08:51.160
<v Speaker 2>How insane is this thing that this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do where he,</v>

2804
02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:54.550
<v Speaker 2>he's just talking stripes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching all this stuff play out.</v>

2805
02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:56.530
<v Speaker 2>There's texts and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2806
02:08:56.531 --> 02:08:58.450
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's funnier than that.</v>

2807
02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:02.050
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking he's Funnier </v>
<v Speaker 2>than any movie that I've ever seen.</v>

2808
02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Even in Richard Pryor movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2809
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:05.223
<v Speaker 2>Richard Pryor movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like never as funny as him talking like </v>

2810
02:09:08.501 --> 02:09:10.990
<v Speaker 2>him talking his way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funniest thing,</v>

2811
02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:13.240
<v Speaker 2>the funniest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a comic killing.</v>

2812
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember my friend Steve </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

2813
02:09:15.250 --> 02:09:16.960
<v Speaker 2>he said something about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2814
02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:18.193
<v Speaker 2>he went to see something about Mary and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this was his instinct strip is his </v>

2815
02:09:22.391 --> 02:09:24.220
<v Speaker 2>fucking old school Italian guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a lawyer.</v>

2816
02:09:24.250 --> 02:09:26.050
<v Speaker 2>He was on the Sopranos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2817
02:09:26.051 --> 02:09:27.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said he goes,</v>

2818
02:09:27.250 --> 02:09:30.520
<v Speaker 2>it was as good as someone killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he said.</v>

2819
02:09:30.610 --> 02:09:33.070
<v Speaker 2>He was as good as a comic killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a funny.</v>

2820
02:09:33.071 --> 02:09:34.330
<v Speaker 2>That movie is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2821
02:09:34.331 --> 02:09:37.120
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a crazy statement.</v>

2822
02:09:37.330 --> 02:09:38.163
<v Speaker 2>It's as good as a comic killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's universally accepted that if </v>

2823
02:09:40.991 --> 02:09:42.460
<v Speaker 2>you go to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2824
02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:44.050
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave Chappelle,</v>

2825
02:09:44.051 --> 02:09:44.884
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's killing bill burr when they're on </v>

2826
02:09:46.471 --> 02:09:47.304
<v Speaker 2>stage smashing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the funniest thing you </v>

2827
02:09:49.481 --> 02:09:50.314
<v Speaker 2>could ever experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the art form itself is to me like </v>

2828
02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:57.730
<v Speaker 2>it's the craziest</v>

2829
02:09:58.100 --> 02:09:58.933
<v Speaker 4>it most craziest dynamic art forum that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we stand up there with a microphone and </v>

2830
02:10:02.431 --> 02:10:03.900
<v Speaker 4>talking to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's all we have.</v>

2831
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:06.390
<v Speaker 4>There are times where I'm on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2832
02:10:06.391 --> 02:10:07.224
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

2833
02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:08.273
<v Speaker 4>how are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have that moment that other people </v>

2834
02:10:11.041 --> 02:10:12.060
<v Speaker 4>say to you all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

2835
02:10:12.061 --> 02:10:13.980
<v Speaker 4>how do you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2836
02:10:13.981 --> 02:10:14.814
<v Speaker 4>musicians say they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a guitar and I get to sing and I </v>

2837
02:10:16.711 --> 02:10:21.420
<v Speaker 4>rely on all these things use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to talk and there's no other option</v>

2838
02:10:21.421 --> 02:10:22.254
<v Speaker 4>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like that's all we've ever </v>

2839
02:10:22.951 --> 02:10:25.890
<v Speaker 4>done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is a wild thing that we do.</v>

2840
02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:27.230
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2841
02:10:27.231 --> 02:10:29.120
<v Speaker 2>musicians have their own wildness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2842
02:10:29.121 --> 02:10:30.680
<v Speaker 2>could you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

2843
02:10:30.710 --> 02:10:31.930
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2844
02:10:32.610 --> 02:10:33.443
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>

2845
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:36.220
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I have no skills.</v>

2846
02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:38.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't have it either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I admire the shit out of it.</v>

2847
02:10:38.741 --> 02:10:42.310
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why I admire it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't have it like a watch.</v>

2848
02:10:42.311 --> 02:10:45.070
<v Speaker 3>Like I have friends that are musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to see them live and it's,</v>

2849
02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:48.520
<v Speaker 3>it's so fulfilling to me because I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>no talent.</v>

2850
02:10:48.670 --> 02:10:50.560
<v Speaker 3>So like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I watched them do it,</v>

2851
02:10:50.561 --> 02:10:52.870
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing that they can do this.</v>

2852
02:10:53.110 --> 02:10:54.650
<v Speaker 3>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

2853
02:10:54.651 --> 02:10:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I go to see Cirque du Solei,</v>

2854
02:10:56.531 --> 02:10:57.364
<v Speaker 3>I get the same feeling.</v>

2855
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:59.890
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doing dancing with the stars.</v>

2856
02:10:59.891 --> 02:11:03.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like watching these dancers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how did you just do like that?</v>

2857
02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:04.273
<v Speaker 4>That took me months to learn and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just taught it to this girl in three </v>

2858
02:11:06.701 --> 02:11:08.760
<v Speaker 4>minutes for her to fill in for me to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>the camera black.</v>

2859
02:11:08.761 --> 02:11:11.490
<v Speaker 4>Like it was just like I couldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2860
02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:14.370
<v Speaker 4>That is the thing of the wonder of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just can't.</v>

2861
02:11:14.410 --> 02:11:16.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what that's like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

2862
02:11:16.151 --> 02:11:18.700
<v Speaker 4>But I of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you play an instrument?</v>

2863
02:11:18.730 --> 02:11:20.350
<v Speaker 4>Do you have any musical ability?</v>
<v Speaker 4>None.</v>

2864
02:11:20.351 --> 02:11:21.900
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like you would know.</v>

2865
02:11:22.150 --> 02:11:23.410
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't it suck?</v>

2866
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:25.220
<v Speaker 4>Like want that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to.</v>

2867
02:11:25.630 --> 02:11:28.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to learn anything and I do </v>
<v Speaker 3>too much shit already.</v>

2868
02:11:28.530 --> 02:11:30.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You to where you don't need it.</v>

2869
02:11:30.810 --> 02:11:32.880
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to manage my time.</v>

2870
02:11:32.881 --> 02:11:33.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2871
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to manage my obsessions,</v>

2872
02:11:36.180 --> 02:11:40.080
<v Speaker 3>but I think that what we are seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's in music or in,</v>

2873
02:11:40.081 --> 02:11:44.490
<v Speaker 3>you know what going to see a great comic</v>
<v Speaker 3>or anything when you're seeing is these,</v>

2874
02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:48.870
<v Speaker 3>these portals for expression and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>more they concentrate on that portal for</v>

2875
02:11:48.871 --> 02:11:50.400
<v Speaker 3>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's dancing,</v>

2876
02:11:50.410 --> 02:11:54.090
<v Speaker 3>whether it's musicians or even someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>making a film,</v>

2877
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:57.990
<v Speaker 3>there's more they concentrate on those </v>
<v Speaker 3>portals of expression.</v>

2878
02:11:58.020 --> 02:11:58.853
<v Speaker 3>The better the message and the better </v>
<v Speaker 3>the impact it's going to be for the </v>

2879
02:12:01.441 --> 02:12:03.660
<v Speaker 3>people that are enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that watch it,</v>

2880
02:12:03.870 --> 02:12:04.703
<v Speaker 3>and I think Paul Mooney told me that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago when I was a young comic </v>

2881
02:12:08.581 --> 02:12:11.130
<v Speaker 3>coming up and he was like the old sage </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the comedy store.</v>

2882
02:12:11.370 --> 02:12:12.203
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to get good </v>

2883
02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:14.340
<v Speaker 3>accommodate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to go up and kill.</v>

2884
02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:16.230
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should go get into tained.</v>

2885
02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Go get entertained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2886
02:12:18.211 --> 02:12:18.901
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2887
02:12:18.901 --> 02:12:19.621
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2888
02:12:19.621 --> 02:12:21.420
<v Speaker 3>you know what I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to see some music.</v>

2889
02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.310
<v Speaker 3>I go to see a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get entertained,</v>

2890
02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:25.080
<v Speaker 3>I get entertained and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertain.</v>

2891
02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:26.670
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2892
02:12:26.671 --> 02:12:30.420
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you go see someone kick ass,</v>

2893
02:12:30.690 --> 02:12:34.680
<v Speaker 3>right when you go see someone sing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking amazing and you're like,</v>

2894
02:12:34.681 --> 02:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>God that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2895
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.310
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that portal for expression,</v>

2896
02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:39.353
<v Speaker 3>like they've honed whatever message </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to go through that portal </v>

2897
02:12:42.661 --> 02:12:44.910
<v Speaker 3>and it reaches you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2898
02:12:44.911 --> 02:12:45.744
<v Speaker 3>it's the result of hundreds of not </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of hours of twisting and </v>

2899
02:12:49.681 --> 02:12:53.490
<v Speaker 3>turning and hammering and sculpting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>massaging and sanding,</v>

2900
02:12:53.491 --> 02:12:56.490
<v Speaker 3>and then you get to see it in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>finished form.</v>

2901
02:12:56.491 --> 02:12:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Like awe inspiring.</v>

2902
02:12:59.380 --> 02:13:02.650
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you go see a lot of music and as much</v>

2903
02:13:02.650 --> 02:13:03.460
<v Speaker 4>as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2904
02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:07.000
<v Speaker 4>I do it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I try to be entertained on purpose.</v>

2905
02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:08.163
<v Speaker 4>Are you saying that to me just now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that I need to work harder at </v>

2906
02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:14.770
<v Speaker 4>doing like it sounds stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I need to go and enjoy myself and be</v>

2907
02:13:14.771 --> 02:13:15.604
<v Speaker 4>entertained more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're absolutely right because every </v>

2908
02:13:16.751 --> 02:13:20.260
<v Speaker 4>time I do I walk away from it and I go </v>
<v Speaker 4>and be a better comedian.</v>

2909
02:13:20.810 --> 02:13:21.000
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

2910
02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:21.833
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2911
02:13:22.050 --> 02:13:24.870
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he told me that in the nineties and he's</v>

2912
02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:28.500
<v Speaker 3>just such a wise man and when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he told me that I remember thinking</v>

2913
02:13:28.501 --> 02:13:30.900
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God fucking totally completely makes</v>

2914
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.650
<v Speaker 2>and I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't do enough of that.</v>

2915
02:13:34.651 --> 02:13:35.484
<v Speaker 2>And also I think if you just do only </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy in your round comedy all the </v>

2916
02:13:38.011 --> 02:13:40.290
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't get too wrapped up in it.</v>

2917
02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:41.173
<v Speaker 2>You get to in your own head and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes away a little bit of your </v>

2918
02:13:44.491 --> 02:13:45.570
<v Speaker 2>ability to be free.</v>

2919
02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:46.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2920
02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:47.770
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2921
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:50.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't seek out comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen enough of it,</v>

2922
02:13:50.190 --> 02:13:53.530
<v Speaker 4>but movies and I went to a musical last </v>
<v Speaker 4>week at forced myself to go,</v>

2923
02:13:53.531 --> 02:13:55.930
<v Speaker 4>just watch people be great at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>

2924
02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:58.990
<v Speaker 4>I left feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good to do.</v>

2925
02:13:58.991 --> 02:14:01.810
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like to watch a movie.</v>

2926
02:14:01.811 --> 02:14:04.240
<v Speaker 4>I feel accomplished at the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I read a book,</v>

2927
02:14:05.130 --> 02:14:05.963
<v Speaker 4>that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where I've gotten to now if it's </v>

2928
02:14:07.511 --> 02:14:08.350
<v Speaker 4>a good movie,</v>

2929
02:14:08.770 --> 02:14:10.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see something that's like,</v>

2930
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:11.183
<v Speaker 2>like x mocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like one of my favorite movies of </v>

2931
02:14:12.761 --> 02:14:13.594
<v Speaker 2>all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember seeing that movie and </v>

2932
02:14:15.071 --> 02:14:16.790
<v Speaker 2>getting out of there going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>

2933
02:14:16.791 --> 02:14:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I want to make something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that when I leave I go,</v>

2934
02:14:20.770 --> 02:14:22.240
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was good.</v>

2935
02:14:22.330 --> 02:14:23.860
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They nailed it.</v>

2936
02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:27.610
<v Speaker 2>You know like when when something comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>together like that,</v>

2937
02:14:27.611 --> 02:14:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it gives you just a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of juice.</v>

2938
02:14:30.070 --> 02:14:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Music definitely does that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll play like a five.</v>

2939
02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:35.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a song that really cracks with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2940
02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:39.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll play that motherfucker on repeat in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the background while I write.</v>

2941
02:14:39.730 --> 02:14:40.563
<v Speaker 2>I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just one song just over and over </v>

2942
02:14:42.191 --> 02:14:46.570
<v Speaker 2>again and all the songs sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fades into the background and just gives</v>

2943
02:14:46.571 --> 02:14:47.404
<v Speaker 2>you energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you hear it like two or three </v>

2944
02:14:49.481 --> 02:14:50.314
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the words don't mean anything </v>

2945
02:14:51.011 --> 02:14:56.011
<v Speaker 2>anymore and then it just becomes like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking this power supply.</v>

2946
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Have you done the Goddamn comedy jam?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

2947
02:14:59.570 --> 02:15:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no interest.</v>

2948
02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill was trying to get me this thing the</v>

2949
02:15:03.311 --> 02:15:03.701
<v Speaker 2>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2950
02:15:03.701 --> 02:15:06.340
<v Speaker 2>you should do it because if I was him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Dean del Rey,</v>

2951
02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:10.570
<v Speaker 2>the what they do is they go to a venue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he played the forum last week.</v>

2952
02:15:10.590 --> 02:15:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they get there 2:00,</v>

2953
02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:17.080
<v Speaker 2>set up the drums and the guitar and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amps and then they play to no audience.</v>

2954
02:15:17.081 --> 02:15:19.990
<v Speaker 2>They jammed all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He played from two to 6:30.</v>

2955
02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Fat Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2956
02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:25.810
<v Speaker 2>They're playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having fun.</v>

2957
02:15:26.230 --> 02:15:28.440
<v Speaker 2>And then you go on later that night and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2958
02:15:28.450 --> 02:15:30.010
<v Speaker 2>you've just free.</v>

2959
02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:31.233
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I rented a karaoke room for my birthday </v>

2960
02:15:33.130 --> 02:15:33.963
<v Speaker 4>and I just sang Taylor swift songs the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole time and had my friends are held </v>

2961
02:15:37.421 --> 02:15:38.440
<v Speaker 4>captive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even,</v>

2962
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:41.230
<v Speaker 4>they got the same one or two songs but </v>
<v Speaker 4>we only had it for an hour because I had</v>

2963
02:15:41.231 --> 02:15:43.280
<v Speaker 4>to go do sets that night and I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>sang.</v>

2964
02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:46.600
<v Speaker 4>I just performed Taylor swift to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I want to be Taylor swift and it</v>

2965
02:15:46.601 --> 02:15:48.130
<v Speaker 4>was so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2966
02:15:48.131 --> 02:15:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I should do this more often by myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>just to sing,</v>

2967
02:15:51.041 --> 02:15:53.360
<v Speaker 4>to attract and retain and pop star for </v>
<v Speaker 4>an hour.</v>

2968
02:15:53.810 --> 02:15:55.450
<v Speaker 4>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that is such.</v>

2969
02:15:55.451 --> 02:15:56.950
<v Speaker 4>That's so cool that they did that.</v>

2970
02:15:57.070 --> 02:15:57.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think just having funds important </v>

2971
02:15:59.530 --> 02:16:01.440
<v Speaker 2>because doing things that are fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2972
02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:03.213
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you could definitely get too </v>

2973
02:16:05.711 --> 02:16:08.410
<v Speaker 2>distracted when you're not concentrating</v>
<v Speaker 2>on what you should be doing,</v>

2974
02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:09.453
<v Speaker 2>but I also think you could get too </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused where you lose track of what it </v>

2975
02:16:12.431 --> 02:16:13.350
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that?</v>

2976
02:16:13.450 --> 02:16:14.283
<v Speaker 4>What do I do for fun anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had to ask myself that and I'm </v>

2977
02:16:17.051 --> 02:16:20.050
<v Speaker 4>currently asking myself that and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did,</v>

2978
02:16:20.070 --> 02:16:23.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean running,</v>

2979
02:16:23.531 --> 02:16:26.650
<v Speaker 4>but does that count sometime?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love it every day.</v>

2980
02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:27.960
<v Speaker 4>It's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2981
02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:28.960
<v Speaker 4>that it's a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2982
02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:32.710
<v Speaker 5>Why wouldn't account because it's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2983
02:16:32.830 --> 02:16:34.690
<v Speaker 5>Because it's a thing that people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2984
02:16:34.691 --> 02:16:36.500
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kind of feel like it's a chore kind of</v>

2985
02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:38.380
<v Speaker 5>working on is something will look as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>chore.</v>

2986
02:16:38.381 --> 02:16:39.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It isn't any more.</v>

2987
02:16:39.641 --> 02:16:42.880
<v Speaker 5>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meditation might be a hobby,</v>

2988
02:16:42.881 --> 02:16:44.650
<v Speaker 5>but that's more of a practice that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>

2989
02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:47.050
<v Speaker 5>It's like brushing my teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I wouldn't say brushing my teeth as a</v>

2990
02:16:47.051 --> 02:16:48.960
<v Speaker 5>hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2991
02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:51.640
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I need more.</v>

2992
02:16:52.450 --> 02:16:56.950
<v Speaker 5>But you've always had hobbies has you've</v>
<v Speaker 5>always like martial arts.</v>

2993
02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:57.873
<v Speaker 5>Did that turn into a hobby for you as </v>
<v Speaker 5>soon as you started doing comedy or did </v>

2994
02:17:01.571 --> 02:17:03.710
<v Speaker 5>you have to like Kinda get back into it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>

2995
02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:06.180
<v Speaker 3>never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always been just,</v>

2996
02:17:06.510 --> 02:17:08.740
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like a big part of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy,</v>

2997
02:17:08.770 --> 02:17:11.740
<v Speaker 3>like who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never stopped because,</v>

2998
02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:15.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started working for the UFC in 1997.</v>

2999
02:17:15.490 --> 02:17:19.180
<v Speaker 3>That's when I started doing post fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>interviews and I was still very involved</v>

3000
02:17:19.181 --> 02:17:21.670
<v Speaker 3>in martial arts then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was just starting to learn</v>

3001
02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3002
02:17:22.890 --> 02:17:25.330
<v Speaker 3>so it was in involved in a new martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>art for me.</v>

3003
02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:26.740
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3004
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:27.663
<v Speaker 3>I've never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always done something and I've </v>

3005
02:17:29.741 --> 02:17:30.574
<v Speaker 3>never stopped paying attention to it or </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying it or learning new moves or </v>

3006
02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.340
<v Speaker 3>paying attention to the new trends or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3007
02:17:36.341 --> 02:17:37.174
<v Speaker 3>watching fights or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially things that I don't </v>

3008
02:17:40.751 --> 02:17:43.780
<v Speaker 3>necessarily practice as much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in that,</v>

3009
02:17:43.810 --> 02:17:46.030
<v Speaker 3>like watching different things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do.</v>

3010
02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:51.680
<v Speaker 5>What's the last hobby you picked up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bow Hunting and you're like,</v>

3011
02:17:52.310 --> 02:17:53.640
<v Speaker 5>you love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3012
02:17:53.730 --> 02:17:55.700
<v Speaker 3>What's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it's a,</v>

3013
02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:57.270
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to sound ridiculous,</v>

3014
02:17:57.271 --> 02:17:58.104
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a spiritual way to achieve your </v>

3015
02:18:02.611 --> 02:18:03.444
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get meat and spiritual sounds </v>

3016
02:18:06.811 --> 02:18:07.830
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous to people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3017
02:18:07.831 --> 02:18:12.540
<v Speaker 3>you're shooting an Arrow and an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be so finely tuned with your</v>

3018
02:18:12.541 --> 02:18:13.374
<v Speaker 3>senses in your skills and your abilities</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's so much consequence on the </v>

3019
02:18:16.891 --> 02:18:21.720
<v Speaker 3>line if you fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the pressure is so immense that</v>

3020
02:18:21.721 --> 02:18:25.470
<v Speaker 3>to me it's almost cleansing and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>intensity and that,</v>

3021
02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:28.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think doing difficult things makes,</v>

3022
02:18:28.321 --> 02:18:31.260
<v Speaker 3>doing other difficult things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3023
02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:33.600
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Easier,</v>

3024
02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:35.400
<v Speaker 3>but you're get better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get,</v>

3025
02:18:35.430 --> 02:18:36.263
<v Speaker 3>you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I think if you put yourself in a </v>

3026
02:18:38.251 --> 02:18:40.170
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this happens to certain comedians,</v>

3027
02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:42.533
<v Speaker 3>they get really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get really famous and then they </v>

3028
02:18:44.041 --> 02:18:46.380
<v Speaker 3>only perform for their crowd and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>get soft.</v>

3029
02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I think we've all seen them.</v>

3030
02:18:48.050 --> 02:18:49.830
<v Speaker 3>You've all seen them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start to suck.</v>

3031
02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:51.270
<v Speaker 3>They start to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3032
02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:52.133
<v Speaker 3>they're committing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their comedy gets soft and they become </v>

3033
02:18:55.650 --> 02:18:56.483
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like someone doing an impression </v>

3034
02:18:58.141 --> 02:18:59.820
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lose their edge.</v>

3035
02:19:00.210 --> 02:19:02.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the ways to keep your</v>
<v Speaker 3>edge is to always be scared.</v>

3036
02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.920
<v Speaker 3>So always do something that scares the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit out of you.</v>

3037
02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Always do something that's nerve </v>
<v Speaker 3>wracking.</v>

3038
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:07.703
<v Speaker 3>Always do something that's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's a martial art or it's </v>

3039
02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:10.913
<v Speaker 3>learning to dance or learning an </v>
<v Speaker 3>instrument or there's something that's </v>

3040
02:19:13.590 --> 02:19:17.280
<v Speaker 3>something hard for bill bird does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He flies helicopters,</v>

3041
02:19:17.281 --> 02:19:20.010
<v Speaker 3>he plays the drums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think things like that.</v>

3042
02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:21.353
<v Speaker 3>I think those are critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you need differently and it </v>

3043
02:19:23.731 --> 02:19:25.860
<v Speaker 3>almost like she'd be thought of as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a protocol,</v>

3044
02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cross that you're</v>

3045
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:28.933
<v Speaker 5>not just going to do your discipline but</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're also going to be involved in </v>

3046
02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.210
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3047
02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:39.230
<v Speaker 5>other disciplines that they add to what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing.</v>

3048
02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:42.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what you're hitting on.</v>

3049
02:19:42.261 --> 02:19:44.810
<v Speaker 5>Exactly why I said Yes to dancing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the stars,</v>

3050
02:19:44.811 --> 02:19:45.644
<v Speaker 5>which dancing is the thing that I'm know</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I'm worst at was because it's like </v>

3051
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:49.063
<v Speaker 5>that's the scariest thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if I do that then I can do so many </v>

3052
02:19:51.561 --> 02:19:53.750
<v Speaker 5>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm also scared of that.</v>

3053
02:19:53.751 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm not as scared of as dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's really weird.</v>

3054
02:19:57.531 --> 02:20:01.250
<v Speaker 5>But like I like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've talked a lot about sex.</v>

3055
02:20:01.251 --> 02:20:03.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm into like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to do weird sex things in my life</v>

3056
02:20:03.621 --> 02:20:05.900
<v Speaker 5>that I haven't done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I want to go to sex clubs,</v>

3057
02:20:05.901 --> 02:20:06.910
<v Speaker 5>I want to have threesomes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

3058
02:20:07.050 --> 02:20:11.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty vanilla.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though my sex club [inaudible] club</v>

3059
02:20:11.301 --> 02:20:14.990
<v Speaker 5>is the other people in the sex club </v>
<v Speaker 5>there also there.</v>

3060
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:16.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3061
02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:19.110
<v Speaker 5>that's not the problem for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weirdos chosen on your feet and chill.</v>

3062
02:20:19.170 --> 02:20:20.003
<v Speaker 5>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all very consensual and it's all </v>

3063
02:20:21.621 --> 02:20:23.290
<v Speaker 5>very.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just want to study that.</v>

3064
02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:24.643
<v Speaker 5>I know enough going in like I'm ready </v>
<v Speaker 5>for it now because I did dancing with </v>

3065
02:20:27.351 --> 02:20:28.040
<v Speaker 5>the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3066
02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:29.660
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could go have a threesome,</v>

3067
02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:30.533
<v Speaker 5>go to have a threesome 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was not before because I always </v>

3068
02:20:33.081 --> 02:20:33.914
<v Speaker 5>wanted to say I've done a threesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always wanted that experience to </v>

3069
02:20:35.631 --> 02:20:37.790
<v Speaker 5>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like an interesting thing.</v>

3070
02:20:37.980 --> 02:20:39.740
<v Speaker 5>What do you want to do a threesome with </v>
<v Speaker 5>two dudes?</v>

3071
02:20:39.860 --> 02:20:42.080
<v Speaker 5>Or do you want to do a threesome with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>girl guy?</v>

3072
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:43.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

3073
02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:44.353
<v Speaker 5>I would prefer for my own,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I would like more dudes than women </v>

3074
02:20:47.541 --> 02:20:50.570
<v Speaker 5>because I'm just not like making out in </v>
<v Speaker 5>front of you.</v>

3075
02:20:50.590 --> 02:20:52.460
<v Speaker 5>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has to be about me.</v>

3076
02:20:53.050 --> 02:20:55.970
<v Speaker 5>I have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to be mostly into me,</v>

3077
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.863
<v Speaker 5>but I can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind a little bit of gayness </v>

3078
02:20:59.181 --> 02:21:01.010
<v Speaker 5>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't.</v>

3079
02:21:01.011 --> 02:21:02.990
<v Speaker 5>I think we're all very fluid or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

3080
02:21:02.991 --> 02:21:04.250
<v Speaker 5>but good luck with that thought.</v>

3081
02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:10.370
<v Speaker 5>I am totally like if a guy has kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>gay,</v>

3082
02:21:10.371 --> 02:21:12.350
<v Speaker 5>but it's like enough end to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm fine with it.</v>

3083
02:21:13.460 --> 02:21:15.930
<v Speaker 5>If you have sex and in your life you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can.</v>

3084
02:21:15.980 --> 02:21:18.470
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't Rni cool?</v>

3085
02:21:18.471 --> 02:21:23.471
<v Speaker 5>How many dicks sexual if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>equal dicks to pussies.</v>

3086
02:21:24.531 --> 02:21:28.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't care as long as you're very into</v>
<v Speaker 5>my pussy while it's in front of you.</v>

3087
02:21:28.220 --> 02:21:29.960
<v Speaker 5>Is that rare though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems rare.</v>

3088
02:21:29.980 --> 02:21:31.670
<v Speaker 5>It seems like most girls would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>skeeved out.</v>

3089
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:33.140
<v Speaker 5>I think that is rare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3090
02:21:33.141 --> 02:21:35.060
<v Speaker 5>I think it's rare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think it shouldn't be.</v>

3091
02:21:35.061 --> 02:21:39.950
<v Speaker 5>I think that why shouldn't it be like </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever you liked.</v>

3092
02:21:40.420 --> 02:21:42.650
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're just in a totally </v>
<v Speaker 5>straight men,</v>

3093
02:21:42.651 --> 02:21:45.650
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as you're not homophobic,</v>

3094
02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:47.173
<v Speaker 5>bisexual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a phobic to the point where you judge </v>

3095
02:21:48.561 --> 02:21:51.350
<v Speaker 5>them and you hate them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you shouldn't have to like them.</v>

3096
02:21:51.470 --> 02:21:52.251
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3097
02:21:52.251 --> 02:21:54.800
<v Speaker 5>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that.</v>

3098
02:21:55.640 --> 02:22:00.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that liking Dick makes you</v>
<v Speaker 5>like pussy any less.</v>

3099
02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:02.330
<v Speaker 5>If you also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're bisexual,</v>

3100
02:22:02.331 --> 02:22:06.980
<v Speaker 5>it's not like you have an amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>liking other people's body parts to give</v>

3101
02:22:06.981 --> 02:22:09.470
<v Speaker 5>out and you're giving half of that to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dick's and half of that to put these.</v>

3102
02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:10.453
<v Speaker 5>I think you can like them both equally </v>
<v Speaker 5>and be as excited by them in front of </v>

3103
02:22:14.661 --> 02:22:16.160
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never met anyone like that.</v>

3104
02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:17.553
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've met bisexual men who like you like </v>

3105
02:22:19.610 --> 02:22:22.280
<v Speaker 5>them equally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really totally believe,</v>

3106
02:22:22.281 --> 02:22:25.860
<v Speaker 5>but it was just a good joke that I kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of believe that I,</v>

3107
02:22:25.940 --> 02:22:26.230
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3108
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:31.080
<v Speaker 2>I believe in gay women but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I believe in bisexual women,</v>

3109
02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:34.950
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's two types of gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

3110
02:22:34.980 --> 02:22:35.813
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily believe in bisexual </v>

3111
02:22:37.531 --> 02:22:40.890
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's gay men and then there's</v>

3112
02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:41.873
<v Speaker 2>really gullible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight dudes who get talked into blow </v>

3113
02:22:45.621 --> 02:22:46.500
<v Speaker 2>and crafty gay.</v>

3114
02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:53.840
<v Speaker 5>I think that those things do exist real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's definitely some gullible,</v>

3115
02:22:53.841 --> 02:22:56.030
<v Speaker 5>straight dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do think there are really bisexual</v>

3116
02:22:56.031 --> 02:22:57.350
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just as just a joke.</v>

3117
02:22:57.380 --> 02:22:59.220
<v Speaker 5>Of course that's just a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do.</v>

3118
02:22:59.230 --> 02:23:00.063
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those do exist like straight men who </v>

3119
02:23:03.231 --> 02:23:04.064
<v Speaker 5>have been and who will live with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>secret and I walked around Travolta's </v>

3120
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:08.030
<v Speaker 5>massage therapists</v>

3121
02:23:10.620 --> 02:23:15.620
<v Speaker 5>allegedly just to show you a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3122
02:23:17.430 --> 02:23:18.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

3123
02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:19.923
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that if I'm not like I don't </v>

3124
02:23:22.261 --> 02:23:24.330
<v Speaker 5>look at women and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to fuck her,</v>

3125
02:23:24.331 --> 02:23:28.200
<v Speaker 5>but if a girl was like super into me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could totally date someone and fall in</v>

3126
02:23:28.201 --> 02:23:30.780
<v Speaker 5>love with someone and like be in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>romantic,</v>

3127
02:23:30.781 --> 02:23:34.200
<v Speaker 5>sexual relationship with a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be just as gratifying as with</v>

3128
02:23:34.201 --> 02:23:36.820
<v Speaker 5>a man because you would have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have to be into me.</v>

3129
02:23:37.090 --> 02:23:39.210
<v Speaker 5>Like I think that's the thing that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>into.</v>

3130
02:23:39.211 --> 02:23:42.740
<v Speaker 5>Men that aren't in a certain way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain lesbian,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I like to be pursued.</v>

3149
02:24:40.390 --> 02:24:41.223

<v Speaker 2>This is why I can't settle down with a </v>

3150
02:24:43.351 --> 02:24:43.690
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3151

<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3154
02:24:51.790 --> 02:24:54.570
<v Speaker 5>If she was into me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if it was like if she was like,</v>

3155
02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:55.960

<v Speaker 5>then no,</v>

3156
02:24:55.961 --> 02:24:58.480

<v Speaker 5>I'm want this girl and I'm going to come</v>

3157
02:24:58.481 --> 02:24:59.740
<v Speaker 5>after her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3158
02:25:00.310 --> 02:25:03.100

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3159
02:25:03.101 --> 02:25:04.360
<v Speaker 5>not even close,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't make.</v>

3160
02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:06.750
<v Speaker 5>I make it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made out with most girl.</v>

3161
02:25:06.930 --> 02:25:10.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was like all my girlfriends </v>
<v Speaker 5>before I ever kissed a guy because I was</v>

3162
02:25:10.181 --> 02:25:11.014
<v Speaker 5>so scared of boys that I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first time I got drunk I made it </v>

3163
02:25:12.791 --> 02:25:15.220
<v Speaker 5>with all of my girlfriends because we </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to kiss boys,</v>

3164
02:25:15.221 --> 02:25:17.470
<v Speaker 5>but we didn't have boys around who liked</v>
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

3165
02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:20.110
<v Speaker 5>That's the difference in girls and boys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys don't ever do that.</v>

3166
02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:21.760
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just don't talk about it.</v>

3167
02:25:21.761 --> 02:25:23.630
<v Speaker 5>Show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh they do that they</v>

3168
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:25.600
<v Speaker 2>can make out with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

3169
02:25:25.630 --> 02:25:28.390
<v Speaker 2>How many guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had like 10 guys in a room,</v>

3170
02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:30.760
<v Speaker 2>how many guys do you think have made out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their buddies?</v>

3171
02:25:30.930 --> 02:25:31.763
<v Speaker 5>I'm not kidding you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think for at a 10 guys have done some </v>

3172
02:25:34.171 --> 02:25:35.004
<v Speaker 5>gay stuff early on before they had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>chance to do it with women straight men </v>

3173
02:25:38.161 --> 02:25:39.000
<v Speaker 5>who identify as straight.</v>

3174
02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:42.580
<v Speaker 2>You are dealing with a severely impaired</v>
<v Speaker 2>sample,</v>

3175
02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:44.553
<v Speaker 5>like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever semi homo energy you're </v>

3176

<v Speaker 5>these are all the Cymbalta dot put.</v>

3177
02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Poor John Travolta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a joke.</v>

3178
02:25:57.011 --> 02:25:58.120
<v Speaker 5>Just a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>John</v>

3179
02:25:59.190 --> 02:26:01.980
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the number.</v>

3180
02:26:02.190 --> 02:26:03.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it's probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the,</v>

3181
02:26:03.690 --> 02:26:04.523
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the standard accepted number of </v>

3182
02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:12.110
<v Speaker 2>homosexuals in a population?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it one on one time?</v>

3183
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:14.200
<v Speaker 2>So real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like $10.</v>

3184
02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:17.100
<v Speaker 2>It would be so many more to stop and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about that.</v>

3185

<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You could still say homo.</v>

3193
02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:37.760
<v Speaker 2>You can definitely still say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>respects us.</v>

3198
02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:50.970
<v Speaker 2>What are the numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What numbers of gays broken down by?</v>

3199
02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:51.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how many closeted gays see the </v>

3200
02:26:53.021 --> 02:26:56.610
<v Speaker 2>problem that I know so many closeted gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and there's steps.</v>

3201
02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:57.473
<v Speaker 2>There's several stages to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's closeted gays that are out to </v>

3202
02:27:00.181 --> 02:27:01.014
<v Speaker 2>their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I have friends that are closeted </v>

3203
02:27:02.221 --> 02:27:03.570
<v Speaker 2>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are out to their friends,</v>

3204
02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:06.150
<v Speaker 2>but they're in the business and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're closeted,</v>

3205
02:27:06.450 --> 02:27:08.700
<v Speaker 2>but then there's closeted even to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

3206
02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have one friend in particular.</v>

3207
02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:12.700
<v Speaker 2>You know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

3208
02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:13.933
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>

3209
02:27:15.350 --> 02:27:16.183
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a six percent of women or five </v>

3210
02:27:17.631 --> 02:27:21.410
<v Speaker 5>percent of women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five point one percent of them and three</v>

3211
02:27:21.411 --> 02:27:25.400
<v Speaker 5>point nine percent of men that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>identifying.</v>

3212
02:27:25.580 --> 02:27:28.410
<v Speaker 5>So then let's round up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3213
02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:29.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much will we round up?</v>

3214
02:27:31.130 --> 02:27:34.460
<v Speaker 5>I got around up at least a percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

3215
02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:37.250
<v Speaker 5>So we're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're dealing with a five percent,</v>

3216
02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:39.920
<v Speaker 5>I think five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're rounding up five percent,</v>

3217
02:27:39.921 --> 02:27:41.090
<v Speaker 5>then we're looking at 10 percent joe.</v>

3218
02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:42.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's three.</v>

3219
02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

3220
02:27:43.490 --> 02:27:46.640
<v Speaker 5>So five percent of women identify in </v>
<v Speaker 5>three point nine percent of men.</v>

3221
02:27:46.641 --> 02:27:49.100
<v Speaker 5>So if you're rounding up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're doubling that,</v>

3222
02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:49.993
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rounding up five percent or you're </v>

3223
02:27:51.591 --> 02:27:55.400
<v Speaker 5>running a five percent of the percent </v>
<v Speaker 5>were both back.</v>

3224
02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:59.180
<v Speaker 5>It's been clearly established.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

3225
02:27:59.181 --> 02:27:59.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3226
02:27:59.910 --> 02:28:01.870
<v Speaker 2>you're safe if they're saying it's three</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

3227
02:28:02.350 --> 02:28:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably five percent.</v>

3228
02:28:04.020 --> 02:28:04.591
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3229
02:28:04.591 --> 02:28:06.270
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're rounding up one percent?</v>

3230
02:28:06.271 --> 02:28:06.841
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3231
02:28:06.841 --> 02:28:09.290
<v Speaker 5>Then that's what St I think it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3232
02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:10.593
<v Speaker 2>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even more because there's such a </v>

3233
02:28:13.331 --> 02:28:14.164
<v Speaker 2>stigma whenever there's a stigma to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something is always going to be a bunch </v>

3234
02:28:16.961 --> 02:28:21.620
<v Speaker 2>of people that are just in denial of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just they're sad that they are,</v>

3235
02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:23.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that.</v>

3236
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:25.680
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy that I used to know and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3237
02:28:25.710 --> 02:28:30.710
<v Speaker 2>he was a comic and he used to have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most ruthlessly homophobic material.</v>

3238
02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:34.820
<v Speaker 2>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was awful.</v>

3239
02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:35.773
<v Speaker 2>Like he used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he used to God he to do these </v>

3240
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:41.610
<v Speaker 2>really mean nasty jokes about gay guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then uh,</v>

3241
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:45.020
<v Speaker 2>I moved out here to la and then somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

3242
02:28:45.021 --> 02:28:46.370
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you hear that guy's gay?</v>

3243
02:28:46.430 --> 02:28:47.263
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3244
02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:47.741
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3245
02:28:47.741 --> 02:28:49.190
<v Speaker 2>he finally came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3246
02:28:49.191 --> 02:28:51.690
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then uh,</v>

3247
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:52.543
<v Speaker 2>go back home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went back to Boston and then all of a </v>

3248
02:28:54.231 --> 02:28:56.680
<v Speaker 2>sudden he's like a big old queen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he just,</v>

3249
02:28:58.490 --> 02:29:00.950
<v Speaker 2>he was just keeping it in the poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>bastard,</v>

3250
02:29:01.370 --> 02:29:03.320
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that's,</v>

3251
02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:05.830
<v Speaker 4>it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guys,</v>

3252
02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:09.170
<v Speaker 4>when guys have acts where I watch on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage and they're just,</v>

3253
02:29:09.171 --> 02:29:13.730
<v Speaker 4>they hate women so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not so much hating gay people but</v>

3254
02:29:13.731 --> 02:29:17.380
<v Speaker 4>hating women in a way that they're like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of guys that um,</v>

3255
02:29:17.690 --> 02:29:18.650
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot.</v>

3256
02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:19.513
<v Speaker 4>I used to hate my vagina a lot because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>would hear guys talk about like beef </v>

3257
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:23.623
<v Speaker 4>curtains or voguing Derby's five for $5 </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I have like one of those vagina's </v>

3258
02:29:28.101 --> 02:29:30.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I have like more,</v>

3259
02:29:30.321 --> 02:29:32.150
<v Speaker 4>I have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like not like,</v>

3260
02:29:32.151 --> 02:29:34.280
<v Speaker 4>it's not like hanging down to my knees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I have a,</v>

3261
02:29:34.310 --> 02:29:36.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a pussy you see in porn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I like,</v>

3262
02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:37.273
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to like a perfect little </v>
<v Speaker 4>designer batch and I used to be really </v>

3263
02:29:40.191 --> 02:29:44.180
<v Speaker 4>insecure about it because I used to hear</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys say like too many lips down there,</v>

3264
02:29:44.181 --> 02:29:45.014
<v Speaker 4>it's gross and I think that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys that have that kind of mentality </v>

3265
02:29:49.881 --> 02:29:50.714
<v Speaker 4>about postseason and say that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>gay and I would be disgusted with pussy </v>

3266
02:29:54.111 --> 02:29:55.280
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have that like,</v>

3267
02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:56.870
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a Rosebud.</v>

3268
02:29:56.900 --> 02:30:01.900
<v Speaker 4>I would act that way too if I were a gay</v>
<v Speaker 4>man that if I had to do something that I</v>

3269
02:30:02.751 --> 02:30:04.640
<v Speaker 4>didn't really want to be doing by </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>

3270
02:30:04.641 --> 02:30:09.641
<v Speaker 4>So that's where I think that comes from </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes being.</v>

3271
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:11.023
<v Speaker 4>So when I see when I see a guy on stage </v>
<v Speaker 4>just say like really disgusting things </v>

3272
02:30:13.941 --> 02:30:15.600
<v Speaker 4>about women and just hate women and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>just like</v>

<v Speaker 2>bring up that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>2009 that my butt's special.</v>

3282

3283
02:30:33.301 --> 02:30:36.750
<v Speaker 2>he was the famous preacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Haggard,</v>

3284
02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:41.250

<v Speaker 2>having gay sex with prostitutes,</v>

3288
02:30:48.721 --> 02:30:50.790
<v Speaker 2>and we smoked crack together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was like,</v>

3289
02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:54.450
<v Speaker 2>but that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these guys,</v>

3290
02:30:54.451 --> 02:30:55.284
<v Speaker 2>they hate what they are and there's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of these anti gay politicians that </v>

3291
02:30:58.801 --> 02:31:00.930
<v Speaker 2>turned out to begin with so many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3292
02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:04.790
<v Speaker 4>It's almost a go the other way because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were just telling us who you are and</v>

3293
02:31:04.791 --> 02:31:07.140
<v Speaker 4>this is how many times they don't know.</v>

3294
02:31:07.220 --> 02:31:08.053
<v Speaker 2>I think the thing about people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>living a lie is that they're always </v>

3295
02:31:11.121 --> 02:31:15.350
<v Speaker 2>living in that lie and they can't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth because they're spouting.</v>

3296
02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:16.333
<v Speaker 2>I think if you lie all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're always not yourself in an </v>

3297
02:31:19.981 --> 02:31:20.814
<v Speaker 2>honest way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get super confused and you don't </v>

3298
02:31:23.281 --> 02:31:24.300
<v Speaker 2>know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

3299
02:31:25.020 --> 02:31:28.050
<v Speaker 4>comics who steal jokes can't write </v>
<v Speaker 4>jokes.</v>

3300
02:31:28.530 --> 02:31:31.440
<v Speaker 4>You ever noticed that there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comics is steal jokes that right.</v>

3301
02:31:31.441 --> 02:31:32.550
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3302
02:31:32.551 --> 02:31:35.220
<v Speaker 4>Amazing jokes and they don't do both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do both.</v>

3303
02:31:35.250 --> 02:31:37.260
<v Speaker 4>You do one or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3304
02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:38.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3305
02:31:38.300 --> 02:31:40.430
<v Speaker 2>because to be living in that lie like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3306
02:31:40.431 --> 02:31:42.170
<v Speaker 2>I thought of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my joke.</v>

3307
02:31:42.250 --> 02:31:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Like you're constantly justifying it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in your head like that.</v>

3308
02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Those comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're,</v>

3309
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:50.720
<v Speaker 2>when they get out it and they're forced </v>
<v Speaker 2>to write their own material,</v>

3310
02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:54.680
<v Speaker 2>they fucking suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They suck.</v>

3311
02:31:54.681 --> 02:31:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a joke,</v>

3312
02:31:56.421 --> 02:31:57.254
<v Speaker 2>like an open mic or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone who doesn't know how to do </v>

3313
02:31:58.971 --> 02:32:01.670
<v Speaker 2>comedy and they could have been doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy for 10,</v>

3314
02:32:01.671 --> 02:32:02.504
<v Speaker 2>15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll see their material and </v>

3315
02:32:05.661 --> 02:32:07.450
<v Speaker 2>compare it to the jokes they stole.</v>

3316
02:32:07.830 --> 02:32:10.080
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're so right.</v>

3317
02:32:10.081 --> 02:32:10.914
<v Speaker 4>To live a lie that to steel material,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't be actually a creative genius </v>

3318
02:32:18.211 --> 02:32:20.880
<v Speaker 4>person in another way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's a totally different?</v>

3319
02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:22.050
<v Speaker 4>It's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're different.</v>

3320
02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:24.390
<v Speaker 4>You're not a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a thief.</v>

3321
02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:26.490
<v Speaker 4>You're a magician.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're doing something,</v>

3322
02:32:26.491 --> 02:32:28.320
<v Speaker 4>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're an actor,</v>

3323
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:30.390
<v Speaker 4>you're a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a liar.</v>

3324
02:32:30.450 --> 02:32:32.390
<v Speaker 4>Not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the opposite.</v>

3325
02:32:32.540 --> 02:32:35.850
<v Speaker 4>It's so interesting to take that away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from them and then they'd.</v>

3326
02:32:36.330 --> 02:32:37.630
<v Speaker 4>We've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3327
02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:38.543
<v Speaker 2>So mentioning names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen it and when you see it it's </v>

3328
02:32:40.291 --> 02:32:43.560
<v Speaker 2>super obvious and they get terrible as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get older,</v>

3329
02:32:43.561 --> 02:32:45.450
<v Speaker 2>as they get further along in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

3330
02:32:45.451 --> 02:32:46.530
<v Speaker 2>instead of getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get</v>

3331
02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:48.670
<v Speaker 4>way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird when you're like,</v>

3332
02:32:49.030 --> 02:32:49.863
<v Speaker 4>we've all been accused of stealing </v>
<v Speaker 4>material because there's one tweet that </v>

3333
02:32:52.901 --> 02:32:54.760
<v Speaker 4>someone did and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's a similar thought.</v>

3334
02:32:54.761 --> 02:32:56.230
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's a parallel thought.</v>

3335
02:32:56.231 --> 02:32:57.064
<v Speaker 4>Idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like always parallel thought was a joke </v>

3336
02:32:58.961 --> 02:33:00.680
<v Speaker 4>theat when I've been accused of stealing</v>
<v Speaker 4>land.</v>

3337
02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:01.820
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

3338
02:33:02.530 --> 02:33:06.490
<v Speaker 4>So then all of my stuff is stolen </v>
<v Speaker 4>because why would I do that?</v>

3339
02:33:06.491 --> 02:33:07.324
<v Speaker 4>Why would it take that one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I really need that that badly that I </v>

3340
02:33:09.731 --> 02:33:10.564
<v Speaker 4>would steal it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then all this other stuff is </v>

3341
02:33:11.861 --> 02:33:14.080
<v Speaker 4>original.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then all of my stuff is probably stolen.</v>

3342
02:33:14.081 --> 02:33:14.520
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3343
02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:16.590
<v Speaker 2>And when that some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the weird things that you do find</v>

3344
02:33:16.591 --> 02:33:18.210
<v Speaker 2>out when you find out that someone's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thief,</v>

3345
02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:19.513
<v Speaker 2>then then someone starts going through </v>
<v Speaker 2>their material and comparing it to all </v>

3346
02:33:22.351 --> 02:33:24.810
<v Speaker 2>these other comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Holy Shit,</v>

3347
02:33:25.090 --> 02:33:27.300
<v Speaker 2>like look at all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my God.</v>

3348
02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:28.373
<v Speaker 2>And then look at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a bit from mad tv or that's a </v>

3349
02:33:30.361 --> 02:33:32.460
<v Speaker 2>cosby bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

3350
02:33:32.461 --> 02:33:35.490
<v Speaker 2>and then you see like most of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>

3351
02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:40.470
<v Speaker 2>they've somehow or another pilfered from</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else and just sort of repackaged</v>

3352
02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:42.670
<v Speaker 4>and that's a different kind of talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm almost like,</v>

3353
02:33:42.671 --> 02:33:43.504
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I respect that you were able to have </v>

3354
02:33:44.951 --> 02:33:47.740
<v Speaker 4>that room is going for that long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like a different kind of.</v>

3355
02:33:48.150 --> 02:33:52.060
<v Speaker 4>You're just a kid imagined that being </v>
<v Speaker 4>that much of a.</v>

3356
02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:56.770
<v Speaker 4>just waiting for someone to pull up that</v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube clip,</v>

3357
02:33:57.900 --> 02:34:00.810
<v Speaker 4>but they must not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they.</v>

3358
02:34:00.850 --> 02:34:03.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't possibly think about that.</v>

3359
02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:04.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I used to,</v>

3360
02:34:05.020 --> 02:34:08.370
<v Speaker 4>when I used to shoplift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was worried about getting caught.</v>

3361
02:34:08.410 --> 02:34:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3362
02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:10.013
<v Speaker 4>I was addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shoplift like noses while you're </v>

3363
02:34:11.620 --> 02:34:13.000
<v Speaker 4>anorexic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big Time.</v>

3364
02:34:13.060 --> 02:34:14.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3365
02:34:14.110 --> 02:34:16.120
<v Speaker 4>I was addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even want it to</v>

3366
02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:18.490
<v Speaker 2>keep yourself from about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were really skinny.</v>

3367
02:34:18.910 --> 02:34:19.743
<v Speaker 4>I was shoplifting to stop from thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how I was hungry or that I was </v>

3368
02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.990
<v Speaker 4>hated myself for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a high.</v>

3369
02:34:25.991 --> 02:34:29.200
<v Speaker 4>I would get like getting things and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would steal things that I didn't want,</v>

3370
02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:31.240
<v Speaker 4>that I didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I would never wear,</v>

3371
02:34:31.241 --> 02:34:33.670
<v Speaker 4>that I just wrote this because I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>write.</v>

3372
02:34:33.671 --> 02:34:36.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I always knew I would get caught and</v>

3373
02:34:36.761 --> 02:34:37.594
<v Speaker 4>I knew that I had to get caught to quit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wanted to keep going as long as I </v>

3374
02:34:41.021 --> 02:34:41.854
<v Speaker 4>could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I got caught and I never </v>

3375
02:34:42.911 --> 02:34:43.744
<v Speaker 4>shoplifted again after getting caught.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I remember getting caught and </v>

3376
02:34:47.021 --> 02:34:48.690
<v Speaker 4>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew I needed to get caught.</v>

3377
02:34:48.691 --> 02:34:50.320
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll never do it again.</v>

3378
02:34:50.321 --> 02:34:51.154
<v Speaker 4>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking tired of this shit and </v>

3379
02:34:52.270 --> 02:34:53.103
<v Speaker 4>screaming at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was like a couple of years older </v>

3380
02:34:54.401 --> 02:34:55.900
<v Speaker 4>than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an urban outfitters in Lawrence,</v>

3381
02:34:55.901 --> 02:34:59.710
<v Speaker 4>Kansas I was on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was on a break from work and I just went</v>

3382
02:34:59.711 --> 02:35:03.140
<v Speaker 4>over to do some light shoplifting and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>got caught on the way out.</v>

3383
02:35:03.630 --> 02:35:04.463
<v Speaker 4>The beeper went off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so embarrassing because she went </v>

3384
02:35:06.041 --> 02:35:07.210
<v Speaker 4>through my bag and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

3385
02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:08.920
<v Speaker 4>The shirt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is disgusting.</v>

3386
02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:14.920
<v Speaker 4>And she was like cooler than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so humiliating on every level and</v>

3387
02:35:14.970 --> 02:35:15.803
<v Speaker 4>every I was wearing my uniform from my </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant job where I worked next door </v>

3388
02:35:19.620 --> 02:35:20.453
<v Speaker 4>and it was urban outfitters that was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>only cool place to shop in my college </v>

3389
02:35:23.321 --> 02:35:24.820
<v Speaker 4>town and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your band for three years.</v>

3390
02:35:24.821 --> 02:35:26.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rest of college,</v>

3391
02:35:26.111 --> 02:35:26.944
<v Speaker 4>so I'd have to go in and disguises to </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually purchase things because that </v>

3392
02:35:29.411 --> 02:35:30.750
<v Speaker 4>was banned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

3393
02:35:30.751 --> 02:35:33.170
<v Speaker 4>I never shoplifted again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I remember guys,</v>

3394
02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:34.013
<v Speaker 4>this is where I would just like wear </v>
<v Speaker 4>sunglasses and a scarf and like Eddie </v>

3395
02:35:41.170 --> 02:35:46.170
<v Speaker 4>Murphy when he put on the fast shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3396
02:35:47.470 --> 02:35:48.161
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3397
02:35:48.161 --> 02:35:49.330
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

3398
02:35:49.450 --> 02:35:50.283
<v Speaker 4>but being someone who stole things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I knew that I would get caught and </v>

3399
02:35:53.291 --> 02:35:55.690
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to get caught because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible life.</v>

3400
02:35:56.050 --> 02:35:57.340
<v Speaker 4>Do you think these people want to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>caught?</v>

3401
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:58.900
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3402
02:35:58.901 --> 02:36:02.230
<v Speaker 2>I think they just want to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get addicted to killing.</v>

3403
02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:04.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happens,</v>

3404
02:36:04.061 --> 02:36:04.894
<v Speaker 2>like when someone gets caught stealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>or we're just talking about this the </v>

3405
02:36:06.941 --> 02:36:07.774
<v Speaker 2>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that when someone gets caught </v>

3406
02:36:10.661 --> 02:36:12.360
<v Speaker 2>stealing and then you call them on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

3407
02:36:12.370 --> 02:36:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I won't do that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he's here.</v>

3408
02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:14.673
<v Speaker 2>Hey you here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just did that your bit at the laugh </v>

3409
02:36:15.551 --> 02:36:18.400
<v Speaker 2>factory like that motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he would stop doing it.</v>

3410
02:36:19.250 --> 02:36:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Aren't they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get addicted to killing you.</v>

3411
02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:22.953
<v Speaker 2>Addicted to it.</v>

3412
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:25.190
<v Speaker 4>Imagine being having that taken away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from you.</v>

3413
02:36:25.340 --> 02:36:28.910
<v Speaker 4>That's what I keep thinking about with </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedians that have had,</v>

3414
02:36:28.911 --> 02:36:31.400
<v Speaker 4>did not go on stage anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 4>something happens.</v>

3415
02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:34.460
<v Speaker 4>Obviously the me too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stuff that's happened.</v>

3416
02:36:35.170 --> 02:36:36.440
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a part of me that's like,</v>

3417
02:36:36.441 --> 02:36:40.190
<v Speaker 4>what if someone said I couldn't go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage for a year.</v>

3418
02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:43.310
<v Speaker 4>Like I was banned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Richard's.</v>

3419
02:36:43.730 --> 02:36:44.930
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like forever,</v>

3420
02:36:45.390 --> 02:36:46.223
<v Speaker 4>like he's basically been forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I do if I couldn't do </v>

3421
02:36:49.221 --> 02:36:52.610
<v Speaker 4>standup at night and like I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>jerking off in front of people.</v>

3422
02:36:52.611 --> 02:36:53.444
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not at risk of losing that right </v>

3423
02:36:54.951 --> 02:36:56.930
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I don't think he thought he was</v>

3424
02:36:56.931 --> 02:36:57.764
<v Speaker 4>at risk of losing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think like it was just a matter </v>

3425
02:37:00.981 --> 02:37:01.791
<v Speaker 4>of time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3426
02:37:01.791 --> 02:37:05.360
<v Speaker 4>I know that maybe towards the end when </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything was kind of blowing up around</v>

3427
02:37:05.361 --> 02:37:07.970
<v Speaker 4>him with other men that he was maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>worried about it,</v>

3428
02:37:07.971 --> 02:37:09.680
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think he wouldn't?</v>

3429
02:37:09.681 --> 02:37:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Years of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope this doesn't come back?</v>

3430
02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3431
02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3432
02:37:15.831 --> 02:37:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Because it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3433
02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:18.673
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's because that's one that you </v>

3434
02:37:20.151 --> 02:37:21.590
<v Speaker 2>liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you describe that?</v>

3435
02:37:21.980 --> 02:37:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

3436
02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:25.130
<v Speaker 2>how do you defend that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you really can't.</v>

3437
02:37:27.410 --> 02:37:28.960
<v Speaker 2>It's just a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3438
02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:34.190
<v Speaker 2>it's not the worst one because I'm into </v>
<v Speaker 2>jerking off in front of women.</v>

3439
02:37:34.191 --> 02:37:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my thing.</v>

3440
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:38.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm listening to Jim Norton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim Norton should to.</v>

3441
02:37:38.370 --> 02:37:40.880
<v Speaker 2>This is attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should've done a press conference and</v>

3442
02:37:40.881 --> 02:37:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Jim Norton should've been as attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have fucking clear that thing</v>

3443
02:37:43.431 --> 02:37:46.730
<v Speaker 2>up in a heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim Norton was said,</v>

3444
02:37:46.731 --> 02:37:48.560
<v Speaker 2>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I jerk off in front of women as well,</v>

3445
02:37:48.561 --> 02:37:52.120
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of times they have dicks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm into.</v>

3446
02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3447
02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:59.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Norton is so free because he talks about</v>

3448
02:37:59.810 --> 02:38:00.360
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3449
02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:04.250
<v Speaker 2>he hose into trannies and like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his thing and you know,</v>

3450
02:38:04.251 --> 02:38:06.140
<v Speaker 2>a lot of training anymore by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's right,</v>

3451
02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:07.033
<v Speaker 2>that's right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he can still say it because he's </v>

3452
02:38:08.481 --> 02:38:11.510
<v Speaker 2>into them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It no one even calls him out on it.</v>

3453
02:38:11.511 --> 02:38:13.700
<v Speaker 2>They just let it slide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

3454
02:38:13.701 --> 02:38:14.534
<v Speaker 2>He really does.</v>

3455
02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:16.880
<v Speaker 4>He does so much for the community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3456
02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:18.113
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's talked about liking having </v>

3457
02:38:20.291 --> 02:38:21.124
<v Speaker 4>people shit on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he puts down a tarp before women </v>

3458
02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:26.630
<v Speaker 4>come over sometimes like seven women </v>
<v Speaker 4>piston his mouth.</v>

3459
02:38:26.730 --> 02:38:29.170
<v Speaker 4>Remember reading his books like early on</v>
<v Speaker 4>in college and being like,</v>

3460
02:38:29.171 --> 02:38:32.470
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe this man talking so </v>
<v Speaker 4>openly about this,</v>

3461
02:38:32.471 --> 02:38:34.390
<v Speaker 4>but thank God for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing.</v>

3462
02:38:34.391 --> 02:38:36.400
<v Speaker 4>He's not worried about anything coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>back to haunt him.</v>

3463
02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:38.570
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so brave because the fact that he's</v>

3464
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:41.990
<v Speaker 2>so ruthlessly honest like that and loved</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>

3465
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:42.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3466
02:38:42.930 --> 02:38:43.763
<v Speaker 4>storm rain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>him talking about blowing another kid </v>

3467
02:38:45.301 --> 02:38:47.220
<v Speaker 4>underneath the porch as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

3468
02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:48.493
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people now talk openly about being </v>

3469
02:38:49.770 --> 02:38:50.603
<v Speaker 4>molested or having weird sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences with boys early on and it's </v>

3470
02:38:53.971 --> 02:38:54.804
<v Speaker 4>more of like an okay thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When Jim Norton was doing it back in </v>

3471
02:38:56.671 --> 02:39:01.410
<v Speaker 4>2002,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one talked about that shit and it was</v>

3472
02:39:01.411 --> 02:39:02.720
<v Speaker 4>an joked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3473
02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:03.833
<v Speaker 4>And was beloved by ONA fans for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was someone that early on I </v>

3474
02:39:09.031 --> 02:39:10.070
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3475
02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:11.873
<v Speaker 4>this is different to me and I love it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I want to be on the other side of </v>

3476
02:39:14.401 --> 02:39:16.890
<v Speaker 4>this where I can talk about all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff too and not,</v>

3477
02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:17.783
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting because there's so </v>

3478
02:39:19.111 --> 02:39:20.790
<v Speaker 4>much freedom and being able to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3479
02:39:20.791 --> 02:39:22.380
<v Speaker 4>I blew a kid under a porch when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>

3480
02:39:22.381 --> 02:39:24.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing wrong with I was a kid.</v>

3481
02:39:24.610 --> 02:39:26.340
<v Speaker 4>And being yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being yourself,</v>

3482
02:39:26.341 --> 02:39:27.420
<v Speaker 4>being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3483
02:39:27.450 --> 02:39:30.940
<v Speaker 2>And you find that when you are yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as you're not hurting anybody,</v>

3484
02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:32.820
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you are yourself,</v>

3485
02:39:32.850 --> 02:39:34.980
<v Speaker 2>you find people actually love you for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3486
02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3487
02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:40.470
<v Speaker 2>And they love the fact that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>so brave that you can talk about all the</v>

3488
02:39:40.471 --> 02:39:41.304
<v Speaker 2>different things that you love that </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people might be scared of </v>

3489
02:39:42.631 --> 02:39:44.010
<v Speaker 2>admitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3490
02:39:44.650 --> 02:39:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his love of transgender women.</v>

3491
02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:49.253
<v Speaker 2>Like think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if that came out about someone </v>

3492
02:39:51.211 --> 02:39:54.450
<v Speaker 2>who's trying to hide that it would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>devastating to them.</v>

3493
02:39:54.660 --> 02:39:55.493
<v Speaker 2>But to him it's just like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll just talk about it openly and </v>

3494
02:39:58.290 --> 02:40:00.110
<v Speaker 2>laugh about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3495
02:40:00.450 --> 02:40:03.210
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a point of contention at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

3496
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:07.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not something he's ashamed of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just who he is.</v>

3497
02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:10.640
<v Speaker 4>I know I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've him and there.</v>

3498
02:40:10.641 --> 02:40:13.500
<v Speaker 4>There's several other people though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just to.</v>

3499
02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:14.513
<v Speaker 4>I remember Sarah Silverman or hearing </v>
<v Speaker 4>her talk about being a bed wetter and I </v>

3500
02:40:17.541 --> 02:40:18.374
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was like my biggest shame for so </v>

3501
02:40:19.531 --> 02:40:20.970
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I was just like,</v>

3502
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.541
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3503
02:40:21.541 --> 02:40:22.950
<v Speaker 4>well then that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's okay.</v>

3504
02:40:23.270 --> 02:40:24.103
<v Speaker 4>Just that all it took was one cool woman</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say she did something embarrassing </v>

3505
02:40:27.481 --> 02:40:28.350
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3506
02:40:28.351 --> 02:40:29.970
<v Speaker 4>it's acceptable now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I can talk about it.</v>

3507
02:40:30.250 --> 02:40:33.330
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why I talk about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like anal sex.</v>

3508
02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:36.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that it's a cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that like I,</v>

3509
02:40:37.290 --> 02:40:38.123
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to put that out there as </v>
<v Speaker 4>like nih naughty and don't you want to </v>

3510
02:40:40.441 --> 02:40:41.274
<v Speaker 4>fuck me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not my intention with it </v>

3511
02:40:42.421 --> 02:40:44.580
<v Speaker 4>even though people will put that on me </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes,</v>

3512
02:40:44.970 --> 02:40:45.803
<v Speaker 4>but it's because you should try it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels good and I want to put it out </v>

3513
02:40:50.521 --> 02:40:51.740
<v Speaker 4>there to women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>

3514
02:40:52.140 --> 02:40:52.973
<v Speaker 4>it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I want to just more people to </v>

3515
02:40:54.721 --> 02:40:55.554
<v Speaker 4>experience it and not be scared of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is gross and it is scary and it </v>

3516
02:40:59.671 --> 02:41:00.504
<v Speaker 4>is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I talk openly about it because </v>

3517
02:41:03.151 --> 02:41:06.390
<v Speaker 4>I hope that if you are a girl that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>into it,</v>

3518
02:41:06.391 --> 02:41:09.810
<v Speaker 4>you're not ashamed of being into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if you're a guy that's into it,</v>

3519
02:41:09.811 --> 02:41:12.900
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a threesome with.</v>

3520
02:41:13.270 --> 02:41:15.570
<v Speaker 4>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will listen.</v>

3521
02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:17.173
<v Speaker 5>Do you think you would be excited about </v>
<v Speaker 5>a dude but fucking a dude who's fucking </v>

3522
02:41:19.551 --> 02:41:20.384
<v Speaker 5>you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like have you got some sort of human </v>

3523
02:41:21.771 --> 02:41:22.700
<v Speaker 5>centipede thing going?</v>

3524
02:41:23.260 --> 02:41:24.093
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no because I don't think he could focus </v>

3525
02:41:25.951 --> 02:41:26.784
<v Speaker 4>on me if he was</v>

3526
02:41:26.980 --> 02:41:30.800
<v Speaker 5>penetrated himself and it would be more </v>
<v Speaker 5>about taking it for a year in the past.</v>

3527
02:41:30.801 --> 02:41:35.801
<v Speaker 5>I think that is so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's because of you might be the</v>

3528
02:41:36.711 --> 02:41:38.030
<v Speaker 5>Dick in my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>

3529
02:41:39.080 --> 02:41:40.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't stand that.</v>

3530
02:41:40.540 --> 02:41:42.610
<v Speaker 5>I would need more focus on trading on </v>
<v Speaker 5>you</v>

3531
02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:53.640
<v Speaker 4>two thrusts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One back be concentrating on both.</v>

3532
02:41:55.341 --> 02:41:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Focused on me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to be the focal focal point.</v>

3533
02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:00.800
<v Speaker 4>If I'm going to be in one of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

3534
02:42:00.801 --> 02:42:05.120
<v Speaker 4>which I think you can arrange that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>

3535
02:42:05.210 --> 02:42:07.250
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arranging what people are going to focus</v>

3536
02:42:07.251 --> 02:42:08.120
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3537
02:42:08.121 --> 02:42:09.410
<v Speaker 4>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

3538
02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:10.273
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing that I was fearing of </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing a threesome is like what if I get </v>

3539
02:42:12.741 --> 02:42:13.574
<v Speaker 4>in it and like what if I had to go down </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a girl and like I'm doing it and I'm </v>

3540
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:20.290
<v Speaker 4>like it's bad pussy or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or it's like,</v>

3541
02:42:20.291 --> 02:42:22.010
<v Speaker 4>what a bad pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's bad pussy?</v>

3542
02:42:24.950 --> 02:42:26.900
<v Speaker 4>What if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if I just don't like pussy,</v>

3543
02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:29.450
<v Speaker 4>but what's possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I did dancing with the stars,</v>

3544
02:42:29.451 --> 02:42:30.284
<v Speaker 4>I really came out of it being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm ready to eat some pussy now because </v>

3545
02:42:32.540 --> 02:42:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I faced my fear of dancing in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>millions of people,</v>

3546
02:42:36.261 --> 02:42:39.260
<v Speaker 4>which is like the scariest thing I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever done on live TV.</v>

3547
02:42:39.261 --> 02:42:40.940
<v Speaker 4>Anything go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now I'm like,</v>

3548
02:42:40.941 --> 02:42:43.700
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why am I so scared of a threesome?</v>

3549
02:42:43.730 --> 02:42:45.510
<v Speaker 4>Because I think my thing about </v>
<v Speaker 4>threesomes,</v>

3550
02:42:45.530 --> 02:42:47.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get into it and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be like,</v>

3551
02:42:47.330 --> 02:42:50.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be here and that I'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>still have to go through with it.</v>

3552
02:42:50.061 --> 02:42:51.200
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3553
02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:54.560
<v Speaker 4>it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I like,</v>

3554
02:42:54.620 --> 02:42:55.453
<v Speaker 4>I changed my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I do all the time now with </v>

3555
02:42:57.381 --> 02:42:58.214
<v Speaker 4>hookups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that as a woman we are so </v>

3556
02:43:00.231 --> 02:43:03.230
<v Speaker 4>conditioned to think that men have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>come at the end of it.</v>

3557
02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:06.140
<v Speaker 4>There's the thing called blue balls and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like in that if you've,</v>

3558
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:07.063
<v Speaker 4>if you've made out with a guy and gotten</v>
<v Speaker 4>a loan with a guy that and you've </v>

3559
02:43:09.141 --> 02:43:10.340
<v Speaker 4>decided to hook up with a guy and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3560
02:43:10.370 --> 02:43:11.203
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting naked a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to go through the whole thing </v>

3561
02:43:13.361 --> 02:43:15.510
<v Speaker 4>until he orgasms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that is what,</v>

3562
02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:19.510
<v Speaker 4>that is what we are sold because men put</v>
<v Speaker 4>that pressure on you.</v>

3563
02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:20.860
<v Speaker 4>It's not men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's women,</v>

3564
02:43:20.861 --> 02:43:21.694
<v Speaker 4>it's magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's TV tell you you have to make them </v>

3565
02:43:23.681 --> 02:43:24.514
<v Speaker 4>come with like 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways to blow his mind and to do this </v>

3566
02:43:28.691 --> 02:43:29.471
<v Speaker 4>with a feather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3567
02:43:29.471 --> 02:43:32.530
<v Speaker 4>that kind of keep coming up with those </v>
<v Speaker 4>lists.</v>

3568
02:43:32.860 --> 02:43:36.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all the same episodes.</v>

3569
02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:37.593
<v Speaker 4>How many issues have been made?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's the same thing with </v>

3570
02:43:40.970 --> 02:43:43.780
<v Speaker 4>workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last ab workout you'll ever need.</v>

3571
02:43:43.810 --> 02:43:44.643
<v Speaker 4>Well then you better not tell me another</v>
<v Speaker 4>one because you just said this is the </v>

3572
02:43:46.391 --> 02:43:47.224
<v Speaker 4>last one on eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though you'll say that next year </v>

3573
02:43:48.461 --> 02:43:51.040
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's endless things,</v>

3574
02:43:51.041 --> 02:43:52.810
<v Speaker 4>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my new thing is now,</v>

3575
02:43:52.811 --> 02:43:55.570
<v Speaker 4>like when I used to be so scared of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hooking up with guys because I was like,</v>

3576
02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:57.760
<v Speaker 4>if I agree to kiss a guy alone in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>room,</v>

3577
02:43:58.060 --> 02:43:58.893
<v Speaker 4>then I'm probably agreeing to have sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>with him and then I don't even want to </v>

3578
02:44:01.871 --> 02:44:04.600
<v Speaker 4>put myself in that scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I just didn't even kiss boys.</v>

3579
02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:06.330
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that a man doesn't have</v>

3580
02:44:06.331 --> 02:44:07.051
<v Speaker 2>to fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3581
02:44:07.051 --> 02:44:09.660
<v Speaker 2>If a man is alone with a woman and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>making out with her in a room,</v>

3582
02:44:09.661 --> 02:44:10.770
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3583
02:44:10.771 --> 02:44:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I have to satisfy her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to be mad at me.</v>

3584
02:44:13.210 --> 02:44:13.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>

3585
02:44:13.870 --> 02:44:16.120
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not even about like it is,</v>

3586
02:44:16.121 --> 02:44:16.954
<v Speaker 4>it is exactly what you're saying because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to backtrack and say it's not </v>

3587
02:44:18.821 --> 02:44:20.830
<v Speaker 4>about like he's going to force me to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have sex with them.</v>

3588
02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:21.673
<v Speaker 4>It's like he's going to be mad or </v>
<v Speaker 4>disappointed in me and he's just going </v>

3589
02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:25.753
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just going to be mad and I don't </v>

3590
02:44:27.371 --> 02:44:28.910
<v Speaker 4>want a guy to be mad at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3591
02:44:29.050 --> 02:44:33.850
<v Speaker 4>And so I always had an unpleasant </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience for the other person.</v>

3592
02:44:33.970 --> 02:44:35.200
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just don't,</v>

3593
02:44:35.230 --> 02:44:36.063
<v Speaker 4>you just want to be nice and </v>
<v Speaker 4>accommodating and that's what I felt </v>

3594
02:44:40.841 --> 02:44:42.850
<v Speaker 4>always felt like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

3595
02:44:43.150 --> 02:44:45.730
<v Speaker 4>if I make out with a guy I have so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>times in my life,</v>

3596
02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:48.100
<v Speaker 4>been making out with a guy and been said</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my head like,</v>

3597
02:44:49.210 --> 02:44:51.070
<v Speaker 4>what's the least second day to make this</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy come?</v>

3598
02:44:51.310 --> 02:44:52.143
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3599
02:44:52.420 --> 02:44:55.210
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what can I do that is gonna make me feel</v>

3600
02:44:55.211 --> 02:44:58.570
<v Speaker 4>the least bad about myself or like </v>
<v Speaker 4>something I,</v>

3601
02:44:59.050 --> 02:45:01.480
<v Speaker 4>what do I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what can I do to make what,</v>

3602
02:45:01.481 --> 02:45:02.314
<v Speaker 4>how can this guy get off and I can leave</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling good about myself and like I </v>

3603
02:45:05.531 --> 02:45:07.300
<v Speaker 4>didn't do something I didn't want to do.</v>

3604
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Which a lot of times you do something </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to do.</v>

3605
02:45:10.270 --> 02:45:11.860
<v Speaker 4>It has happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

3606
02:45:11.861 --> 02:45:14.050
<v Speaker 4>I call rape on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I look back on that guy and go,</v>

3607
02:45:14.051 --> 02:45:16.900
<v Speaker 4>he raped me know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that the thought I was into</v>

3608
02:45:16.901 --> 02:45:17.020
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3609
02:45:17.020 --> 02:45:18.980
<v Speaker 2>do you think the solution to that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

3610
02:45:19.060 --> 02:45:21.670
<v Speaker 2>way longer before you get intimate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone?</v>

3611
02:45:21.700 --> 02:45:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Like get to know them really well?</v>

3612
02:45:23.470 --> 02:45:24.303
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the solution is educating women </v>

3613
02:45:25.841 --> 02:45:26.674
<v Speaker 4>and telling them that it's okay if a guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't come and it is okay the second </v>

3614
02:45:29.381 --> 02:45:30.770
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm not really feeling this,</v>

3615
02:45:30.980 --> 02:45:31.813
<v Speaker 2>that's the case for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean personally for you to not be </v>

3616
02:45:34.121 --> 02:45:34.954
<v Speaker 2>in that situation like no a guy really </v>
<v Speaker 2>well before you're intimate with them </v>

3617
02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:39.063
<v Speaker 2>because isn't that part of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a lot of times people get intimate </v>

3618
02:45:42.101 --> 02:45:44.020
<v Speaker 2>with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if alcohol's involved.</v>

3619
02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:45.033
<v Speaker 2>You get intimate with someone before you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know them and then you may be in the </v>

3620
02:45:47.921 --> 02:45:51.790
<v Speaker 2>situation and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not what I wanted and now I feel</v>

3621
02:45:51.791 --> 02:45:53.170
<v Speaker 2>gross and I want to get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3622
02:45:53.570 --> 02:45:54.560
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3623
02:45:54.561 --> 02:45:59.330
<v Speaker 4>that's part of it and to not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it really is though as a woman,</v>

3624
02:45:59.331 --> 02:46:01.610
<v Speaker 4>just being able to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

3625
02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:03.560
<v Speaker 4>make the situation uncomfortable by </v>
<v Speaker 4>being like,</v>

3626
02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:04.453
<v Speaker 4>I'm done here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sorry I'm not going to come and </v>

3627
02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:10.730
<v Speaker 4>either so neither are you and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll do this again sometime.</v>

3628
02:46:11.480 --> 02:46:12.313
<v Speaker 4>I've done that recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the lady who's in charge of the </v>

3629
02:46:14.091 --> 02:46:16.190
<v Speaker 4>audition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you Nikki.</v>

3630
02:46:17.180 --> 02:46:19.490
<v Speaker 4>I really reached that point with myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

3631
02:46:19.491 --> 02:46:22.920
<v Speaker 4>We're a much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did that to someone recently.</v>

3632
02:46:23.630 --> 02:46:25.760
<v Speaker 4>I was literally hooking up with them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3633
02:46:27.340 --> 02:46:29.330
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is it.</v>

3634
02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:31.400
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>

3635
02:46:31.700 --> 02:46:35.660
<v Speaker 4>but here's my thing is like more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate being this woman that,</v>

3636
02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:40.230
<v Speaker 4>but if I'm going to get anything across </v>
<v Speaker 4>to your listeners because it's.</v>

3637
02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:43.760
<v Speaker 4>I sound like a hack eighties female </v>
<v Speaker 4>comic right now,</v>

3638
02:46:43.761 --> 02:46:47.450
<v Speaker 4>but like more foreplay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I never thought I'd be a woman that</v>

3639
02:46:47.451 --> 02:46:50.390
<v Speaker 4>says that just like we need.</v>

3640
02:46:50.930 --> 02:46:53.060
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't always be convinced to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>sex with you.</v>

3641
02:46:53.061 --> 02:46:55.940
<v Speaker 4>If I'm willing to make out with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I am what I am.</v>

3642
02:46:55.941 --> 02:46:58.730
<v Speaker 4>Somewhere in the realm of things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not giving this to every woman,</v>

3643
02:46:58.731 --> 02:46:59.564
<v Speaker 4>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am willing to take a good decade from </v>

3644
02:47:02.721 --> 02:47:04.250
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have that opportunity.</v>

3645
02:47:04.251 --> 02:47:06.200
<v Speaker 4>If I'm making out with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3646
02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:09.110
<v Speaker 4>Convince me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turned me on.</v>

3647
02:47:10.130 --> 02:47:12.830
<v Speaker 4>Don't just try to stick your Dick in me </v>
<v Speaker 4>right after making out.</v>

3648
02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:14.660
<v Speaker 4>That's not going to be the way to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

3649
02:47:14.730 --> 02:47:19.580
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I think I know where she says </v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3650
02:47:19.700 --> 02:47:21.870
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're panicked,</v>

3651
02:47:22.130 --> 02:47:23.390
<v Speaker 4>but before she says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3652
02:47:23.391 --> 02:47:24.224
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have all this time to get me to say </v>

3653
02:47:25.881 --> 02:47:26.714
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people are panickers just we need </v>

3654
02:47:29.181 --> 02:47:30.014
<v Speaker 4>to bring back dry humping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is so hot to the point where I'm so </v>

3655
02:47:34.161 --> 02:47:39.161
<v Speaker 4>revved up that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need it like girls or I want.</v>

3656
02:47:39.530 --> 02:47:43.130
<v Speaker 4>Because you know what it feels like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get fingered when you're not turned on.</v>

3657
02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:45.860
<v Speaker 4>It feels like the way it feels when a </v>
<v Speaker 4>girl,</v>

3658
02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:48.350
<v Speaker 4>when a girl grabs your deck and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not hard,</v>

3659
02:47:48.351 --> 02:47:49.660
<v Speaker 4>you know that feeling where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

3660
02:47:49.661 --> 02:47:49.941
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3661
02:47:49.941 --> 02:47:50.691
<v Speaker 4>too early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't do it.</v>

3662
02:47:50.691 --> 02:47:52.220
<v Speaker 4>Don't do it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just get.</v>

3663
02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:55.040
<v Speaker 4>That's the way it feels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When a guy goes to finger you and you're</v>

3664
02:47:55.041 --> 02:47:56.030
<v Speaker 4>not wet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

3665
02:47:56.060 --> 02:47:58.520
<v Speaker 4>I could get there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now I'm not going to because now I'm</v>

3666
02:47:58.521 --> 02:47:59.354
<v Speaker 4>insecure that I'm not wet and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I just want to cut this thing so </v>

3667
02:48:02.900 --> 02:48:03.733
<v Speaker 4>don't touch us there until we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please like until we take your hand and </v>

3668
02:48:07.251 --> 02:48:08.370
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

3669
02:48:09.050 --> 02:48:09.883
<v Speaker 4>if you get us there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you will by doing all the other </v>

3670
02:48:11.901 --> 02:48:15.470
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dry humping over the pants stuff,</v>

3671
02:48:16.090 --> 02:48:19.220
<v Speaker 4>a feeling.</v>

3674
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:27.380
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like,</v>

3675
02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:28.273
<v Speaker 4>you feel that I feel like you're onstage</v>
<v Speaker 4>in front of a large audience telling </v>

3676
02:48:30.891 --> 02:48:32.240
<v Speaker 4>people how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I want to give like sex ted talks </v>

3678
02:48:34.791 --> 02:48:39.320

<v Speaker 4>women to have more sex and enjoy it more</v>

3679
02:48:39.321 --> 02:48:41.270
