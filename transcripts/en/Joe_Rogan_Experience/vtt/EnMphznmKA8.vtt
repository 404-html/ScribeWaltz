<v Speaker 1>The general experience and David Allan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coe,</v>

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>did you know we did our song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our set and then he played and he was</v>

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.400
<v Speaker 1>onstage and he performed a song my mom</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote called storms never last,</v>

4
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>so my mom's over on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and we were talking to.</v>

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>My mom were watching it and he's singing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with his wife and stuff.</v>

6
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>The next night I'm opening up for him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes on stage and he goes,</v>

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jessi colter was right in the front row</v>

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>when I sang the song and my wife and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was crying and like I'm sitting there</v>

9
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was here and she was not crying.</v>

10
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>She was standing on the front row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom just kilder road.</v>

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>This song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>storms,</v>

13
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>everlast teasing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's his character.</v>

14
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>That's who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I'm saying here with like I'm as</v>

15
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>forgiving about him lying to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience because that is what he's doing</v>

16
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>at the moment.</v>

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>It's his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could sit there and go,</v>

18
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're lying.</v>

19
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take you in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk.</v>

20
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell this audience tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

21
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>He's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a piece of shit.</v>

22
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Fuck him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that because it's</v>

23
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>David Alcoa is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just did it on the show,</v>

24
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:13.641
<v Speaker 1>which is a much larger audience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of pieces of shit.</v>

25
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>why would I do that to him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's like,</v>

27
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like,</v>

28
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Times that I met Alex at times I've</v>

29
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>been around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>

30
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>his Gig is this and he got called out</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a specific thing.</v>

31
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It involved the lives of children and</v>

32
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>everything that I understand that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

33
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not at all sympathizing for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>family or for him versus those families,</v>

34
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that like at the moment</v>

35
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>everything is so hot with this and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of exhausting and it's the</v>

36
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Internet is the reason for it and in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>

37
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>because I think that like all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>years that have come along,</v>

38
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>the mass amount of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>migrated to social media,</v>

39
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.160
<v Speaker 1>the way that the integrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations happened,</v>

40
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>the way that that stuff ends up on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>news now,</v>

41
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>like aol chat rooms in fucking 1998.</v>

42
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>That shit did not end up on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were not listening to those.</v>

43
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:08.551
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

44
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best to get the closest you could</v>

45
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 1>get to fucking tv was to catch a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator when,</v>

46
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>when you were on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time,</v>

47
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I feel like at this point in time</v>

48
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.670
<v Speaker 1>people need again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not those families,</v>

49
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>their lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine,</v>

50
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's their thing.</v>

51
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just feel like people need to</v>

52
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:31.701
<v Speaker 1>lighten up a little bit in the sense of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that the social media thing</v>

53
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:36.711
<v Speaker 1>is very hazardous and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's faith in all of it,</v>

54
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fake news and it doesn't have to do</v>

55
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>with Russian bots and all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that like Alex Jones is a</v>

56
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:49.341
<v Speaker 1>casualty because he's always been that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by another really odd</v>

57
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>comic Davidson?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah's story is he always told me when</v>

58
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you're on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't read from your current book.</v>

59
00:02:56.611 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Always read from the next four pieces to</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of road testing the stories</v>

60
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 2>and finding out which ones work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>should go into the next book.</v>

61
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 2>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was telling this story about being in</v>

62
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:08.494
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.010
<v Speaker 2>this forensic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

64
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 2>a laboratory isn't an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an autopsy was taking place.</v>

65
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.500
<v Speaker 2>And this autopsy table was adjacent to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this huge indoor window that separated</v>

66
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:25.531
<v Speaker 2>the autopsy suite from this lunch room</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the lunch room where the rest of</v>

67
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:26.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

68
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 2>the forensic staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all eating their lunches.</v>

69
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 2>They all had tuna sandwiches and cans of</v>
<v Speaker 2>coke and barbecued potato chips.</v>

70
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 2>And they were watching through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>window as this absolutely perfect.</v>

71
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Twelve year old boy was being autopsied</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just hours before at this kid,</v>

72
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 2>like two hours before this kid had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>riding his bicycle,</v>

73
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 2>he'd fallen over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd hit his head on the curb.</v>

74
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.140
<v Speaker 2>And now two hours later he was dead and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead without almost a scratch on him.</v>

75
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Just this perfect naked dead 12 year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy on the autopsy table.</v>

76
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 2>And as he that the technicians eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lunch,</v>

77
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 2>watching it through a window that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch as the,</v>

78
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:18.211
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the pathologist in sizes around the</v>

79
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>top of the kid's face at the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>forehead,</v>

80
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 2>the hairline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then peels the face down,</v>

81
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.490
<v Speaker 2>like peeling an orange peels the entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>face off of the skull of this little boy</v>

82
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 2>and leaves the face around the neck like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mask,</v>

83
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 2>like a rubber mask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this exposes this liver colored dark</v>

84
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 2>red musculature of the child's</v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying face.</v>

85
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 2>And this one guy watching it with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouthful of tuna sandwich,</v>

86
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 2>he points this out and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see that?</v>

87
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 2>That there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the color of red that I want to</v>

88
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 2>paint our rec room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

89
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 2>and once the data has told that story in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of 600 people,</v>

90
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 2>it was dead silent and you could hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>people weeping.</v>

91
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.430
<v Speaker 2>People were crying and they were hating</v>
<v Speaker 2>David's sit doris in that moment and so</v>

92
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I had to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I laughed really loud,</v>

93
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:21.901
<v Speaker 2>like a donkey and it was amazing how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred in that auditorium swung from</v>

94
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 2>hating David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who they did not want to hate to hating</v>

95
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:32.071
<v Speaker 2>this jackass over here who was actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing and so I threw myself on the</v>

96
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 2>sword for David and that story never</v>
<v Speaker 2>went in any book and like I said,</v>

97
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 2>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And philosophers like arguing and</v>

98
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 2>debating the meaning of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

99
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 2>it's harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are using the word.</v>

100
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 2>That's the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I concede that.</v>

101
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see why I don't call myself an</v>

102
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why you can look up the dictionary</v>

103
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>definition of atheist and a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>applies</v>

104
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is the definition of atheist in</v>

105
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 3>practice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what leading atheists do and it's</v>

106
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 3>their conduct and it's their behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they say,</v>

107
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

108
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 3>it's their attitudes that is what an</v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist is today because they're the</v>

109
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:18.371
<v Speaker 3>most visible exemplars of that word and</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of their conduct either don't agree</v>

110
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 3>with or simply don't engage in what</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you agree with?</v>

111
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't debate religious people and tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>them they're idiots.</v>

112
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't work.</v>

113
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 3>It's missing whether or not it works and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just not.</v>

114
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not in me to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't purge myself of words that have</v>

115
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 3>religious foundations in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I once in my facebook,</v>

116
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend going up in orbit to</v>
<v Speaker 3>repair the Hubble Telescope,</v>

117
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 3>one of the astronauts and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

118
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 3>Godspeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I gave the astronauts name</v>

119
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 3>people wrote in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the threads that I thought you were</v>

120
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 3>an atheist.</v>

121
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 3>How could you say Godspeed and atheist</v>
<v Speaker 3>got angry with me and I said,</v>

122
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

123
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 3>this phrase is deeply historical in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>space program.</v>

124
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.480
<v Speaker 3>When John Glenn was launched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the headline was Godspeed John Glenn.</v>

125
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Every mission where we send human beings</v>
<v Speaker 3>into space.</v>

126
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere there is that reference in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>NASA fancy word means I'll tell you,</v>

127
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.070
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please do</v>

128
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.221
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

129
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:22.030
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get to that in just one minute.</v>

130
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 3>The atheist who are arguing that I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>using Godspeed as a phrase,</v>

131
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.240
<v Speaker 3>they all have used the phrase goodbye</v>
<v Speaker 3>having to see you later.</v>

132
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that word come from?</v>

133
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 3>It's from God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be With you.</v>

134
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a contraction of those three words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

135
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 3>and why would you say this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would say this to someone leaving</v>

136
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 3>the city wall where it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

137
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Back when you had city states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to,</v>

138
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a good God.</v>

139
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.780
<v Speaker 3>Be With you to bring protection for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Between one city.</v>

140
00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:59.890
<v Speaker 3>One of the people who's asking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asked me to have pictures of my other</v>

141
00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:02.740
<v Speaker 3>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're actually both passed away now.</v>

142
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.030
<v Speaker 3>I had to put them both down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both your bull mastiffs stiff in the</v>

143
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:09.660
<v Speaker 3>English of the English bulldog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She mixed.</v>

144
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.960
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

145
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 3>they were both 13 years old and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnny couldn't walk anymore.</v>

146
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.590
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really rough</v>

147
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.060
<v Speaker 3>the last few days of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

148
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:25.983
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

149
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.220
<v Speaker 3>try to bring them in for dinner and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would try to bring them in,</v>

150
00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:34.870
<v Speaker 3>he literally couldn't make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a small yard where he was at,</v>

151
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.610
<v Speaker 3>but we're talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

152
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.110
<v Speaker 3>15 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't make it 15 yards to the</v>

153
00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:44.320
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He will take a couple steps and his body</v>

154
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:48.820
<v Speaker 3>would shake and he'd take a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>steps and he was just sleeping all day</v>

155
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.110
<v Speaker 3>and he was also having a really hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>time shifting and he would occasionally</v>

156
00:08:53.111 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 3>shit in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he couldn't hold his bowels and he</v>

157
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:57.970
<v Speaker 3>couldn't go outside when he wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at,</v>

158
00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 3>you'd see them trying.</v>

159
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.920
<v Speaker 3>But his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his body was so old from massive 13</v>

160
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 3>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his crazy old,</v>

161
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.760
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of them die at like eight or</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine and he was 13 and he was sweet,</v>

162
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 3>sweet dog up until the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he just,</v>

163
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

164
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.450
<v Speaker 3>he was suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

165
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 3>it was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard when you know them when</v>

166
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:27.111
<v Speaker 3>they're a puppy and then 10 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're kind of the same and they're</v>

167
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 3>not men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gone.</v>

168
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think about that with Marshall</v>

169
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:35.070
<v Speaker 3>because he's only a year and a half and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so full of life and he's so fun.</v>

170
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 3>He's so silly and playful and happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

171
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a day where</v>

172
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Marshall's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this old old,</v>

173
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 3>old dog and I'm going to have to put him</v>
<v Speaker 3>down to,</v>

174
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was depressing and the other one,</v>

175
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 3>brutus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Shiba Inu English bulldog mix.</v>

176
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.880
<v Speaker 3>He was better than Johnny for a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

177
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Still I've known for the last two years</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't have much time left.</v>

178
00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

179
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.800
<v Speaker 3>they were both struggling hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Brutus took a real hard turn over</v>

180
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 3>the last few months where he wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even come in.</v>

181
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.860
<v Speaker 3>Like I tried to get them to come in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

182
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.990
<v Speaker 3>you want to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to put a little food in front of</v>

183
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:16.340
<v Speaker 3>his face and he would try to stand up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his legs would be shaken.</v>

184
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:20.320
<v Speaker 3>And it's just so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

185
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.190
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard watching them fade away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

186
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:25.980
<v Speaker 3>And then also watching them suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

187
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 3>a lot the last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last days where you have to decide</v>

188
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:30.444
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

189
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.490
<v Speaker 3>me and my wife had to have conversations</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

190
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.520
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to do something like this,</v>

191
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 3>like one day we're going to come home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a dead dog.</v>

192
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 3>And it's not like they're having a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

193
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a horrible suffering slow</v>

194
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 3>demise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So did you have someone come to the</v>

195
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 3>house?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did you take them?</v>

196
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was rough,</v>

197
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:51.840
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's rough.</v>

198
00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.320
<v Speaker 4>Just ask yourself what problems do I</v>
<v Speaker 4>have right now?</v>

199
00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:01.150
<v Speaker 4>But genuinely like problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer may not always be zero,</v>

200
00:11:01.151 --> 00:11:06.151
<v Speaker 4>but it's usually surprisingly small when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think about the immediate,</v>

201
00:11:06.551 --> 00:11:11.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just the base level of Maslow's</v>

202
00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

203
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.580
<v Speaker 4>Like if that's taken care of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>usually it's like,</v>

204
00:11:15.581 --> 00:11:18.520
<v Speaker 4>oh I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are things that are ongoing things</v>

205
00:11:18.521 --> 00:11:20.720
<v Speaker 4>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like things that you could define as</v>

206
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:26.060
<v Speaker 4>a problem and then just kind of staying</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that space of like,</v>

207
00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a control issue.</v>

208
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.690
<v Speaker 4>Like what's a real issue where there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like immediacy,</v>

209
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

210
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:36.760
<v Speaker 4>and when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when there are real problems,</v>

211
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times you,</v>

212
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.180
<v Speaker 4>you handle it well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like instinctually the things like a lot</v>

213
00:11:43.181 --> 00:11:48.181
<v Speaker 4>of times people get caught in those</v>
<v Speaker 4>intense situations like,</v>

214
00:11:48.701 --> 00:11:50.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they can handle like real problems.</v>

215
00:11:50.981 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 4>It's the anticipation of problems and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the anticipation of solutions that bass.</v>

216
00:11:55.691 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 4>What drives you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

217
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 4>Very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

218
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.230
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

219
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They also sort of enlightened you to the</v>

220
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 4>fact that most of the time your problems</v>
<v Speaker 4>are bullshit.</v>

221
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you break your leg,</v>

222
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.153
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

223
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.470
<v Speaker 4>that's an immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

224
00:12:10.471 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

225
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.970
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

226
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 4>And so just staying in the space of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

227
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

228
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in a control center.</v>

229
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.450
<v Speaker 4>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
