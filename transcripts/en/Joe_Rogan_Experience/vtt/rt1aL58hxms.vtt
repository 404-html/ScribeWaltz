<v Speaker 3>hit and then it moved to helping the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the evacuation centers.</v>

47
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 3>And then now it's people that are placed</v>
<v Speaker 3>in temporary housing that don't have any</v>

57
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Were you in Japan when the quake hit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Japan.</v>

58
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Overfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

60
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Just kept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference was it didn't usually </v>

61
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes last few seconds and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

62
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquake finish,</v>

63
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 3>but this one gets kept going and it kept</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting stronger and we're like,</v>

64
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.900
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on the phone with a friend at the </v>

65
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.900
<v Speaker 3>time in Hawaii and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

66
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 3>this is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then shit started falling in my house,</v>

67
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.500
<v Speaker 3>in the cupboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

68
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.830
<v Speaker 3>my pictures on my walls and the old </v>
<v Speaker 3>these ships.</v>

69
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 3>This is something I never felt before.</v>

70
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.380
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of fucked up because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos of the tsunami was,</v>

71
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.260
<v Speaker 4>we've all known about tsunamis for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

72
00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:20.060
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if not thousands of years.</v>

73
00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:22.520
<v Speaker 4>People have been aware that that happens</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the ocean goes out,</v>

74
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.130
<v Speaker 4>that you gotta get the fuck out of there</v>
<v Speaker 4>because something's going on,</v>

75
00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:30.131
<v Speaker 4>but we've never really seen it on video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've never captured it the way it was </v>

76
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:34.751
<v Speaker 4>captured in Fukushima,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's scarier when you saw those cars </v>

77
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 4>rolling over the ground just going with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ocean and taken out houses and </v>

78
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.180
<v Speaker 4>houses floating that were on fire and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like mother nature.</v>

79
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 3>They had it going over the rice fields </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had like these white of </v>

80
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 3>greenhouses like on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to realize those greenhouses </v>

81
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 3>like 12 feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaises blake,</v>

82
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 3>little toys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was a screening rate over </v>

83
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was unbelievable.</v>

84
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.080
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing to watch the physical </v>

85
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.280
<v Speaker 4>devastation that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that mother nature can bring it.</v>

86
00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's shit like that,</v>

87
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 4>which happens every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

88
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 4>several hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just,</v>

89
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 4>we hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hadn't documented it like this,</v>

90
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:14.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't have video cameras the last </v>

91
00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:16.591
<v Speaker 4>time it happened like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was amazing though to me was not </v>

92
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 4>just that something like this would </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

93
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 4>but how orderly everybody responded in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan,</v>

94
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 4>like you saw the lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was when they were waiting for</v>

95
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 4>eight or when they were helping each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

96
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 4>It was really pretty amazing.</v>

97
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little different than the rest of</v>

98
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 3>the room.</v>

99
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.450
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>when they don't have food.</v>

101
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:39.181
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the difference is just the </v>

102
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 4>culture of Japan</v>

103
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.810
<v Speaker 3>mannerisms and the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the type of,</v>

<v Speaker 3>rounds within the Japanese guys.</v>

112

116
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:10.740
<v Speaker 3>When we started talking to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked back and you're still repeating</v>

117
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:15.741
<v Speaker 3>the technique over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I go into something in the </v>

<v Speaker 3>states as I'll do it,</v>

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.650
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep going,</v>

121
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:20.300
<v Speaker 3>keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

122
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.680
<v Speaker 3>doesn't tell us a little different.</v>

123
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.530
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of lazy bitches in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

124
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 4>We got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got it too.</v>

125
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.350
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's fucking soft over here.</v>

126
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.110
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to find like super disciplined</v>
<v Speaker 4>people over here.</v>

127
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.160
<v Speaker 4>It is a fascinating thing when you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>that an entire country has a different </v>

128
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:41.420
<v Speaker 4>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

129
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.250
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've only been to Japan once,</v>

130
00:05:43.251 --> 00:05:45.620
<v Speaker 4>but it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really interesting.</v>

131
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.360
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was after the,</v>

132
00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:52.361
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earthquake and it was after </v>

133
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:52.361
<v Speaker 4>Fukushima and everything's won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The UFC was there.</v>

134
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:52.490
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

135
00:05:52.491 --> 00:05:55.100
<v Speaker 4>it's a totally different world man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty neat.</v>

136
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.400
<v Speaker 4>It's very neat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

137
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 4>how long you been over there now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty two years.</v>

138
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you were born and raised in America.</v>

139
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 4>And why and what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

140
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 4>what led you to go to Japan</v>

141
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.620
<v Speaker 3>for extra racquetball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racquetball,</v>

142
00:06:07.621 --> 00:06:09.010
<v Speaker 3>play record with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

143
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.610
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't even fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just training because we had a lot</v>

144
00:06:11.611 --> 00:06:14.490
<v Speaker 3>of street fights in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was just training just so I didn't</v>

145
00:06:14.491 --> 00:06:18.150
<v Speaker 3>get my ass kicked in Hawaii pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we were Japanese and back in the</v>

146
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.710
<v Speaker 3>day being big was being strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me being an oriental,</v>

147
00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:25.530
<v Speaker 3>we're smaller so we just had to really </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight for our stuff.</v>

148
00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:28.710
<v Speaker 3>We either had to give her a lunch money </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday or fight for it.</v>

149
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii is one of the last places where </v>
<v Speaker 4>street fights go down on a fucking </v>

150
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 4>regular basis to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of crazy man.</v>

151
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 4>Why is one of the rare places that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>left on this earth where things are </v>

152
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.010
<v Speaker 4>decided with knuckles?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

153
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.230
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's real.</v>

154
00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of places where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

155
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of gun violence and violence </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sure so Hawaii hasn't shared </v>

156
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.871
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of fucking fights </v>

157
00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:59.391
<v Speaker 4>going on in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing when you think about an </v>

158
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:02.691
<v Speaker 4>island in the middle of Pacific and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>many great fighters that come out of </v>

<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's both you and your brother,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the line.</v>

164
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 4>like it has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain style of fighter that </v>

165
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 4>comes out.</v>

166
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.690
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii,</v>

169
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii like you don't see like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stick and move technical,</v>

170
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:31.380
<v Speaker 4>like trying to get out of there and stay</v>
<v Speaker 4>safe.</v>

171
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.480
<v Speaker 4>Let Me Bond Jackie style,</v>

173
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.660
<v Speaker 4>Dudes are going after it in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

174
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.440
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You and your brother,</v>

175
00:07:40.441 --> 00:07:43.980
<v Speaker 4>I was there for your UFC debut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was here when you fought Royce Alger.</v>

176
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was the backstage interviewer.</v>

177
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure I interviewed you </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you got injured in the fight and</v>

178
00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:52.050
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't continue to interview.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

179
00:07:52.051 --> 00:07:52.560
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

180
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:53.820
<v Speaker 4>Let me back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

181
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:54.720
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 97,</v>

182
00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 4>was that [inaudible] 98.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 97.</v>

183
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

184
00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I remember,</v>

185
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.590
<v Speaker 3>I remember it is fueled a little weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't think it was hurt.</v>

186
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:08.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened to you and that went </v>

187
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:08.760
<v Speaker 3>backstage and I felt that I got hit so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just wanted to check on.</v>

188
00:08:08.761 --> 00:08:11.320
<v Speaker 3>My nose was bleeding and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>basic rule,</v>

189
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:16.321
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't blow your nose for nose that I </v>

190
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:19.770
<v Speaker 3>felt the air come through and push.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost like felt like it was going to </v>

191
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:19.770
<v Speaker 3>push it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

192
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What just happened</v>

193
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.300
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for functional know when,</v>

194
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 4>when a guy in a fight gets a broken </v>
<v Speaker 4>nose,</v>

195
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:29.201
<v Speaker 4>they always tell you don't blow your </v>
<v Speaker 4>nose because it creates some sort of </v>

196
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 4>pressure built up</v>

197
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.210
<v Speaker 3>thin plate of bone plate across the face</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

198
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.540
<v Speaker 3>That's like paper thin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if there's any hole in it actually </v>

199
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 3>holds in the air and turn your face </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty Freaky,</v>

200
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:39.710
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

201
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.320
<v Speaker 3>And if you have a little crack there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you blow your nose,</v>

202
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.550
<v Speaker 3>it'll just push the Arrow through that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty much it for fighting,</v>

203
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:48.460
<v Speaker 3>especially for um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxers boxers.</v>

204
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.720
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a basic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real simple,</v>

205
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 3>basic root and blow your nose after your</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

206
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to do though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

207
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 4>Because he can't breathe out of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>nose and bloods</v>

208
00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:01.810
<v Speaker 3>kind of just check if I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those is bleeding and they just blew in </v>

209
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:01.810
<v Speaker 3>this</v>

210
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:01.810
<v Speaker 4>poof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

211
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.620
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a fight where Royce Alger was.</v>

212
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.640
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was when Mark Coleman was on top </v>

213
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 4>and wrestlers like the high end Jessalyn</v>
<v Speaker 4>was Kevin Jackson and randleman was in </v>

214
00:09:13.421 --> 00:09:18.421
<v Speaker 4>his prime and it was a lot of like high </v>
<v Speaker 4>end wrestlers were just starting to </v>

215
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:18.421
<v Speaker 4>enter into the game.</v>

216
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 3>The wrestlers were the ones that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>beating everybody here.</v>

217
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.450
<v Speaker 3>But I remember you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you caught him in the arm born.</v>

218
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 3>I think he broke his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it pop.</v>

219
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.790
<v Speaker 3>But I remember you put your bras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

220
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.870
<v Speaker 3>they were yelling something at you guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>and as you were leaving your brothers </v>

221
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.171

222
00:09:39.171 --> 00:09:41.340

223
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 3>between you guys.</v>

224
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

226
00:09:41.921 --> 00:09:44.470
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was interesting because you uh,</v>

227
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in arm barn him,</v>

228
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.440
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't just an upset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was an upset,</v>

229
00:09:50.441 --> 00:09:54.100
<v Speaker 4>but it was also like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like the world got to know you.</v>

230
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.770
<v Speaker 4>That was like your first big fight on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the big stage.</v>

231
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.680
<v Speaker 3>It was Kinda good that they just blew </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

232
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:03.681
<v Speaker 3>Royce kind of helped me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made a big deal at them because </v>

233
00:10:03.681 --> 00:10:03.681
<v Speaker 3>they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well here's a</v>

234
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 4>accessible amateur wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's probably going to be the next big </v>

235
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.150
<v Speaker 4>thing in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it turned out that you were,</v>

236
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.760
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was recording everything.</v>

237
00:10:12.761 --> 00:10:13.780
<v Speaker 3>It was about race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>

238
00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:14.260
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>

239
00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:14.950
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even when,</v>

240
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 3>the way the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when I fought randy the same </v>

241
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 3>type of question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

242
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.650
<v Speaker 3>are you going to be okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of thing.</v>

243
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Like it gets mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grabbed that.</v>

244
00:10:25.871 --> 00:10:27.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm breaking like any other arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

245
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Did you find out randy with pants on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you wearing the tights and you </v>

246
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.890
<v Speaker 3>caught Randi with an arm as well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

247
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.010
<v Speaker 3>So almost the exact same time too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like right after,</v>

248
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.690
<v Speaker 3>because randy was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC,</v>

249
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.950
<v Speaker 3>he won the heavyweight tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

250
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.400
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't expect that to him to,</v>

251
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.350
<v Speaker 3>for him to make that mistake.</v>

252
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fought Tony Halma and then he fought </v>

253
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:52.720
<v Speaker 4>that big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big black kid who had a lot of promise.</v>

254
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.800
<v Speaker 4>But after that randy five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we never really saw him again.</v>

255
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.170
<v Speaker 4>A kid was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>

256
00:10:57.171 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

257
00:10:57.661 --> 00:11:02.661
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did one thing in that fight that we </v>

258
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:03.560
<v Speaker 4>hadn't seen up until that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like in the Royce Alger fight.</v>

259
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.590
<v Speaker 4>It was like we were just starting to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>accustomed to what techniques were </v>

260
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.850
<v Speaker 4>really effective in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we'd seen hoists.</v>

261
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.810
<v Speaker 4>Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

262
00:11:11.811 --> 00:11:16.811
<v Speaker 4>Armbar a few guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we hadn't seen them take on one of </v>

263
00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:21.221
<v Speaker 4>these big name wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just starting to enter into the </v>

264
00:11:21.221 --> 00:11:24.401
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you caught him with that arm </v>

265
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:24.401
<v Speaker 4>bar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a,</v>

266
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:24.401
<v Speaker 4>that was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like,</v>

267
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:24.401
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

268
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:29.261
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't just be a wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta you gotTa know what the fuck </v>

269
00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:29.261
<v Speaker 4>is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it got throws his legs up,</v>

270
00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:29.261
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

271
00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Speaker 3>especially with the hype them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still is the volunteer.</v>

272
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Well then after that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next thing that you showed those in </v>

273
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.151
<v Speaker 3>the randy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were kicking the shit out his legs </v>

274
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:43.090
<v Speaker 3>from like the scoop position man from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom.</v>

275
00:11:43.091 --> 00:11:48.091
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You landed some fucking hard leg kicks </v>

276
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:48.160
<v Speaker 3>from that position when you don't see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that very often,</v>

277
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this,</v>

278
00:11:50.031 --> 00:11:50.450
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

279
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I just have this style that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive matter where you're at.</v>

280
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

281
00:11:55.421 --> 00:12:00.421
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't really checking the leg </v>

282
00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:00.421
<v Speaker 3>tape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

283
00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:03.450
<v Speaker 3>we literally put a whole roll of tape on</v>
<v Speaker 3>my legs and it was pretty much 80 </v>

284
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.991
<v Speaker 3>percent of the front and they let it go </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was like a little castle all </v>

285
00:12:06.991 --> 00:12:10.891
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shit hurt a little more than it </v>

286
00:12:10.891 --> 00:12:10.891
<v Speaker 3>looked.</v>

287
00:12:10.891 --> 00:12:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the part of the game though.</v>

288
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

291
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:23.360

<v Speaker 4>the bottom of the bottom of the ropes </v>

<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a different world.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Thirty minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a 30 minute rounds.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and essentially no rules.</v>

309
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember when Gary Goodridge </v>
<v Speaker 4>reached into the Pedro's pants and </v>

310
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.151
<v Speaker 4>grabbed his dick and balls?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He grabbed his dick and balls and </v>

311
00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:23.150
<v Speaker 4>squeezes Dick and balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

312
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.890
<v Speaker 4>That was like a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is,</v>

316
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.620
<v Speaker 5>No eye gouging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody couldn't grab the ropes and no </v>

317
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:33.620
<v Speaker 5>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think was the,</v>

318
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.570
<v Speaker 5>everything that's growing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Strategy,</v>

319

<v Speaker 5>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>headbutts elbows.</v>

320
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.330

<v Speaker 4>A lot of oil.</v>

321
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.750
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

322
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 5>I actually called them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>went in the back end,</v>

323
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:47.911
<v Speaker 5>was taped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We actually took the oil away from </v>

324
00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:47.911
<v Speaker 5>vandelay and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Got My,</v>

327
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.280
<v Speaker 5>grabbed it from oil it up enough for it </v>
<v Speaker 5>to kickboxing.</v>

328
00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.940
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny how the world has changed </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

329
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.730
<v Speaker 4>I remember I was there for your first </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight in the UFC to.</v>

330
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.870
<v Speaker 4>You fought that knowingly knowing </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hernandez and he was a boxer and I </v>

331
00:14:09.361 --> 00:14:14.361
<v Speaker 4>remember already didn't know that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were a wrestler up until that fight </v>

332
00:14:14.361 --> 00:14:14.490
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

333
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.270
<v Speaker 5>Note to the weigh ins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I said the big thing was we,</v>

334
00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:19.350
<v Speaker 5>we're going away in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

335
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.490
<v Speaker 5>And I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made the UFC for Wayne and Wayne is in</v>

336
00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.310
<v Speaker 5>on the bathroom scale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like cutting weight and</v>

337
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
<v Speaker 1>not like a digital bathroom scales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of them aluminum that she </v>

338
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:34.530
<v Speaker 1>asked me.</v>

339
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.060
<v Speaker 5>They asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I know he was two pounds over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that right?</v>

341
00:14:37.831 --> 00:14:38.680
<v Speaker 5>I looked at him and right</v>

342
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get back on here.</v>

<v Speaker 5>By the.</v>

345
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 5>And I said something about it and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>

346
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.840
<v Speaker 5>he didn't know her as a rather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He saw,</v>

347
00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:02.220
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you better keep this standard if you </v>

348
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:02.220
<v Speaker 5>want to come back again because in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>back I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>A lot of people don't know about that.</v>

351
00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:08.350
<v Speaker 4>That's some fucking bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be mma.</v>

352
00:15:08.351 --> 00:15:11.530
<v Speaker 4>You know that someone would say that to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you especially right before a fight.</v>

353
00:15:11.531 --> 00:15:12.910
<v Speaker 4>You better fight a certain way.</v>

354

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

399
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.870
<v Speaker 5>most of the card.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take him where he lives.</v>

471
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.480
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a crazy fight man.</v>

472
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.340
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever look back on fights like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

473
00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:21.500
<v Speaker 4>Going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck was I?</v>

474
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.150
<v Speaker 4>Was I thinking there?</v>

475
00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Basically what people don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>is my why.</v>

476
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.830
<v Speaker 3>I went into my fight to a little deeper </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing I was thinking of growing as a </v>

477
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.881
<v Speaker 3>person and I didn't really worry that </v>
<v Speaker 3>much about the wind losses because in my</v>

478
00:20:36.041 --> 00:20:41.041
<v Speaker 3>types of fights I never ever was </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressured on winning and losing because </v>

479
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:41.710
<v Speaker 3>my friends were always fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is always exciting.</v>

480
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:41.870
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

481
00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.220
<v Speaker 4>is that a difference in the way the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Japanese fans view fights as opposed to </v>

482
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 4>American fans who so much emphasis</v>

483
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.810
<v Speaker 2>on victory on winning?</v>

484
00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:50.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

485
00:20:50.571 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 3>what's hard now is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

486
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:54.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can say yes,</v>

487
00:20:54.351 --> 00:20:59.351
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have the fighters fight with </v>
<v Speaker 3>more honor and more about the pride and </v>

488
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:04.151
<v Speaker 3>the deep thing about the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's hard because back in the day </v>

489
00:21:04.151 --> 00:21:04.950
<v Speaker 3>when we were fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are no big sponsors you,</v>

490
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.770
<v Speaker 3>you'd never made six figures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

491
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.810
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't much pressure about winning</v>

492
00:21:08.811 --> 00:21:10.670
<v Speaker 3>and losing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day,</v>

493
00:21:10.671 --> 00:21:12.290
<v Speaker 3>was you feeding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting for peanuts?</v>

494
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Basically if you're fighting in the ring</v>
<v Speaker 3>and putting your life on the line,</v>

495
00:21:15.111 --> 00:21:17.000
<v Speaker 3>that ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about pride and honor,</v>

496
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:22.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the fights are different and you say </v>

497
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.130
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd say like two fighters,</v>

498
00:21:22.131 --> 00:21:22.510
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

499
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 3>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that discernible for people to fight </v>

500
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 3>that way now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

501
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.970
<v Speaker 3>it isn't because they have so much to </v>
<v Speaker 3>gain from it.</v>

502
00:21:28.971 --> 00:21:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Now they can make set their life within,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

503
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:35.480
<v Speaker 3>winning and losing is a whole different </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing right now in this day,</v>

504
00:21:35.481 --> 00:21:35.690
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

505
00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.150
<v Speaker 2>So for you it wasn't about winning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>losing.</v>

506
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.060
<v Speaker 2>It's about finding what you were.</v>

507
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was basically,</v>

508
00:21:40.891 --> 00:21:41.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

509
00:21:41.751 --> 00:21:46.751
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>MMA for me was a stepping stone in my </v>

510
00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:47.990
<v Speaker 3>life as a man to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

511
00:21:47.991 --> 00:21:52.991
<v Speaker 3>when are you gonna ever be put in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>willingly walk into an area that you </v>

512
00:21:52.991 --> 00:21:55.040
<v Speaker 3>possibly might die that day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

513
00:21:55.210 --> 00:22:00.210
<v Speaker 3>The stress and the fears and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxieties you got to overcome in that </v>

514
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.960
<v Speaker 3>moment is not something you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever gain in a day to day,</v>

515
00:22:02.961 --> 00:22:04.820
<v Speaker 3>daily lifetime routine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

516
00:22:04.821 --> 00:22:09.821
<v Speaker 3>we're lucky as fighters to grow </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritually and grow meant in our heart </v>

517
00:22:09.891 --> 00:22:12.830
<v Speaker 3>as far as facing that fear every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

518
00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:17.120
<v Speaker 3>you can get hit with a wrong punching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy can hurt you real bad.</v>

519
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:22.080
<v Speaker 2>People didn't just respect that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they responded to that in a big way.</v>

520
00:22:22.081 --> 00:22:24.650
<v Speaker 2>That attitude Yamanto dementia is that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

521
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was nicknamed in Japan and that means</v>

522
00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:32.290
<v Speaker 3>it means a Japanese spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was actually used back in the </v>

523
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.050
<v Speaker 3>summer idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I translated as a sunrise spirit</v>

524
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.420
<v Speaker 2>and you became known for that attitude </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people knew that when ensign anyway </v>

525
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 2>stepped into the ring of the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no plane.</v>

526
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:47.311
<v Speaker 2>It's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There will be some wild shit going down </v>

527
00:22:47.311 --> 00:22:49.470
<v Speaker 2>every single time and they loved you for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

528
00:22:49.471 --> 00:22:52.200
<v Speaker 2>The ovation that you got in Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that,</v>

529
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.100
<v Speaker 2>the word jargon.</v>

530
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.480
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

531
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.870
<v Speaker 3>It was a real good nickname to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm basically,</v>

532
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.740
<v Speaker 3>when I got it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know how,</v>

533
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.020
<v Speaker 3>how big the word was and from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from being okay,</v>

534
00:23:03.021 --> 00:23:05.630
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kanji to wool,</v>

535
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 3>they named me that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm actually trying to live my life </v>

536
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:11.600
<v Speaker 3>to be as close as I can to that way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

537
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is hard.</v>

538
00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:18.220
<v Speaker 2>So when they named you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you feel like a big obligation </v>

539
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:18.220
<v Speaker 2>because of that?</v>

540
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at first I didn't know what it meant and</v>

541
00:23:19.801 --> 00:23:23.070
<v Speaker 3>then when I found out what it meant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was really questioning myself like,</v>

542
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:24.990
<v Speaker 3>do I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

543
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:30.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean I showed in a ring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not just about being in the </v>

544
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:30.300
<v Speaker 3>ring and I have my fears in the ring </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

545
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you watch the eager for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>first I was,</v>

546
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
<v Speaker 3>I think the tackle I through a right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>from there I was going to stand toe to </v>

547
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.421
<v Speaker 3>toe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all of a sudden I found myself </v>

548
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:41.421
<v Speaker 3>clenching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

549
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:41.550
<v Speaker 3>So I got my fears and everyone doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>see that.</v>

550
00:23:41.551 --> 00:23:46.551
<v Speaker 3>If you look back at the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that I had fear took over me </v>

551
00:23:46.551 --> 00:23:50.891
<v Speaker 3>for a moment and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I beat that battle like I released them </v>

552
00:23:50.891 --> 00:23:51.920
<v Speaker 3>through those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

553
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fight that fear too,</v>

554
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as far as you know,</v>

555
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:56.910
<v Speaker 3>people say I'm going to do that mushy.</v>

556
00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.390
<v Speaker 3>The he the undying spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

557
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:00.600
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never taps.</v>

558
00:24:00.601 --> 00:24:03.920
<v Speaker 3>It never gives up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are so many times in the fight</v>

559
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:08.921
<v Speaker 3>if you really look at it that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting that myself and I'm standing </v>

560
00:24:08.921 --> 00:24:12.281
<v Speaker 3>there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I justified to Caritas men because I </v>

561
00:24:12.281 --> 00:24:12.800
<v Speaker 3>think in the middle of a fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

562
00:24:12.801 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I say Yamamoto,</v>

563
00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:20.670
<v Speaker 3>dominancy the summer spirit to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have an experience to grow your </v>

564
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:20.670
<v Speaker 3>spirit to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that level,</v>

565
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.580
<v Speaker 3>every time you have an opportunity to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

566
00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:24.500
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not exactly.</v>

567
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.240
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

568
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:31.530
<v Speaker 3>doing this is going to be with our </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience because it depends on the </v>

569
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:31.530
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

570
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a driver.</v>

571
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 3>If he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell them to get in the car and take</v>

572
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:39.281
<v Speaker 3>a hairpin turn at 200 miles per hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be an experience for him to </v>

573
00:24:39.281 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 3>build his heart because he does it.</v>

574
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.330
<v Speaker 3>But if I were to do that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hell yeah,</v>

575
00:24:41.331 --> 00:24:43.160
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably be freaking sit in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>pants,</v>

576
00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>

577
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I go into the ring,</v>

578
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:48.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's,</v>

579
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 3>it's the situation that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was perfect for me for egos for it</v>

580
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:57.590
<v Speaker 3>because if I went and stood in and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>threw it out and just threw off from the</v>

581
00:24:57.591 --> 00:24:59.210
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like cool,</v>

582
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.880
<v Speaker 3>I conquer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I conquered that anxiety and that fear.</v>

583
00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:06.110
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't really a phenomenal </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience because it wouldn't have been</v>

584
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:07.250
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't clinch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

585
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:12.310
<v Speaker 3>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What made me happy was I actually had </v>

586
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.310
<v Speaker 3>that fear take over me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

587
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.930
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did some growing in my heart because I</v>

588
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:18.210
<v Speaker 3>clenched and I actually hesitated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking of trying to take them down and</v>

589
00:25:18.211 --> 00:25:19.340
<v Speaker 3>sending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting top position.</v>

590
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that when you look at like </v>

591
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.141
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that attitude towards fighting and you </v>

592
00:25:28.141 --> 00:25:30.461
<v Speaker 2>look at how that attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting was sort of a part of that era </v>

593
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:35.890
<v Speaker 2>where there wasn't that much money to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>made and there wasn't that much on the </v>

594
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:40.211
<v Speaker 2>line too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When do you think that those days are </v>

595
00:25:40.211 --> 00:25:40.211
<v Speaker 2>gone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

596
00:25:40.211 --> 00:25:40.211
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

597
00:25:40.211 --> 00:25:41.740
<v Speaker 3>It is because the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they stopped,</v>

598
00:25:41.741 --> 00:25:46.741
<v Speaker 3>fades away faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I basically see a lot of fights </v>

599
00:25:46.741 --> 00:25:51.271
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are the spirit will start taking </v>

600
00:25:51.271 --> 00:25:52.660
<v Speaker 3>over someone the fights or stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I understand it's a sport you'd have</v>

601
00:25:52.661 --> 00:25:54.430
<v Speaker 3>sponsors is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be televised.</v>

602
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.950
<v Speaker 3>It can't be too brutal and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>understandable.</v>

603
00:25:56.951 --> 00:26:00.430
<v Speaker 3>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a damn.</v>

604
00:26:00.431 --> 00:26:01.450
<v Speaker 3>If you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damned if you don't,</v>

605
00:26:01.451 --> 00:26:01.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

606
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.560
<v Speaker 3>when I see some of those fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

607
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.010
<v Speaker 3>I cringe because I think this is right </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

608
00:26:06.011 --> 00:26:11.011
<v Speaker 3>This is where this guy's heart's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have to kick in and they stopped the </v>

609
00:26:11.011 --> 00:26:11.011
<v Speaker 3>fight in the state.</v>

610
00:26:11.011 --> 00:26:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

611
00:26:11.251 --> 00:26:12.440
<v Speaker 2>kind credit bummed at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

612
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:17.540
<v Speaker 2>No one else was big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that 10 minute first round and </v>

613
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.390
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have fun within 10 minute.</v>

614
00:26:18.391 --> 00:26:20.050
<v Speaker 2>First round was big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

615
00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.760
<v Speaker 2>that was great because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five minutes shit just gets interesting.</v>

616
00:26:23.761 --> 00:26:25.380
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're halfway through,</v>

617
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.500
<v Speaker 2>you've got five more minutes after five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes of hell.</v>

618
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.650
<v Speaker 2>That first round was incredible,</v>

619
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's not exactly the best thing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

620
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:38.750
<v Speaker 3>If you want to find sponsors and </v>
<v Speaker 3>televise it and get people attracted to </v>

621
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.310
<v Speaker 3>it that don't understand the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

622
00:26:39.311 --> 00:26:39.610
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

623
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

624
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of a balancing act isn't.</v>

625
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard man.</v>

626
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

627
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.330
<v Speaker 5>how do you soften up cage fighting </v>
<v Speaker 5>though?</v>

628
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:50.360
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you soften up mixed martial arts.</v>

629
00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:56.170
<v Speaker 5>You're stopping the fight sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know there is bisping Belfort this </v>

630
00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.290
<v Speaker 5>weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'll stop fight.</v>

631
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:03.370
<v Speaker 5>We stopped a little soon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped too soon.</v>

632
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.670
<v Speaker 5>He's laying in the fetal position with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy behind him throwing hammerfest.</v>

633
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:13.970
<v Speaker 5>You're not trying to defend you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At no point are you trying to defend </v>

634
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.530
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

635
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't stopping him from rolling up </v>

636
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.970
<v Speaker 5>to his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to his belly.</v>

637
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.690
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't trying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stopping them from trying to get up and </v>

638
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.690
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't trying to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

639
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:28.440
<v Speaker 5>So what I ended up defending his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the only question I had was why </v>

640
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:30.550
<v Speaker 5>do they touch him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Step back,</v>

641
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.030
<v Speaker 5>it went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's over,</v>

642
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.520
<v Speaker 2>didn't last very long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he dropped him and then,</v>

643
00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:41.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the replay you're dealing </v>

644
00:27:41.521 --> 00:27:41.521
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're only talking about</v>

645
00:27:41.521 --> 00:27:44.210
<v Speaker 5>a couple of seconds shots to the body </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he hit him too.</v>

646
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.210
<v Speaker 5>I think it was two times ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he went,</v>

647
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.310
<v Speaker 5>went to a couple of others by.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he had,</v>

648
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.840
<v Speaker 5>he didn't even try to roll back up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't trying to get out.</v>

649
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.670
<v Speaker 5>He turned his back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

650
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:56.360
<v Speaker 5>it was over here and that was what's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on with the volume,</v>

651
00:27:56.361 --> 00:27:57.410
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you doing here?</v>

652
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.610
<v Speaker 5>It's varying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a big fucking head kick.</v>

653
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.510
<v Speaker 5>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those clean.</v>

654
00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.700
<v Speaker 5>I mean he wasn't trying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to defend himself.</v>

655
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:06.020
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

656
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.550
<v Speaker 5>he didn't look like he was trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

657
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:08.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

658
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean nothing against it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was,</v>

659
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he knew where he was at </v>
<v Speaker 5>that point.</v>

660
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.500
<v Speaker 5>Instincts kicked in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was defending I and I'm,</v>

661
00:28:15.501 --> 00:28:17.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm all for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

662
00:28:17.061 --> 00:28:18.080
<v Speaker 5>I think at the top level.</v>

663
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm all for letting it go a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>longer.</v>

664
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:20.420
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

665
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.160
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I complained a little bit about guys.</v>

666
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean I understand stopping real quick </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the lower levels,</v>

667
00:28:25.941 --> 00:28:28.250
<v Speaker 5>but at the higher levels mean these </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

680
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.540
<v Speaker 2>that get involved too much in like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling guys to fight and like when they</v>

681
00:29:05.541 --> 00:29:08.840
<v Speaker 2>are fighting and they just make their </v>
<v Speaker 2>presence known too much,</v>

682
00:29:08.841 --> 00:29:12.390
<v Speaker 2>there's just too much intervention by </v>
<v Speaker 2>them need to.</v>

683
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.440
<v Speaker 2>They need to learn how to step back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>too many fights get called where you </v>

684
00:29:17.541 --> 00:29:19.190
<v Speaker 2>have to look at the incident report like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

685
00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.490
<v Speaker 2>The controversial this weekend about </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting the back of the head goes,</v>

686
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:23.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible.</v>

687
00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.650
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get hit once in a band called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight,</v>

688
00:29:27.651 --> 00:29:32.651
<v Speaker 2>a no contest and I don't know if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the guy was complaining </v>

689
00:29:32.651 --> 00:29:34.040
<v Speaker 2>what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he hit him once with an elbow to the</v>

690
00:29:34.041 --> 00:29:39.041
<v Speaker 2>ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean elbow and then punch to the side </v>

691
00:29:39.041 --> 00:29:39.320
<v Speaker 2>of the head and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wash the back of the head,</v>

692
00:29:39.321 --> 00:29:44.321
<v Speaker 2>wash the back of the head and I don't if</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dude on the bottom was saying </v>

693
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:44.770
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was bad.</v>

694
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible call.</v>

695
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's happened in Brazil a couple of </v>

696
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happened with the Eric Silva fight.</v>

697
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:55.981
<v Speaker 2>When Eric Silva got a same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mario Yamasaki called it a no contest </v>

698
00:29:55.981 --> 00:29:56.830
<v Speaker 2>from shots to the back of the head</v>

699
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.460
<v Speaker 4>and the guy played it up to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

700
00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:04.120
<v Speaker 4>He definitely played it out because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was holding the back of his head and </v>

701
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.601
<v Speaker 4>then you see the instant replay in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>elbows hit him in the year that his pad.</v>

702
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.730
<v Speaker 4>I was kind of stoked when I heard the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dana tweeted something today.</v>

703
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.370
<v Speaker 4>I will never find the UFC again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

704
00:30:13.371 --> 00:30:15.210
<v Speaker 4>I think he tweeted that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

705
00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:20.690
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I should never forgetting the </v>

706
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.690
<v Speaker 4>octagon ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy's a disgrace to the sport.</v>

707
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sad when you see guys do shit like </v>

708
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 4>that and they see</v>

709
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.210
<v Speaker 2>someone looking for a way out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for an excuse,</v>

710
00:30:27.211 --> 00:30:27.900
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

711
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:33.170
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking camera there and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a camera there and there's a camera </v>

712
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.171
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone can see what those shots land </v>

713
00:30:36.171 --> 00:30:36.171
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno what.</v>

714
00:30:36.171 --> 00:30:37.140
<v Speaker 2>You can't just pretend that it hit you </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the back of the head.</v>

715
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but refereeing bad refereeing socks,</v>

716
00:30:42.301 --> 00:30:46.170
<v Speaker 2>but bad judging is even more prevalent </v>
<v Speaker 2>in bad referee.</v>

717
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.210
<v Speaker 2>We got a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

718
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.470
<v Speaker 5>First off with ref ref judging it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard anyway.</v>

719
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.380
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

720
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:57.660
<v Speaker 5>But then you put that with a lot of guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>just don't understand the sport.</v>

721
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.250
<v Speaker 5>They don't understand either the Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 5>or they don't understand the striking or</v>

722
00:31:02.251 --> 00:31:07.251
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean and they're judging it on the </v>

723
00:31:07.251 --> 00:31:08.490
<v Speaker 5>highest level and the highest level and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't really understand.</v>

724
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.500
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the guys working for summer,</v>

725
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.900
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you guys,</v>

726
00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to count that.</v>

727
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:17.130
<v Speaker 5>Attempted submission will hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thrown your legs up into a triangle.</v>

728
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.820
<v Speaker 5>Like this is not attended to mission.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

729
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.920
<v Speaker 5>it's got to be closer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to call it an attempt </v>

730
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.340
<v Speaker 5>attempted submission or it's got to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights to fight out of it.</v>

731
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean in wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take takedown.</v>

732
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.410
<v Speaker 5>Which takedowns good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean how much,</v>

733
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:33.840
<v Speaker 5>how much do you can either take down?</v>

734
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.950
<v Speaker 5>I was getting up or getting back up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How has escaped his escape?</v>

735
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:38.730
<v Speaker 5>What's the skateboard?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you were fighting,</v>

736
00:31:38.731 --> 00:31:40.500
<v Speaker 5>you were famous for you take down </v>
<v Speaker 5>defense,</v>

737
00:31:40.501 --> 00:31:45.501
<v Speaker 5>but you're also famous for being able to</v>
<v Speaker 5>get up off the bottom when you thought </v>

738
00:31:45.501 --> 00:31:46.140
<v Speaker 5>if you got taken down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were you thinking,</v>

739
00:31:46.141 --> 00:31:51.141
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much are the judges gonna pay </v>

740
00:31:51.141 --> 00:31:51.141
<v Speaker 5>attention to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if I get right back up real quick,</v>

741
00:31:51.141 --> 00:31:52.380
<v Speaker 5>how much does that score?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

742
00:31:52.381 --> 00:31:55.050
<v Speaker 5>I never worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean my thing was I was always.</v>

743
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.450
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot easier to get back up if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>start as soon as I hit the ground.</v>

744
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:00.580
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

745
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.890
<v Speaker 5>if I let you get on top of me and get </v>
<v Speaker 5>set,</v>

746
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.650
<v Speaker 5>it's real hard to get off my back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

747
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.520
<v Speaker 5>But if you get to take down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not over.</v>

748
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.630
<v Speaker 5>This isn't college.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not.</v>

749
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.130
<v Speaker 5>No one's throwing up two points.</v>

750
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.750
<v Speaker 5>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm still,</v>

751
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm still.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as we hit the ground,</v>

752
00:32:14.491 --> 00:32:19.491
<v Speaker 5>I'm fighting your take that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And my thing was always I just always </v>

753
00:32:19.491 --> 00:32:19.491
<v Speaker 5>trying to find a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

754
00:32:19.491 --> 00:32:21.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying offensive so he can't hit me </v>
<v Speaker 5>on down.</v>

755
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.420
<v Speaker 5>He can't really score with them down </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and I don't really think of a guy </v>

756
00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.961
<v Speaker 5>just tastes guy down and holds him </v>
<v Speaker 5>unless nothing else has really done in </v>

757
00:32:29.961 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 5>the round.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean that you should,</v>

758
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:35.300
<v Speaker 5>when you got to take down and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>haven't been able to land a punch having</v>

759
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:40.500
<v Speaker 5>Atlanta done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he gets up and land some punches </v>

760
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:40.500
<v Speaker 5>standing and he just went around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

761
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 2>is it a case a lot of times of a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to conserve energy or trying to </v>

762
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.320
<v Speaker 2>figure out when to explode when he gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken down where he like,</v>

763
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.560
<v Speaker 2>he'll hang on for a second and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>start moving.</v>

764
00:32:49.561 --> 00:32:54.561
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you're back touches the </v>

765
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:54.561
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're scooting,</v>

766
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:54.561
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

767
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:55.710
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting for under hooks.</v>

768
00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:00.820
<v Speaker 5>The problem I tell a lot of guys all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time is if you get down and you take </v>

769
00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.410
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get that,</v>

770
00:33:01.411 --> 00:33:02.880
<v Speaker 5>oh shit moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

771
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.250
<v Speaker 5>Get flattened out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as he did that.</v>

772
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.200
<v Speaker 5>If I mean you're sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you're going to.</v>

773
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.770
<v Speaker 5>Now it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be a bitch to get off your back.</v>

774
00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.280
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

775
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.280
<v Speaker 5>my thing is as soon as you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a little space,</v>

776
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.510
<v Speaker 5>even when you hit a good hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good takedown.</v>

777
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:17.860
<v Speaker 5>UHM,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's balance.</v>

778
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:18.600
<v Speaker 5>Guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is.</v>

779
00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.540
<v Speaker 5>Space is that space now I'm pushing </v>
<v Speaker 5>already.</v>

780
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm already working and get back up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean that,</v>

781
00:33:24.851 --> 00:33:25.830
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

782
00:33:25.831 --> 00:33:28.020
<v Speaker 5>that helps you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>continue to get up.</v>

783
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.030
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting is you guys had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure that shit out in the cage.</v>

784
00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:37.031
<v Speaker 2>Like there wasn't like a whole series of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters that came before you that have </v>

785
00:33:37.031 --> 00:33:38.150
<v Speaker 2>already figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like essentially,</v>

786
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take down defense and the ability to get</v>

787
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 2>up off the bottom and an mma fight was </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda written by you.</v>

788
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I mean I,</v>

789
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:51.430
<v Speaker 5>I put together some stuff from John </v>
<v Speaker 5>Lewis taught me how get out one this way</v>

790
00:33:52.141 --> 00:33:54.590
<v Speaker 5>and it's got to have somebody on a role </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that knee bar this way.</v>

791
00:33:54.591 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 5>And I kind of figured out how to do a </v>
<v Speaker 5>push pull thing with the guys and I just</v>

792
00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 5>changed something right at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 5>each thing to get.</v>

793
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.520
<v Speaker 5>Because instead of going through that </v>
<v Speaker 5>knee bar,</v>

794
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.560
<v Speaker 5>I get halfway there and just stand up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and guess what,</v>

795
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:09.500
<v Speaker 5>if I get halfway there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I get people off balanced and I could</v>

796
00:34:09.501 --> 00:34:14.501
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do a push pull and make it so I tried </v>

797
00:34:14.501 --> 00:34:14.501
<v Speaker 5>to get you to push real hard to stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>this one.</v>

798
00:34:14.501 --> 00:34:17.630
<v Speaker 5>I go the other way and you stopped that </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I pop under the other way.</v>

799
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:23.030
<v Speaker 2>But it's kind of fascinating when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it because you had to kind </v>

800
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.500
<v Speaker 2>of figure all that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there wasn't like you came along in</v>

801
00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:30.501
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 97.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there wasn't a lot of dudes who </v>

802
00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:30.501
<v Speaker 2>had already done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were.</v>

803
00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:33.660
<v Speaker 2>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at a guy like Rory Macdonald is</v>

804
00:34:33.661 --> 00:34:38.661
<v Speaker 2>training at Tristar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has got George St Pierre and his camp </v>

805
00:34:38.661 --> 00:34:41.181
<v Speaker 2>for us a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got fucking charts and graphs and </v>

806
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 2>dry erase boards where they're writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to every day's workout where </v>

807
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.960
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to break it down to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual technique and skill.</v>

808
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.350
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we</v>

809
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.720
<v Speaker 5>came in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's trying to figure out.</v>

810
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.080
<v Speaker 5>Most guys came in with one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

811
00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.120
<v Speaker 5>wrestling or striking or some Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then come in and they're trying to </v>

812
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:02.291
<v Speaker 5>mix them all together and we're also </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to figure out how to train them </v>

813
00:35:02.291 --> 00:35:02.291
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

814
00:35:02.291 --> 00:35:05.910
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do I train my wrestling and my age </v>

815
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.910
<v Speaker 5>at my am,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

820
00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.270
<v Speaker 5>it was an interesting time and </v>
<v Speaker 5>challenging.</v>

821
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.220
<v Speaker 5>It's challenging and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you got guys like you said,</v>

<v Speaker 5>better because you got guys that now </v>

823
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:24.370
<v Speaker 5>they've learned in mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the start,</v>

824
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:25.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they,</v>

<v Speaker 5>have coaches that know how to train it.</v>

826
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.810
<v Speaker 5>They'll have a teaching and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>still gonna be innovative.</v>

827
00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:37.811
<v Speaker 5>A little bit of navy guys are still </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to create their own little things </v>

828
00:35:37.811 --> 00:35:38.790
<v Speaker 5>that work better for you or for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever body type you off.</v>

829
00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to you about this and you don't</v>

830
00:35:40.931 --> 00:35:43.810
<v Speaker 2>know what have you thought about opening</v>
<v Speaker 2>up a gym?</v>

831
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Are you thinking about trying to open it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

832
00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.440
<v Speaker 5>open a gym?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

833
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:52.470
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I'm going to get into </v>

834
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.290
<v Speaker 5>all that coaching guys to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I always like working with guys that</v>

835
00:35:53.291 --> 00:35:54.460
<v Speaker 5>are fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

836
00:35:54.461 --> 00:35:59.461
<v Speaker 5>and like working with different things </v>
<v Speaker 5>and showing them things I like or I do </v>

837
00:35:59.461 --> 00:36:02.410
<v Speaker 5>different than what they're used to </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing and seeing someone use it.</v>

838
00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.590
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you've got a guy that show that.</v>

839
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:10.930
<v Speaker 5>I think my favorite thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember teaching forest had a fine </v>

840
00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:11.920
<v Speaker 5>point to something you've done forever </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

841
00:36:11.921 --> 00:36:13.840
<v Speaker 5>I thought that was a bullshit move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It never worked.</v>

842
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:14.980
<v Speaker 5>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

843
00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.320
<v Speaker 5>that's what I was doing wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because now it just,</v>

844
00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 5>it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just a guard,</v>

845
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.730
<v Speaker 5>a guard pass thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was.</v>

846
00:36:21.731 --> 00:36:22.820
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>

847
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.610
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I was missing.</v>

848
00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:25.900
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's fun for me.</v>

849
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Will you enjoy teaching?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just saying that you were talking </v>

850
00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:30.980
<v Speaker 2>about before the podcast ever started </v>
<v Speaker 2>about glover.</v>

851
00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 2>You've been training with glover and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting him ready for his fight with </v>

852
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 2>rampages weekend.</v>

853
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:36.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been working with over the last two</v>

854
00:36:36.971 --> 00:36:39.250
<v Speaker 5>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll after he got back in the US.</v>

855
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean I even away from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

856
00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.920
<v Speaker 5>he was training for a long time and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went,</v>

857
00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 5>went back to get stuck in Brazil for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>few years and so I know when I was </v>

858
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.680
<v Speaker 5>working with them with stuff that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>used to do,</v>

859
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.830
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the stuff that he's forgotten.</v>

860
00:36:53.831 --> 00:36:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

861
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.320
<v Speaker 5>that's why that's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

862
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.210
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>little little fine points and you know,</v>

863
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:03.600
<v Speaker 5>because I know I had the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I come back from having done that </v>

864
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:03.600
<v Speaker 5>movement one I'll be why isn't this </v>
<v Speaker 5>working?</v>

865
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just</v>

866
00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:09.930
<v Speaker 2>you just forget one small little </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical aspects of difference of a </v>

867
00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:11.090
<v Speaker 2>makes a whole difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

868
00:37:11.091 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating how much when you look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

869
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.990
<v Speaker 2>you look at athleticism and you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>like just sheer strength and size.</v>

870
00:37:17.991 --> 00:37:22.991
<v Speaker 2>That's all well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really fascinating how much </v>

871
00:37:22.991 --> 00:37:25.930
<v Speaker 2>actual technique is involved and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>subtle variations and changes in that </v>

872
00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:27.470
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make all the difference in the world and</v>

873
00:37:27.471 --> 00:37:32.471
<v Speaker 2>that's something that the lay person </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't understand and that's something </v>

874
00:37:32.471 --> 00:37:34.730
<v Speaker 2>that it's a shame when judges don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it</v>

875
00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.300
<v Speaker 5>and that's the hard part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

876
00:37:37.301 --> 00:37:42.301
<v Speaker 5>I mean even just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean some of them I don't think they </v>

877
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:42.301
<v Speaker 5>quite understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The basics.</v>

878
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.800
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government workers,</v>

879
00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:45.480
<v Speaker 2>they might as well be working for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>DMV.</v>

880
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 2>They got a Gig and they went in and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned how to,</v>

881
00:37:48.031 --> 00:37:49.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a triangle.</v>

882
00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:50.440
<v Speaker 2>This is an arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a kick.</v>

883
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:51.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

884
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.240
<v Speaker 5>Times I've watched around and just gone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

885
00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:59.930
<v Speaker 5>I want to see the judge that gave that </v>
<v Speaker 5>round to that guy and have him explain </v>

886
00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:01.140
<v Speaker 5>it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just want to watch.</v>

887
00:38:01.141 --> 00:38:02.820
<v Speaker 5>I just want to it just for my own </v>
<v Speaker 5>entertainment.</v>

888
00:38:02.821 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 5>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to hear him explain.</v>

889
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:09.620
<v Speaker 5>Justify was an ultimate fighters I </v>
<v Speaker 5>watched.</v>

890
00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.520
<v Speaker 5>It was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was the live one.</v>

891
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:17.090
<v Speaker 5>I remember I went to overtime and in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>overtime it was two to one for one guy </v>

892
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:19.380
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like looking at it going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all standing.</v>

893
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.310
<v Speaker 5>One guy threw two punches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't land one of them,</v>

894
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:26.670
<v Speaker 5>the other guy probably landed five or </v>
<v Speaker 5>six punches the hole round,</v>

895
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:32.060
<v Speaker 5>but chase the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole round one of the judges </v>

896
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.130
<v Speaker 5>actually gave it to the guy that threw </v>
<v Speaker 5>two punches in the air.</v>

897
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.560
<v Speaker 5>It never landed a punch and was running </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole time.</v>

898
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

899
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.570
<v Speaker 5>Are you watching?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any,</v>

900
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.600
<v Speaker 5>any?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

901
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.520
<v Speaker 5>you gotta be kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually had on Tivo.</v>

902
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.030
<v Speaker 5>Every wound it went okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't.</v>

903
00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.710
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I must've watched around wrong.</v>

904
00:38:47.711 --> 00:38:49.570
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I must've saw ms dot.</v>

905
00:38:49.571 --> 00:38:51.140
<v Speaker 5>Let me see what I missed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

906
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No punches.</v>

907
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:53.310
<v Speaker 5>No landed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>none.</v>

908
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:55.990
<v Speaker 5>Freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were all guys who,</v>

909
00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.840
<v Speaker 5>a lot of them are from boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in Nevada.</v>

910
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:03.870
<v Speaker 5>Nevada has a lot of like Adelaide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Given Dana a hard time about it.</v>

911
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:06.520
<v Speaker 5>It's like a guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't pick the referees.</v>

912
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.050
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not up to here.</v>

913
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:09.800
<v Speaker 5>He can't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not always out of about</v>

914
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.210
<v Speaker 2>promoter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really,</v>

915
00:39:11.211 --> 00:39:11.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

916
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.480
<v Speaker 2>You don't get any say whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

917
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.250
<v Speaker 2>You can't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's illegal.</v>

918
00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:18.070
<v Speaker 2>You can't have any say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who's,</v>

919
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.610
<v Speaker 2>who's judging?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not judging,</v>

920
00:39:19.611 --> 00:39:24.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to be done by the athletic </v>

921
00:39:24.611 --> 00:39:26.291
<v Speaker 2>commission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No wonder he rips on the referring a </v>

922
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:28.310
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the refereeing is,</v>

923
00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.800
<v Speaker 2>is a lot of it is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking hard.</v>

924
00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.920
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to make the right call in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment and the</v>

925
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:39.060
<v Speaker 5>reference reference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of guys don't do it well,</v>

926
00:39:39.381 --> 00:39:39.560
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

927
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.830
<v Speaker 2>the judging is a disgrace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The judging,</v>

928
00:39:41.831 --> 00:39:46.831
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion is a disgrace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people make errors as referees </v>

929
00:39:46.831 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 2>and that's just a part of being a human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

930
00:39:47.141 --> 00:39:52.141
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like the referees for the </v>

<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

969
00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.260
<v Speaker 5>I put in prison and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

970
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was funny</v>

971
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.380
<v Speaker 3>because after I got to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was on national TV.</v>

972
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:37.430
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all the newspapers,</v>

973
00:41:37.431 --> 00:41:42.431
<v Speaker 3>magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Funny how I start fading out of the </v>

974
00:41:42.431 --> 00:41:42.431
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden I get arrested.</v>

975
00:41:42.431 --> 00:41:43.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a hot thing in the media again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I say</v>

976
00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:47.010
<v Speaker 1>first the shocker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why the media.</v>

977
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.160
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

978
00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:50.310
<v Speaker 1>when I got out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

979
00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.110
<v Speaker 3>when I would go to bars and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was saying,</v>

980
00:41:52.111 --> 00:41:53.320
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people would say like,</v>

981
00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.230
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen you on TV.</v>

982
00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.700
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

983
00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:02.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the one with me handcuffed </v>

984
00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:03.240
<v Speaker 3>police or wasn't a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

985
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.170
<v Speaker 3>they hated that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

986
00:42:04.171 --> 00:42:05.100
<v Speaker 3>So I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

987
00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 3>the only way to tell she'll make it up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to my fans and let them know that I'm </v>

988
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

991
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:16.710

<v Speaker 3>and Japan,</v>

992
00:42:16.711 --> 00:42:18.660

<v Speaker 3>They walk around and in Japan it's kind </v>

998
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:37.450
<v Speaker 3>of unconstitutional where they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>need a reason to search you.</v>

999
00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.090

<v Speaker 3>make an example of me.</v>

1017
00:43:24.011 --> 00:43:25.690
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1018
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.470
<v Speaker 3>what was the worst case scenario?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

1019
00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it was five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

1020
00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:43:33.281 --> 00:43:38.281
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all dependent on what came up in my </v>

1022
00:43:38.281 --> 00:43:38.590
<v Speaker 3>house and my gym when they did the </v>
<v Speaker 3>search next day.</v>

1023
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what came up?</v>

1024
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:41.780
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing came up.</v>

1025
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.530
<v Speaker 3>So that saved you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1026
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:44.830
<v Speaker 3>well I was kind of baffled.</v>

1027
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Someone stole my fucking weed,</v>

1028
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.730
<v Speaker 3>thinking what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the,</v>

1029
00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:03.050
<v Speaker 3>the interrogation came to finding out </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I got my stuff.</v>

1030
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when in Japan,</v>

1031
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:11.150
<v Speaker 3>if you throw everything to a foreign </v>
<v Speaker 3>person deal drop,</v>

1032
00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.480
<v Speaker 3>they won't want to go fight someone in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

1033
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:19.590
<v Speaker 3>I told them it was a student from Guam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked me for her name and I said </v>

1034
00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew like three tonys in Guam,</v>

1035
00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:26.830
<v Speaker 3>so keep it real tony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1036
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.980
<v Speaker 3>and we had like two days of questioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he talking interrogation for like</v>

<v Speaker 3>name and this fricken ridiculous.</v>

1040
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:45.060
<v Speaker 3>The first name that popped in my head </v>
<v Speaker 3>was Montana.</v>

1041
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.200
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

<v Speaker 3>like this road answer.</v>

1100
00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the name of your mom and dad,</v>

1107
00:47:47.921 --> 00:47:49.600
<v Speaker 3>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really flipped the fuck.</v>

1108
00:47:49.601 --> 00:47:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Does that have to do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1109
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:56.070
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just going along with the role </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like the next week I go in for </v>

1110
00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:57.400

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1113
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:05.101
<v Speaker 3>and it got to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so bad that I got so frustrated </v>

<v Speaker 3>with her as much as I needed to be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They don't want me here.</v>

1128

<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1129
00:48:31.061 --> 00:48:36.061
<v Speaker 3>the interrogation went on and there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>one guy that was a phantom way when he </v>

1130
00:48:36.061 --> 00:48:37.680
<v Speaker 3>was intimidating me and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1131
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:40.840
<v Speaker 3>he kinda did something illegal where he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he told me that the,</v>

1132
00:48:40.841 --> 00:48:43.300
<v Speaker 3>between these two red marker said </v>
<v Speaker 3>linking those two papers.</v>

1133
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:48.300
<v Speaker 3>She said he flipped it open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said this is all petitions coming in </v>

1134
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.800
<v Speaker 3>for you not to get kicked out of Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I saw the papers like this thick.</v>

1135
00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:51.430
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

1136
00:48:51.431 --> 00:48:52.240
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got like $4,000</v>

1138
00:48:53.621 --> 00:48:55.050
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the petition,</v>

1139
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Japan isn't just names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to live your name,</v>

<v Speaker 3>your address and everything you see </v>

1141
00:49:02.191 --> 00:49:05.050
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bullshit where you can just </v>

1142
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:05.050
<v Speaker 3>get people to sign their names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just write some.</v>

1143
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:09.810
<v Speaker 3>So they're writing this 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every time we get an integration I </v>

1144
00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:13.471
<v Speaker 3>see that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that between those two red mark is </v>

1145
00:49:13.471 --> 00:49:15.361
<v Speaker 3>getting thicker and thicker and I come </v>
<v Speaker 3>to find at the end it came out to be </v>

1146
00:49:15.361 --> 00:49:16.270
<v Speaker 3>9,008</v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

1147
00:49:16.271 --> 00:49:21.271
<v Speaker 3>9,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people sent in that they don't want me </v>

1148
00:49:21.271 --> 00:49:23.641
<v Speaker 3>to keep the Japan and immigration is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there to protect Japan from dangerous </v>

1149
00:49:23.641 --> 00:49:24.490
<v Speaker 3>so-called dangerous foreigners.</v>

1150
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:29.550
<v Speaker 3>So when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people that they're supposed </v>

1151
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.871
<v Speaker 3>to be protecting is sending you 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>letters saying they don't want this guy </v>

1152
00:49:31.871 --> 00:49:35.080
<v Speaker 3>kicked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was the overwhelming thing that </v>

1153
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I could have been the board idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much press are you getting over </v>

1154
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.390
<v Speaker 3>there because of all the stuff you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing for Fukushima victims?</v>

<v Speaker 3>look what I'm doing.</v>

1159
00:49:50.681 --> 00:49:53.170
<v Speaker 3>But nod people would even know I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>up on the 24th.</v>

1160
00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 3>The day after I get back from here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm driving straight to Fukushima.</v>

1161
00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:59.740
<v Speaker 3>When Nolan radiation like there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1162
00:49:59.741 --> 00:50:01.600
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went into the,</v>

1163
00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:04.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the zone twice or three times.</v>

1164
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:07.680
<v Speaker 3>And the zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the zone is,</v>

1165
00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.900
<v Speaker 3>it's from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the plants blew up.</v>

1166
00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:15.400
<v Speaker 3>It's like a 20 kilometer zone where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>radiation is actually pretty high,</v>

1167
00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 3>although 30 kilometers salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1168
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:19.990
<v Speaker 3>But the town that I'm visiting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nurses or visiting,</v>

1169
00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:22.540
<v Speaker 3>the temporary housing is about 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>kilometers away,</v>

1170
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:24.550
<v Speaker 3>so the radiation's a little higher than </v>
<v Speaker 3>usual,</v>

1171
00:50:24.551 --> 00:50:26.950
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not living there,</v>

1172
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.680
<v Speaker 3>it's not a big deal.</v>

1173
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Chuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want I can take him.</v>

1174
00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll take him home because I know you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to get out of here.</v>

1175
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Say Goodbye to the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you got your kids at home.</v>

1176
00:50:35.191 --> 00:50:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for coming by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brother are very good.</v>

1177
00:50:36.631 --> 00:50:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Ceos are having anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime.</v>

1178
00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Come on back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mrs.</v>

1179
00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Odell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take care.</v>

1180
00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:46.620
<v Speaker 2>She's crashed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's out there on the couch.</v>

1181
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grab some coconut waters.</v>

1182
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:52.260
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go in there,</v>

1183
00:50:52.261 --> 00:50:54.210
<v Speaker 2>you bring in a geiger counter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>

1184
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:56.410
<v Speaker 2>how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what your.</v>

1185
00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:58.880
<v Speaker 3>I have a corner and a dusty man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll get you out.</v>

1186
00:50:58.881 --> 00:51:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Go see you later man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks man.</v>

1187
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have both a geiger counter.</v>

1188
00:51:03.031 --> 00:51:05.280
<v Speaker 3>What's the other thing that Dr Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a docile guy?</v>

1189
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 3>Cremator guyer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connor.</v>

1190
00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:11.380
<v Speaker 3>Co Counsel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly what you're getting at that </v>

1191
00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:14.181
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the dosimeter it takes accumulation </v>

1192
00:51:14.181 --> 00:51:14.181
<v Speaker 3>of which your body is taking him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1193
00:51:14.181 --> 00:51:14.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1194
00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take iodine.</v>

1195
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we take that stone tablets.</v>

1196
00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:19.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1197
00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly a protects your thyroid.</v>

1198
00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the steroids.</v>

1199
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:30.580
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean for your blood chemistry to </v>

1200
00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:31.590
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to take in 65,000</v>

1201
00:51:31.591 --> 00:51:36.591
<v Speaker 3>microsieverts and it depends on the wind</v>
<v Speaker 3>and depends on how long you're in the </v>

1202
00:51:38.311 --> 00:51:43.311
<v Speaker 3>hot spots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first time I went in I took in a </v>

1203
00:51:43.311 --> 00:51:47.450
<v Speaker 3>25,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty bad because you're </v>

1204
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:48.750
<v Speaker 3>talking a yearly count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You only want $65,000</v>

1205
00:51:48.751 --> 00:51:53.751
<v Speaker 3>after 65,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it changes your blood chemistry </v>

1206
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:53.751
<v Speaker 3>which could cause cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me.</v>

1207
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then the second time I went and.</v>

1208
00:51:55.801 --> 00:52:00.801
<v Speaker 3>How's this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got 19 microsieverts as much as you </v>

1209
00:52:00.801 --> 00:52:00.840
<v Speaker 3>get flying from a trip from Hawaii to </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>

1210
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually did that.</v>

1211
00:52:03.901 --> 00:52:06.480
<v Speaker 3>I brought the dusty meter and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plane.</v>

1212
00:52:06.481 --> 00:52:07.000
<v Speaker 3>The plane.</v>

1213
00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of things that people don't</v>

1214
00:52:09.971 --> 00:52:12.220
<v Speaker 2>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you get way more radiation from the</v>

1215
00:52:12.221 --> 00:52:14.260
<v Speaker 2>plane that you do from those radar </v>
<v Speaker 2>detectors.</v>

1216
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:19.280
<v Speaker 2>There are those metal detectors rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you going through the airport and </v>

1217
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:19.280
<v Speaker 2>everybody's terrified of those.</v>

1218
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just the plane itself probably </v>

1219
00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:22.900
<v Speaker 3>sitting in radiation right now with </v>
<v Speaker 3>other electrical equipment.</v>

1220
00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:27.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what people don't realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now that there's radiation all </v>

1221
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.831
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the sun gives us radiation when </v>

1222
00:52:29.831 --> 00:52:29.831
<v Speaker 3>it hits the concrete and it bounces back</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

1223
00:52:29.831 --> 00:52:32.060
<v Speaker 3>It's giving off radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're getting ration everything you do.</v>

1224
00:52:32.061 --> 00:52:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1225
00:52:33.411 --> 00:52:36.920
<v Speaker 3>going into Fukushima that second time </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got only 19 microsieverts,</v>

1226
00:52:36.921 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 3>it's like getting a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting a chest extra now.</v>

1227
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:44.681
<v Speaker 3>Why was it less than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you spent less time where you </v>

1228
00:52:44.681 --> 00:52:46.520
<v Speaker 3>want radiation is actually particles of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dust.</v>

1229
00:52:46.521 --> 00:52:49.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it depends on if it rained,</v>

1230
00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 3>if turns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it rains,</v>

1231
00:52:50.811 --> 00:52:53.060
<v Speaker 3>it drains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it cumulates in a certain area.</v>

1232
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:58.150
<v Speaker 3>It depends if you're in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can stay right here and see </v>

1233
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:59.230
<v Speaker 3>zero in the Gardner Corner and walk 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet and get to 100.</v>

1234
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:01.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the craziest thing.</v>

1235
00:53:01.941 --> 00:53:03.410
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't see it,</v>

1236
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:05.390
<v Speaker 3>you don't smell it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't feel nothing.</v>

1237
00:53:05.391 --> 00:53:08.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculously scary</v>

1238
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:11.390
<v Speaker 2>and the closer to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the higher the reading.</v>

1239
00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:16.391
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched a video where a guy took a </v>

1240
00:53:16.391 --> 00:53:17.160
<v Speaker 2>geiger counter and was showing the air </v>
<v Speaker 2>and anyone else.</v>

1241
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the ground,</v>

1242
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.680
<v Speaker 3>stuck on the surfaces even could be on </v>
<v Speaker 3>glass,</v>

1243
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.980
<v Speaker 3>glass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some radiation that gallon glass</v>

1244
00:53:23.981 --> 00:53:26.820
<v Speaker 3>and you can't even wash it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Developer into glass.</v>

1245
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:31.910
<v Speaker 3>How do you look at nuclear power now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you look at it completely different </v>

1246
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:35.211
<v Speaker 3>after you've seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard situation because we don't </v>

1247
00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Nikila power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan wouldn't be able to run or will be</v>

1248
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:40.800
<v Speaker 3>paying out of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our asses in electrical bills.</v>

1249
00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:43.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's literally can't run without looking</v>

1250
00:53:43.991 --> 00:53:45.260
<v Speaker 3>at your car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1251
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 3>it's important and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1252
00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:50.790
<v Speaker 3>it's a hard thing men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because an incident like this,</v>

1253
00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:51.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where um,</v>

1254
00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:57.540
<v Speaker 3>the tsunamis come in and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that hasn't happened in </v>

1255
00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:00.750
<v Speaker 3>100 years in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean she's,</v>

1256
00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but 100 years ain't shit.</v>

1257
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:05.430
<v Speaker 2>When you think about the geography and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about this,</v>

1258
00:54:05.431 --> 00:54:08.700
<v Speaker 2>the surface of the earth 100 years is </v>
<v Speaker 2>barely a blink of the night.</v>

1259
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:10.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1260
00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:15.300
<v Speaker 2>we're so used to what we've seen so far </v>
<v Speaker 2>in our lifetime when we take that as </v>

1261
00:54:15.721 --> 00:54:16.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1262
00:54:16.201 --> 00:54:18.420
<v Speaker 2>well this is our point of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we know.</v>

1263
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen.</v>

1264
00:54:20.131 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't happened in 100 years.</v>

1265
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.400
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean anything.</v>

1266
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:25.410
<v Speaker 3>A lot of shit can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1267
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:27.180
<v Speaker 3>Japan has active volcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1268
00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:31.740
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of shit that can go on </v>
<v Speaker 3>global like eight or nine times a day.</v>

1269
00:54:31.741 --> 00:54:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Man in Japan if we're constantly getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes.</v>

1270
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.180
<v Speaker 3>But you love it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1271
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.230
<v Speaker 3>I love the people and I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love what I was established there.</v>

1272

1275
00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of gyms in Guam.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I have a following there that I a big </v>

1277
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 3>following.</v>

1279
00:54:59.371 --> 00:55:04.371

<v Speaker 3>So it's something that a lot of them </v>

1280
00:55:04.371 --> 00:55:04.371
<v Speaker 3>can't leave your pants</v>

1281
00:55:04.371 --> 00:55:05.590
<v Speaker 2>now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you first moved there,</v>

1282
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.320
<v Speaker 2>you moved there for racquetball in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>year?</v>

1283
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in 1994.</v>

1284
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.530
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1285
00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.520
<v Speaker 3>We 22 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's calculate that.</v>

1286
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was way back.</v>

1287
00:55:17.611 --> 00:55:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I fought in 1995.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was four years before this.</v>

1288
00:55:20.241 --> 00:55:21.270
<v Speaker 3>In 1991.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

1289
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 90.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I moved there.</v>

1290
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:29.690
<v Speaker 3>So it was for record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What tournament did you speak Japanese </v>

1292
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.690
<v Speaker 3>fluently before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1293
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:31.620
<v Speaker 3>I had to learn it with flashcards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Holy Shit.</v>

1294
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.070
<v Speaker 3>So in writing and everything and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the writing the Kanji,</v>

1295
00:55:35.071 --> 00:55:37.980
<v Speaker 3>I understand it a little bit but it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not necessary in my life.</v>

1296
00:55:37.981 --> 00:55:39.510
<v Speaker 3>So I've been learned it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean I teach fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like shit whenever I did anything I </v>

1298
00:55:45.361 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 3>thought that I don't read the newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

1299
00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:52.380
<v Speaker 3>There's an English newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I read that I'm the most conject can </v>

1300
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:52.950
<v Speaker 3>write is my name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My address,</v>

1301
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1302
00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:55.730
<v Speaker 3>I can read more than I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1303
00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:01.240
<v Speaker 3>Because a whole different thing to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to read it into actually have to </v>

1304
00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.000
<v Speaker 3>write it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you learn how to speak it,</v>

1305
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:04.970
<v Speaker 3>you just learn by talking to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just learned flashcards and lists,</v>

1306
00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:10.420
<v Speaker 3>learn vocabulary just slammed as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure that I thought I would using as </v>

1307
00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.550
<v Speaker 3>far as the particles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just let it flow.</v>

1308
00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So speaking pretty much just vocabulary.</v>

1309
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.940
<v Speaker 2>When you communicate in Japan now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they know it's like,</v>

1310
00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:25.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear like Boron Talk English and he </v>

1311
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:25.380
<v Speaker 2>has a Kazakhstan</v>

1312
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:29.340
<v Speaker 3>accent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they hear an American accent for </v>

1313
00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:29.340
<v Speaker 3>your Japanese?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1314
00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you hear me treat shopper </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs,</v>

1315
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:34.510
<v Speaker 3>you probably think I'm fluent but </v>
<v Speaker 3>considering our bidding for 20 years,</v>

1316
00:56:34.511 --> 00:56:39.511
<v Speaker 3>I suck really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fluent as far as I can </v>

1317
00:56:39.511 --> 00:56:42.720
<v Speaker 3>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem communicating and I </v>

1318
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.780
<v Speaker 3>never misunderstanding anything is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty understanding everything.</v>

1319
00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:48.781
<v Speaker 3>But it's not fluent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of your communicating over </v>

1320
00:56:48.781 --> 00:56:49.660
<v Speaker 3>there as English speaking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost zero.</v>

1321
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.520
<v Speaker 3>Almost zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all Japanese.</v>

1322
00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:56.830
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many different fighters are you </v>

1323
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:56.830
<v Speaker 3>working with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don?</v>

1324
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:57.270
<v Speaker 3>I know you were working with kids for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

1325
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:59.150
<v Speaker 3>He's still working with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1326
00:56:59.350 --> 00:56:59.980
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1327
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.350
<v Speaker 3>We had a falling on with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1328
00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:02.440
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1329
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.980
<v Speaker 3>his idea of loyalty is a whole different</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1330
00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:09.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a super fucking talented guy,</v>

1331
00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:11.080
<v Speaker 3>you know that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1332
00:57:11.081 --> 00:57:16.081
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a super athlete and all he needed </v>

1333
00:57:16.081 --> 00:57:18.841
<v Speaker 3>was something behind him that he felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>confident with where he would have his </v>

1334
00:57:18.841 --> 00:57:18.841
<v Speaker 3>confidence when he has.</v>

1335
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:21.220
<v Speaker 3>When a kid has his head on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1336
00:57:21.221 --> 00:57:22.140
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody can beat him,</v>

1337
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.810
<v Speaker 3>but that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of can be broken.</v>

1338
00:57:25.811 --> 00:57:30.811
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen him break so many times and he </v>

1339
00:57:30.811 --> 00:57:33.091
<v Speaker 3>needs that something behind him that </v>
<v Speaker 3>gives him that little extra confidence </v>

1340
00:57:33.091 --> 00:57:35.260
<v Speaker 3>that pushes them past that barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't have it.</v>

1341
00:57:35.261 --> 00:57:40.261
<v Speaker 3>No ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This superbad because when in his prime </v>

1342
00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:43.111
<v Speaker 3>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a stunning athlete when were </v>

1343
00:57:43.111 --> 00:57:46.181
<v Speaker 3>talking about a guy who entered into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing bow with Masato and dropped </v>

1344
00:57:46.181 --> 00:57:50.230
<v Speaker 3>him when he was a wrestler essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1345
00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:54.400
<v Speaker 3>and he's fighting one against one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best Japanese kickboxers of all times.</v>

1346
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 3>He was there the whole time when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>first came in from wrestling.</v>

1347
00:57:56.891 --> 00:58:01.891
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's defending Jujitsu moves just being </v>

1348
00:58:01.891 --> 00:58:01.891
<v Speaker 3>a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even understanding.</v>

1349
00:58:01.891 --> 00:58:04.520
<v Speaker 3>It's just on a natural instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you don't see much in wrestling.</v>

1350
00:58:04.521 --> 00:58:09.521
<v Speaker 3>And arresting has this bad habits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stretching their arms all using their </v>

1351
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:09.521
<v Speaker 3>arms and getting locked up a lot.</v>

1352
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:12.760
<v Speaker 3>But he was just sobbing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was defending from the arm bars,</v>

1353
00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:15.280
<v Speaker 3>took him to Thailand and he started </v>
<v Speaker 3>picking on the standing right away.</v>

1354
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:19.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean the guy was natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a confidence thing and kid.</v>

1355
00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:20.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still think he has it today,</v>

1356
00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:23.200
<v Speaker 3>but he just doesn't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That confidence.</v>

1357
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he first fought in the UFC against </v>

1358
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:30.751
<v Speaker 3>a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yamamoto and then against or against a </v>

1359
00:58:30.751 --> 00:58:30.751
<v Speaker 3>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Demetrius Johnson.</v>

1360
00:58:30.751 --> 00:58:32.800
<v Speaker 3>And then against Vaughn Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was telling everybody,</v>

1361
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:33.280
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1362
00:58:33.281 --> 00:58:38.281
<v Speaker 3>wait till you see this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then by the time he got into the </v>

1363
00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:40.651
<v Speaker 3>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had already lost some of his </v>

1364
00:58:40.651 --> 00:58:40.651
<v Speaker 3>momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lost some of its fire.</v>

1365
00:58:40.651 --> 00:58:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the fire that he had when he </v>

1366
00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:44.420
<v Speaker 3>knocked out Hoya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gracie or the father that he had when he</v>

1367
00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:46.720
<v Speaker 3>was in his fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

1368
00:58:46.721 --> 00:58:50.040
<v Speaker 3>He was a bad motherfucker when he was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his prime was like,</v>

1369
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1370
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:53.200
<v Speaker 3>he was just a freak.</v>

1371
00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Just a real unusual athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel I know what's missing in </v>

1372
00:58:58.310 --> 00:58:58.310
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1373
00:58:58.310 --> 00:58:58.840
<v Speaker 3>If I went and started training with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1374
00:58:58.841 --> 00:59:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I could get right back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be there,</v>

1375
00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:01.360
<v Speaker 3>I can get them right back to what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1376
00:59:01.361 --> 00:59:06.361
<v Speaker 3>But I don't want to deal with the father</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to be with the loyalty </v>

1377
00:59:06.361 --> 00:59:10.651
<v Speaker 3>issues that he runs a shall issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the state of Japanese MMA now?</v>

1378
00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:15.220
<v Speaker 3>It was gigantic for awhile when Soccer </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rabo was big.</v>

1379
00:59:15.221 --> 00:59:18.610
<v Speaker 3>When you were huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When pride was filling 90,000</v>

1380
00:59:18.611 --> 00:59:20.410
<v Speaker 3>seat arenas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>

1381
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.960
<v Speaker 3>It was like nothing else.</v>

1382
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:27.820
<v Speaker 2>So like I experienced 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Rogers in Canada when George St </v>

1383
00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Pierre fought jake shields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine 30 more thousand </v>

1384
00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:33.110
<v Speaker 2>people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you were there for that.</v>

1385
00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:39.060
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if that was a 10 and before we </v>

1386
00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:40.960
<v Speaker 3>may actually came out when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>only had pancreas and that was a one.</v>

1387
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:46.320
<v Speaker 3>It said like a Ford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now what happened is Yakuza </v>

1388
00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:46.810
<v Speaker 3>involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1389
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:48.910
<v Speaker 3>the thing that people don't realize is </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Japan,</v>

1390
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.910
<v Speaker 3>everything is Ya'lls involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every big company,</v>

1391
00:59:51.911 --> 00:59:54.210
<v Speaker 3>every big promotion shooto chose to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1392
00:59:54.211 --> 00:59:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Didn't ever get a yuck his involvement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're there.</v>

1393
00:59:56.890 --> 01:00:01.890
<v Speaker 3>They're backed Subito shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the second largest group of </v>

1394
01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:01.890
<v Speaker 3>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1395
01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.760
<v Speaker 3>so everyone has yakuza connections to </v>
<v Speaker 3>any big Coca Cola company.</v>

1396
01:00:03.761 --> 01:00:08.761
<v Speaker 3>Johnson and Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any company has yet because the </v>

1397
01:00:08.761 --> 01:00:08.761
<v Speaker 3>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1398
01:00:08.761 --> 01:00:09.190
<v Speaker 3>But it's not public.</v>

1399
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.670
<v Speaker 2>So say if Coca Cola goes over there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they open up a plant in Japan,</v>

1400
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:15.680
<v Speaker 2>they must go through the Yakuza.</v>

1401
01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.720
<v Speaker 3>They will have that connections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1402
01:00:17.721 --> 01:00:19.670
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do they negotiate that?</v>

1403
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really easy.</v>

1404
01:00:21.321 --> 01:00:21.660
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1405
01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:23.510
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a turf thing.</v>

1406
01:00:23.511 --> 01:00:25.010
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know somebody,</v>

1407
01:00:25.011 --> 01:00:25.870
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1408
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:30.560
<v Speaker 3>it's a percentage of pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty given thing.</v>

1409
01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1410
01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pink accepted,</v>

1411
01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:35.900
<v Speaker 3>accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accepted.</v>

1412
01:00:35.901 --> 01:00:38.690
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny how when it became public,</v>

1413
01:00:38.691 --> 01:00:41.980
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it got really bad because it's a,</v>

1414
01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:45.350
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing is accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's frowned upon.</v>

1415
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.280
<v Speaker 3>It's something that they know they need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a part of in society,</v>

1416
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.150
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want to make it public </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Oculus has,</v>

1417
01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.050
<v Speaker 3>does have a bad name.</v>

1418
01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.330
<v Speaker 2>That was the only place where I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>been with a.</v>

1419
01:00:56.331 --> 01:01:00.440
<v Speaker 2>asked me to cover up my tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was weird,</v>

1420
01:01:00.441 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 2>that's why I try to keep them out</v>

1421
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:05.330
<v Speaker 3>from my sleep so it comes up from here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but after that I stopped because I don't</v>

1422
01:01:05.331 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 3>want to walk around and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be kicked out of places,</v>

1423
01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:13.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just got denied to go in a hotel </v>

1424
01:01:13.631 --> 01:01:13.631
<v Speaker 3>like last week when I was in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1425
01:01:13.631 --> 01:01:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of my tattoos</v>

1426
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.460
<v Speaker 2>with the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

1427
01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they saw the Hoodie.</v>

1428
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:21.680
<v Speaker 2>It covers it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps me.</v>

1429
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got A.</v>

1430
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:27.620
<v Speaker 2>I got kicked out of a gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made me go put a long sleeve shirt </v>

1431
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:28.790
<v Speaker 2>on the gyms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Gyms at Gold's gym on the chair.</v>

1432
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.320
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1433
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.630
<v Speaker 2>What is it represented?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese.</v>

1434
01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.090
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

1435
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:38.090
<v Speaker 3>represents the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gangsters and you've got to figure when </v>

1436
01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:41.550
<v Speaker 3>you have a gang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two or three top men.</v>

1437
01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Those men are awesome people and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got the rest of the hundreds and </v>

1438
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:48.210
<v Speaker 3>thousands that are punks and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones that you see.</v>

1439
01:01:48.211 --> 01:01:51.910
<v Speaker 3>So basically a gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone with tattoos which equals Yakuza</v>

1440
01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 3>would mean trouble and they would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go into sports gym and you're </v>

1441
01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:00.010
<v Speaker 3>working out next to a guy and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1442
01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:05.020
<v Speaker 3>you're working on say you take his </v>
<v Speaker 3>weights by oxen casino in the middle of </v>

1443
01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:05.730
<v Speaker 3>the set and if you're doing it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that's a normal person,</v>

1444
01:02:05.731 --> 01:02:06.300
<v Speaker 3>he'll just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1445
01:02:06.301 --> 01:02:07.500
<v Speaker 3>I was using those ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh sorry.</v>

1446
01:02:07.501 --> 01:02:12.501
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it might be different for the </v>

1447
01:02:12.501 --> 01:02:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Yakuza and people would rather not work </v>
<v Speaker 3>out in the area if there's a guy working</v>

1448
01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:16.350
<v Speaker 3>on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a bad rap.</v>

1449
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's justifiable though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can that the</v>

1450
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 4>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they went in and bought pride,</v>

1451
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:25.080
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a crazy story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they paid $65,</v>

1452
01:02:25.081 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 4>million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They bought pride and they thought,</v>

1453
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:27.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1454
01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:32.811
<v Speaker 4>we're going to run pride as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>UFC the same way they did with </v>

1455
01:02:32.811 --> 01:02:33.390
<v Speaker 4>strikeforce when they bought </v>
<v Speaker 4>strikeforce.</v>

1456
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.780
<v Speaker 4>They kept strikeforce going for years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They thought they were going to do that,</v>

1457
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:40.830
<v Speaker 4>but meanwhile it turned out all of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>contracts are illegal.</v>

1458
01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 4>They really didn't have anybody under </v>
<v Speaker 4>contract.</v>

1459
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.380
<v Speaker 4>They spent $65 million in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All they really got was a video library </v>

1460
01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:53.270
<v Speaker 4>and then while they had offices in Japan</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were hiring these people and </v>

1461
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:57.291
<v Speaker 4>painful and they were starting up dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were starting up their own </v>

1462
01:02:57.291 --> 01:02:57.900
<v Speaker 4>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>organizing everything and yeah.</v>

1463
01:02:57.901 --> 01:02:59.590
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1464
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:04.700
<v Speaker 4>the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it took years before they could come </v>

1465
01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.560
<v Speaker 4>back and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>UFC there they took,</v>

1466
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.690
<v Speaker 4>it took a long time.</v>

1467
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Dana was getting like some like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>underworld threats and you know,</v>

1468
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.040
<v Speaker 3>running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1469
01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:12.080
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I heard.</v>

1470
01:03:12.081 --> 01:03:15.500
<v Speaker 3>I sorry I sent an email on that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>if anything I have a lot of pulling that</v>

1471
01:03:15.501 --> 01:03:19.070
<v Speaker 3>side and I told him that if you have any</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with that I can help you.</v>

1472
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:22.320
<v Speaker 4>What would he have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come to you and then you go to</v>

1473
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.890
<v Speaker 3>directed in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1474
01:03:24.891 --> 01:03:26.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

1475
01:03:26.031 --> 01:03:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't know the person directly,</v>

1476
01:03:27.921 --> 01:03:31.310
<v Speaker 3>I have guys at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if he had any type of problem,</v>

1477
01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:32.750
<v Speaker 3>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it still stands today.</v>

1478
01:03:32.751 --> 01:03:35.120
<v Speaker 3>If Dana has any type of underworld </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems there,</v>

1479
01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.130
<v Speaker 3>if he calls me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take care of it for them.</v>

1480
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:42.510
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting that there's such an </v>
<v Speaker 4>underworld presence in Japan because it </v>

1481
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:43.420
<v Speaker 4>seems so safe when you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is so.</v>

1482
01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:46.450
<v Speaker 4>People are so polite and you don't see </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>

1483
01:03:46.451 --> 01:03:50.080
<v Speaker 4>You don't see like you see drunk people </v>
<v Speaker 4>walking into the street and no one hurts</v>

1484
01:03:50.081 --> 01:03:50.680
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>

1485
01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's fine.</v>

1486
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Walk down dark lanes and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1487
01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:58.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange sort of contrast.</v>

1488
01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:01.680
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like you just have bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas.</v>

1489
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.270
<v Speaker 3>They can change it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have over 300 yards.</v>

1490
01:04:05.271 --> 01:04:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Was offices there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roppongi only has three.</v>

1491
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1492
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:13.670
<v Speaker 3>So you got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are districts that their </v>

1493
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.670
<v Speaker 3>accumulated in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have offices,</v>

1494
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.860
<v Speaker 3>they have offices.</v>

1495
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.150
<v Speaker 4>The Mafia doesn't El Office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that's the thing for</v>

1496
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:19.650
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I grew up in America.</v>

1497
01:04:19.651 --> 01:04:22.440
<v Speaker 3>So for me the mafia just scares me way </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

1498
01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:22.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1499
01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.050
<v Speaker 3>I have this image that you screw it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mafia,</v>

1500
01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.080
<v Speaker 3>you better change your name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were to move and you better hide who</v>

1501
01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:30.690
<v Speaker 3>your family is and you better get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell out of just disappear.</v>

1502
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:34.140
<v Speaker 3>But when you get in trouble with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Yakuza um,</v>

1503
01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:36.030
<v Speaker 3>I've been in trouble with them before </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1504
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:41.031
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you can kind of pretty much </v>

1505
01:04:41.031 --> 01:04:41.031
<v Speaker 3>deal with them the way you want to deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them,</v>

1506
01:04:41.031 --> 01:04:42.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on how much you're willing to</v>

1507
01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:46.800
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice and for what was your issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them?</v>

1508
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a wonder kid,</v>

1509
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:50.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1510
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

1511
01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:58.130
<v Speaker 3>this young guy who wanted to open up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gym and I agreed to open up a gym with </v>

1512
01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:02.331
<v Speaker 3>him called purebred Tokyo killer bee and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just told them that only thing you </v>

1513
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:07.551
<v Speaker 3>have to do is you have to hire two of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters so they can make a living </v>

1514
01:05:07.551 --> 01:05:07.551
<v Speaker 3>through fighting.</v>

1515
01:05:07.551 --> 01:05:08.730
<v Speaker 3>And I wanted to help them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want no money.</v>

1516
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.640
<v Speaker 3>He can use my name or my gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to hire my two fighters.</v>

1517
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:16.670
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they acquired kid and they're hardwired </v>

1518
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.670
<v Speaker 3>and bowl and those are the fighters and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was good.</v>

1519
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:21.291
<v Speaker 3>And what happened was kids started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess from the influence of his </v>

1520
01:05:21.291 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 3>father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He started being,</v>

1521
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:27.250
<v Speaker 3>the loyalty issue in him was getting was</v>
<v Speaker 3>wavering where he wasn't telling me </v>

1522
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:27.700
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was hiding stuff.</v>

1523
01:05:27.701 --> 01:05:32.701
<v Speaker 3>He's lying to me and then I put that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy in charge of them that ran the </v>

1524
01:05:32.701 --> 01:05:33.160
<v Speaker 3>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I told him,</v>

1525
01:05:33.161 --> 01:05:34.170
<v Speaker 3>I called him and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1526
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:39.210
<v Speaker 3>What's going on man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta take care of it because I'll </v>

1527
01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:39.210
<v Speaker 3>take care of her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take care of.</v>

1528
01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:40.210
<v Speaker 3>He's told me that and it got to a point </v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't take care of it.</v>

1529
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 3>So I called him and I was pissed 30 by </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and I called him and said,</v>

1530
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:45.570
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1531
01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:48.010
<v Speaker 3>Call me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He avoided my calls for three days,</v>

1532
01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:48.930
<v Speaker 3>so three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

1533
01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:50.910
<v Speaker 3>three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sitting there,</v>

1534
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:53.590
<v Speaker 3>this guy to running from me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking this is ridiculous.</v>

1535
01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:54.670
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1536
01:05:54.671 --> 01:05:56.410
<v Speaker 3>this guy's running from me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to look for them.</v>

1537
01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to pop up is these guys had </v>

1538
01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:01.460
<v Speaker 3>charter to run their pop up all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1539
01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:05.341
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sitting there watching the Uno </v>

1540
01:06:05.341 --> 01:06:06.490
<v Speaker 3>kid flight and kid wins a fight and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's in the ring jumping and hug him.</v>

1541
01:06:06.491 --> 01:06:08.880
<v Speaker 3>And theme as a mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is hiding from me.</v>

1542
01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.740
<v Speaker 3>He's on national TV hugging me saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hansen,</v>

1543
01:06:11.741 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess is it.</v>

1544
01:06:14.141 --> 01:06:18.550
<v Speaker 3>So I called my students until the final </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the after party is adulthood after</v>

1545
01:06:18.551 --> 01:06:23.551
<v Speaker 3>part now is literally going to walk in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and grab that guy with the hair </v>

1546
01:06:23.551 --> 01:06:23.551
<v Speaker 3>and pull them out with party.</v>

1547
01:06:23.551 --> 01:06:25.060
<v Speaker 3>But my students felt he was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a problem,</v>

1548
01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 3>is going to be too much commotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cops are going to be called.</v>

1549
01:06:27.521 --> 01:06:32.521
<v Speaker 3>So they decide to get them in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They brought them up and brought him to </v>

1550
01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:33.790
<v Speaker 3>the park and pretty much beat him for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 20 minutes,</v>

1551
01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:38.791
<v Speaker 3>which is something he shouldn't do in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan because in the Yakuza world they </v>

1552
01:06:38.791 --> 01:06:39.480
<v Speaker 3>work by face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They work by being tough,</v>

1553
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:44.510
<v Speaker 3>being scary to collect money and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you've got all got a black guy </v>

1554
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:48.571
<v Speaker 3>and bruises on her face is kind of goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the fact that they're tough </v>

1555
01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:48.571
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1556
01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:52.450
<v Speaker 3>So I beat him up pretty bad and I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But see,</v>

1557
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:57.451
<v Speaker 3>the thing is I never did pick on anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never did do anything without a </v>

1558
01:06:57.451 --> 01:07:01.021
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I believe that I would die for my </v>

1559
01:07:01.021 --> 01:07:03.721
<v Speaker 3>beliefs tomorrow and I believed that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was right and this guy really deserved </v>

1560
01:07:03.721 --> 01:07:03.721
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>

1561
01:07:03.721 --> 01:07:07.150
<v Speaker 3>So if they didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the top guys didn't like it,</v>

1562
01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:08.950
<v Speaker 3>then they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know where to find me.</v>

1563
01:07:08.951 --> 01:07:13.951
<v Speaker 3>And so what happened was it was going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>for 20 minutes and when I went down I </v>

1564
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:15.080
<v Speaker 3>let people in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people,</v>

1565
01:07:15.081 --> 01:07:16.720
<v Speaker 3>all my friends know and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 3>worried.</v>

1566
01:07:16.721 --> 01:07:21.721
<v Speaker 3>So they made calls and we had two other </v>
<v Speaker 3>Yakuza guys come down to the scene to </v>

1567
01:07:21.721 --> 01:07:23.470
<v Speaker 3>try and stop me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to kind of get in between,</v>

1568
01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:26.130
<v Speaker 3>not stop me physically but to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1569
01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:31.220
<v Speaker 3>to ask for forgiveness for this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're kind of like bawling in the </v>

1570
01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:35.520
<v Speaker 3>middle of me and the guy that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting around and just giving them wax </v>

1571
01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:35.520
<v Speaker 3>at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he,</v>

1572
01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:40.020
<v Speaker 3>if he were to fall from a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd grab them and standing right back </v>

1573
01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:40.020
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1574
01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:40.570
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of getting really.</v>

1575
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:41.290
<v Speaker 3>He was all bloody.</v>

1576
01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:44.770
<v Speaker 3>And then these guys are kind of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends too.</v>

1577
01:07:44.771 --> 01:07:46.300
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't going to get involved with.</v>

1578
01:07:46.301 --> 01:07:50.200
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to stop me from going too</v>
<v Speaker 3>far and when we,</v>

1579
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:55.470
<v Speaker 3>there's this old lady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how you have the old ladies in </v>

1580
01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:55.470
<v Speaker 3>the neighborhood that don't give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>who you are.</v>

1581
01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:59.460
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this lady comes on and starts screaming </v>

1582
01:07:59.460 --> 01:07:59.830
<v Speaker 3>at us that it gets on the lady and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1583
01:07:59.831 --> 01:08:00.130

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1584
01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:01.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't do that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go.</v>

1585
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:04.930
<v Speaker 3>So he moved over to the next part and as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're moving on with the next part,</v>

1586
01:08:04.931 --> 01:08:09.931
<v Speaker 3>like three African monkeys disguise </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher ups to find out what's happening </v>

1587
01:08:09.931 --> 01:08:11.170

<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

1621
01:09:12.311 --> 01:09:12.810
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1627
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:24.460

<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1628
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:27.370
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you agree for you what you.</v>

1629
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:32.550
<v Speaker 3>If you had somebody fuck you over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you decide to just do 10 percent out of </v>

1630
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:35.200
<v Speaker 3>respect to the people behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you think that's fair?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Interesting Code.</v>

1635
01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:51.810
<v Speaker 3>The believe in the underworld side is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two sides of the fences,</v>

1636
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:54.900
<v Speaker 3>the legal side of the illegal side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the legitimate site,</v>

1637
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.300
<v Speaker 3>and you are never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>

<v Speaker 3>have a legitimate problem.</v>

1639
01:09:59.410 --> 01:10:04.410
<v Speaker 3>You are never ever allowed to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other site to get help you.</v>

1640
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.960
<v Speaker 3>If you're going gonna stay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get other guys to help </v>

<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

1642
01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.570
<v Speaker 3>But if you ever go to authorities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose face and you can never can </v>

1643
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.570
<v Speaker 3>never work in that world again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1644
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:21.070
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to deal with things on your </v>

1645
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.070
<v Speaker 4>own</v>

1646
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.070
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1647
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:22.560
<v Speaker 3>you pretty much if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1648
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:27.610
<v Speaker 3>if you're someone from the outside and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like a regular businessman and </v>

1649
01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:31.211
<v Speaker 3>these guys come and bother you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best thing to do is go to the </v>

1650
01:10:31.211 --> 01:10:34.261
<v Speaker 3>authorities because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the police are just waiting to grab the </v>

1651
01:10:34.261 --> 01:10:34.960
<v Speaker 3>buses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's psycho role.</v>

1652
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:37.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like Kryptonite to the adolescence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go say you're going to the police</v>

1653
01:10:37.551 --> 01:10:40.510
<v Speaker 3>still back off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I,</v>

1654
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.880
<v Speaker 3>I live my life in that side pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1655
01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:49.420
<v Speaker 3>A lot of my friends are part of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups and a lot of my beliefs run </v>

1656
01:10:49.911 --> 01:10:51.800
<v Speaker 3>really deep with their beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1657
01:10:51.801 --> 01:10:52.490
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1658
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:53.510
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>

1659
01:10:53.511 --> 01:10:58.511
<v Speaker 3>is you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and you hear about the Yakuza they </v>

1660
01:10:58.511 --> 01:10:58.511
<v Speaker 3>get a bad rap because you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>child pornography,</v>

1661
01:10:58.511 --> 01:10:59.330
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1662
01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.610
<v Speaker 3>extortion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1663
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:02.620
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1664
01:11:02.621 --> 01:11:04.970
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they steal money from people,</v>

1665
01:11:04.971 --> 01:11:08.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that they don't see that's</v>

1666
01:11:08.141 --> 01:11:09.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all the things in the media,</v>

1667
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.040
<v Speaker 3>but the things that they don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I feel is a really unfortunate.</v>

1668
01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:18.290
<v Speaker 3>The honor and the loyalty they have for </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and that's where me and then </v>

1669
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.290
<v Speaker 3>click really well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1670
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:23.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean they will die for anyone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow they'll go to jail for 10 years</v>

1671
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:26.820
<v Speaker 3>for their boss tomorrow if they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1672
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:29.250
<v Speaker 3>you don't see that type of loyalty </v>
<v Speaker 3>around all these,</v>

1673
01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:31.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>non America and I love that.</v>

1674
01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.250
<v Speaker 3>I think that loyalty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1675
01:11:33.251 --> 01:11:34.950
<v Speaker 3>and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1676
01:11:34.951 --> 01:11:36.640
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why they respect me so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much as you.</v>

1677
01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.630
<v Speaker 3>I will die for my values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll die for my people that are close to</v>

1678
01:11:39.631 --> 01:11:44.631
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just such an unbelievably </v>

1679
01:11:44.631 --> 01:11:45.530
<v Speaker 3>fascinating culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How different Japan is in so many ways.</v>

1680
01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:46.950
<v Speaker 3>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's big gaps in it.</v>

1681
01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

1682
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1683
01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:54.831
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that all these different </v>

1684
01:11:54.831 --> 01:11:58.850
<v Speaker 2>cultures evolve independently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Japanese culture evolved </v>

1685
01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:03.441
<v Speaker 2>independently from the American culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>independently from the European culture </v>

1686
01:12:03.441 --> 01:12:03.441
<v Speaker 2>and it's so different.</v>

1687
01:12:03.441 --> 01:12:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is all you think all the places are </v>

1688
01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:07.780
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1689
01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.911
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to really move into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different country and run yourself in </v>

1690
01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.460
<v Speaker 3>the way that you learned in another </v>
<v Speaker 3>country because it's,</v>

1691
01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:14.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1692
01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:19.730
<v Speaker 2>when enrollment is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about the state of </v>

1693
01:12:19.730 --> 01:12:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Japanese mma right now because it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of in a transitionary period if one at </v>

1694
01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:27.471
<v Speaker 2>one point in time it was gigantic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say Yakuza involvement is why </v>

1695
01:12:27.471 --> 01:12:31.610
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate sponsors backed out and then </v>

1696
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:32.250
<v Speaker 2>they lost a lot of viewership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

1697
01:12:32.251 --> 01:12:36.840
<v Speaker 2>it was jet not that long ago that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were selling out these gigantic places.</v>

1698
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:39.430
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on right now or</v>

1699
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.370
<v Speaker 3>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1700
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.270
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's under number four right now.</v>

1701
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:47.390
<v Speaker 3>Just people that are real hesitant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not many sponsors that want to </v>

1702
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.460
<v Speaker 3>put money into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1703
01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:52.850
<v Speaker 3>on the flip side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big things that's happening is </v>

1704
01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:53.670
<v Speaker 3>gangster events where they allow </v>
<v Speaker 3>gangsters to fight in the ring.</v>

1705
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:55.530
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy,</v>

1706
01:12:55.531 --> 01:12:57.600
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I attended all of those.</v>

1707
01:12:57.601 --> 01:13:02.601
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a guest and most of them they </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay me to just to be there and to judge </v>

1708
01:13:02.601 --> 01:13:06.021
<v Speaker 3>sometimes to make a speech in that ring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe in the beginning because I'm so </v>

1709
01:13:06.021 --> 01:13:07.170
<v Speaker 3>respected in that world that to have me </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1710
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:09.100
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these gangsters toned down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1711
01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.560
<v Speaker 3>when they want to riot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't riot,</v>

1712
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:15.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you go to the event and it's not </v>

1713
01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.260
<v Speaker 3>unusual to see a picture of two stick </v>
<v Speaker 3>figures fighting and has a big </v>

1714
01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:18.510
<v Speaker 3>excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dark.</v>

1715
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Don't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that given?</v>

1716
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:26.630
<v Speaker 3>You've never seen any signs of the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying please don't fight in the </v>

1717
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.940
<v Speaker 3>audience is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's already given this.</v>

1718
01:13:26.941 --> 01:13:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Not something you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1719
01:13:29.011 --> 01:13:34.011
<v Speaker 3>so that's a big thing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's good because the gangster </v>

1720
01:13:34.011 --> 01:13:34.380
<v Speaker 3>events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually they,</v>

1721
01:13:34.381 --> 01:13:35.800
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have headbutts,</v>

1722
01:13:35.801 --> 01:13:38.870
<v Speaker 3>they have elbow striking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can split Stom,</v>

1723
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.220
<v Speaker 3>you can need the groin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do whatever.</v>

1724
01:13:41.221 --> 01:13:44.520
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much they have to on one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to one tool.</v>

1725
01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:46.320
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy though.</v>

1726
01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.660
<v Speaker 3>How often do they have these funds on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bowl?</v>

1727
01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Once a month now there's some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1728
01:13:51.061 --> 01:13:53.790
<v Speaker 3>and it's like these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's become,</v>

1729
01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:58.800
<v Speaker 3>it's a good trend because it's become </v>
<v Speaker 3>where these guys just came off the </v>

1730
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.821
<v Speaker 3>streets singing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're tough gassing on in one minute </v>

1731
01:14:01.821 --> 01:14:01.821
<v Speaker 3>from these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually spending time in the gym though</v>

1732
01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:04.260
<v Speaker 3>and being off the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a good movement.</v>

1733
01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.840
<v Speaker 3>A lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's about three or four gangsters </v>

1734
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:09.840
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this,</v>

1735
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.450
<v Speaker 3>she made their pro debut in deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1736
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:16.500
<v Speaker 3>These guys are actually gonna run gangs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and start selling drugs and doing </v>

1737
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.940
<v Speaker 3>illegal activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not training and having a future</v>

1738
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:20.050
<v Speaker 3>in fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is awesome.</v>

1739
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.740
<v Speaker 3>As far as the legitimate side of mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1740
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:27.880
<v Speaker 3>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see it picking up again and it's </v>

1741
01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.211
<v Speaker 3>all due to the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the UFC has done a couple of events </v>

1742
01:14:30.211 --> 01:14:32.350
<v Speaker 3>there now in the last one they did that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I went to that,</v>

1743
01:14:32.351 --> 01:14:33.340
<v Speaker 3>it was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

1744
01:14:33.341 --> 01:14:34.480
<v Speaker 3>that's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1745
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:40.470
<v Speaker 3>as much as the Japanese fans are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing hope in Japanese mma because a </v>

1746
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:42.580
<v Speaker 3>lot of productions were folding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1747
01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we went to,</v>

1748
01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.910
<v Speaker 3>when I went to the USC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1749
01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 3>I felt that that energy again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was fighting in pride,</v>

1750
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:54.271
<v Speaker 3>that energy that they had in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience and especially when rampage </v>

1751
01:14:54.271 --> 01:14:57.631
<v Speaker 3>came out with the pride music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gave me goosebumps because when he </v>

1752
01:14:57.631 --> 01:15:01.201
<v Speaker 3>came out to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked around the arena and I was </v>

1753
01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:01.201
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

1754
01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:01.201
<v Speaker 3>this is a psycho pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

1755
01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:02.790
<v Speaker 3>this is a pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>

1756
01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:07.791
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the first time since that big </v>

1757
01:15:07.791 --> 01:15:09.901
<v Speaker 3>incident with the Yakuza will vomit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pride that I've actually seen that </v>

1758
01:15:09.901 --> 01:15:09.901
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1759
01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:13.060
<v Speaker 3>it was surreal to me actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1760
01:15:13.061 --> 01:15:13.770
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is gonna.</v>

1761
01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:17.350
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be the ticket back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the UFC coming to Japan?</v>

1762
01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:22.310
<v Speaker 2>If the UFC did an ultimate fighter in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan and Japanese version of it,</v>

1763
01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.750
<v Speaker 2>would you be interested in coaching?</v>

1764
01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh definitely.</v>

1765
01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:27.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to.</v>

1766
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.980
<v Speaker 3>That would be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be,</v>

1767
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:31.840
<v Speaker 3>you would really be perfect for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1770
01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:39.140
<v Speaker 2>I hope they do it because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to do that in other </v>

1771
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:39.140
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1772
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.781
<v Speaker 2>You saw they did in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smashes the Brazilian show mean it's a </v>

1773
01:15:41.781 --> 01:15:43.020
<v Speaker 2>natural for it eventually to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan.</v>

1774
01:15:43.021 --> 01:15:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1775
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:44.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably inevitable.</v>

1776
01:15:44.861 --> 01:15:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someday.</v>

1777
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as far as like Japanese,</v>

1778
01:15:48.921 --> 01:15:53.921
<v Speaker 2>like standouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously probably one of the bigger </v>

1779
01:15:53.931 --> 01:15:55.160
<v Speaker 2>guys right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1780
01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.380
<v Speaker 2>And how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1781
01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Who were the other guys that are coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>up that you see?</v>

1782
01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:03.610
<v Speaker 3>I like Ricky Fukuda bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1783
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:09.130
<v Speaker 3>I used to train with them so I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little biased in that very good </v>

1784
01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:09.480
<v Speaker 3>wrestling and the guy's still young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a real hungry.</v>

1785
01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:14.500
<v Speaker 3>I think he just needs someone in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corner to keep that killer instinct </v>

1786
01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.970
<v Speaker 3>going because he's such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1787
01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.090
<v Speaker 3>And he's such a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1788
01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:21.670
<v Speaker 3>you got to convince this guy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is going to try and hurt you.</v>

1789
01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.670
<v Speaker 3>Got To hurt him first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1790
01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:28.300
<v Speaker 3>so he has that little titty beers </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of him that has got to be </v>

1791
01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:30.350
<v Speaker 3>ignited the gotta get get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get that on and get the grizzly on.</v>

1792
01:16:30.351 --> 01:16:32.360
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1793
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:33.530
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be a good fighter.</v>

1794
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.020
<v Speaker 2>What about a hot so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He.</v>

1795
01:16:36.021 --> 01:16:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1796
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

1797
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.040
<v Speaker 3>He's already good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>

1798
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's awesome.</v>

1799
01:16:39.821 --> 01:16:41.480
<v Speaker 3>I thought it will be call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to do better too.</v>

1800
01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One guy was some tough breaks.</v>

1801
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had some bad calls,</v>

1802
01:16:47.221 --> 01:16:48.210
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually,</v>

1803
01:16:48.211 --> 01:16:53.211
<v Speaker 3>the last one he actually did really </v>
<v Speaker 3>loose and it was a week I was going to </v>

1804
01:16:53.211 --> 01:16:53.211
<v Speaker 3>do something.</v>

1805
01:16:53.211 --> 01:16:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

1806
01:16:53.741 --> 01:16:56.800
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at the tail end of a long career.</v>

1807
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1808
01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:02.540
<v Speaker 2>How many years do you think our guy can </v>
<v Speaker 2>compete at a fate or level four?</v>

1809
01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only a certain amount of years </v>

1810
01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:10.080
<v Speaker 2>where your body can kind of red line at </v>
<v Speaker 2>those high and</v>

1811
01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.060
<v Speaker 4>keep it going when you were like top</v>

1812
01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.410
<v Speaker 3>form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll all depend on the fighter.</v>

1813
01:17:14.411 --> 01:17:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some,</v>

1814
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:17.680
<v Speaker 3>like afraid to like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe five,</v>

1815
01:17:17.681 --> 01:17:22.681
<v Speaker 3>six years of the fighter that goes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there training with everything he has </v>

1816
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.620
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and willing to die in the ring.</v>

1817
01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean not being not accepting the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that my,</v>

1818
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:31.720
<v Speaker 3>but fighting with the will to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole different thing,</v>

1819
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:37.110
<v Speaker 3>but then you've got another fight like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sakuraba schools in there and takes a </v>

1820
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:40.531
<v Speaker 3>fight in two days and it's just having </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun and does this smoke entrance coming </v>

1821
01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:42.010
<v Speaker 3>in with this riding a scooter and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1822
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.410
<v Speaker 3>actually literally having fun in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

1823
01:17:44.411 --> 01:17:46.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's first can go on forever,</v>

1824
01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:46.600
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1825
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:48.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sakharova man,</v>

1826
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:51.640
<v Speaker 4>that guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had some incredible finding.</v>

1827
01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.170
<v Speaker 4>That guy's got to retire though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to eat too much.</v>

1828
01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:59.171
<v Speaker 4>Hits the Melvin manhoef fight was </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking scary when Melvin manhoef was </v>

1829
01:17:59.171 --> 01:17:59.210
<v Speaker 4>beating on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He like,</v>

1830
01:17:59.211 --> 01:18:04.211
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't need that at this stage in </v>

1831
01:18:04.211 --> 01:18:04.211
<v Speaker 4>his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's done so much for the sport.</v>

1832
01:18:04.211 --> 01:18:04.211
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think he should.</v>

1833
01:18:04.211 --> 01:18:09.190
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to do another mom and </v>

1834
01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:09.190
<v Speaker 4>Alia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:12.461
<v Speaker 4>There's been so many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This has been so many beat downs and </v>

1836
01:18:12.461 --> 01:18:12.740
<v Speaker 4>he's had like in the later stages of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>career,</v>

1837
01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.850
<v Speaker 4>you got to really look at a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1838
01:18:14.851 --> 01:18:18.320
<v Speaker 4>like mail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but its ability to absorb punishment.</v>

1839
01:18:18.321 --> 01:18:19.820
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1841
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:24.640
<v Speaker 3>The one that freaked me out was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1842
01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:29.270
<v Speaker 3>the Nino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>El Nino and that it was weird.</v>

1843
01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:31.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's been taking too much hits.</v>

1844

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1845
01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:34.600
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no question.</v>

1846
01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:35.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1847
01:18:35.381 --> 01:18:36.580

<v Speaker 4>you were honest about yourself.</v>

1848
01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:39.190
<v Speaker 4>You're like five or six years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your styles,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

1850
01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.210
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1851
01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:45.390
<v Speaker 3>I write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write letters to everyone that's close</v>

1852
01:18:45.391 --> 01:18:47.070
<v Speaker 3>to me before every fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real.</v>

1853
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every time I come back to life in </v>

1854
01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:52.090
<v Speaker 3>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I burned them all.</v>

1855
01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So literally I'm training the three </v>

1856
01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.640
<v Speaker 3>months that I'm training for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm literally training not to die.</v>

1857
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:05.370
<v Speaker 3>And if you knew there was a possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to die in this search area.</v>

1858
01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Most people would avoid it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have to do.</v>

1859
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:12.720
<v Speaker 3>I have to walk there on my own will and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stress level for me.</v>

1860
01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:17.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could just take it later and </v>

1861
01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:18.360
<v Speaker 3>say it's a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have to like play it,</v>

1862
01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:23.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had you ever heard the tenacious </v>

1863
01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:23.480
<v Speaker 3>d song?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck me gently.</v>

1864
01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:25.590
<v Speaker 3>The girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no girl fight.</v>

1865
01:19:25.591 --> 01:19:27.930
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the girl ring entrance </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the ranch,</v>

1866
01:19:27.931 --> 01:19:28.860
<v Speaker 3>I put on headphones.</v>

1867
01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:32.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the song that was playing because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a joke song.</v>

1868
01:19:32.731 --> 01:19:34.360
<v Speaker 3>It's so it makes it license my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1869
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.280
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>

1870
01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:36.570
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to die today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1871
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:37.220
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1872
01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:42.260
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go into fights if it's the fights on </v>

1873
01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.500
<v Speaker 3>the 19th and someone asked me on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>21st I got a party,</v>

1874
01:19:43.501 --> 01:19:44.180
<v Speaker 3>can you come?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1875
01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:48.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm literally feeling inside men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I am at that party,</v>

1876
01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm super happy because that means I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

1877
01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really preparing for,</v>

1878
01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.840
<v Speaker 3>for death that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1879
01:19:55.410 --> 01:20:00.410
<v Speaker 3>And for me it's so stressful man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I actually didn't feel I could do</v>

1880
01:20:01.141 --> 01:20:06.141
<v Speaker 3>it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean every time I fought after I </v>

1881
01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:06.141
<v Speaker 3>fought win or lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always felt like shit nice to over.</v>

1882
01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:08.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm alive because I was willing to die </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the fight,</v>

1883
01:20:08.611 --> 01:20:13.560
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a little bit too intense for me,</v>

1884
01:20:13.561 --> 01:20:13.770
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1885
01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:18.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the closest you think you came </v>

1886
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.770
<v Speaker 3>to New York?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably eager.</v>

1887
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:20.010
<v Speaker 3>That was a crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually the fight where I,</v>

1888
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:22.320
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that I should retire because,</v>

1889
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:27.350
<v Speaker 3>not because of the beating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because I didn't think there was </v>

1890
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.930
<v Speaker 3>anything else in mma that would ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach me to be a stronger man.</v>

1891
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't once feel that I wanted to quit</v>

1892
01:20:32.391 --> 01:20:34.410
<v Speaker 3>or give up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never contemplated giving up at all.</v>

1893
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Not once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I got,</v>

1894
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I had a broken finger out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a broken jaw.</v>

1895
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:42.580
<v Speaker 3>I had um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a swollen brain prefer to your drum.</v>

1896
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:48.000
<v Speaker 3>And apparently my liver count was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>2000 times to normal person.</v>

1897
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.860
<v Speaker 3>You had a swollen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swollen brain.</v>

1898
01:20:49.861 --> 01:20:54.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they hospitalized me for the first </v>

1899
01:20:54.861 --> 01:20:58.670
<v Speaker 3>four days because they want it to cat </v>
<v Speaker 3>scan my brain every day because when </v>

1900
01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:00.810
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the swelling's impacting the veins,</v>

1901
01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:02.460
<v Speaker 3>if tears bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't tell.</v>

1902
01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:07.020
<v Speaker 3>And when the brain goes back to its size</v>
<v Speaker 3>and its not compacted anymore,</v>

1903
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.210
<v Speaker 3>if there's bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when you can tell the bleeding.</v>

1904
01:21:09.211 --> 01:21:11.340
<v Speaker 3>So they were worried that my brain might</v>
<v Speaker 3>be bleeding.</v>

1905
01:21:11.341 --> 01:21:14.220
<v Speaker 3>There might be bleeding in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1906
01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what,</v>

1907
01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.780
<v Speaker 3>while this is all going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you feeling?</v>

1908
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:21.360
<v Speaker 3>I feel fine really well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1909
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:23.110
<v Speaker 3>I kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is is that when,</v>

1910
01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:25.560
<v Speaker 3>if you watch the video of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it was done,</v>

1911
01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:27.940
<v Speaker 3>I remember laying down thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

1912
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:34.040
<v Speaker 3>got over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got To the first unit of the big 10 </v>

1913
01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:34.040
<v Speaker 3>minute Raul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1914
01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:34.040
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1915
01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.280
<v Speaker 3>you got best wrong second line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I cut him something.</v>

1916
01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:38.620
<v Speaker 3>We're going to stand good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start standing again almost on total toy</v>

1917
01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:43.640
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to open that cut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember Egan leaning over to me </v>

1918
01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:44.010
<v Speaker 3>and looking at me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stop the fight.</v>

1919
01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.300
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1920
01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:47.170
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1921
01:21:47.171 --> 01:21:48.870
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not sending the fight and we have</v>

1922
01:21:48.871 --> 01:21:53.871
<v Speaker 3>a rule that you don't throw a towel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the tower that we have in the </v>

1923
01:21:53.871 --> 01:21:55.590
<v Speaker 3>ring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's always throw it there into the</v>

1924
01:21:55.591 --> 01:22:00.591
<v Speaker 3>fancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was that bow quite throw it </v>

1925
01:22:00.591 --> 01:22:01.220
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when Egan told me that,</v>

1926
01:22:01.221 --> 01:22:01.890
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1927
01:22:01.891 --> 01:22:03.770
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to lay down at least seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

1928
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:06.220
<v Speaker 3>maybe 10 seconds to kind of recollect </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything.</v>

1929
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.920
<v Speaker 3>And he said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1930
01:22:07.921 --> 01:22:12.921
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to get up because Egan's going to </v>

1931
01:22:12.921 --> 01:22:12.921
<v Speaker 3>stop the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got.</v>

1932
01:22:12.921 --> 01:22:15.510
<v Speaker 3>I started getting up and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting up and walking to the corner,</v>

1933
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:21.710
<v Speaker 3>but my legs were under me and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the weirdest feeling because I </v>

1934
01:22:21.710 --> 01:22:23.640
<v Speaker 3>felt like my below my waist was a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>different machine.</v>

1935
01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was dragging on me.</v>

1936
01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:30.030
<v Speaker 3>I was seeing shit my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when I sat down in a corner,</v>

1937
01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.400
<v Speaker 3>when you see the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everyone says,</v>

1938
01:22:32.401 --> 01:22:33.660
<v Speaker 3>you know that I'm screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1939
01:22:33.661 --> 01:22:34.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1940
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:36.000
<v Speaker 3>because this guy's trying to stop the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1941
01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:41.001
<v Speaker 3>But we got two minutes between rounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that he comes in 10 seconds after I </v>

1942
01:22:41.001 --> 01:22:41.820
<v Speaker 3>sit down and sing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at me.</v>

1943
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Sagamore stopped the fight and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize how bad I looked,</v>

1944
01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:45.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was saying,</v>

1945
01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:45.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1946
01:22:45.991 --> 01:22:46.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1947
01:22:46.621 --> 01:22:48.390
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that there's two more minutes,</v>

1948
01:22:48.391 --> 01:22:53.391
<v Speaker 3>give me two more minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Checked me after the two minutes and </v>

1949
01:22:53.391 --> 01:22:53.391
<v Speaker 3>then we give your assessment of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm screaming.</v>

1950
01:22:53.391 --> 01:22:53.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1951
01:22:53.461 --> 01:22:54.090
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1952
01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:55.680
<v Speaker 3>And the decor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight,</v>

1953
01:22:55.681 --> 01:22:59.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it happened to happen was I,</v>

1954
01:22:59.031 --> 01:23:04.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a preferred your gentleman a lost </v>

1955
01:23:04.031 --> 01:23:05.410
<v Speaker 3>my balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically I couldn't if,</v>

1956
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:08.540
<v Speaker 3>unless I had like two days or three days</v>
<v Speaker 3>between their own,</v>

1957
01:23:08.730 --> 01:23:10.720
<v Speaker 3>I probably couldn't have done the secure</v>
<v Speaker 3>on anyway.</v>

1958
01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.720
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that made me really happy </v>

1959
01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:15.790
<v Speaker 3>about that is when I saw the video on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight,</v>

1960
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:17.380
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1961
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.870
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my heart and my spirit didn't die,</v>

1962
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as punishments I was taking.</v>

1963
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.740
<v Speaker 3>It was never an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1964
01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:28.360
<v Speaker 3>which really made me realize that if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>take any more than a beating down,</v>

1965
01:23:28.361 --> 01:23:30.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably die everything to myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1966
01:23:30.641 --> 01:23:31.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in mma,</v>

1967
01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:36.400
<v Speaker 3>that as far as the test in my heart and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tests as strong as a man is probably not</v>

1968
01:23:36.431 --> 01:23:37.510
<v Speaker 3>going to go any further than that.</v>

1969
01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:42.810
<v Speaker 2>So you were thinking that you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>retire because you proved to yourself </v>

1970
01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:43.030
<v Speaker 2>that you are willing to die literally.</v>

1971
01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1972
01:23:43.671 --> 01:23:48.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I already knew that wasn't going to be </v>

1973
01:23:48.671 --> 01:23:50.171
<v Speaker 3>the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't interested in grabbing a pride </v>

1974
01:23:50.171 --> 01:23:51.200
<v Speaker 3>belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I basically was fighting,</v>

1975
01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.020
<v Speaker 3>if you look at all my fights when I took</v>
<v Speaker 3>fights,</v>

1976
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:54.740
<v Speaker 3>it was always when they were at the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their game,</v>

1977
01:23:54.741 --> 01:23:57.020
<v Speaker 3>I took a heath hearing when he just beat</v>
<v Speaker 3>Erickson,</v>

1978
01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.510
<v Speaker 3>took no girl when he was a top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1979
01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:04.400
<v Speaker 3>I took a marker when he was still </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered a specimen,</v>

1980
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:09.690
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all of these fights that I took was </v>

1981
01:24:09.690 --> 01:24:09.690
<v Speaker 3>when people are at the top of your game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I took those fights,</v>

1982
01:24:09.690 --> 01:24:13.040
<v Speaker 3>not because I thought I could win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that there was the fights that</v>

1983
01:24:13.041 --> 01:24:14.090
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way I could win.</v>

1984
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:19.430
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason why I took those sites</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I thought I was going to put </v>

1985
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.430
<v Speaker 3>myself in somewhere.</v>

1986
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:23.270
<v Speaker 3>That was gonna test my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You went to sleep when the Nogueira </v>

1987
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.270
<v Speaker 3>fire?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1988
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:24.920
<v Speaker 3>You got caught in a triangle and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't tap.</v>

1989
01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:26.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do see,</v>

1990
01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:29.150
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a thing that people always ask me,</v>

1991
01:24:29.151 --> 01:24:34.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think that not tapping is about </v>

1992
01:24:34.151 --> 01:24:36.770
<v Speaker 3>being tough and being like macho and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being someone who kind of feel pain,</v>

1993
01:24:36.771 --> 01:24:38.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1994
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.250
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth of the matter is I have,</v>

1995
01:24:40.251 --> 01:24:42.860
<v Speaker 3>I have this saying that always referred </v>
<v Speaker 3>to as a strong man,</v>

1996
01:24:42.861 --> 01:24:45.710
<v Speaker 3>feels no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a man with the summer spirit,</v>

1997
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:49.280
<v Speaker 3>Yamamotoyama she feels pain but can </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue through the pain,</v>

1998
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:50.790
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's uh,</v>

1999
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:53.730
<v Speaker 3>when you fish for the recent were first </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the strong and Field Olympian.</v>

2000
01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>

2001
01:24:54.351 --> 01:24:56.060
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2002
01:24:56.061 --> 01:24:57.280
<v Speaker 3>read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second part is like,</v>

2003
01:24:58.230 --> 01:24:59.900
<v Speaker 3>I started really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really real.</v>

2004
01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:05.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real man is the one who feels </v>

2005
01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:05.260
<v Speaker 3>that pinball works truly pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2006
01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:05.260
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2007
01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:10.340
<v Speaker 3>the strong men fierce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no opponent but the man of Yonathan and </v>

2008
01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:12.170
<v Speaker 3>she fears opponent and sees a challenge </v>
<v Speaker 3>and takes it on head on,</v>

2009
01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.750
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's my belief in the fighting,</v>

2010
01:25:14.751 --> 01:25:16.220
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I fought,</v>

2011
01:25:16.221 --> 01:25:17.340
<v Speaker 3>that's what it was all about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2012
01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.770
<v Speaker 3>facing those fears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

2013
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:21.470
<v Speaker 2>fought after the ego fight though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fought,</v>

2014
01:25:21.471 --> 01:25:23.570
<v Speaker 2>you fought heath herring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you fought Nogueira,</v>

2015
01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.970
<v Speaker 2>then you fought and Ashita and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought Tommy.</v>

2016
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:27.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all,</v>

2017
01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:29.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so funny because it was all a thing</v>

2018
01:25:29.081 --> 01:25:31.750
<v Speaker 3>of my way of saying goodbye to fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2019
01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.760
<v Speaker 3>because when I fought the Igor I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

2020
01:25:37.361 --> 01:25:39.100
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could retire today,</v>

2021
01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:39.890
<v Speaker 3>but I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2022
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:43.720
<v Speaker 3>after all mma has done for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to give her fight.</v>

2023
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:45.400
<v Speaker 3>And I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said the hearing and pride,</v>

2024
01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:50.401
<v Speaker 3>Neil is going to retire to a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't want to give me the mic </v>

2025
01:25:50.401 --> 01:25:51.370
<v Speaker 3>and no one knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knew that I was retiring.</v>

2026
01:25:51.371 --> 01:25:54.430
<v Speaker 3>I just grabbed the mic and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is this,</v>

2027
01:25:54.431 --> 01:25:57.600
<v Speaker 3>the last of Yamaha mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone freaked out and that,</v>

2028
01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:00.550
<v Speaker 3>and the reason why I fucked a girl who </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because um,</v>

2029
01:26:00.551 --> 01:26:05.551
<v Speaker 3>when nine slash 11 happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend die in the second tower </v>

2030
01:26:05.551 --> 01:26:09.730
<v Speaker 3>and I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really felt that I was being </v>

2031
01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:11.900
<v Speaker 3>hypocritical because I would look into </v>
<v Speaker 3>see the special stuff in tv of the,</v>

2032
01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:16.220
<v Speaker 3>the building collapsing and really </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally feeling like Shit,</v>

2033
01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:21.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty much really dawning my day </v>

2034
01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:24.160
<v Speaker 3>and I can actually switch off the TV and</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk to the game center and laugh </v>

2035
01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:24.770
<v Speaker 3>without a problem with my friends.</v>

2036
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:26.530
<v Speaker 3>And I felt like a real prick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>

2037
01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:28.010
<v Speaker 3>There's no honor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2038
01:26:28.011 --> 01:26:29.570
<v Speaker 3>if you really feel shitty about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2039
01:26:29.571 --> 01:26:30.740
<v Speaker 3>do something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2040
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:36.310
<v Speaker 3>So I talked to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said what I want to do and I felt </v>

2041
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.310
<v Speaker 3>really shitty retire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had that wave of change and now seeing</v>

2042
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:38.120
<v Speaker 3>I got to be fricking real to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2043
01:26:38.121 --> 01:26:40.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to lose my honor funnel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take care of this shit.</v>

2044
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:41.990
<v Speaker 3>So I thought I'm wanting to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>army.</v>

2045
01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.740
<v Speaker 3>So he started running list and I tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to enlist.</v>

2046
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:46.700
<v Speaker 3>I was 34,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 36 account,</v>

2047
01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:51.701
<v Speaker 3>the cutoff age is 34 and the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing I couldn't get her own as a </v>

2048
01:26:51.701 --> 01:26:55.181
<v Speaker 3>tattoos are the uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head and the palm tattoos so I </v>

2049
01:26:55.181 --> 01:26:59.510
<v Speaker 3>couldn't enlist and my thing was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to list,</v>

2050
01:26:59.511 --> 01:27:04.511
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know I couldn't list or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought one of the US I want to fight </v>

2051
01:27:04.511 --> 01:27:05.720
<v Speaker 3>one more fight because I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to die there.</v>

2052
01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:10.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm going to come back </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentally deranged or I'll never be able </v>

2053
01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:10.960
<v Speaker 3>to fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I figured I wanted to say a farewell</v>

2054
01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:14.390
<v Speaker 3>fight and I asked for Vanderbilt and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they gave me vendor.</v>

2055
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:18.470
<v Speaker 3>It was $200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fight vendor and I was like,</v>

2056
01:27:18.471 --> 01:27:23.471
<v Speaker 3>are you guys just fucked up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've fought valiantly for free </v>

2057
01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:23.990
<v Speaker 3>because that's one guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured at the end,</v>

2058
01:27:23.991 --> 01:27:27.110
<v Speaker 3>my career with a bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd stand toe to toe dust clear.</v>

2059
01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:28.910
<v Speaker 3>Someone's going to be standing with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

2060
01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.740
<v Speaker 3>If it's vandelay fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good with it.</v>

2061
01:27:30.741 --> 01:27:33.320
<v Speaker 3>As long as it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Total talk to the very end,</v>

2062
01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.850
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was cool because I was seeing,</v>

2063
01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:37.610
<v Speaker 3>this is awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like picture perfect.</v>

2064
01:27:37.611 --> 01:27:38.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fight violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to war,</v>

2065
01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.220
<v Speaker 3>I dyed hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine,</v>

2066
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:41.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden,</v>

2067
01:27:41.991 --> 01:27:46.991
<v Speaker 3>two weeks into the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they called me and told me that they </v>

2068
01:27:46.991 --> 01:27:46.991
<v Speaker 3>wanted me to fight.</v>

2069
01:27:46.991 --> 01:27:46.991
<v Speaker 3>No Garrett.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2070
01:27:46.991 --> 01:27:50.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my ass kicked by a lot of </v>

2071
01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:50.440
<v Speaker 3>heavyweights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2072
01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2073
01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.010
<v Speaker 3>I kind of want to fight at my weight now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not interested in.</v>

2074
01:27:52.290 --> 01:27:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Or Gary who was pride champion at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2075
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:57.020
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was more real for me to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight Vander Lee.</v>

2076
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

2077
01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:03.490
<v Speaker 3>why did they change that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently what I finally did was they </v>

2078
01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:06.311
<v Speaker 3>got tomorrow so they tomorrow wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to fight Nogueira with the size </v>

2079
01:28:06.311 --> 01:28:07.670
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also tomorrow,</v>

2080
01:28:07.671 --> 01:28:12.671
<v Speaker 3>fod vandalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They figured it was a big draw for </v>

2081
01:28:12.671 --> 01:28:12.671
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tomorrow is a huge name in Japan.</v>

2082
01:28:12.671 --> 01:28:14.930
<v Speaker 3>So pro wrestling from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from some of the you,</v>

2083
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:17.250
<v Speaker 3>Uwf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uwf the progressing.</v>

2084
01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:22.260
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as a fireworks as a world will </v>

2085
01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:22.260
<v Speaker 3>love the incident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vandelay,</v>

2086
01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:24.620
<v Speaker 3>the Japanese crowd would love probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>

2087
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Vandelay bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>

2088
01:28:26.781 --> 01:28:27.890
<v Speaker 3>That would have been a crazy fight.</v>

2089
01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:32.450
<v Speaker 3>You and vandelay would've been in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Supernova.</v>

2090
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.480
<v Speaker 3>I would have my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My whole thing about fighting van Lewis </v>

2091
01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:40.000
<v Speaker 3>to push them backwards because every </v>
<v Speaker 3>time he gets he gets caught and every </v>

2092
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.991
<v Speaker 3>one of his fights and I always notice </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he says such fast recovery that as </v>

2093
01:28:43.991 --> 01:28:46.460
<v Speaker 3>he's going down to recover since shoots </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a single or double and he'll recover</v>

2094
01:28:46.461 --> 01:28:51.461
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I figured if I use me like toward </v>

2095
01:28:51.461 --> 01:28:51.740
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you move federally backwards,</v>

2096
01:28:51.741 --> 01:28:54.470
<v Speaker 3>he hit them going backwards and he falls</v>
<v Speaker 3>backwards and you can end the fight.</v>

2097
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Now knowing your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2098
01:28:58.311 --> 01:29:02.300
<v Speaker 3>your beliefs in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your philosophy of Yamato,</v>

2099
01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:07.380
<v Speaker 2>the marshy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you feel about the fights that </v>

2100
01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:10.680
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some obvious works over there.</v>

2101
01:29:10.770 --> 01:29:15.770
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some definite fights where </v>

2102
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:17.670
<v Speaker 2>people were paid to lose and paid to win</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was a lot of fuckery going on.</v>

2103
01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Did that drive you crazy?</v>

2104
01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.680
<v Speaker 3>It pisses me off to our went public on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2105
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Did you mean public or autocard occur?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm couple.</v>

2106
01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:27.360
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of coma was one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious.</v>

2107
01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2108
01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:30.950
<v Speaker 3>I went public on that and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to be nice about it.</v>

2109
01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:36.230
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for a fighter who's willing to </v>

2110
01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:39.161
<v Speaker 3>die in the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's total disrespect to go into our </v>

2111
01:29:39.161 --> 01:29:42.851
<v Speaker 3>ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're tripping our real blood and </v>

2112
01:29:42.851 --> 01:29:43.640
<v Speaker 3>sweat in and willing to die in and these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys are pulling works in there.</v>

2113
01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:47.450
<v Speaker 3>It's just totally disrespect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he,</v>

2114
01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:50.200
<v Speaker 3>when he did that day that it was such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big thing that the,</v>

2115
01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.820
<v Speaker 3>the MMA magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan actually interviewed me about that</v>

2116
01:29:53.210 --> 01:29:54.110
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't,</v>

2117
01:29:54.111 --> 01:29:59.111
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't be blatant and be a dick about </v>

2118
01:29:59.111 --> 01:29:59.111
<v Speaker 3>it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2119
01:29:59.111 --> 01:29:59.111
<v Speaker 3>he fought a fake fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a human.</v>

2120
01:29:59.111 --> 01:30:03.731
<v Speaker 3>He's a faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know I just said that the rules that </v>

2121
01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Takata fought and the rule set I flight </v>
<v Speaker 3>or two different rules and I believe the</v>

2122
01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:07.220
<v Speaker 3>rules that he fought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'd be in a different ring.</v>

2123
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:10.130
<v Speaker 3>So pretty much painting it out that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was bullshit fight,</v>

2124
01:30:10.131 --> 01:30:11.560
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2125
01:30:11.561 --> 01:30:16.561
<v Speaker 3>I just stated that way and Tacada got </v>
<v Speaker 3>pissed off at it and he banned all </v>

2126
01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:21.940
<v Speaker 3>interviews with me and stuck with Albert</v>
<v Speaker 3>together because Santa Clara was </v>

2127
01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:22.460
<v Speaker 3>fighting under Carter and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was kind of pissed off,</v>

2128
01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.770
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can go suck my eggs because,</v>

2129
01:30:24.771 --> 01:30:26.210
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm telling the truth.</v>

2130
01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.130
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty obvious.</v>

2131
01:30:28.131 --> 01:30:33.131
<v Speaker 2>The Coleman fight was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like pro wrestling and was so </v>

2132
01:30:33.131 --> 01:30:34.060
<v Speaker 2>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like almost going to tap and uh,</v>

2133
01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:37.910
<v Speaker 2>like adding drama to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so silly.</v>

2134
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:40.700
<v Speaker 2>But he had a few real fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2135
01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Takata had a real fight against Hixon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a real fight.</v>

2136
01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:48.300
<v Speaker 2>You could tell Hickson was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And plus there was no way Hickson was </v>

2137
01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:49.100
<v Speaker 2>going to throw a five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

2138
01:30:49.101 --> 01:30:49.990
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2139
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever get to roll with Erickson?</v>

2140
01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was when I was a white belt and</v>

2141
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:56.880
<v Speaker 3>of course he probably would've told me </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a black belt,</v>

2142
01:30:56.881 --> 01:31:01.881
<v Speaker 3>but he told me he was a white belt and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just kind of went through the whole </v>

2143
01:31:01.881 --> 01:31:01.881
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2144
01:31:01.881 --> 01:31:01.910
<v Speaker 3>he lines over and squash it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>

2145
01:31:01.911 --> 01:31:02.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did that so,</v>

2146
01:31:02.831 --> 01:31:02.930
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

2147
01:31:02.970 --> 01:31:07.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a video that of one of his </v>

2148
01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:10.241
<v Speaker 2>seminars back when he ended up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Samurai ponytail and he just lines </v>

2149
01:31:10.851 --> 01:31:15.851
<v Speaker 2>everybody up and just taps some over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and nobody knew what the fuck they </v>

2150
01:31:15.851 --> 01:31:16.310
<v Speaker 2>were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was essentially a white belt.</v>

2151
01:31:16.311 --> 01:31:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there was like a blue belt in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mix,</v>

2152
01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:23.170
<v Speaker 2>but still it's so fascinating watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>him just gently toy with everybody know,</v>

2153
01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:27.560
<v Speaker 2>just choosing how it was worded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only,</v>

2154
01:31:28.190 --> 01:31:30.470
<v Speaker 2>he's the one that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2155
01:31:30.471 --> 01:31:32.450
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish he had more fights.</v>

2156
01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:35.960
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the ones where I would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>loved to see him fight.</v>

2157
01:31:35.961 --> 01:31:40.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had dinner with him many years back </v>

2158
01:31:40.961 --> 01:31:41.550
<v Speaker 2>when fader was on top and he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight fader.</v>

2159
01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

2160
01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:31:45.081 --> 01:31:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>

2162
01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:49.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real question was could he fade that</v>

2163
01:31:49.731 --> 01:31:52.890
<v Speaker 2>ground and pound fate or his ground and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pound the wake.</v>

2164
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:57.950
<v Speaker 2>There was no fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking incredible man that especially </v>

2165
01:31:58.581 --> 01:32:02.950
<v Speaker 2>that first fight where he got them </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuffed in the corner by the term bokken</v>

2166
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:07.990
<v Speaker 2>was just blast shots and that was when </v>
<v Speaker 2>no Nogueira was at his most durable,</v>

2167
01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:11.470
<v Speaker 2>very few other human beings would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to take those shots.</v>

2168
01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:16.650
<v Speaker 2>The Window Garrett was taking them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would have really loved to see </v>

2169
01:32:16.650 --> 01:32:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Hicks at against top level guys just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see if.</v>

2170
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Because he had this effect on people </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he got ahold of them on the ground </v>

2171
01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.310
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking done.</v>

2172
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Like no one was getting up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one was getting out of mount.</v>

2173
01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Nolan was hip escaping and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting back to their feet.</v>

2174
01:32:31.001 --> 01:32:33.700
<v Speaker 2>There was none of that in his fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kicks in,</v>

2175
01:32:33.701 --> 01:32:38.701
<v Speaker 2>Mtsu you and then he punches you until </v>
<v Speaker 2>you give up your back and they choked </v>

2176
01:32:38.701 --> 01:32:38.701
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of you.</v>

2177
01:32:38.701 --> 01:32:39.940
<v Speaker 2>That was every fight becomes textbook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2178
01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see him against hire guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To this day,</v>

2179
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:44.680
<v Speaker 2>he's the one guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2180
01:32:44.681 --> 01:32:48.610
<v Speaker 2>it just really drives me nuts that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his fifties now and we missed it.</v>

2181
01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.070
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2182
01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.480
<v Speaker 2>we really missed his opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2183
01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:56.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a great son real what everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>does in Jujitsu,</v>

2184
01:32:56.021 --> 01:32:58.210
<v Speaker 2>the Japan Valley Tudo days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2185
01:32:58.211 --> 01:32:59.560
<v Speaker 2>when you saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2186
01:32:59.561 --> 01:33:04.561
<v Speaker 2>like right after hoists had made his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mark in America Hickson and made his </v>

2187
01:33:04.561 --> 01:33:08.911
<v Speaker 2>mark in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really amazing documentary choke if you </v>

2188
01:33:08.911 --> 01:33:09.640
<v Speaker 2>never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Folks,</v>

2189
01:33:09.641 --> 01:33:11.410
<v Speaker 2>if you're an MMA fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2190
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:16.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a classic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really shows you what would Hickson's </v>

2191
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:19.300
<v Speaker 2>all about in a very similar philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you was where,</v>

2192
01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2193
01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:22.280
<v Speaker 2>he was willing to die in there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2194
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:26.260
<v Speaker 2>he was fighting with honor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have never thrown a fight.</v>

2195
01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:30.570
<v Speaker 2>So what you saw at the Catia setting up </v>
<v Speaker 2>a fight with Hickson and you're like,</v>

2196
01:33:30.610 --> 01:33:32.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to have to fight for real.</v>

2197
01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta be weird.</v>

2198
01:33:33.881 --> 01:33:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Where some of his fights were fake and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of his fights were real.</v>

2199
01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:43.080
<v Speaker 2>It's disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy has no business being in their </v>

2200
01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.320
<v Speaker 2>memory and he won by one body kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck did he fight?</v>

2201
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:49.930
<v Speaker 2>You kick somebody and it was like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were watching going like just didn't </v>

2202
01:33:50.651 --> 01:33:52.690
<v Speaker 2>look legit at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2203
01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.980
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2204
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.970
<v Speaker 2>That guy got no good works for Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was a big time pro wrestler.</v>

2205
01:33:57.971 --> 01:34:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that he liked the rock,</v>

2206
01:34:00.371 --> 01:34:02.710
<v Speaker 2>like the Japanese were sort of like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2207
01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.340
<v Speaker 2>but person is progressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's big over there.</v>

2208
01:34:06.341 --> 01:34:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2209
01:34:06.971 --> 01:34:09.070
<v Speaker 2>It's still going on bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big here in Japan.</v>

2210
01:34:09.071 --> 01:34:14.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't realize like </v>

2211
01:34:14.071 --> 01:34:14.071
<v Speaker 2>American MMA fighter sometimes they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there and take fights too.</v>

2212
01:34:14.071 --> 01:34:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I know Tim Silvia's had mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said,</v>

2213
01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:17.830

<v Speaker 2>He does a lot of that shit.</v>

2215
01:34:20.441 --> 01:34:25.441
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh is one of those few guys that can </v>

2216
01:34:25.441 --> 01:34:25.441
<v Speaker 2>do both and do it.</v>

2223
01:34:35.221 --> 01:34:37.440
<v Speaker 3>He enjoys it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Josh really likes the program.</v>

2224
01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.440
<v Speaker 3>He's more of a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The MMA fighter,</v>

2225
01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:42.240
<v Speaker 3>you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an MMA fighter and he's a professor</v>

2226
01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:42.480
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2229
01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at him,</v>

2230
01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:54.700
<v Speaker 2>he's a God that was ufc heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion in 2001,</v>

2231
01:34:55.161 --> 01:34:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he still in the mix,</v>

2232
01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:02.390
<v Speaker 2>2013,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still top five heavyweight in the world.</v>

2233
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hasn't lost a step.</v>

2234
01:35:04.431 --> 01:35:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Said I believe that guy can be the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

2235
01:35:06.690 --> 01:35:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I just still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even at the strikeforce tournament,</v>

2236
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:11.630
<v Speaker 2>was it a strikeforce?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost a May,</v>

2237
01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:13.490
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he broke his hand in the first round.</v>

2238
01:35:13.491 --> 01:35:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I thought I thought Josh hands down even</v>
<v Speaker 2>with further in it.</v>

2239
01:35:17.241 --> 01:35:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I thought jostens though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2240
01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:23.300
<v Speaker 2>I picked justin reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was another fucking lost in the MMA</v>

2241
01:35:23.301 --> 01:35:25.550
<v Speaker 2>world when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he pissed hot and he couldn't fight</v>

2242
01:35:25.551 --> 01:35:28.240
<v Speaker 2>fader and they closed the flushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2243
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.540
<v Speaker 2>that was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a,</v>

2244
01:35:29.610 --> 01:35:31.460
<v Speaker 2>that was a big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would have been a crazy fight,</v>

2245
01:35:31.461 --> 01:35:31.880
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2246
01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Josh Higgins feto would have been very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>

2247
01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:40.060
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was fate or in its prime to after </v>

2248
01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:42.791
<v Speaker 2>the Tim Silvia knockout was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was terrified of fate or he </v>

2249
01:35:42.791 --> 01:35:43.030
<v Speaker 2>just looked like a fucking issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2250
01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.770
<v Speaker 2>it was a destroyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

2251
01:35:45.771 --> 01:35:47.480
<v Speaker 2>like somebody did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2252
01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:48.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2253
01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:53.060
<v Speaker 2>they wrote this thing about fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you look at fighters from the time </v>

2254
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:57.581
<v Speaker 2>they entered into high level MMA </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition to the time they started to </v>

2255
01:35:57.581 --> 01:36:00.941
<v Speaker 2>fade and with almost all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like seven and nine years,</v>

2256
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:06.250
<v Speaker 2>like between seven and nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the transition where it drops </v>

2257
01:36:06.250 --> 01:36:07.580
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Josh Barnett,</v>

2258
01:36:07.581 --> 01:36:10.050
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just living every day.</v>

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Fifteen plus years still at the top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his game.</v>

2260
01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I met that Guy [inaudible] 97 when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was with.</v>

2263
01:36:23.771 --> 01:36:24.780
<v Speaker 2>gym to train when he was fighting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

2264
01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.800
<v Speaker 2>in Hawaii when you were living there </v>
<v Speaker 2>when super broad,</v>

2265
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:29.110

2266
01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:33.300
<v Speaker 2>It was bad as big crazy belly buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was gangster man.</v>

01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:13.740
<v Speaker 2>When he gives you like a real technical </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2300
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:14.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see what,</v>

2301
01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:18.990
<v Speaker 2>what the guy did that are applicable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on inside the cage.</v>

2302
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Like real point for point instruction to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with his very specific situation </v>

2303
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:25.920
<v Speaker 2>that he's facing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so rare.</v>

2304
01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:28.710
<v Speaker 2>When I fought joe is in Japan and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in this corner.</v>

2305
01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I was trying to set something</v>

2306
01:38:31.471 --> 01:38:32.670
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell him.</v>

2307
01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time in my career that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I ever felt like shit.</v>

2308
01:38:37.951 --> 01:38:42.050
<v Speaker 2>The corpsman really screwing up my game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I thought of something.</v>

2309
01:38:42.150 --> 01:38:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Washer aren't mature and he'd suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't really cause shit.</v>

2310
01:38:45.170 --> 01:38:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't set anything up because Matt </v>

2311
01:38:50.170 --> 01:38:51.240
<v Speaker 2>was seeing ahead and he knew when my hip</v>
<v Speaker 2>shifted was with farm.</v>

2312
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:54.450
<v Speaker 2>When they did this to Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the turnover was so hip throw.</v>

2313
01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:59.810
<v Speaker 2>He was giving them the heads up one step</v>
<v Speaker 2>ahead of time and so huge to have a guy </v>

2314
01:38:59.950 --> 01:39:04.950
<v Speaker 2>in this rare and so used to have a mini </v>
<v Speaker 2>coordinate in Japan where you could </v>

2315
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.950
<v Speaker 2>actually hear him.</v>

2316
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of people don't realize </v>

2317
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:12.370
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy quiet during these pride </v>

2318
01:39:12.370 --> 01:39:14.100
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There would be 90,000</v>

2319
01:39:14.101 --> 01:39:17.310
<v Speaker 2>people in an arena and you could hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's corner.</v>

2320
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:22.830
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so strange and attentive to.</v>

2321
01:39:23.011 --> 01:39:25.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they're not paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and clapping.</v>

2322
01:39:25.531 --> 01:39:27.860
<v Speaker 2>When someone passed the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would hear like a,</v>

2323
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:33.970
<v Speaker 2>like a group of people clapping and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's settled down and be quiet </v>

2324
01:39:33.970 --> 01:39:34.890
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you miss that,</v>

2325
01:39:34.891 --> 01:39:39.891
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that respectful approach to to the </v>

2326
01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:41.130
<v Speaker 2>sport?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good in bed too.</v>

2327
01:39:41.450 --> 01:39:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean the American public where they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming like idiots.</v>

2328
01:39:44.251 --> 01:39:49.251
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're screaming at the every punch </v>

2329
01:39:49.251 --> 01:39:49.251
<v Speaker 2>thrown when he stopped brawling start </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullying.</v>

2330
01:39:49.251 --> 01:39:49.251
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2331
01:39:49.251 --> 01:39:51.720
<v Speaker 2>it's an animal African.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also pretty good for the event,</v>

2332
01:39:51.721 --> 01:39:53.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

2333
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:56.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a give and take to both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The booing drives me nuts.</v>

2334
01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes we just say you there,</v>

2335
01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:03.590
<v Speaker 2>they're baking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Transition on the ground bullying and </v>

2336
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.590
<v Speaker 2>say get a clue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2337
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:08.271
<v Speaker 2>but it's the real problem is people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>go there just to see blood or just to </v>

2338
01:40:08.401 --> 01:40:13.401
<v Speaker 2>see an event and they don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying and so everybody knows </v>

2339
01:40:13.401 --> 01:40:17.751
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with two dudes or if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and igor were thrown down in the middle </v>

2340
01:40:17.751 --> 01:40:18.340
<v Speaker 2>of the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows what's happened over the</v>

2341
01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:23.340
<v Speaker 2>middle of the ring as it were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows you could see that you </v>

2342
01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:26.061
<v Speaker 2>go this crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to get knocked the fuck </v>

2343
01:40:26.061 --> 01:40:27.981
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you watching like some high </v>

2344
01:40:27.981 --> 01:40:28.500
<v Speaker 2>level transitions in the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know what they're doing,</v>

2345
01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:30.450
<v Speaker 2>you're lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in.</v>

2346
01:40:30.451 --> 01:40:34.830
<v Speaker 2>So people would start booing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so disheartening.</v>

2347
01:40:34.831 --> 01:40:36.360
<v Speaker 2>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just drives me nuts.</v>

2348
01:40:36.361 --> 01:40:41.361
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that the UFC could fill </v>

2349
01:40:41.361 --> 01:40:41.830
<v Speaker 2>up these big arenas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2350
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I hate the fact that filling them up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a certain percentage of Douche </v>

2351
01:40:46.930 --> 01:40:46.930
<v Speaker 2>bags.</v>

2352
01:40:46.930 --> 01:40:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the money's still green,</v>

2353
01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:55.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I wish that the martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts aspect was respected and </v>

2354
01:40:56.471 --> 01:41:01.471
<v Speaker 2>appreciated and I feel like the only way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ever going to really happen is </v>

2355
01:41:01.471 --> 01:41:05.431
<v Speaker 2>for a much larger percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience to be martial artists </v>

2356
01:41:05.431 --> 01:41:09.091
<v Speaker 2>themselves to be training and not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it isn't a trend and actually see </v>

2357
01:41:09.091 --> 01:41:13.520
<v Speaker 2>happening where it's think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly not much drunk idiots just </v>

2358
01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:13.570
<v Speaker 2>screening for blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2359
01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:16.540
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely less and it depends </v>
<v Speaker 2>on where you are.</v>

2360
01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:21.541
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some places where they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're super polite and some places </v>

2361
01:41:21.541 --> 01:41:23.740
<v Speaker 2>where they're just go fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be the worst than Brazil is the</v>

2362
01:41:23.770 --> 01:41:26.840
<v Speaker 2>most like vocal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2363
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:30.550
<v Speaker 2>but they're getting a lot better to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Brazil,</v>

2364
01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:33.850
<v Speaker 2>it used to be that foreigners just got </v>
<v Speaker 2>booed no matter what.</v>

2365
01:41:33.851 --> 01:41:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Like Mike Pyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

2366
01:41:35.831 --> 01:41:37.060
<v Speaker 2>Mike Pyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2367
01:41:37.230 --> 01:41:40.570
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he won in Brazil and he knocked out.</v>

2368
01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I forget who he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knocked a guy from Ludlow,</v>

2369
01:41:45.161 --> 01:41:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he trades out a team link.</v>

2370
01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:51.730
<v Speaker 2>He trains with Gabriel Gonzaga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but pile was super respectful,</v>

2371
01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:53.590
<v Speaker 2>didn't do anything wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one,</v>

2372
01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:54.850
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2373
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:57.860
<v Speaker 2>after he won,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in the ring in the cage,</v>

2374
01:41:57.861 --> 01:42:02.861
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was interviewing him and the whole </v>

2375
01:42:02.861 --> 01:42:04.650
<v Speaker 2>crowd is chanting something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I asked the translator,</v>

2376
01:42:04.710 --> 01:42:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they saying?</v>

2377
01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:08.350
<v Speaker 2>And the saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a faggot.</v>

2378
01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.360
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're chanting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole crowd was calling him a </v>

2379
01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.490
<v Speaker 4>faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2380
01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:19.530
<v Speaker 4>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he didn't do anything wrong.</v>

2381
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:20.760
<v Speaker 4>All he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ricardo Punch,</v>

2382
01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.520
<v Speaker 4>that's what we fought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All he did was one,</v>

2383
01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:24.420
<v Speaker 4>he stopped him and knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All he did was,</v>

2384
01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:28.530
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Mike put my bio but was super.</v>

2385
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:29.910
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much.</v>

2386
01:42:29.911 --> 01:42:33.480
<v Speaker 4>It was bound to everybody waving and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's like,</v>

2387
01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:34.470
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

2388
01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:37.230
<v Speaker 4>There was a 16 year old little kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2389
01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.320
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like yell and scream and given him the </v>

2390
01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:42.320
<v Speaker 4>finger to the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

2391
01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:46.251
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what can I do to get them to the back </v>

2392
01:42:46.251 --> 01:42:46.251
<v Speaker 4>and into the back?</v>

2393
01:42:46.251 --> 01:42:48.560
<v Speaker 2>The whole place was chanting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a faggot.</v>

2394
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazil's the most vocal,</v>

2395
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:56.060
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lightened up about that,</v>

2396
01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:56.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2397
01:42:56.730 --> 01:43:01.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nationalism because I think the </v>

2398
01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:04.361
<v Speaker 2>first time I was there was only the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second event that the UFC had done in </v>

2399
01:43:04.361 --> 01:43:04.361
<v Speaker 2>Rio and many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

2400
01:43:04.361 --> 01:43:09.131
<v Speaker 2>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a big thing to have the UFC </v>

2401
01:43:09.131 --> 01:43:10.700
<v Speaker 2>there and they were like super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super nationalistic and charged up.</v>

2402
01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:15.710
<v Speaker 2>But then after we did two more events in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazil that kind of relaxed a little bit</v>

2403
01:43:15.711 --> 01:43:20.711
<v Speaker 2>on that and would even applaud fighters </v>
<v Speaker 2>that showed sportsmanship and one who </v>

2404
01:43:20.711 --> 01:43:21.380
<v Speaker 2>were foreigners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2405
01:43:21.381 --> 01:43:23.090
<v Speaker 2>even if they beat a Brazilian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2406
01:43:23.091 --> 01:43:23.950
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2407
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:25.320
<v Speaker 2>they showed they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2408
01:43:25.321 --> 01:43:28.160
<v Speaker 2>they clap for people like rich Franklin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example,</v>

2409
01:43:28.161 --> 01:43:33.161
<v Speaker 2>when he beat Vandelay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually clapped for rich Franklin </v>

2410
01:43:33.161 --> 01:43:33.161
<v Speaker 2>and he tried to address them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Portuguese.</v>

2411
01:43:33.161 --> 01:43:35.210
<v Speaker 2>He had something that he had prepared </v>
<v Speaker 2>and learned.</v>

2412
01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:40.900
<v Speaker 2>So it was Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was cool to see that even though </v>

2413
01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Richard One and beaten vandelay</v>

2414
01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:43.970
<v Speaker 4>they liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were happy,</v>

2415
01:43:43.971 --> 01:43:44.370
<v Speaker 4>happy.</v>

2416
01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:45.220
<v Speaker 2>But I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2417
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:50.270
<v Speaker 2>he had also shown like a massive respect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Anderson Anderson had beaten him and </v>

2418
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:55.930
<v Speaker 2>you I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people had a lot of </v>

2419
01:43:55.930 --> 01:43:57.800
<v Speaker 2>respect for rich there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as far as the sound they make though</v>

2420
01:43:57.890 --> 01:44:02.890
<v Speaker 2>no one's louder than Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here I've been in fights where I had to </v>

2421
01:44:02.890 --> 01:44:06.521
<v Speaker 2>take my ears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ear pieces off and just like </v>

2422
01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:11.540
<v Speaker 2>turnaround listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I couldn't believe how loud it </v>

2423
01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:11.540
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this can't be real.</v>

2424
01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 2>So I took the headphones off because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>headphones mute most of the shit.</v>

2425
01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:19.571
<v Speaker 2>You hear what I'm hearing this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>noise through the microphone and then I </v>

2426
01:44:19.571 --> 01:44:22.210
<v Speaker 2>take these off and you hear the volume </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Whoa.</v>

2427
01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:24.650
<v Speaker 2>So I like tap Goldberg and like take </v>
<v Speaker 2>your shit off,</v>

2428
01:44:24.651 --> 01:44:29.651
<v Speaker 2>take your shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like as they were introducing a </v>

2429
01:44:29.651 --> 01:44:29.651
<v Speaker 2>Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take your,</v>

2430
01:44:29.651 --> 01:44:30.140
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your headphones off,</v>

2431
01:44:30.170 --> 01:44:33.470
<v Speaker 2>you look around like the sound was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>roar.</v>

2432
01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:36.890
<v Speaker 2>It was just like a jet was going off </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind your ears.</v>

2433
01:44:38.670 --> 01:44:42.910
<v Speaker 2>They're all pounding on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson the spider,</v>

2434
01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:52.510
<v Speaker 2>they weren't going fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never experienced that before.</v>

2435
01:44:52.511 --> 01:44:54.790
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dana was saying it louder than anywhere.</v>

2436
01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:57.340
<v Speaker 2>They're passionate motherfuckers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazil,</v>

2437
01:44:57.341 --> 01:44:59.590
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a passionate country.</v>

2438
01:45:00.370 --> 01:45:02.470
<v Speaker 2>They get excited for their own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

2439
01:45:02.471 --> 01:45:05.670
<v Speaker 2>they relaxed on the foreign hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2440
01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:07.240
<v Speaker 2>which was Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2441
01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.250
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the most loud,</v>

2442
01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:13.540
<v Speaker 2>but as far as the most polite England's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty fucking polite.</v>

2443
01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:15.550
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty polite in England.</v>

2444
01:45:15.610 --> 01:45:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

2445
01:45:16.541 --> 01:45:17.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2446
01:45:17.370 --> 01:45:19.930
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty nationalistic themselves,</v>

2447
01:45:19.931 --> 01:45:20.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2448
01:45:20.331 --> 01:45:21.170
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2449
01:45:21.210 --> 01:45:23.440
<v Speaker 2>root for bisping and rooting for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2450
01:45:23.441 --> 01:45:25.540
<v Speaker 2>a Brad Pickett and anybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

2451
01:45:25.541 --> 01:45:27.490
<v Speaker 2>It's an English guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're there.</v>

2452
01:45:27.491 --> 01:45:28.720
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty polite in England,</v>

2453
01:45:29.130 --> 01:45:29.860
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2454
01:45:29.970 --> 01:45:34.970
<v Speaker 3>I just went to New Zealand last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of last year and it tripped me </v>

2455
01:45:35.461 --> 01:45:38.940
<v Speaker 3>out because New Zealand is like 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

2456
01:45:38.941 --> 01:45:41.220
<v Speaker 3>America really couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2457
01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:46.460
<v Speaker 3>These guys will know what the MME is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I finally explained to one of </v>

2458
01:45:46.831 --> 01:45:48.450
<v Speaker 3>the immigration officers what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

2459
01:45:48.451 --> 01:45:50.580
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you beat people for a living.</v>

2460
01:45:51.630 --> 01:45:52.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2461
01:45:52.051 --> 01:45:54.910
<v Speaker 3>that's the animosity you had back in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day when they were singing.</v>

2462
01:45:54.911 --> 01:45:57.690
<v Speaker 3>It was human dogfighting yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you go to,</v>

2463
01:45:57.691 --> 01:46:02.691
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were running into the same </v>

2464
01:46:02.691 --> 01:46:04.401
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The boxing commission is the one that's </v>

2465
01:46:04.401 --> 01:46:04.650
<v Speaker 3>interfering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has so much party stopping it because</v>

2466
01:46:04.651 --> 01:46:06.690
<v Speaker 3>they're afraid that MMA is going to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>over boxing.</v>

2467
01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:10.020
<v Speaker 3>And it's like the whole same thing all </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again.</v>

2468
01:46:10.021 --> 01:46:15.021
<v Speaker 3>And the craziest thing about New Zealand</v>
<v Speaker 3>is you got these crazy fighters there.</v>

2469
01:46:15.031 --> 01:46:20.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can go the jaws of stone and they </v>

2470
01:46:20.031 --> 01:46:20.460
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can hit,</v>

2471
01:46:20.461 --> 01:46:22.200
<v Speaker 3>they can mean a lot of stuff.</v>

2472
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:24.800
<v Speaker 2>A country full of mark hunt's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2473
01:46:24.801 --> 01:46:25.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of them do</v>

2474
01:46:25.770 --> 01:46:28.380
<v Speaker 3>the big boys in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all to fight,</v>

2475
01:46:28.381 --> 01:46:29.700
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2476
01:46:29.710 --> 01:46:34.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering how the Hell is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country 20 years behind?</v>

2477
01:46:34.230 --> 01:46:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean I couldn't</v>

2478
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:37.390
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

2479
01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it?</v>

2480
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Is New York state's still illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That drives me.</v>

2481
01:46:40.630 --> 01:46:42.940
<v Speaker 2>That drives me nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That drives me nuts.</v>

2482
01:46:42.941 --> 01:46:45.010
<v Speaker 2>And that's all corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know the root of that.</v>

2483
01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:47.290
<v Speaker 2>It's the culinary union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Coronary Union,</v>

2484
01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:52.490
<v Speaker 2>they want station casinos to go union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're bing politicians and </v>

2485
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:53.880
<v Speaker 2>politicians are trying their best</v>

2486
01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.380
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand too because like I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand it.</v>

2487
01:46:57.381 --> 01:46:59.810
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't understand how this country </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be</v>

2488
01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:05.180
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid too because it's not going </v>

2489
01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:05.180
<v Speaker 2>to hurt boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to hurt kickboxing,</v>

2490
01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:05.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2491
01:47:05.431 --> 01:47:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I really feel like there's plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>room for all the combat sports.</v>

2492
01:47:08.461 --> 01:47:13.461
<v Speaker 2>I think that there is something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching like a floyd mayweather or </v>

2493
01:47:13.461 --> 01:47:17.130
<v Speaker 2>watching a guy who's a fantastic boxer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's always,</v>

2494
01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:19.230
<v Speaker 2>it's always going to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to watch.</v>

2495
01:47:19.231 --> 01:47:22.350
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a big fan of high level </v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing too.</v>

2496
01:47:22.351 --> 01:47:26.610
<v Speaker 2>I Love K One and glory is doing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>big shows now too.</v>

2497
01:47:26.611 --> 01:47:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I love watching that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's room for all that shit.</v>

2498
01:47:29.851 --> 01:47:30.660
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2499
01:47:30.661 --> 01:47:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2500
01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:35.520
<v Speaker 2>And they can work together know and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>should promote an mma.</v>

2501
01:47:35.521 --> 01:47:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Don't be stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't try to fight it.</v>

2502
01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:42.340
<v Speaker 3>Fighting it mean you can go into New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zealand and half the people will hate </v>

2503
01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:45.000
<v Speaker 3>marsh sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you believe that?</v>

2504
01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:45.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day,</v>

2505
01:47:45.891 --> 01:47:48.980
<v Speaker 3>you remember back in the day when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC,</v>

2506
01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:53.200
<v Speaker 3>MMA was considered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like we,</v>

2507
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:58.110
<v Speaker 2>when I first started doing post fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews,</v>

2508
01:47:58.410 --> 01:48:02.550
<v Speaker 2>it was like 97 and I was on a TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>news radio and I would tell people I was</v>

2509
01:48:02.551 --> 01:48:07.551
<v Speaker 2>going to fly to Dothan Alabama to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>work at an ultimate fighting </v>

2510
01:48:07.681 --> 01:48:08.610
<v Speaker 2>championship event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nobody would have ever thought back then</v>

2523
01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:38.040
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would happen so fast.</v>

01:49:35.871 --> 01:49:39.561
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no sport broken down to me more </v>

2547
01:49:39.561 --> 01:49:43.161
<v Speaker 2>so even than boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken down to its raw cost element </v>

2548
01:49:43.161 --> 01:49:44.190
<v Speaker 2>acceptable by society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

2549
01:49:44.191 --> 01:49:45.240
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real sport.</v>

2550
01:49:45.241 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>It's man dominating another man with </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

2551

<v Speaker 2>Focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technique will intelligence and heart,</v>

2552
01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:56.290

<v Speaker 2>That's the route in what people admire </v>

2553
01:49:56.290 --> 01:49:59.941
<v Speaker 2>in all sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but MMA and bodies that it's the purest </v>

2554
01:49:59.941 --> 01:50:01.600
<v Speaker 2>form of sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know if you say you love sports,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you don't really love sports.</v>

2581
01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:02.220
<v Speaker 2>I always thought it was weird when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard a trainer say,</v>

2582
01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:03.420
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we want to win this first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to go out there and do this and </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2585

<v Speaker 2>what we worked on in the gym is this </v>

2586
01:51:12.450 --> 01:51:12.450
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2587
01:51:12.450 --> 01:51:12.460
<v Speaker 4>it's not really a lot of [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on here.</v>

2588
01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:16.210
<v Speaker 4>Fucking that guides him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really shouldn't be saying we,</v>

2589
01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:19.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we trained him to do this.</v>

2590
01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:24.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we showed him that he's been working </v>

2591
01:51:24.850 --> 01:51:24.850
<v Speaker 4>hard in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2592
01:51:24.850 --> 01:51:26.890
<v Speaker 4>we've been pushing him know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it's in the cage,</v>

2593
01:51:27.010 --> 01:51:28.300
<v Speaker 4>we want to win this first round there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2594
01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:31.540
<v Speaker 4>he's going to win that first round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really don't have any to do it.</v>

2595
01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:35.620
<v Speaker 4>Nobody helps them prepare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's going to fight the fight.</v>

2596
01:51:35.621 --> 01:51:36.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't</v>

2597
01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:38.450
<v Speaker 2>have the mind for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that.</v>

2598
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:43.810
<v Speaker 2>That is really where it all boils down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mindset and the ability to overcome </v>

2599
01:51:46.521 --> 01:51:49.100
<v Speaker 2>obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much of it is mental.</v>

2600
01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:53.090
<v Speaker 2>So much of deciding the right things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

2601
01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:58.360
<v Speaker 2>And when you were talking about seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys break and knowing the guys are </v>

2602
01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:02.561
<v Speaker 2>breaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times you seen guys give up a </v>

2603
01:52:02.561 --> 01:52:02.660
<v Speaker 2>choke when you know that they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2604
01:52:02.661 --> 01:52:04.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know how to get out of that.</v>

2605
01:52:04.570 --> 01:52:05.600
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tap,</v>

2606
01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:09.350
<v Speaker 2>you know that they're just looking for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way out of the pressure of the moment.</v>

2607
01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2608
01:52:10.150 --> 01:52:12.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you really think about it is you.</v>

2609
01:52:12.651 --> 01:52:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever questioned why people tan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2610
01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:20.280
<v Speaker 3>It's not because of the pain is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the anticipation of what they think </v>

2611
01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:21.400
<v Speaker 3>is going to happen to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

2612
01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Rarely do you have a garlic Nogueira or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Henzel and Misha tate who gets her arm </v>

2613
01:52:27.761 --> 01:52:29.350
<v Speaker 3>broke and then taps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2614
01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:35.100
<v Speaker 3>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see a lot of guys tapping out to </v>

2615
01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:35.520
<v Speaker 3>armbars and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and waving to the French,</v>

2616
01:52:35.521 --> 01:52:37.120
<v Speaker 3>shaking their hands after with the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>arm.</v>

2617
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:40.300
<v Speaker 3>I see people tap Baltic chokes and glow </v>
<v Speaker 3>and drinking that night.</v>

2618
01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:41.800
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2619
01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.990
<v Speaker 3>it's anticipation is basically what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

2620
01:52:43.991 --> 01:52:47.060
<v Speaker 3>And tapping all is basically a mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus.</v>

2621
01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:52.120
<v Speaker 3>If you're focusing on getting up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you focusing on hurting the guy before </v>

2622
01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:53.330
<v Speaker 3>he hurts you and you're not focusing on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

2623
01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:56.810
<v Speaker 3>my arm's gonna get broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be all fucked up tomorrow.</v>

2624
01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hero ligament pop.</v>

2625
01:52:58.221 --> 01:53:03.221
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be fucked up to my better </v>

2626
01:53:03.221 --> 01:53:03.221
<v Speaker 3>tap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2627
01:53:03.221 --> 01:53:03.760
<v Speaker 3>it's anticipation and we really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really put the,</v>

2628
01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:04.440
<v Speaker 3>put it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2629
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:07.270
<v Speaker 3>black and white men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of funny because that's what</v>

2630
01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:12.280
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the faster the person tabs to the </v>

2631
01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:12.470
<v Speaker 3>earlier he was broke and once you break </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2632
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:17.530
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're anticipating what you think's </v>

2633
01:53:17.530 --> 01:53:17.530
<v Speaker 3>going to happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

2634
01:53:17.530 --> 01:53:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a Jimmy Smith on the podcast </v>

2635
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:23.811
<v Speaker 2>earlier today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about he's the guy does </v>

2636
01:53:23.811 --> 01:53:26.131
<v Speaker 2>a commentary for Bella tour and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about when Jacques Rey fought </v>

2637
01:53:26.131 --> 01:53:29.961
<v Speaker 2>hydro gracie and got his arm broken and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then tucked it into his belt and </v>

2638
01:53:30.571 --> 01:53:35.571
<v Speaker 2>defended for the last minute with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking broken arm so that he could win </v>

2639
01:53:35.571 --> 01:53:35.571
<v Speaker 2>on points.</v>

2647
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:58.380
<v Speaker 2>It was making sure that they didn't stop</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let me back in there.</v>

2655
01:54:12.621 --> 01:54:15.830
<v Speaker 2>That's all about focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's about focusing on what </v>

2656
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:18.711
<v Speaker 2>you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you focused on when you're in </v>

2657
01:54:18.711 --> 01:54:18.711
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2658
01:54:18.711 --> 01:54:21.081
<v Speaker 2>Are you focused on losing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you focused on getting out of there </v>

2659
01:54:21.081 --> 01:54:23.700
<v Speaker 2>without being injured or are you focused</v>
<v Speaker 2>on finding a way to win no matter what?</v>

2660
01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:24.790
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2661
01:54:24.990 --> 01:54:26.520
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a big thing.</v>

2662
01:54:26.850 --> 01:54:31.230
<v Speaker 2>One of the most impressive fights that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever saw where a guy lost the fight,</v>

2663
01:54:31.231 --> 01:54:32.310
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

2664
01:54:32.311 --> 01:54:36.570
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker is trying to win this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight was when uriah faber broke,</v>

2665
01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:40.050
<v Speaker 2>broke both his hands on Mike Brown.</v>

2666
01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:41.810
<v Speaker 2>He had no hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2667
01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:45.330
<v Speaker 2>and by the second round he broke both </v>
<v Speaker 2>his hands.</v>

2668
01:54:45.331 --> 01:54:50.331
<v Speaker 2>He broke his thumb on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he broke his knuckles on the other hand </v>

2669
01:54:50.331 --> 01:54:53.510
<v Speaker 2>so he couldn't punch with either hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's throwing elbows and he's </v>

2670
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:54.840
<v Speaker 2>throwing kicks and he did it for five </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking rounds.</v>

2671
01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't do anything.</v>

2672
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:59.410
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't grab a hold of them,</v>

2673
01:54:59.411 --> 01:55:01.560
<v Speaker 2>couldn't hold on to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't grapple,</v>

2674
01:55:01.590 --> 01:55:02.320
<v Speaker 2>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2675
01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:06.540
<v Speaker 2>all he could do was try and throw elbows</v>
<v Speaker 2>and try to take them out with kicks,</v>

2676
01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:11.900
<v Speaker 2>but he still never complained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when there and tried to win every </v>

2677
01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:15.480
<v Speaker 2>minute of every round he had left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2678
01:55:15.481 --> 01:55:17.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of that.</v>

2679
01:55:17.190 --> 01:55:22.190
<v Speaker 2>And every now and then a guy will pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit off like rich Franklin when </v>

2680
01:55:22.190 --> 01:55:25.221
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he knocked out chuck chuck broke </v>

2681
01:55:25.221 --> 01:55:26.040
<v Speaker 2>his arm and rich had a broken arm and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>punched chuck with a broken arm.</v>

2682
01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:29.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really now know there's,</v>

2683
01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:34.780
<v Speaker 2>there's moments like that where guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the face of that kind of an </v>
