40
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did an interview yesterday,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>

42
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.260

<v Speaker 1>me some,</v>

43
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>some shirts.</v>

44
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>She brought me some shirts from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

45
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>She had got them for free or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is just my favorite shirt</v>

46
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>out of the three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a cute little kid.</v>

47
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Just</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked like it could maybe be me.</v>

48
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what I sorta like high and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be given maybe a little bit.</v>

49
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>The other shirts I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one other shirt.</v>

50
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman pulling down,</v>

51
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>like it was a sketch of a woman pulling</v>
<v Speaker 1>down her pants,</v>

52
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>standing over a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bit weird.</v>

53
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another one that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the tech set,</v>

54
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>young Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it was a person in a,</v>

55
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:16.490
<v Speaker 1>in a Klan outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

56
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.900

<v Speaker 1>I get what you're going for,</v>

57
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.600

<v Speaker 1>So this was the winter out of the three.</v>

58
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>That one that's wearable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a cute kid.</v>

59
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No young Republican.</v>

60
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

61
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody stop.</v>

62
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.021
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

63
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>what has it been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

64
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>this you sunk the Cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raped,</v>

65
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>shipped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

66
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:42.381
<v Speaker 1>I didn't expect to still be talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it now I saw you in January of</v>

67
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.520
<v Speaker 1>last year at a UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't expect it to still be.</v>

69
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you what I mean,</v>

70
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>but people made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just about.</v>

71
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I did a joke and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

72
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>and people kind of rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really.</v>

73
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Has nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about me at all.</v>

74
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

75
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.390
<v Speaker 1>that makes the story better for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a is not about me because</v>

76
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes the story better.</v>

77
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>They'd make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes the.</v>

78
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:21.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

79
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.181
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said it,</v>

80
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:27.181
<v Speaker 1>but it's like everybody was saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is strange though that just you</v>

81
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>saying it on stage for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it getting into a video and then all of</v>

82
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>a sudden everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

83
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>is that shit true?</v>

84
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody had heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those things that</v>

85
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>everybody had kind of heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you had heard rumors,</v>

86
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was never anything like concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

89
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>that was the match that lit the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

90
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:53.670
<v Speaker 1>what really what really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>people forget about this part of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I remember being,</v>

92
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:02.911
<v Speaker 1>I was on tour in November 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember being on my tour bus and,</v>

93
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>and that he put out this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cosby meme.</v>

94
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>

95
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually had died down a little bit.</v>

96
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say November</v>

97
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>10th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this 12 fish around that range.</v>

98
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And he put out cause me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

99
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.713
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

100
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>and you could go on his site and</v>
<v Speaker 1>different images and then people started</v>

101
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>saying stuff about it and then that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made it take off again.</v>

102
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>People forget about that really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually because I remember</v>

103
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>that being like Google analytics about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

104
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Where peaked for a little bit in mid</v>
<v Speaker 1>October,</v>

105
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:51.601
<v Speaker 1>somebody show and then it dipped and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the causeway meme is what set it</v>

106
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>back off again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is so fascinating.</v>

107
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because nobody knows how to manage that</v>

108
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're like a PR person,</v>

109
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

110
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.660
<v Speaker 1>whoever did the meme thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that the dude who did what</v>

111
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine whoever did the main</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing was probably somebody works on his</v>

112
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:10.941
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somebody works on his website is like</v>

114
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.350
<v Speaker 1>a web culture person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who understands the Internet.</v>

115
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Some tech dude or woman at tech person</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to know what the fuck is going</v>

116
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>to happen when they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost think they did it on purpose.</v>

117
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.000
<v Speaker 1>That's my conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they thought he was a piece of</v>

119
00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>shit and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

120
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>I got an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

121
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely weird,</v>

122
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:37.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>move on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move on.</v>

124
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:40.100
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not his,</v>

125
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his is as I continue to is not really</v>

126
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.450
<v Speaker 1>about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:50.451
<v Speaker 1>I talk about the reaction to it in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech because it was really a crazy.</v>

128
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>It was stressful too just to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>just casually,</v>

129
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on social media or going on a site</v>

130
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>how I normally would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then just seeing my name,</v>

131
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now looking for it,</v>

132
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.840
<v Speaker 1>like Gnats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>googling myself but just go onto a site</v>

133
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

134
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And originally,</v>

135
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>initially at least people were mad at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

136
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some still are really?</v>

137
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

138
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.720
<v Speaker 1>People just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>

139
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

140
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>they think I'm part of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

141
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a small amount of people like vocal</v>
<v Speaker 1>but vocal online.</v>

142
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like it's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that Bob Dude thinks that the</v>

143
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>earth is flat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

144
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fucking strange people</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>

145
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the big conspiracies</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that bill cosby was trying to buy</v>

146
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>NBC and that they didn't want bill cosby</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy NBC.</v>

147
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:45.400
<v Speaker 1>So they came out with all these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Fake charges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

149
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:52.030
<v Speaker 1>and then they gave me a road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave me my own TV show and reward.</v>

150
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave you a TV show,</v>

151
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:58.331
<v Speaker 1>but you already had the TV show that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to deal in in mid 2014.</v>

152
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Luckily you're a very funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talented guy so this isn't going to fuck</v>

153
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>you over and it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could like as far as leaning into it,</v>

154
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dozens and dozens of media requests</v>

155
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't do good.</v>

156
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.490
<v Speaker 1>I came to my place one in looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been on the road for a couple of weeks.</v>

157
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll come back to my apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an inside edition.</v>

158
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Business cards slipped under my door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got into my building as if I would</v>

159
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.870
<v Speaker 1>come home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

160
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 1>inside the district?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go on there now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very resourceful for getting</v>

162
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 1>into my building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

163
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>that's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

164
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 1>it was really creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people getting my cell phone out of</v>

165
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 1>nowhere there you want to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about a job.</v>

166
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:46.604
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

167
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

168
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how good bob thanks to world is</v>

169
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.730
<v Speaker 1>flat</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Neil Neil degrasse Tyson.</v>

170
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 1>So he wrote a dis song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear this?</v>

171
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh I can't bring myself the song is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Bob is a pretty.</v>

172
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.540
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because the song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's full of fallacies and</v>

173
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>runs the song sounds good.</v>

174
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And then Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his nephew or somebody who's also in the</v>

175
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he put out a song and his song sounds</v>

176
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.240
<v Speaker 1>garbage but it has the facts in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds horrible,</v>

177
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 1>horrible rap voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His voice sounded like,</v>

178
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.930
<v Speaker 1>is this guy rapping?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy can teach me something.</v>

179
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>He could do a youtube video about why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:41.171
<v Speaker 1>mintos explode in a goddamn coke color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to hear this guy rap.</v>

181
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 1>It was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was weird.</v>

182
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.570
<v Speaker 1>That's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But truth gets a shitty voice.</v>

183
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Internet is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

184
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Bob really believed that if he just</v>

185
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 1>just cause strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people know how to manipulate</v>

186
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just say you could say something</v>

187
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>contrary in an empirical response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

188
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the nature of when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

189
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I got fans that say,</v>

190
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 1>and you probably had to say with fans</v>
<v Speaker 1>will just be like,</v>

191
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you piece of shit and you're like,</v>

192
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:14.690
<v Speaker 1>what's going on man?</v>

193
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:15.481
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan.</v>

194
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to get your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does have.</v>

195
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:23.050
<v Speaker 1>And so one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's the same thing with like Bob,</v>

196
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I know this will get people go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because out of nowhere he doesn't tell</v>

197
00:09:26.411 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I haven't checked his history,</v>

198
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if he has posed any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other scientific theories outside of</v>

199
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but out of nowhere he's like,</v>

200
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to post 10 tweets about the</v>

201
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 1>world potentially being flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

202
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:41.510
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he just wanted.</v>

203
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of people that believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

204
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fucked up Tila Tequila.</v>

205
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

208
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Before she said the world is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

209
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>That's here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the experience and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because they offered me more for one</v>

<v Speaker 1>But then afterwards I loosened up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ship,</v>

236
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.510

<v Speaker 1>interesting vibe and walking around the</v>

238
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>convention floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt comfortable being amongst other</v>

239
00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:12.864
<v Speaker 1>creeps.</v>

240
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's Gawking and</v>

244
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next to Dana.</v>

245
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Dr Maran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

246
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I Know Dana and Ron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy was to the left to her than some</v>

247
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 1>other porn lady was next to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Lexington still in me.</v>

248
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I think I was the only non porn person</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first few rows.</v>

249
00:11:40.941 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doug Benson,</v>

250
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.400
<v Speaker 1>was that somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

251
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm that blowing his bought up</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

252
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure everybody knows he's a creeper,</v>

253
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.860
<v Speaker 1>but it was not in the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an interesting vibe,</v>

254
00:11:52.861 --> 00:11:53.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

255
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's walking out with rockwood around</v>

256
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 1>with test it out and it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

257
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 1>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

258
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.440
<v Speaker 2>because everybody loves sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean sex is what.</v>

259
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the favorite things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do.</v>

260
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of filming it,</v>

261
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 2>there's something fucking real taboo</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

262
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Real locked down and taboo and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even like the admission that you</v>

263
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it is controversial.</v>

264
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's a multibillion dollar</v>

265
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 1>business still with his own award show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's definitely still a moment.</v>

266
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Billion dollar business and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>free now.</v>

267
00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what's fucked up about it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to be a multibillion dollar</v>

268
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:39.310
<v Speaker 2>business and it made sense because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were selling dvds,</v>

269
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.450
<v Speaker 2>but now the multibillion dollar</v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses mostly paper view in hotel</v>

270
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 2>rooms.</v>

271
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where they make a lot of money</v>

272
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.280
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time I was playing xannies and St</v>

273
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about good gig.</v>

274
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a outside of Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

275
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 1>about 45 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour or so.</v>

276
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.930
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

277
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.940
<v Speaker 1>if I had a car I would have just went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gig and went home every night,</v>

278
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:10.430
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't have a car so I got a ride</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and I stayed there for the</v>

279
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.510
<v Speaker 1>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I didn't have a laptop,</v>

280
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I didn't own a laptop at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like 2007 or some shit to the</v>

281
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

282
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:20.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

283
00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:25.131
<v Speaker 1>I gotta order some hotel porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the stuff I kept ordering,</v>

284
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I ordered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was soft porn,</v>

285
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 1>so it was showing no penetration and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

286
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.940
<v Speaker 1>It was just the grind it and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking sucks.</v>

287
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 1>I ordered another one and it was still</v>
<v Speaker 1>soft poop it.</v>

288
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I ordered a third one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soft porn just spent 10 bucks a pop on</v>

289
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:49.291
<v Speaker 1>south point and I kind of wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a call the front desk and be like,</v>

290
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 1>these movies aren't what I thought they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

291
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:53.660
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just ate the chart.</v>

292
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.710
<v Speaker 2>That's how it used to be in hotel rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd show no penetration and they'd</v>

293
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:01.120
<v Speaker 2>showed no cum shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

294
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would show like scenes of people on</v>

295
00:14:04.401 --> 00:14:06.650
<v Speaker 2>top of it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Hicks used to have a bit about it.</v>

296
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.820
<v Speaker 2>You Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Hicks,</v>

297
00:14:07.821 --> 00:14:11.350
<v Speaker 2>you save a bit about hotel porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about [inaudible].</v>

298
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.710
<v Speaker 2>They used to do apparently the way they</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to film scenes as they would film a</v>

299
00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:20.480
<v Speaker 2>hardcore scene and a softcore version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they would have like soft core scenes</v>

300
00:14:20.481 --> 00:14:23.420
<v Speaker 2>where they shot angles where they knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't see anything and they did</v>

301
00:14:23.421 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 2>it specifically just for for hotel rooms</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those,</v>

302
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.590
<v Speaker 2>all those hotel chains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the marriotts and all those.</v>

303
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Those are the biggest porn sellers in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

304
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.230
<v Speaker 2>You don't think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're all in the porn business.</v>

305
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:41.330
<v Speaker 2>They make a fuck load of money off of</v>
<v Speaker 2>porn because they're charging now.</v>

306
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.430
<v Speaker 2>How much is it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like 20 bucks or something?</v>

307
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't looked in a long time.</v>

308
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I know I go on the Internet and looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that stuff.</v>

309
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like 20 bucks or somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>

310
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.940
<v Speaker 1>so I guess that's the move you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch porn on tv if you,</v>

311
00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.350
<v Speaker 1>if you want a big screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you can't even reride now</v>

312
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.240
<v Speaker 1>knows that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

313
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Or pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

314
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:07.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a very restricted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think,</v>

315
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 1>because I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about this at the,</v>

316
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.580
<v Speaker 1>at the awards was they had awards for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

317
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just best director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>

318
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 1>What makes a good porn director?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I could direct.</v>

319
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I could jump into porn direct</v>

320
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:26.570
<v Speaker 1>and kind of easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just if you just give me 12 hours</v>

321
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 1>to watch a bunch of different porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me the point and gave me the</v>

322
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:32.930
<v Speaker 1>screeners for the best director</v>
<v Speaker 1>nominees.</v>

323
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could mimic what they do within my</v>

324
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 1>third directed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you gotta think</v>

325
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 2>not a whole lot to it because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

326
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a direct in some car chase</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a bridge and as a fucking monster</v>

327
00:15:45.081 --> 00:15:47.780
<v Speaker 2>coming after the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a real simple.</v>

328
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.620
<v Speaker 2>It's just fucking so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

329
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.500
<v Speaker 2>But if you talk to the porn people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take that shit super serious.</v>

330
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a piece on my blog a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago about a porn party because I had a</v>

331
00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 2>buddy that I used to do Jujitsu with who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a director for a porn company and he</v>

332
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:06.970
<v Speaker 2>held a party for the release of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>film that he made that he was.</v>

333
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 2>It was like an art film and what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do was make a real movie with</v>

334
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:15.930
<v Speaker 2>a real plot and real dialog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have people fucking it and we,</v>

335
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.600
<v Speaker 2>we didn't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just a bunch of guys from Jujitsu</v>

336
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.670
<v Speaker 2>invited us to the party.</v>

337
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 2>We all went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on here?</v>

338
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.650
<v Speaker 2>So they have this projection screen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start playing the scenes.</v>

339
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.160
<v Speaker 2>So they play this movie and he gets out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and he's talking about it.</v>

340
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Like they said this couldn't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That said that what I was doing was just</v>

341
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.910
<v Speaker 2>the industry wouldn't accept it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did it.</v>

342
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm here and not the porn people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is backward.</v>

343
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Porn made money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking like early 2000,</v>

344
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 2>2001 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then</v>

345
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.480
<v Speaker 2>like we're watching the scene right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This seems ridiculous.</v>

346
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.060
<v Speaker 2>This is asked to mouth seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's dudes banging this,</v>

347
00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 2>his chicken the ass then fucking her</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth and she's making these,</v>

348
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.480
<v Speaker 2>he's gagging noises.</v>

<v Speaker 2>dressing and makeup.</v>

371
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she took him to this party.</v>

372
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 2>She took him there.</v>

373
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.860
<v Speaker 2>She lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She met him at like some some bar.</v>

374
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.930
<v Speaker 2>How long ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long before the party?</v>

375
00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I think like the day before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

376
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:00.380
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

377
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>

378
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

379
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She tried.</v>

380
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.220
<v Speaker 2>She tried to show him what she's capable</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

381
00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.990
<v Speaker 2>what he could have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew specifically how long they</v>

382
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:14.460
<v Speaker 2>knew each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was very long.</v>

383
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I think was real sleek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's trying to show him what's up I</v>

384
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:20.130
<v Speaker 2>guess and just try to surprise him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more like,</v>

385
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:23.230
<v Speaker 2>hey look what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm up to some of that.</v>

386
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 2>But he came at the right time because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just asked mouth ass mouth.</v>

387
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 2>The way I describe it was like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude's ball slapping against her ass was</v>

388
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:35.950
<v Speaker 2>like to chalk erasers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like chocolates</v>

389
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 2>and then he would go from that to our</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouse over</v>

390
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 2>and that's right where homeboy walked</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

391
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 2>got out of the car and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck?</v>

<v Speaker 1>When we're talking about 2000,</v>

472
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.030
<v Speaker 1>2001,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they had Viagra back then.</v>

473
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.420
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what type of stuff they say</v>

474
00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 1>to themselves in their head what it went</v>
<v Speaker 1>back down.</v>

475
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.290
<v Speaker 1>But let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out when they invented Viagara.</v>

476
00:22:02.291 --> 00:22:04.990

<v Speaker 1>I feel like nineties,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like that?</v>

483
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I just remembered been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just remember the stories in</v>

484
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:25.450
<v Speaker 1>highschool and shit around it.</v>

485
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.640
<v Speaker 1>I just remember it being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

486
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was making those late night</v>

487
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:31.810
<v Speaker 1>jokes about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

488
00:22:31.811 --> 00:22:32.680
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

489
00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 1>That same joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

490
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:39.340
<v Speaker 1>The overnight get the director for five</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

491
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 1>call a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was another girl.</v>

492
00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:46.030
<v Speaker 1>A call that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

493
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:50.290
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those jokes that nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>could say they got ripped off that.</v>

494
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.020
<v Speaker 1>That was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucking everybody did.</v>

495
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.720
<v Speaker 1>What is your take on all this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amy Schumer?</v>

496
00:22:55.721 --> 00:22:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

497
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking at it.</v>

498
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she would take jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she will take and a lot of</v>

499
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.880
<v Speaker 1>jokes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been talking about like that.</v>

500
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the most recent ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the most one?</v>

501
00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.460
<v Speaker 1>It was a gang of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put together some compilations.</v>

502
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a few of them that are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely suspicious,</v>

503
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.750
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is when you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

504
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:27.810
<v Speaker 1>you know when you like go and scouring</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the hours of standup that I'm sure</v>

505
00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:31.290
<v Speaker 1>she's done places you can find similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>premises and she'll like that.</v>

506
00:23:31.291 --> 00:23:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the real issue is whoever wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the sketch show,</v>

507
00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 1>whoever wrote those sketches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the very least there's an originality</v>

508
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:39.870
<v Speaker 1>problem at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's.</v>

509
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.850
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

510
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.900
<v Speaker 1>like the Kathleen Madigan one is a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>egregious one because you could totally</v>

511
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 2>come up with the same idea that Kathleen</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madigan had about someone slapping food</v>

512
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:52.550
<v Speaker 2>out of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>

513
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.280
<v Speaker 2>someone said I think should fear said</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that used to be on the flintstones.</v>

514
00:23:56.281 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 2>So there was an episode of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>flintstones where Fred was trying to</v>

515
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:06.131
<v Speaker 2>lose weight and so we had like a robot</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would slap food out of his mouth or</v>

516
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:08.750
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see if you could find that.</v>

517
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.210
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that it was the same two</v>

518
00:24:14.211 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 2>bits back to back like Kathleen had that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Kathleen had,</v>

519
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:19.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hire somebody.</v>

520
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Kathleen Madigan's bit was about Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How Oprah so rich.</v>

521
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Like how could she be so fat if I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rich,</v>

522
00:24:25.251 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 2>I'd have people slap food out of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

523
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I would hire someone to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to exercise me while I slept like a baby</v>

524
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.380
<v Speaker 2>with cerebral palsy.</v>

525
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.040
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so they go from the slap thing</v>

526
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:39.350
<v Speaker 2>right to the exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You while you're asleep,</v>

527
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:40.620
<v Speaker 2>back to back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

528
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 2>it's too close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there was this one from college</v>

529
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 2>humor that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

530
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.870
<v Speaker 2>a sketch about the audition for two</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls,</v>

531
00:24:47.871 --> 00:24:50.360
<v Speaker 2>one cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's exact same setup.</v>

532
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fucking Fred.</v>

533
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.511
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

534
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 2>See he's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone.</v>

535
00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.330
<v Speaker 2>He hired someone to knock food out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mouth.</v>

536
00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not the most original idea.</v>

537
00:25:02.721 --> 00:25:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Like people thought that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is they're back to back</v>

538
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.270
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back to back.</v>

539
00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's this,</v>

540
00:25:09.891 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the college humor one,</v>

541
00:25:11.241 --> 00:25:14.120
<v Speaker 2>which is the fucking exact same setup</v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the office.</v>

542
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.160
<v Speaker 2>They're a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going through the audition</v>

543
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:18.020
<v Speaker 2>process for two girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One Cup.</v>

544
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the same fucking thing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of other ones.</v>

545
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.210
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an originality problem with</v>

546
00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:26.840
<v Speaker 2>somebody you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't know that college humor</v>

547
00:25:26.841 --> 00:25:29.090
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like say if I was doing a sketch show</v>

548
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.080
<v Speaker 2>and someone came to me what we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

549
00:25:31.081 --> 00:25:32.030
<v Speaker 2>the sketch show and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

550
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 2>how about we do a sketch about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>audition process for two girls,</v>

551
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:36.801
<v Speaker 2>one cup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

552
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:38.060
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

553
00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:39.020
<v Speaker 2>What do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How we do it,</v>

554
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 2>so she might not have had any knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all that there's other bits existed.</v>

555
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so much content out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>today to be aware of.</v>

556
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Every premise in every bit is almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>

557
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.380
<v Speaker 2>It's tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

558
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was doing my show,</v>

559
00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I would get pitched stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

560
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.390
<v Speaker 2>I will try to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam,</v>

561
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.570
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all comedy obviously,</v>

562
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:04.490
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I think like I would try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to remember the stuff,</v>

563
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.050
<v Speaker 2>but you can't remember everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

564
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:13.280
<v Speaker 2>in a day I think we kicked people from</v>
<v Speaker 2>in living color out of the comedy store</v>

565
00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>

566
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.850
<v Speaker 2>We had nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I was there,</v>

567
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.770
<v Speaker 2>like the comics were complaining so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

568
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:21.470
<v Speaker 2>So they got him kicked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually I had nothing to do with it,</v>

569
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.780
<v Speaker 2>but I remember like being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

570
00:26:23.781 --> 00:26:25.490
<v Speaker 2>this is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kicked the writers out because they</v>

571
00:26:25.491 --> 00:26:28.960
<v Speaker 2>had these writers that would come and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would hang out at the,</v>

572
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.160
<v Speaker 2>in the back of the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they would,</v>

573
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.770
<v Speaker 2>those sketches would appear on</v>
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

574
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>like they would take people's premises</v>
<v Speaker 2>and turned them into sketches.</v>

575
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.800
<v Speaker 2>It was a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was like,</v>

576
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.560
<v Speaker 2>this is in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early nineties.</v>

577
00:26:39.561 --> 00:26:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

578
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 2>so it has happened in my friend Kevin</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genius showcase</v>

579
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.120
<v Speaker 3>for all these writers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did this bit about muffins.</v>

580
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 3>He used to have this closing bit that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>should do about muffins,</v>

581
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.280
<v Speaker 3>that if someone wants a piece of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muffin,</v>

582
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.760
<v Speaker 3>you don't give them the muffin top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have all the muffins teams.</v>

583
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:57.840
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

584
00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.050
<v Speaker 3>had a bit that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a showcase for NBC at development</v>

585
00:27:01.051 --> 00:27:03.440
<v Speaker 3>deal with NBC stump you want but you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't fight.</v>

586
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.360
<v Speaker 3>It was a funny bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in with Kevin,</v>

587
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.920
<v Speaker 3>he's a funny guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

588
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.180
<v Speaker 3>And Kevin is an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

589
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.390
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his bit was way before the Seinfeld</v>

590
00:27:12.391 --> 00:27:14.330
<v Speaker 3>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean he's not a thief at all.</v>

591
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:19.020
<v Speaker 3>So then that bit came out like in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>exact form on an episode of Seinfeld and</v>

592
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:21.360
<v Speaker 3>this is NBC writers who went to see him</v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

593
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.650
<v Speaker 3>That shit happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys have to produce and some of</v>

594
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:26.484
<v Speaker 3>them aren't that good.</v>

595
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 3>I've had fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had some development deals with</v>

596
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:32.760
<v Speaker 3>writers and or some development deals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you meet with writers and you</v>

597
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:34.410
<v Speaker 3>read some of the stuff they write and</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys had.</v>

598
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.700
<v Speaker 3>This is in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

599
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:38.460
<v Speaker 3>So this is like the sitcom boom friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

600
00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:42.630
<v Speaker 3>This is when I was on news radio and</v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys had big deals where they were</v>

601
00:27:42.631 --> 00:27:46.020
<v Speaker 3>getting a lot of money and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking garbage.</v>

602
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 3>Terrible writers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

603
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 3>And they get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get desperado man and they need</v>

604
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:54.060
<v Speaker 3>premises and they'll go to comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No fucking steel.</v>

605
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 3>And it was a huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been a huge problem for a long</v>

606
00:27:57.361 --> 00:27:58.650
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

607
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.860
<v Speaker 3>So you take away those sketches and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

608
00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:02.431
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

609
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think you can make</v>
<v Speaker 3>her responsible for those sketches</v>

610
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:07.140
<v Speaker 3>because there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were going to do your show</v>

611
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 3>and you had a premise that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>pitched you,</v>

612
00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:09.600
<v Speaker 3>what are you gonna do?</v>

613
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.770
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna go online and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

614
00:28:10.771 --> 00:28:13.410
<v Speaker 3>has anybody heard this premise before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to do that.</v>

615
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

616
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:17.010
<v Speaker 3>you have to ask around your friends and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your friends might not know.</v>

617
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:20.370
<v Speaker 3>You could ask me and I've been doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>standup for 26 fucking years.</v>

618
00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:24.270
<v Speaker 3>I might not know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might ask 10 people and those 10</v>

619
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:27.090
<v Speaker 3>people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then that big guts on television,</v>

620
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:28.620
<v Speaker 3>someone goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

621
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:30.780
<v Speaker 3>I saw that on mad TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was another one.</v>

622
00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:33.750
<v Speaker 3>There was a mad tv one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a mad TV tv one.</v>

623
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 3>It was the exact same premise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was about a woman.</v>

624
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:43.370
<v Speaker 3>It was about amy talking to a woman at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the counter of a store and someone had</v>

625
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:46.260
<v Speaker 3>helped her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The person who helps her gets</v>

626
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:48.060
<v Speaker 3>commissioned and she couldn't say it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a black guy.</v>

627
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.870
<v Speaker 3>So she was trying a way to say it</v>
<v Speaker 3>without saying it's a black guy.</v>

628
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

629
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.960
<v Speaker 3>he had dark eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

630
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like it's put the same exact premise</v>

631
00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:01.490
<v Speaker 3>as mad TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

632
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Did she know about the manatee viewing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck watched mad TV.</v>

633
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.480
<v Speaker 3>I never watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ever watch it,</v>

634
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.760
<v Speaker 3>I watched some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not maybe twice,</v>

635
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.653
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

636
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean how they were on for 100 years,</v>

637
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.350
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV was on forever.</v>

638
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.423
<v Speaker 3>Like how could you.</v>

639
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I like the sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize how racist it was when</v>

640
00:29:19.721 --> 00:29:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I was watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the nail lady sketch.</v>

641
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.810
<v Speaker 3>That's a good sketch that made that girl</v>

642
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.660
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the lady that ran the nail shop.</v>

645
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angela Johnson.</v>

646
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.580

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

647
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.433

<v Speaker 1>This was early.</v>

648
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I think this is even before Angela</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson was on the show.</v>

649
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:48.350
<v Speaker 1>This was like early in mad TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of their signature sketches</v>

650
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:50.590
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Occasionally.</v>

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.590
<v Speaker 1>because I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

00:32:10.001 --> 00:32:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

699
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.260
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the Amy Schumer thing.</v>

700
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

701
00:32:15.281 --> 00:32:17.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

702
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also this,</v>

703
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 1>there's like this momentum that's a part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it now.</v>

704
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:24.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like a feeding frenzy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

705
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you got like Ari Shaffir had</v>

706
00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:29.530
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when those people were mad at</v>

707
00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:33.450
<v Speaker 1>him because he did a bit and one of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialist about a girl with one arm and</v>

708
00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:36.530
<v Speaker 1>everyone's mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's sitting at the center name shows</v>

<v Speaker 1>comedy central.</v>

710
00:32:38.681 --> 00:32:41.030

<v Speaker 1>let them say her name.</v>

711
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck would they don't know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>that slipped through the cracks because</v>

712
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.170
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>did a joke about my ex girlfriend was</v>

714
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.480
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about having an introduced my</v>

715
00:32:53.481 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 1>ex girlfriend at an open mic after</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she was a poet.</v>

716
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't seen her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just Kinda goes to me and didn't</v>

717
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 1>stop calling me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was just.</v>

718
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:05.090
<v Speaker 1>The joke was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

719
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.730
<v Speaker 1>please welcome to the cold hearted bitch</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke my heart.</v>

720
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.510
<v Speaker 1>You may know her from that returning my</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone calls also given out mediocre Joe</v>

721
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.510
<v Speaker 1>blow jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please welcome to the stage blank,</v>

722
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:15.140
<v Speaker 1>blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

723
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.480
<v Speaker 1>But I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a couple times I would say her</v>

724
00:33:17.481 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 1>name on stage and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to change the name.</v>

725
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 1>What I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I changed it to something that's close</v>

726
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:27.020
<v Speaker 1>to the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were adamant about I had to</v>

727
00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:28.760
<v Speaker 1>change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

728
00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they didn't see the problem is</v>

729
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:35.450
<v Speaker 1>he didn't make that special for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made that special on his own and sold</v>

730
00:33:35.451 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 1>it to comedy central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think comedy central just bought it</v>

731
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:41.540
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't have to do any work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just bought it and then edit it</v>

732
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.370
<v Speaker 1>and then someone just didn't do their</v>
<v Speaker 1>job</v>

733
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.570
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

734
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:52.340
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fat person smelled.</v>

735
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:58.200
<v Speaker 1>It was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>very angry named mostly unknown person.</v>

736
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn heart,</v>

737
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.240
<v Speaker 1>her name is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

738
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.180
<v Speaker 1>that's her full name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

739
00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.480
<v Speaker 1>that was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you live,</v>

740
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:14.150
<v Speaker 1>you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all make mistakes.</v>

741
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.920
<v Speaker 1>But what he was saying was that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a fire and you just got to stay</v>

742
00:34:18.921 --> 00:34:20.510
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just let it burn out.</v>

743
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let that fire burn out.</v>

744
00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

745
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.140
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's a fire right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>after her and a lot of it is,</v>

746
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:28.790
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

747
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.820
<v Speaker 3>you got to be honest about what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening in her life.</v>

748
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 3>She's a movie star now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden</v>

749
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:38.900
<v Speaker 1>had one of the biggest years never in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a comedian to seven.</v>

750
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

751
00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:44.580
<v Speaker 3>So she went from a year and a half ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>to someone who would do.</v>

752
00:34:44.581 --> 00:34:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Well she probably sell out a weekend in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phoenix or some shit.</v>

753
00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:49.890
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she did well,</v>

754
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was sued theaters.</v>

755
00:34:52.951 --> 00:34:55.690
<v Speaker 3>I think she was just doing okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say theater.</v>

756
00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.980
<v Speaker 3>She's doing like a 1500 seat or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

757
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.730
<v Speaker 3>Now she's doing 20,000 seats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's doing arenas,</v>

758
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.200
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's doing arena tours.</v>

759
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:09.480
<v Speaker 3>So there's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of it is the tall poppy syndrome,</v>

760
00:35:09.481 --> 00:35:11.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To people want to knock her down because</v>

761
00:35:11.791 --> 00:35:15.810
<v Speaker 3>she's taken off so high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But objectively stay away from that.</v>

762
00:35:15.811 --> 00:35:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the whole thing objectively.</v>

763
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.370
<v Speaker 3>There's an originality problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

764
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.960
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely an originality</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

765
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.600
<v Speaker 3>The problem is whose problem is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

766
00:35:24.601 --> 00:35:25.680
<v Speaker 3>like here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

767
00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.250

<v Speaker 3>Someone said she's put out 15 hours of,</v>

768
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sketches in one year.</v>

769
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Of course there's going to be some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some originality problems.</v>

770
00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:36.300
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.970
<v Speaker 3>what about that show?</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's got an addiction to slap in the</v>

<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen that.</v>

782
00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.390
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking funny man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's some shit that I've never seen</v>

783
00:36:12.391 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whenever I see one of their</v>

784
00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:17.220
<v Speaker 3>sketches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always so out there and weird and</v>

785
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:20.790
<v Speaker 3>fun into a very dark direction a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>times too.</v>

786

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's all original.</v>

788
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:27.720

<v Speaker 3>and no one's,</v>

789
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.020
<v Speaker 3>no one's coming at them for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for not.</v>

790
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.470
<v Speaker 3>So it can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just the tall poppy syndrome.</v>

791
00:36:34.471 --> 00:36:37.260
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely an issue and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>sucks,</v>

792
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.990
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sucks to watch all the blood in the</v>

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

798
00:36:50.701 --> 00:36:54.360

<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things which seems</v>

799
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:59.361
<v Speaker 3>like it's a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that as crazy because we,</v>

00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:40.380
<v Speaker 3>comedian's a plagiarist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like it.</v>

814
00:37:40.381 --> 00:37:43.380
<v Speaker 3>They get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think someone wrote an article</v>

815
00:37:43.381 --> 00:37:44.650
<v Speaker 3>about this recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

816
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.300
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

817
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.540
<v Speaker 3>you tweeted it and who was the guy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote the article?</v>

818
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:53.070
<v Speaker 3>But the guy had a real good point and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said if someone does something in a</v>

819
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:54.600
<v Speaker 3>movie and it turns out that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

820
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.850
<v Speaker 3>that scene had been in another movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

821
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stole that from blazing saddles or</v>

822
00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:00.750
<v Speaker 3>some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't offend people because they</v>

823
00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:02.880
<v Speaker 3>know that you're just reading some lines</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a movie,</v>

824
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Speaker 3>but if someone goes to see Hannibal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that your shit is your</v>

825
00:38:07.441 --> 00:38:10.480
<v Speaker 3>thoughts like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to see what is Hannibal?</v>

826
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 3>Think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

827
00:38:12.661 --> 00:38:14.080
<v Speaker 3>when I go see Hannibal buress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

828
00:38:14.081 --> 00:38:14.800
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

829
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.730
<v Speaker 3>what are his thoughts on blank?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

830
00:38:17.731 --> 00:38:19.920
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does he feel about this?</v>

831
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.620
<v Speaker 3>How does he feel about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I expect that,</v>

832
00:38:22.621 --> 00:38:24.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're an interesting,</v>

833
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.730
<v Speaker 3>intelligent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have your own point of</v>

834
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:29.520
<v Speaker 3>view like you go to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Burr is a perfect example.</v>

835
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Bill Burr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can count on bill burke,</v>

836
00:38:32.271 --> 00:38:34.890
<v Speaker 3>kind of humor from Bill Burr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you go see him.</v>

837
00:38:34.891 --> 00:38:37.510
<v Speaker 3>He's got like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Betty did about Arnold Schwartzenegger.</v>

838
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh great man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you ever see that bed?</v>

839
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:42.420
<v Speaker 3>Is it a bit about a is fucking gold</v>
<v Speaker 3>digging?</v>

840
00:38:42.421 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 3>We've got an epidemic of gold digging</v>
<v Speaker 3>whores.</v>

841
00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 3>She took down a great man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great man.</v>

842
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.630
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a bill burr bit.</v>

843
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 3>I fucking love that bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point is you're not going to get</v>

844
00:38:53.381 --> 00:38:54.610
<v Speaker 3>anybody to write that for you.</v>

845
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:56.860
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to steal that from</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody that's.</v>

846
00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:02.070
<v Speaker 3>It's so obvious when you see the bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's his sense of humor and when</v>

847
00:39:02.291 --> 00:39:04.950
<v Speaker 3>you're not doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you doing just a bunch of like</v>

848
00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.700
<v Speaker 3>patchwork bullshit that some other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people wrote for you or some clunky</v>

849
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:14.110
<v Speaker 3>premises that you may or may not have</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifted from somebody else and reworded.</v>

850
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:15.860
<v Speaker 3>It offends people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

851
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:17.800
<v Speaker 3>Because you're a faker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

852
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.100
<v Speaker 3>So that's what happened with Mensa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were offended,</v>

853
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found out it's fake.</v>

854
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.020
<v Speaker 3>You're fake and you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing what you're saying</v>

855
00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 3>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying here's the world through</v>

856
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:30.340
<v Speaker 3>my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not really the world through</v>

857
00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:31.600
<v Speaker 3>your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>

858
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:36.430
<v Speaker 3>you're just trying to push buttons and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking Bang on things and make.</v>

859
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.410
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to make things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

860
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:43.411
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to use bits that work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not necessarily showing people</v>

861
00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:48.030
<v Speaker 3>the way you think about stuff and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that's what's unique about standup</v>

862
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.210
<v Speaker 3>as opposed to anything else.</v>

863
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:52.510
<v Speaker 3>Like if you found out that Jay Z had</v>
<v Speaker 3>writers,</v>

864
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.730
<v Speaker 3>would it offend you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't offend me.</v>

865
00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.370
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't bother me at all if I found</v>
<v Speaker 3>out that,</v>

866
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rolling stones hired some guy to</v>

867
00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:01.830
<v Speaker 3>write their new album.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

868
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not offended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I find out that Lucy case,</v>

869
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:11.460
<v Speaker 3>new special was written entirely by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>team of writers and you know,</v>

870
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.030
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

871
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:16.750
<v Speaker 3>just sort of like rehashed all the shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they wrote down.</v>

872
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Then I don't feel the same way when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I watched Louis,</v>

873
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.770
<v Speaker 3>I know that I'm going to see Louis ck</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts on stuff.</v>

874
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Every time you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that that's Louis thinking</v>

875
00:40:26.711 --> 00:40:29.590
<v Speaker 3>about shit and it's so obvious when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear it on stage.</v>

876
00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:33.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's coming from his voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the difference I think.</v>

877
00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would stand up definitely.</v>

878
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.810
<v Speaker 3>What's the guy's name here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

879
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not even a real person.</v>

880
00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:48.820
<v Speaker 3>How dare you person whoever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why joke thieves are bad by someone who</v>

881
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:50.800
<v Speaker 3>doesn't believe in intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 3>property.</v>

882
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

883
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.400
<v Speaker 3>I believe in intellectual property and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely jokes if you.</v>

884
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.670
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever been swiped anybody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>swiped from you.</v>

885
00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I've heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear about somebody.</v>

886
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying some that opened Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has been lines where maybe they took</v>

887
00:41:07.051 --> 00:41:09.600
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that certain things or</v>

888
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.290
<v Speaker 1>commercials and shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't really,</v>

889
00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:19.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take kind of portray [inaudible].</v>

890
00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Patrice O'Neil had a philosophy about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

891
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody take a joke for me then</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means they needed it way more than</v>

892
00:41:28.141 --> 00:41:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I do and I'm just gonna write more jokes</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I got,</v>

893
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you could take I'm a right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

894
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.900
<v Speaker 2>20 more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

895
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.860
<v Speaker 2>So I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard about comics tryma shit or</v>

896
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:44.950
<v Speaker 2>trying or doing different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really engage it because</v>

897
00:41:45.231 --> 00:41:46.210
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

898
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.620
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you try my shit,</v>

899
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably gonna just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

900
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:51.163
<v Speaker 2>good luck with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

901
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.190
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what if someone does it and they</v>

902
00:41:55.191 --> 00:41:58.010
<v Speaker 2>become like men Sia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become huge and they do that shit</v>

903
00:41:58.011 --> 00:42:00.230
<v Speaker 2>on television and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if it's like a bit.</v>

904
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 2>That's something you have a very unusual</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit about fucking skittles.</v>

905
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like a signature pit and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious whatever.</v>

906
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Pick a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like something that's really</v>

907
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.980
<v Speaker 2>near and dear to your heart and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked on it for a long time.</v>

908
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

909
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:18.050
<v Speaker 2>there's bits that you work on like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day I don't fucking work right away and</v>

910
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:19.130
<v Speaker 2>try to figure out how to.</v>

911
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.260
<v Speaker 2>You figure out how to make them work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then someone comes along and just swipes</v>

912
00:42:23.261 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to just accept.</v>

913
00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that theory,</v>

914
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.980
<v Speaker 2>my theory applies to people what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw less famous than when they started.</v>

915
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

916
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:35.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

917
00:42:35.631 --> 00:42:37.970
<v Speaker 2>You just assume they're never gonna make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

918
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.340
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

919
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely dice.</v>

920
00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amy's a close friends.</v>

921
00:42:43.901 --> 00:42:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Soda is dicey to exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is just a weird,</v>

922
00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.100
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

923
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Because I like her a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's hilarious.</v>

924
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.130
<v Speaker 2>She's very funny and sharp in interviews</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on the radio,</v>

925
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:56.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing podcasts.</v>

926
00:42:56.931 --> 00:42:58.700
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's sharp,</v>

927
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:01.190
<v Speaker 2>she's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's ambitious as fuck.</v>

928
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:05.420
<v Speaker 2>But this is a very unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very unfortunate.</v>

929
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also a problem with,</v>

930
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:09.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently she burned through a shitload</v>

931
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.560
<v Speaker 2>of material doing that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like doing their show,</v>

932
00:43:12.561 --> 00:43:15.270
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of her standup premises she</v>
<v Speaker 2>did in the show,</v>

933
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.950
<v Speaker 2>the show was very important and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>right afterwards just got to do the HBO</v>

934
00:43:18.951 --> 00:43:20.510
<v Speaker 2>special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

935
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:21.710
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the HBO special.</v>

936
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:24.410
<v Speaker 2>There's only the one bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was only the Wendy Liebman joke,</v>

937
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:25.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a Mark Marin,</v>

938
00:43:25.671 --> 00:43:28.460
<v Speaker 2>one to the bulb at the Mark Marin one</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are saying.</v>

939
00:43:28.461 --> 00:43:32.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a pretty obvious premise,</v>

940
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.010
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno man.</v>

941
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

942
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.000
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good that</v>

943
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:41.630
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll leave it there,</v>

944
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.320
<v Speaker 2>leave it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

945
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:48.320
<v Speaker 2>She'll rebound because she's talented</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I really think she is.</v>

946
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:51.500
<v Speaker 2>But if she was anybody else though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about this?</v>

947
00:43:51.501 --> 00:43:53.180
<v Speaker 2>This is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I didn't care about her,</v>

948
00:43:53.181 --> 00:43:55.160
<v Speaker 2>if I wasn't friends with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was anybody else?</v>

949
00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.460
<v Speaker 2>People would want her head if she was</v>
<v Speaker 2>some asshole,</v>

950
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if it was seeing,</v>

951
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.370
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it came out that car had a new show</v>

952
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.940
<v Speaker 2>and all this shit was on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would want his head,</v>

953
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:13.270
<v Speaker 2>there will be blood in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's strong woman's feminists,</v>

954
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole deal.</v>

955
00:44:15.051 --> 00:44:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like people are and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like her,</v>

956
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:18.780
<v Speaker 2>like comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like her,</v>

957
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely a more kid gloves</v>

958
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:27.050
<v Speaker 2>approach from the comedy community</v>
<v Speaker 2>except for the girls that she stole from</v>

959
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.710
<v Speaker 2>or allegedly stole from or they believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>she stole from they.</v>

960
00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:35.760
<v Speaker 2>They went after her and then they pulled</v>
<v Speaker 2>back like Wendy Liebman and Kathleen</v>

961
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Madigan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went after and then they pulled</v>

962
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is unfortunate.</v>

963
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at you,</v>

964
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:45.500
<v Speaker 2>be backed out of the whole conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

965
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Pulled your chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice chair back.</v>

966
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.500
<v Speaker 2>She'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll be fine.</v>

967
00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:00.680
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's important to have</v>

968
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:04.710
<v Speaker 2>original material like Palae and Kiki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the name key?</v>

969
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Keenan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keenan,</v>

970
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.360
<v Speaker 2>impale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Writers.</v>

971
00:45:09.361 --> 00:45:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Writers are a fucking problem.</v>

972
00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:14.160
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know those dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you hire a bunch of writers,</v>

973
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.500
<v Speaker 2>you just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what their ethical</v>

974
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:19.290
<v Speaker 2>processes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what their,</v>

975
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.240
<v Speaker 2>how their creative process works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

976
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.970
<v Speaker 2>you don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking and those guys have to produce,</v>

977
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:25.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to produce.</v>

978
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.880
<v Speaker 2>I knew a girl who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

979
00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.480
<v Speaker 2>a writer on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

980
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:34.890
<v Speaker 2>she was a writer on like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crime show or something like that and</v>

981
00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:36.600
<v Speaker 2>she apparently had plagiarized some</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

982
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:38.230
<v Speaker 2>She got busted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

983
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:42.450
<v Speaker 2>she had just cut and pasted or came up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some,</v>

984
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 2>some shit that somebody else had already</v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

985
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:47.400
<v Speaker 2>And that was it for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Later,</v>

986
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:51.590
<v Speaker 2>later in the season it might show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

987
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.760
<v Speaker 2>so we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll send out,</v>

988
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll send out requests for jokes about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain thing.</v>

989
00:45:57.781 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 2>And it was some writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

990
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.160
<v Speaker 2>eat subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to crank it up,</v>

991
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:07.190
<v Speaker 2>crank out 10 a bunch of jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was one right close to the.</v>

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:14.060
<v Speaker 2>He just started just send in like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>week has joked.</v>

993
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.400
<v Speaker 2>It don't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

994
00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:19.243
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

995
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I never said anything about it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the season was winding down with a part</v>

996
00:46:22.741 --> 00:46:24.310
<v Speaker 2>of me wanting to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you depressed as</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't say step it up.</v>

999
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew him before,</v>

1000
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.800
<v Speaker 2>but I want to put a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1001
00:46:37.801 --> 00:46:39.180
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's a writer.</v>

1002
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:43.520
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was sitting in one like one joke.</v>

1003
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:47.850
<v Speaker 2>The problem with comics is if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on your show and I come up with</v>

1004
00:46:47.851 --> 00:46:52.260
<v Speaker 2>a fucking bang as premise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to Tuck that shit away and I'm</v>

1005
00:46:52.261 --> 00:46:57.150
<v Speaker 2>going to give you some half ass shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>

1006
00:46:57.151 --> 00:46:58.560
<v Speaker 2>if it's going to be in your act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1007
00:46:58.590 --> 00:46:59.101
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Make me this.</v>

1009
00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Could be it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't give this to an animal that</v>

1010
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:05.903
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1011
00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.880
<v Speaker 2>With comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could see it.</v>

1012
00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Avenue.</v>

1013
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.153
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1014
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.900
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely what happens with</v>
<v Speaker 2>comics.</v>

1015
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.540
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a writer,</v>

1016
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.370
<v Speaker 2>just a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different thing.</v>

1017
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.630
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to be known for your</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>

1018
00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:20.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a writer and a comic,</v>

1019
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Tuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuck it,</v>

1020
00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 2>tuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just interesting,</v>

1021
00:47:28.351 --> 00:47:29.530
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This whole thing is,</v>

1022
00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

1023
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 3>an interesting time because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1024
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:34.840
<v Speaker 3>the accountability accountability is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>high now.</v>

1025
00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's good.</v>

1026
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think,</v>

1027
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse amy and say it wasn't her fault</v>

1028
00:47:43.271 --> 00:47:44.770
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all writers and everything like</v>

1029
00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:45.660
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the.</v>

1030
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Obviously there was an originality</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem obviously.</v>

1031
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no getting around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good thing,</v>

1032
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:57.100
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's his forces people to to be as</v>

1033
00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 3>original as possible and even then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have some mistakes or</v>

1034
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:04.720
<v Speaker 3>some parallel thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Parallel thinking is so common,</v>

1035
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.820
<v Speaker 3>like a Viagra thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1036
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have an erection for more than</v>

1037
00:48:09.101 --> 00:48:10.570
<v Speaker 3>five hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seek medical help.</v>

1038
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.700
<v Speaker 3>Dad Joke writes itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's over.</v>

1039
00:48:12.701 --> 00:48:13.534
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1040
00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody</v>

1041
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:16.800
<v Speaker 1>thing I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got two kids.</v>

1042
00:48:16.801 --> 00:48:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I've got a boy and a girl.</v>

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.590
<v Speaker 3>pitching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pitching guys,</v>

1084
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:21.230
<v Speaker 3>pitching guys that had written.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lisa.</v>

1086

<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

1087
00:50:23.391 --> 00:50:26.540
<v Speaker 1>There's one way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill it.</v>

1088
00:50:26.541 --> 00:50:31.541
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling creatively inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way guys have ever written a while</v>

1089
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this one.</v>

1090
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.270
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

1091
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some road itself.</v>

1092
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll search a joke it before I</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet something that's about something</v>

1093
00:50:41.601 --> 00:50:46.601
<v Speaker 1>topical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll search that on twitter to see if</v>

1094
00:50:47.451 --> 00:50:50.030
<v Speaker 1>somebody else said it already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>

1095
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.980
<v Speaker 1>That's smart and it's some stuff where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1096
00:50:51.981 --> 00:50:53.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's some stuff that's easy.</v>

1097
00:50:53.691 --> 00:50:55.820
<v Speaker 1>First thought that anybody can come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1098
00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1099
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a hot take on this</v>

1100
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:05.630
<v Speaker 1>cavaliers game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird because it's your thought</v>

1101
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:07.700
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't you just express yourself?</v>

1102
00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:11.450
<v Speaker 1>You have to go looking to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone didn't express a similar idea</v>

1103
00:51:11.451 --> 00:51:14.450
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to,</v>

1104
00:51:14.451 --> 00:51:15.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's just tricky.</v>

1105
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather do that then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1106
00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exact same thing as somebody 30</v>

1107
00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 1>followers just tweeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:24.343
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1109
00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1110
00:51:25.971 --> 00:51:26.900
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1111
00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And mediums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1112
00:51:28.971 --> 00:51:30.950
<v Speaker 1>That was another one that Wendy Liebman</v>
<v Speaker 1>got pissed at.</v>

1113
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Someone had taken one of her bits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned it into a meme,</v>

1114
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.380
<v Speaker 1>but without her face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So credit.</v>

1115
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a car.</v>

1116
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:40.400
<v Speaker 1>They used a cartoon image instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1117
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:43.630
<v Speaker 1>instead of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1118
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.730
<v Speaker 1>she was pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1119
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:46.520
<v Speaker 1>If it was her faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they'd done it a bunch of</v>

1120
00:51:46.521 --> 00:51:49.520
<v Speaker 1>times to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure to you too with your actual</v>

1121
00:51:49.521 --> 00:51:52.820
<v Speaker 1>face and a bit that you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have zero problem with that.</v>

1122
00:51:52.821 --> 00:51:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

1123
00:51:53.891 --> 00:51:55.880
<v Speaker 1>It means they like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think you're funny.</v>

1124
00:51:55.881 --> 00:51:58.810
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took the time to say something that</v>

1125
00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:01.280
<v Speaker 1>you said that they enjoyed and they put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in a picture.</v>

1126
00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of upset that I never made blam</v>
<v Speaker 1>blam weeding him tee shirts.</v>

1127
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not too late.</v>

1128
00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Not too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if I take you pig finding.</v>

1129
00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.830
<v Speaker 1>If I take you pig hunting then we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can go out there and with them.</v>

1130
00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people had that mean like</v>

1131
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.970
<v Speaker 1>immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why we're doing the podcast bland,</v>

1132
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Bland Wheaton Ham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blam blam eating ham.</v>

1133
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Like Dan was one of the big complaints</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that fat Jewish guy was that he</v>

1134
00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:27.200
<v Speaker 1>would take standup bits and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in memes.</v>

1135
00:52:27.201 --> 00:52:30.770
<v Speaker 1>They would steal someone's stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes and turned into a meme.</v>

1136
00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

1137
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:32.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1138
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.740
<v Speaker 1>and it became the single.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he stealing jokes because he's just</v>

1139
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:40.220
<v Speaker 1>putting up memes on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is that?</v>

1140
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:41.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1141
00:52:41.541 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 1>it is dealing jokes because he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>crediting people and he was also taking</v>

1142
00:52:45.261 --> 00:52:49.550
<v Speaker 1>people's memes from their site and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>reposting it without crediting them and</v>

1143
00:52:49.551 --> 00:52:53.540
<v Speaker 1>then getting all of the new followers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and likes exactly somebody I went out</v>

1144
00:52:53.541 --> 00:52:58.541

<v Speaker 1>with his management or something.</v>

1145
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:05.060
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how true this is or if this</v>

1146
00:53:05.061 --> 00:53:10.061
<v Speaker 1>is just a one off instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she said that he got booked to do</v>

1147

<v Speaker 1>said he got a hundred $50,000.</v>

1177
00:54:33.901 --> 00:54:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I guess we're just just fucking his body</v>
<v Speaker 2>up until it quit.</v>

1178
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 2>But I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That mother fucker could perform.</v>

1179
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won.</v>

1180
00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.100
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was maybe a.</v>

1181
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:46.320
<v Speaker 2>nobody was paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the part of the problem.</v>

1182
00:54:46.321 --> 00:54:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to get everybody up like we were</v>

1183
00:54:48.401 --> 00:54:49.630
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people feel bad.</v>

1184
00:54:49.631 --> 00:54:52.200
<v Speaker 2>So they're like getting people up other</v>
<v Speaker 2>seats and getting them towards the</v>

1185
00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:55.170
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch this huge band is doing,</v>

1186
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:58.110
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows how much they had to</v>

1187
00:54:58.111 --> 00:55:00.630
<v Speaker 2>pay them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must have been an ungodly sum of</v>

1188
00:55:00.631 --> 00:55:02.010
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm.</v>

1189
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:06.360
<v Speaker 2>That fucking dude rocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was 100,000 people in that</v>

1190
00:55:06.361 --> 00:55:07.194
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

1191
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.960
<v Speaker 2>He went full on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean full on.</v>

1192
00:55:09.961 --> 00:55:11.370
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really impressive.</v>

1193
00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:15.660
<v Speaker 2>It made me want to be better at standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made me want to work at my standup.</v>

1194
00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Was is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's easier to do that when</v>

1195
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:20.790
<v Speaker 2>you're doing music because you got the</v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

1196
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need momentum.</v>

1197
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:28.040
<v Speaker 2>It helps me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's easy to have the wind taken out</v>

1198
00:55:28.861 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 2>of your sails when you perform foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A inattentive crap,</v>

1199
00:55:32.731 --> 00:55:35.850
<v Speaker 2>like it's tough to just really get into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1200
00:55:35.851 --> 00:55:39.600
<v Speaker 2>I guess you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it takes a different for doing</v>

1201
00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:43.770
<v Speaker 2>standup and doing stand up if you do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of people that are.</v>

1202
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Half of my eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 of them I texted and a few people</v>

1203
00:55:48.241 --> 00:55:50.730
<v Speaker 2>paying attention and given polite</v>
<v Speaker 2>circles.</v>

1204
00:55:50.731 --> 00:55:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Like it's tough to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1205
00:55:52.471 --> 00:55:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go all the way because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so dependent on it reacts a</v>

1206
00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.960
<v Speaker 2>little music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get through band behind you.</v>

1207
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.880
<v Speaker 2>You can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to rock this shit out.</v>

1208
00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 2>And cassius checking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1209
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.190
<v Speaker 2>But in comedy acts with guitars too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could do the same shit.</v>

1210
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they still need the labs.</v>

1211
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:12.170
<v Speaker 2>The labs is what builds into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into being able to really rock that</v>

1212
00:56:13.561 --> 00:56:14.530
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:18.690
<v Speaker 2>And be a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I found some that people if you,</v>

1214
00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:21.510
<v Speaker 2>because I've done some gigs that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

1215
00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I did this Gig so nice paying gig.</v>

1216
00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Chicago.</v>

1217
00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:28.020
<v Speaker 1>It was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As,</v>

1218
00:56:28.021 --> 00:56:30.910
<v Speaker 1>as wide ballroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people talk at some people</v>

1219
00:56:30.911 --> 00:56:34.600
<v Speaker 1>listening and usually I would call out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1220
00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:37.930
<v Speaker 1>this shit sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is horrible.</v>

1221
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:40.270
<v Speaker 1>This is a horrible performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

1222
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.610
<v Speaker 1>But something in my head that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1223
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:45.520
<v Speaker 1>just due to time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go a few minutes short</v>

1224
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:51.730
<v Speaker 1>and just don't acknowledge it and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>power through due to time.</v>

1225
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Goodnight everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the money and go and if you don't</v>

1226
00:56:56.501 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you don't acknowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're behind me.</v>

1227
00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 1>People think it went</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1228
00:57:02.111 --> 00:57:03.250
<v Speaker 1>They might just be nice to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1229
00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.630
<v Speaker 1>they might've just been night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

1230
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:08.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hated the meet and greet afterwards at</v>

1231
00:57:08.831 --> 00:57:12.780
<v Speaker 1>the meet and greet with like some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with the organization or whatever</v>

1232
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:17.180
<v Speaker 1>can take a bunch of pitches and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like FDA did after.</v>

1233
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't necessarily eat but it wasn't</v>

1234
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.140
<v Speaker 1>an ideal gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a,</v>

1235
00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.970
<v Speaker 1>it was a cash grab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cash grab.</v>

1236
00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.650
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1237
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:29.080
<v Speaker 1>it was like the meet and greet</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

1238
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I hate doing the meet and greet after a</v>
<v Speaker 1>social show because I'm like,</v>

1239
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather be amongst myself and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

1240
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any of you and you were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd that I hate it</v>

1241
00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.740
<v Speaker 2>as a group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to talk to you but I'm glad you</v>

1242
00:57:43.741 --> 00:57:48.741
<v Speaker 2>brought that up because I remember you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I were at the same casino that to</v>

1243
00:57:48.961 --> 00:57:53.860
<v Speaker 2>your lip casino up in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like an hour north of Seattle.</v>

1244
00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that gigs suck for you because</v>

1245
00:57:57.271 --> 00:58:00.390
<v Speaker 2>that Gig suck for me and it sucks so bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Patton Oswald,</v>

1246
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:03.960
<v Speaker 2>that he did a fucking bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on his last CD.</v>

1247
00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:09.120
<v Speaker 2>It's on his last fucking you live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have never performed for a place where</v>

1248
00:58:09.121 --> 00:58:12.000
<v Speaker 2>people were more drunk and rowdy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1249
00:58:12.001 --> 00:58:14.430
<v Speaker 2>It is the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had a good time.</v>

1250
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:16.740
<v Speaker 2>It was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did an hour.</v>

1251
00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:21.030
<v Speaker 2>I might have done 10 minutes of material</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I might be exaggerating,</v>

1252
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that bad.</v>

1253
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Like they did see a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember if this was a</v>

1254
00:58:28.021 --> 00:58:31.060
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't remember being horrible lot.</v>

1255
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:36.470
<v Speaker 1>They just see a lot of people up front</v>
<v Speaker 1>that obviously weren't fans of mine that</v>

1256
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:40.200
<v Speaker 1>just they got casino comps or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lose a lot of money.</v>

1257
00:58:40.201 --> 00:58:41.520
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they got.</v>

1258
00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:44.340
<v Speaker 1>So it was weird having these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1259
00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:48.090
<v Speaker 1>middle age 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the first couple of rows</v>

1260
00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:53.091
<v Speaker 1>full of these Asian ladies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously nothing against Asian ladies,</v>

1261
00:58:53.161 --> 00:58:55.770
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they were familiar</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my work</v>

1262
00:58:57.910 --> 00:59:00.750
<v Speaker 1>and they will in the front row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was.</v>

1263
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.820
<v Speaker 1>So I commented on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't that,</v>

1264
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:05.400
<v Speaker 1>that bad of a Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1265
00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:06.811
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1266
00:59:06.811 --> 00:59:09.450
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was way better than the Gig I was</v>

1267
00:59:09.451 --> 00:59:10.120
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1268
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.980
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another interesting thing about</v>

1269
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:16.981
<v Speaker 2>that Gig is that Gig was where this was</v>
<v Speaker 2>way before all the cosby stuff came out.</v>

1270
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:23.160
<v Speaker 2>The woman who was the manager came up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>us and we're talking in this and then I</v>

1271
00:59:23.541 --> 00:59:25.310
<v Speaker 2>always ask people,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's all you talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1388
01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I did like 40 minutes before I even</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought this up.</v>

1389
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:30.750
<v Speaker 1>But besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really because the people that want</v>

1390
01:04:30.751 --> 01:04:33.720
<v Speaker 1>to heckle me about it aren't the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid 30,</v>

1391
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.410
<v Speaker 1>$35 to see me do a dank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1392
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:37.740
<v Speaker 1>But you never know.</v>

1393
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Some people just get drunk and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't fucking handle themselves.</v>

1394
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>They just don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is an interesting thing where people</v>

1395
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.340
<v Speaker 1>sometimes think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

1396
01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I did ice house and I popped into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a show in a small room,</v>

1397
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last Saturday and uh,</v>

1398
01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I did a set and it was just the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>talkative crowd.</v>

1399
01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I started out as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1400
01:05:03.511 --> 01:05:04.081
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1401
01:05:04.081 --> 01:05:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan and there's like six people,</v>

1402
01:05:06.671 --> 01:05:07.111
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1405
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.770

<v Speaker 1>I wasn't asking you.</v>

1406
01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:13.100
<v Speaker 1>This is not a dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1407
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:16.830
<v Speaker 1>we haven't been to Japan really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up yelling at them and roasting</v>

1408
01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>people for about eight minutes.</v>

1409
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Did two jokes and then got up out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1410
01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.090

<v Speaker 2>talkative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1415
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.350

01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:44.810
<v Speaker 1>you can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can try stuff in the theater.</v>

1504
01:09:44.811 --> 01:09:49.811
<v Speaker 1>You can't leave work out in a theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a club you can have some misses</v>

1505
01:09:50.571 --> 01:09:52.940
<v Speaker 1>and could lose the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gain them back,</v>

1506
01:09:52.941 --> 01:09:56.710
<v Speaker 1>that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the clubs are more fun but you have</v>

1507
01:09:56.711 --> 01:10:00.650
<v Speaker 1>the theater is just a look better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look it,</v>

1508
01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:04.550
<v Speaker 1>but there's some theaters that it works</v>
<v Speaker 1>out like something like the Tabernacle</v>

1509
01:10:04.551 --> 01:10:06.920
<v Speaker 1>and Atlanta that places I've shopped</v>
<v Speaker 1>there before.</v>

1510
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shot there my 2012 special and I was</v>

1511
01:10:10.761 --> 01:10:12.590
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was just say a couple of weeks</v>

1512
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:13.220
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1513
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.370
<v Speaker 1>That place is hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a hot theater.</v>

1514
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:19.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the acoustics in it are amazing.</v>

1515
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And the way it's tiered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people even like the people in the</v>

1516
01:10:23.331 --> 01:10:25.370
<v Speaker 1>back row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty fucking close even though</v>

1517
01:10:25.371 --> 01:10:26.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a big place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1518
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:30.620
<v Speaker 1>that's a great spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of these old theaters in</v>

1519
01:10:30.621 --> 01:10:32.720
<v Speaker 1>this country that when you performed</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1520
01:10:32.721 --> 01:10:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you're like a part of a museum or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1521
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>

1522
01:10:35.881 --> 01:10:40.600
<v Speaker 1>you're performing in a place that's 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old and they charge you for it to.</v>

1523
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Do they charge you for the history?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1524
01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:46.460
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1525
01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:49.250

<v Speaker 1>I didn't want.</v>

1531
01:10:58.371 --> 01:11:01.580

<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>

1532
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are your worlds there.</v>

1533
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.130

<v Speaker 1>Comedy and fighting.</v>

1534
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into watching things while they</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1535
01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to wait.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was a good.</v>

1538
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen</v>

1539
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.260
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to hear.</v>

1540
01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I said I started out by saying I haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen it,</v>

1541
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:22.550
<v Speaker 2>but I just assume you had and you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>go off about it for a few minutes some</v>

1542
01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:26.910
<v Speaker 2>time time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just wanted to hear your thoughts</v>

1543
01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:27.630
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1544
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it was good.</v>

1545
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.400
<v Speaker 2>I heard it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1546
01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie didn't see him.</v>

1547
01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:34.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a.</v>

1548
01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:36.210
<v Speaker 2>she's a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1549
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to see like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cook racer bike?</v>

1550
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.840
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No fight or fight.</v>

1551
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see a cook.</v>

1552
01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:49.290
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if someone that I really liked</v>

1553
01:11:49.291 --> 01:11:51.060
<v Speaker 2>was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't watch snl.</v>

1554
01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's good.</v>

1555
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:56.700
<v Speaker 2>It's too bad too often for me to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

1556
01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Like the amount of good stuff that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get off the snl versus the amount of</v>

1557
01:12:01.921 --> 01:12:02.754
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1558
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:08.100
<v Speaker 2>it's way more than it is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just over the years,</v>

1559
01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:11.100
<v Speaker 2>if you accumulate all the different</v>
<v Speaker 2>sketches want me?</v>

1560
01:12:11.101 --> 01:12:11.840
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1561
01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a classic show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on any given night,</v>

1562
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:17.940
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to watch a lot of mediocre</v>

1563
01:12:17.941 --> 01:12:19.460
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tina Fey,</v>

1564
01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.540
<v Speaker 2>we pulled that up so that was really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1565
01:12:21.541 --> 01:12:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there for that.</v>

1566
01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:24.570
<v Speaker 2>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has been great.</v>

1567
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Really great sketches in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also have a problem with it because I</v>

1568
01:12:28.141 --> 01:12:33.141
<v Speaker 2>did news radio with Phil Hartman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phil Hartman had incredibly negative</v>

1569
01:12:34.231 --> 01:12:38.130
<v Speaker 2>shit to say about SNL,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the environment,</v>

1570
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:41.580
<v Speaker 2>about what it was like working there</v>
<v Speaker 2>about all the backstabbing behind the</v>

1571
01:12:41.581 --> 01:12:42.540
<v Speaker 2>scenes shit.</v>

1572
01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.510
<v Speaker 2>He hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucking hated it.</v>

1573

<v Speaker 2>secretly,</v>

1574
01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.030
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he was public about it,</v>

1575
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:54.290
<v Speaker 2>but till now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think he's probably taught well.</v>

1576
01:12:54.291 --> 01:12:57.940
<v Speaker 2>He's asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Post harmoniously homeless.</v>

1577
01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Is it polls harmlessly posthumous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>posthumous key and peele.</v>

1578
01:13:01.541 --> 01:13:06.350

1579
01:13:06.351 --> 01:13:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot Lee</v>
<v Speaker 2>posthumous.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1583
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:21.480
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I saying it wrong now that he's dead</v>

1584
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:24.120
<v Speaker 2>now that he's dead leaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1585
01:13:24.121 --> 01:13:25.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:29.790
<v Speaker 2>did a news radio that was the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitcom that he'd ever done and when he</v>

1587
01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:31.680
<v Speaker 2>came over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he had this sort of like</v>

1588
01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:35.070
<v Speaker 2>standoffish sort of an attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everybody's competing against</v>

1589
01:13:35.071 --> 01:13:36.870
<v Speaker 2>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like every man for himself,</v>

1590
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:39.390
<v Speaker 2>but then when he realized it wasn't like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1591
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:43.980
<v Speaker 2>he relaxed and then when he relaxed he</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I became friends and he would talk</v>

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Like hit it like this or do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>emphasis on that.</v>

1618
01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.760
<v Speaker 3>He was extremely professional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1619
01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:48.440
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1620
01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Like I learned a lot about discipline</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just being a professional,</v>

1621
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:55.930
<v Speaker 3>watching him work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy was not successful by</v>

1622
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:57.360
<v Speaker 3>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

1623
01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.470
<v Speaker 3>he was a hard work and smart dude</v>

1624
01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:01.880
<v Speaker 1>and married A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:06.380
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll be right back.</v>

1626
01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:14.180
<v Speaker 1>While you're allowed to call someone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come when they kill your friend.</v>

1627
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:15.103
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1628
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:17.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely those times when those times</v>

1629
01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:20.140
<v Speaker 1>to ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we uh,</v>

1630
01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Vegas and uh,</v>

1631
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 1>this is a weird thing to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1632
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1633
01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:32.890
<v Speaker 1>met up with a friend of a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl and her friend,</v>

1634
01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:37.950
<v Speaker 1>we hang out for a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the craps table.</v>

1635
01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't explain craps to her.</v>

1636
01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:45.450
<v Speaker 1>She could not take in the rules of</v>
<v Speaker 1>craft.</v>

1637
01:15:45.451 --> 01:15:47.480
<v Speaker 1>She was a little drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still the,</v>

1638
01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.210
<v Speaker 1>not the whole craps table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the basic,</v>

1639
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:54.140
<v Speaker 1>the seven slash 11 on the first rule is</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1640
01:15:54.141 --> 01:15:54.471
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

1641
01:15:54.471 --> 01:15:57.710
<v Speaker 1>12 is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get anything else,</v>

1642
01:15:57.711 --> 01:15:59.930
<v Speaker 1>that's your point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to hit that point before you</v>

1643
01:15:59.931 --> 01:16:02.060
<v Speaker 1>had seven new?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably couldn't explain it to me.</v>

1644
01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1645
01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a point.</v>

1646
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:07.010
<v Speaker 1>If you have five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five,</v>

1647
01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.210
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

1648
01:16:08.211 --> 01:16:09.500
<v Speaker 1>nine or 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your point.</v>

1649
01:16:09.501 --> 01:16:11.270
<v Speaker 1>And you want to hit that before you hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

1650
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:12.223
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1651
01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.760
<v Speaker 1>But I said this to her eight times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1652
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:18.470
<v Speaker 1>and she was watching the table also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she was just like,</v>

1653
01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.990
<v Speaker 1>is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that</v>

1654
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:26.780
<v Speaker 1>good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the guy is handing me money,</v>

1655
01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.370
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's taken away,</v>

1656
01:16:28.371 --> 01:16:30.110
<v Speaker 1>my money is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

1657
01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so uh,</v>

1658
01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.690
<v Speaker 1>so we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get in the back in my hotel</v>

1659
01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.200
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her friend was there too.</v>

1660
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her friend and I believe in,</v>

1661
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.270
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1662
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:51.270
<v Speaker 1>we fuck real quick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I go hop in the shower.</v>

1663
01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to head downstairs to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>awards,</v>

1664
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:58.680
<v Speaker 1>to the porn awards and then she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was trying to make me fuck her</v>

1665
01:16:58.681 --> 01:17:00.500
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1666
01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:02.570
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it again.</v>

1667
01:17:02.571 --> 01:17:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't come and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were done.</v>

1668
01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:08.300
<v Speaker 1>She was trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1669
01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll write you was like,</v>

1670
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already finished.</v>

1671
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I guess I didn't get what I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a.</v>

1672
01:17:17.561 --> 01:17:19.250
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I being a Douche bag?</v>

1673
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.731
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1674
01:17:19.731 --> 01:17:23.930
<v Speaker 1>she was being demanded also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't feel.</v>

1675
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:27.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't really like I'm wondering</v>

1676
01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:27.801
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1677
01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:30.890
<v Speaker 1>let's go again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like also I'm almost 33.</v>

1678
01:17:30.891 --> 01:17:33.170
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to build back up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1679
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Like the second round is too much for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1680
01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:40.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends entirely on how attractive</v>

1681
01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:45.290
<v Speaker 3>she is or how attracted you are to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That as a human being and physically</v>

1682
01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.110
<v Speaker 3>like what she looks like and like it</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounds like she was annoying a little</v>

1683
01:17:49.111 --> 01:17:49.600
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1684
01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to the porn awards was definitely</v>

1685
01:17:52.811 --> 01:17:55.690
<v Speaker 1>more appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then have sex with her for a second</v>

1686
01:17:55.691 --> 01:18:00.691
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was just really.</v>

1687
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Is it harder for drunk girls to come</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's hard for drunk dudes to</v>

1688
01:18:08.031 --> 01:18:08.864
<v Speaker 3>come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1689
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:10.490
<v Speaker 3>So is it hard for drunk girls to come?</v>

1690
01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so know</v>

1691
01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:16.190
<v Speaker 3>there all night and just pounding away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1692
01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:17.250
<v Speaker 3>Are we done yet?</v>

1693
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was.</v>

1694
01:18:20.031 --> 01:18:24.740
<v Speaker 1>She was a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens.</v>

1695
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Does that make some bad decisions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

1696
01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:28.440
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all do.</v>

1697
01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:30.870
<v Speaker 3>It's part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially with alcohol.</v>

1698
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:35.250
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how many good decisions get</v>
<v Speaker 3>made when you think about all the booze</v>

1699
01:18:35.251 --> 01:18:36.530
<v Speaker 3>is flowing around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1700
01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Especially in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1701
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:43.110
<v Speaker 3>Like when you go to Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing that it's not just chaos</v>

1702
01:18:43.111 --> 01:18:46.710
<v Speaker 3>and fucking street fights and bottles</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking over people's heads.</v>

1703
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:51.780
<v Speaker 3>If you just look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at a casino is a fucking 100,000</v>

1704
01:18:51.781 --> 01:18:53.040
<v Speaker 3>people in there or whatever the hell it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1705
01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:56.160
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's boozed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1706
01:18:56.330 --> 01:19:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Not losing money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People fucking up their lives.</v>

1707
01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Definitely people fucking up their</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

1708
01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:06.580
<v Speaker 3>My friend Andrew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had this dude that used to work with.</v>

1709
01:19:06.610 --> 01:19:09.700
<v Speaker 3>He used to work at a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This dude saved up his money for 10</v>

1710
01:19:09.701 --> 01:19:11.860
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 fucking years.</v>

1711
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:16.810
<v Speaker 3>He had a savings account when he put</v>
<v Speaker 3>together like 20 grand in a savings</v>

1712
01:19:16.811 --> 01:19:20.080
<v Speaker 3>account over 10 years is chipping away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't making much money.</v>

1713
01:19:20.081 --> 01:19:22.390
<v Speaker 3>He's working in a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes to vegas.</v>

1714
01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:25.200
<v Speaker 3>He blew it all in one weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop up,</v>

1715
01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:27.510
<v Speaker 3>all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go.</v>

1716
01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Came back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just devastated.</v>

1717
01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Ten years of working overtime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put money away.</v>

1718
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Hundred here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 there.</v>

1719
01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:40.620
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about all those hours that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>spent washing dishes and cleaning up and</v>

1720
01:19:40.811 --> 01:19:43.030
<v Speaker 3>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to blow it on</v>

1721
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:45.130
<v Speaker 1>a weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A weekend.</v>

1722
01:19:45.170 --> 01:19:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Still hasn't recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gone probably killed him.</v>

1723
01:19:47.151 --> 01:19:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So he said they're real casual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people do it.</v>

1724
01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:53.060
<v Speaker 1>People do do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely do.</v>

1725
01:19:53.061 --> 01:19:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't do it over money though,</v>

1726
01:19:55.031 --> 01:19:57.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you owe somebody else money.</v>

1727
01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.390
<v Speaker 1>We've been paying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Robert Deniro owe somebody</v>

1728
01:20:01.391 --> 01:20:03.340
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's doing this shitty</v>

1729
01:20:03.341 --> 01:20:06.630
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

1736
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:17.990

<v Speaker 2>I heard that.</v>

1737
01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I heard some people at the intern.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I get good reviews,</v>

1740
01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:33.020

1746
01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:55.431
<v Speaker 2>doing a movie like that at one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best actors of all time of all time.</v>

1747
01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1748
01:20:57.330 --> 01:21:01.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he owes somebody millions.</v>

1749
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that they get</v>

1750
01:21:04.201 --> 01:21:07.710
<v Speaker 2>that lifestyle going and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed that lifestyle.</v>

1751
01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:11.580
<v Speaker 2>They just have to chat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want private jets,</v>

1752
01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:15.300
<v Speaker 2>they want that house in Spain or</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever the fuck they like to vacation.</v>

1753
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.430
<v Speaker 2>They want a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted this,</v>

1754
01:21:17.431 --> 01:21:20.370
<v Speaker 2>they wanted that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to fat apartment in New York</v>

1755
01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:22.110
<v Speaker 2>City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want a home in Beverly Hills.</v>

1756
01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:24.360
<v Speaker 2>They want to pop up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you do that,</v>

1757
01:21:24.361 --> 01:21:27.720
<v Speaker 2>you need to generate a lot of income and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when guys get older,</v>

1758
01:21:27.721 --> 01:21:30.060
<v Speaker 2>especially the money drops</v>
<v Speaker 2>substantially.</v>

1759
01:21:30.061 --> 01:21:33.540
<v Speaker 2>That was a big thing that I'm Robin</v>
<v Speaker 2>Williams is experiencing.</v>

1760
01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:36.330
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about that before he</v>
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>

1761
01:21:36.331 --> 01:21:38.700
<v Speaker 2>that the money just wasn't there</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1762
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:41.070
<v Speaker 2>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no big money gigs.</v>

1763
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Like he would get interesting roles and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these independent films,</v>

1764
01:21:43.861 --> 01:21:45.250
<v Speaker 2>but they paid nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1765
01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.640
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I did that CBS show.</v>

1766
01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Remember he did that CBS show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crazy ones just needed to generate</v>

1767
01:21:52.621 --> 01:21:55.920
<v Speaker 2>some money and he had some craziest</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

1768
01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:59.340
<v Speaker 2>He's got some amazing place in northern</v>
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

1769
01:21:59.341 --> 01:22:02.850
<v Speaker 2>like $24,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million bucks actually like hundreds of</v>

1770
01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:04.470
<v Speaker 2>acres.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just giant mansion on it.</v>

1771
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Just like the total great gatsby house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1772
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:10.650
<v Speaker 2>keep my costs low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep your cost low,</v>

1773
01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.620
<v Speaker 2>cost low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good move to what?</v>

1774
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Until 30 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years from now and then you will off.</v>

1775
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:20.340
<v Speaker 2>When I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I become the host of family feud,</v>

1776
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:28.680
<v Speaker 2>then it was nice spending that shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the price is right.</v>

1777
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Family feud is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like family feud has more room</v>

1778
01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:38.120
<v Speaker 2>for humor then prices,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1784
01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:49.800

<v Speaker 2>They came to me today with an offer for</v>

01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:50.950

<v Speaker 2>It would have to be a nice offer for me</v>

<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

1808
01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I could do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1809
01:23:58.451 --> 01:24:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I definitely could do it again if I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke,</v>

1810
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:02.770
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to do it again unless it</v>

1811
01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:05.650
<v Speaker 2>was something unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pitched fear factor to you or you</v>

1812
01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:06.820
<v Speaker 2>fear factor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It existed.</v>

1813
01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.660
<v Speaker 2>It was a show in Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called now or never land.</v>

1814
01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they came to me because I had a</v>

1815
01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:19.020
<v Speaker 2>development deal with NBC to do a Sitcom</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it came to me and they said,</v>

1816
01:24:19.181 --> 01:24:20.980
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this thing,</v>

1817
01:24:20.981 --> 01:24:22.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want you to come in and have a</v>

1818
01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:22.870
<v Speaker 2>meeting with it.</v>

1819
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:26.010
<v Speaker 2>And I started with making fun of it when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went in there daily.</v>

1820
01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:28.810
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want me at first because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't making fun of it because I was.</v>

1821
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Because they were a second dogs on</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and making them eat animal dicks</v>

1822
01:24:31.561 --> 01:24:32.380
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1823
01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.160
<v Speaker 2>I was mocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the purdue,</v>

1824
01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.040
<v Speaker 2>one of the producers was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1825
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.240
<v Speaker 2>this guy's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1826
01:24:37.241 --> 01:24:39.340
<v Speaker 2>he's not taking it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need these people to be scared.</v>

1827
01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.500
<v Speaker 2>And then the other producer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend David Horwitz,</v>

1828
01:24:41.501 --> 01:24:42.010
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1829
01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1830
01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:42.731
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1831
01:24:42.731 --> 01:24:45.430
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at what we're doing this.</v>

1832
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.640
<v Speaker 2>We need someone to mock this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking ridiculous.</v>

1833
01:24:48.641 --> 01:24:51.970
<v Speaker 2>It shows ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if it's going to be successful,</v>

1834
01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:55.750
<v Speaker 2>we probably need a comedian and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably need someone to mock it.</v>

1835
01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:58.990
<v Speaker 2>And I wound up doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never thought I thought it was</v>

1836
01:24:58.991 --> 01:25:00.380
<v Speaker 2>going to be canceled in June.</v>

1837
01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:03.210
<v Speaker 2>When did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many seasons was 600,</v>

1838
01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:04.960
<v Speaker 2>48 episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>

1839
01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:08.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes should we look for if we want</v>

1840
01:25:08.111 --> 01:25:11.410
<v Speaker 2>to see you dead in the eyes while I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't dead in the eyes.</v>

1841
01:25:11.411 --> 01:25:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I did way better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was right around episode three or</v>

1842
01:25:15.101 --> 01:25:18.970
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started getting high as fuck.</v>

1843
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I would get so high that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could feel the earth spinning it.</v>

1844
01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would take pot lollipops with me to</v>

1845
01:25:27.131 --> 01:25:31.720
<v Speaker 2>the set and I would just suck on pot</v>
<v Speaker 2>lollipops and that because that's a slow</v>

1846
01:25:31.721 --> 01:25:35.950
<v Speaker 2>release and the pot lollipops will kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like an hour into the show.</v>

1847
01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:38.860
<v Speaker 2>But I'm functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I know how to do it.</v>

1848
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I can operate hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you married to a fear factor now?</v>

1849
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever hook up with a contest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1850
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.471
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1851
01:25:44.471 --> 01:25:45.960
<v Speaker 2>That's not a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1852
01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't seem smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we just,</v>

1853
01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.860
<v Speaker 2>we both agree that we do dumb things</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

1854
01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.760
<v Speaker 2>The dumbest Shit that you've ever done</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of your Dick</v>

1855
01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.430
<v Speaker 2>was a bad question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1856
01:26:00.431 --> 01:26:00.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1857
01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 2>the dumbest shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just look down at your Dick and you</v>

1858
01:26:04.431 --> 01:26:08.240
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you put the fuck did you do to</v>

1859
01:26:08.241 --> 01:26:11.210
<v Speaker 2>me man fucking position.</v>

1860
01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.940
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean girl in Vegas,</v>

1861
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.950
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't a good decision when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1862
01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:18.420
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like the worst decision.</v>

1863
01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Worst case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst thing happened as she wanted to</v>

1864
01:26:20.861 --> 01:26:22.000
<v Speaker 2>come and she didn't come</v>

1865
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:25.470
<v Speaker 1>and but she is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1866
01:26:25.471 --> 01:26:30.471
<v Speaker 1>I don't like when I end up where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1867
01:26:30.481 --> 01:26:32.640
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this chick is just hit for the story</v>

1868
01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:39.290
<v Speaker 1>I was in when I was in San Jose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a for.</v>

1869
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:43.770
<v Speaker 1>I brought this girl but I brought her a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of friends but I have friend.</v>

1870
01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:47.100
<v Speaker 1>The dude leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her friend crashes on the couch.</v>

1871
01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:52.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a sweet girl called it to the room</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me and it happens and then I wake</v>

1872
01:26:53.881 --> 01:26:54.990
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look over,</v>

1873
01:26:54.991 --> 01:26:59.991
<v Speaker 1>she kinda fucking with her phone or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and I'm like,</v>

1874
01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I am an instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see your phone.</v>

1875
01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:09.740
<v Speaker 1>And then I scroll through the pictures</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she had taken like selfies with me</v>

1876
01:27:12.871 --> 01:27:17.871
<v Speaker 1>sleeping in the background</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I scrolled through some more.</v>

1877
01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:23.130
<v Speaker 1>She had posted a snapchat the night</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1878
01:27:23.131 --> 01:27:25.320
<v Speaker 1>like hanging out in Hannibal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buress is room.</v>

1879
01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:28.060
<v Speaker 1>I cut my face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't in the sleep and pitched it.</v>

1880
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:31.430
<v Speaker 1>But that would have been the implication</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were following her.</v>

1881
01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.460
<v Speaker 2>See I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a snapchat.</v>

1882
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't.</v>

1883
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.540
<v Speaker 2>It was just pitches with</v>

1884
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:42.230
<v Speaker 1>on the camera law on like these cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't on her,</v>

1885
01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:44.860
<v Speaker 1>but that's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do a snapchat,</v>

1886
01:27:44.861 --> 01:27:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could save the image that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put on snapchat.</v>

1887
01:27:47.321 --> 01:27:50.050
<v Speaker 1>You can save it to your right to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

1888
01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I deleted all that shit and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1889
01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.820
<v Speaker 1>get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did she say?</v>

1890
01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.270
<v Speaker 1>She knew she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she knew she was at it,</v>

1891
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:59.000
<v Speaker 1>like fuck else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't say she was like,</v>

1892
01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:05.230
<v Speaker 1>she was young and Goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just,</v>

1893
01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>

1894
01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:10.190
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking goof nuggets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also,</v>

1895
01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.970
<v Speaker 2>but also don't want to data famous</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken.</v>

1896
01:28:16.971 --> 01:28:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Then had everybody in my business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1897
01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like a good moat.</v>

1898
01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:27.920
<v Speaker 2>You know the problem with that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a famous person is not more</v>

1899
01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:32.740
<v Speaker 2>attractive to a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you meet a hot girl and she's</v>

1900
01:28:32.741 --> 01:28:36.880
<v Speaker 2>just interesting and cool and she's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous or you meet a hot grows,</v>

1901
01:28:36.881 --> 01:28:38.990
<v Speaker 2>interesting and cool and his famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

1902
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:42.580
<v Speaker 2>There's no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One's not better than the other.</v>

1903
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous one carries a lot of baggage.</v>

1904
01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Whereas for a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she meets a guy like you,</v>

1905
01:28:48.141 --> 01:28:48.821
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1906
01:28:48.821 --> 01:28:52.210
<v Speaker 2>he's funny and he's smart and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous.</v>

1907
01:28:52.450 --> 01:28:56.000
<v Speaker 2>He's famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the fame means something to them it</v>

1908
01:28:56.010 --> 01:28:58.810
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fame doesn't necessarily mean things to</v>

1909
01:28:58.820 --> 01:28:59.340
<v Speaker 2>mostly.</v>

1910
01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Let me some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1911
01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:04.420
<v Speaker 1>some guys just the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch tv or you see a girl in a,</v>

1912
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:07.380
<v Speaker 1>in a magazine or you see in the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will.</v>

1913
01:29:07.381 --> 01:29:11.070
<v Speaker 1>If you just saw a bunch of dope ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram pages,</v>

1914
01:29:11.071 --> 01:29:11.904
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1915
01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:17.660
<v Speaker 1>that is that attainable to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1916
01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard stories about old school movie</v>

1917
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:23.370
<v Speaker 1>stars or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in the eighties,</v>

1918
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:28.100
<v Speaker 1>they just flipped through a magazine</v>
<v Speaker 1>like her go get her for me and that's</v>

1919
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:30.410
<v Speaker 1>how they would pull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that was their tender</v>

1920
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:36.270
<v Speaker 1>flipping through a magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who was that or shit like that.</v>

1921
01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:41.040
<v Speaker 1>So I think definitely think those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those models and it's something to that</v>

1922
01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:43.110
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some guys.</v>

1923
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:45.160
<v Speaker 1>It's an excitement to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1924
01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.580
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they saw that girl at a club for it</v>

1925
01:29:48.581 --> 01:29:50.070
<v Speaker 1>be just as excited about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1926
01:29:50.071 --> 01:29:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Without knowing about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1927
01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:54.420
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've seen,</v>

1928
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some that I'm like,</v>

1929
01:29:56.361 --> 01:29:57.330
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

1930
01:29:57.450 --> 01:30:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I liked that song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1931
01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:03.210
<v Speaker 1>And someone's talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I do feel it feels iffy.</v>

1932
01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:07.410
<v Speaker 1>So it feels just weird sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well there's that whole world of,</v>

1933
01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:09.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get in that red carpet world</v>

1934
01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.710
<v Speaker 1>within that world of they follow your</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship because you put your</v>

1935
01:30:13.711 --> 01:30:16.440
<v Speaker 1>relationship out there and all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>photos.</v>

1936
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when,</v>

1937
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:25.070
<v Speaker 1>even in 2008 to two where I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend,</v>

1938
01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:31.410
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't even put in a relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>on facebook and it wasn't to like mess</v>

1939
01:30:31.411 --> 01:30:33.660
<v Speaker 1>around with other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just because I didn't feel like</v>

1940
01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:37.530
<v Speaker 1>strangers because I had some facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel like strangers should know</v>

1941
01:30:37.531 --> 01:30:40.770
<v Speaker 1>who my girlfriend is unless you see me</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and about,</v>

1942
01:30:41.150 --> 01:30:43.860
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't just be able to go on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my facebook page and like,</v>

1943
01:30:43.861 --> 01:30:44.694
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's dating her.</v>

1944
01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for the majority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be no problem at all,</v>

1945
01:30:47.941 --> 01:30:52.941
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a few creepers that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be a problem happen.</v>

1946
01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.220
<v Speaker 3>This thought the whole world is very</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange when it comes to that shit.</v>

1947
01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:01.480
<v Speaker 3>It's very social media's a totally new</v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape that our parents didn't have</v>

1948
01:31:01.561 --> 01:31:02.850
<v Speaker 3>to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their parents had never.</v>

1949
01:31:02.851 --> 01:31:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Nobody had to deal with it until this</v>
<v Speaker 3>generation is the first generation ever</v>

1950
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:09.000
<v Speaker 3>that's put their whole life out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1951
01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:10.500
<v Speaker 3>I have friends who put their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

1952
01:31:10.501 --> 01:31:13.230
<v Speaker 3>They put their kids pictures all over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the internet and everything like that.</v>

1953
01:31:13.231 --> 01:31:14.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1954
01:31:14.490 --> 01:31:15.510
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

1955
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:17.640
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like.</v>

1956
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Did you ask the kids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1957
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:22.123
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:24.140
<v Speaker 1>are you gonna know what your kids look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>

1959
01:31:24.170 --> 01:31:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is weird and I mean with some</v>

1960
01:31:26.301 --> 01:31:27.690
<v Speaker 1>people that's how you get,</v>

1962
01:31:29.901 --> 01:31:34.250
<v Speaker 1>you share it with family members that</v>

2045
01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 2>We had a kid that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2046
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.440
<v Speaker 2>in my high school that became a priest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was gay as fuck.</v>

2047
01:35:15.441 --> 01:35:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knew he was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We knew he was gay and he's going to</v>

2048
01:35:18.261 --> 01:35:20.120
<v Speaker 2>become a priest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>

2049
01:35:20.121 --> 01:35:23.870
<v Speaker 2>this is so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess this guy is avoiding pussy by</v>

2050
01:35:23.871 --> 01:35:26.910
<v Speaker 2>becoming a priest because we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey billy,</v>

01:35:28.341 --> 01:35:32.900
<v Speaker 2>The Lord's got me wrapped up and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>became a Catholic priest.</v>

2053
01:35:32.901 --> 01:35:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he ever went.</v>

2054
01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean I didn't talk to them after high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

2055
01:35:35.481 --> 01:35:37.610
<v Speaker 2>but I'm assuming he went with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was.</v>

2056
01:35:37.611 --> 01:35:39.440
<v Speaker 2>That was the whole thing and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a.</v>

2057
01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.930
<v Speaker 2>He was going to be a father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billy was going to be a father,</v>

2058
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:43.310
<v Speaker 2>father billy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there he goes.</v>

2060
01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:49.670
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they think that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to be new people to teach religion</v>

2061
01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:52.190
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need new people like now why don't</v>

2062
01:35:52.191 --> 01:35:54.350
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you need somebody else to say this</v>

2063
01:35:54.351 --> 01:35:59.090
<v Speaker 2>shit has been being said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing new to be added to it.</v>

2064
01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:00.970
<v Speaker 2>What's an organization?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2065
01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:04.160
<v Speaker 2>This is an organization that needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs members to grow.</v>

2066
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:07.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a spooky organization that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of.</v>

2067
01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that happened when</v>

2068
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:12.980
<v Speaker 2>ratzinger was the pope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the glass guy who stepped down.</v>

2069
01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:16.160
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why stepped down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was revealed that that guy had</v>

2070
01:36:16.161 --> 01:36:19.470
<v Speaker 2>relocated child molesters and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them that have relocated walnut</v>

2071

<v Speaker 2>molesting a hundred deaf kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred deaf kid likes this guy was</v>

<v Speaker 2>they relocated them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some new place in rats.</v>

2073
01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:30.170
<v Speaker 2>They knew he was a pedophile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2074
01:36:30.171 --> 01:36:31.940
<v Speaker 2>this isn't,</v>

2153
01:39:41.241 --> 01:39:43.280
<v Speaker 3>They drive a nice car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do they do that?</v>

2154
01:39:43.281 --> 01:39:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Because they want to show like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Did I know that in A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's obviously been a couple</v>

2191
01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:28.140
<v Speaker 1>stories of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2194
01:41:33.881 --> 01:41:37.050
<v Speaker 1>and just really go on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing I liked about being in</v>

2195
01:41:37.051 --> 01:41:42.051
<v Speaker 1>Japan</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a taxi drivers don't say Shit to</v>

2196
01:41:43.651 --> 01:41:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber drivers talked too much.</v>

2197
01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Uber drivers talk to taxi drivers too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Uber drivers or drivers like pro.</v>

2198
01:41:53.250 --> 01:41:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I just want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2199
01:41:54.451 --> 01:41:57.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in Chicago,</v>

2200
01:41:58.470 --> 01:42:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I was heading for my hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My hotel is downtown.</v>

2201
01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Had an old hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 40 minutes early in the</v>

2202
01:42:06.181 --> 01:42:09.720
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit hung over and over.</v>

2203
01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:15.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a comic from that sort of knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 years back in Chicago driving</v>

2204
01:42:17.521 --> 01:42:21.780
<v Speaker 1>an uber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he started pitching me.</v>

2205
01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:22.873
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2206
01:42:24.710 --> 01:42:27.290
<v Speaker 1>And I hadn't seen him in years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even,</v>

2207
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:30.340
<v Speaker 1>we weren't that close when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I did a,</v>

2208
01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:35.570
<v Speaker 1>when I was in Chicago and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got these ideas,</v>

2209
01:42:35.571 --> 01:42:38.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you link me with Stephen Merchant</v>

2210
01:42:38.061 --> 01:42:41.570
<v Speaker 1>and Baba Baba who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Merchant.</v>

2211
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Stephen merchant is a the tall guy from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the office.</v>

2212
01:42:46.090 --> 01:42:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was in the original art and extras</v>

2213
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:51.650
<v Speaker 1>is Ricky Gervais work with Ricky</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gervais'.</v>

2214
01:42:51.651 --> 01:42:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's just like,</v>

2215
01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:53.950
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask him.</v>

2216
01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Just hadn't seen this dude in 11 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some shit.</v>

2217
01:42:58.070 --> 01:43:01.850
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostage on the way to the airport for 40</v>

2218
01:43:01.851 --> 01:43:03.870
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he know that it was gonna be you or</v>

2219
01:43:03.871 --> 01:43:05.870
<v Speaker 1>was it just totally random?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what's going to be me</v>

2220
01:43:05.871 --> 01:43:07.180
<v Speaker 1>because I have a fake name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber.</v>

2221
01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

2222
01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:10.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

2223
01:43:10.491 --> 01:43:11.930
<v Speaker 1>it was totally random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Oh,</v>

2224
01:43:11.931 --> 01:43:15.350
<v Speaker 1>what's up are recognized me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was just like I'm getting pitched</v>

2225
01:43:15.351 --> 01:43:15.820
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

2226
01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:19.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like six in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

2227
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:24.270
<v Speaker 1>And you're tired of 40 minute ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell him to shut the fuck up.</v>

2228
01:43:24.650 --> 01:43:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Getting that was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

2229
01:43:26.331 --> 01:43:31.331
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a real cool idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's why I stopped using car</v>

2230
01:43:33.711 --> 01:43:36.920
<v Speaker 1>services to take me to the airport</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just didn't want to talk to</v>

2231
01:43:36.921 --> 01:43:39.650
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather just listen to podcasts and</v>

2232
01:43:39.651 --> 01:43:41.630
<v Speaker 1>just chill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive myself.</v>

2233
01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And then when I get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I do clubs or colleges or</v>

2234
01:43:45.561 --> 01:43:48.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a colleges will never do colleges</v>

2235
01:43:48.710 --> 01:43:50.840
<v Speaker 1>when I do theaters or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just rent a car.</v>

2236
01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that better</v>

2237
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.210
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2238
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:56.330
<v Speaker 2>most of the time you run into cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>drivers most of the time.</v>

2239
01:43:56.930 --> 01:44:00.500
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pain the ass.</v>

2240
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Like if you run into one dude who just</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks too much,</v>

2241
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:05.930
<v Speaker 2>does take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Takes your mental energy.</v>

2242
01:44:05.931 --> 01:44:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Like it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>

2243
01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:10.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of an exaggeration to say it like</v>

2244
01:44:10.971 --> 01:44:12.100
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like food,</v>

2245
01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:12.741
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2246
01:44:12.741 --> 01:44:16.160
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody can kind of steal your soul a</v>

2247
01:44:16.770 --> 01:44:21.770
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Tony Hinchcliffe were in the car</v>

2248
01:44:21.801 --> 01:44:24.440
<v Speaker 2>once and this fucking dude just joined</v>
<v Speaker 2>in on our conversation.</v>

2249
01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Like we're talking about some important</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2250
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:28.380
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Tony's asking me some question,</v>

2251
01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:30.950
<v Speaker 2>he's asked me for advice and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I think in the guys like,</v>

2252
01:44:30.951 --> 01:44:32.030
<v Speaker 2>what you should do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2253
01:44:32.031 --> 01:44:35.000
<v Speaker 2>you gotta tell her to mama talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a girl.</v>

2254
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2255
01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2256
01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:40.940
<v Speaker 2>Hold on dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not even supposed to be here like</v>

2257
01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:41.950
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just in.</v>

2258
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:43.880
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're here,</v>

2259
01:44:43.881 --> 01:44:45.860
<v Speaker 2>but you're not supposed to be in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

2260
01:44:45.861 --> 01:44:47.720
<v Speaker 2>This is a conversation like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my friend.</v>

2261
01:44:47.721 --> 01:44:49.970
<v Speaker 2>He's asking me advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know him.</v>

2262
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:55.760
<v Speaker 2>And so like the whole rest of the day</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just bizarre because this dude was</v>

2263
01:44:55.761 --> 01:44:59.300
<v Speaker 2>driving us around and just chimed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what we talked about,</v>

2264
01:44:59.301 --> 01:45:01.940
<v Speaker 2>just looking at the looking at you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rear view,</v>

2265
01:45:01.941 --> 01:45:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Mike got eyes on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

2266
01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:04.790
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2267
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:08.660
<v Speaker 2>that thing is to see cars behind us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not to have conversations when</v>

2268
01:45:08.661 --> 01:45:09.440
<v Speaker 2>you're looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're.</v>

2269
01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:12.780
<v Speaker 2>When the guy's driving and he's looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at you in the rear view mirror,</v>

2270
01:45:12.781 --> 01:45:16.220
<v Speaker 2>he that motherfucker's holding your</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention hostage because anything can</v>

2271
01:45:16.221 --> 01:45:19.730
<v Speaker 2>happen now because he's not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying attention to the road and you're</v>

2272
01:45:19.731 --> 01:45:20.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus Christ,</v>

2273
01:45:20.871 --> 01:45:21.770
<v Speaker 2>what does this guy's playing?</v>

2274
01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:24.950
<v Speaker 2>You might as well be texting right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still at the rear view mirror.</v>

2275

<v Speaker 2>Was that I got in the car no lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This dude was a.</v>

<v Speaker 2>at it and I and as I said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>was taking me somewhere and the entire</v>

2294
01:46:23.931 --> 01:46:27.380
<v Speaker 2>time he's on his phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got his phone in his lap and he's</v>

<v Speaker 2>Once it was a fucking perilous terror</v>

2301
01:46:35.871 --> 01:46:39.920
<v Speaker 2>field ride because we're on the highway</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this guy and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>In the few years it's going to be</v>

2317
01:47:15.331 --> 01:47:18.450
<v Speaker 2>rental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self driving cars.</v>

<v Speaker 2>driving car now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>wheel and you sit back and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker drives itself.</v>

2324
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:35.820
<v Speaker 2>It slows down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns.</v>

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:38.790
<v Speaker 2>But does Avis have that shit yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>

2327
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:46.580
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to upgrade to the self driving,</v>

2328
01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:52.020
<v Speaker 2>but when that happens it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>more boring but more safe,</v>

2329
01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you wonder if you'll be able to</v>

2330
01:47:55.741 --> 01:47:59.120
<v Speaker 2>like take it out of self driving mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he'll be,</v>

2331
01:47:59.130 --> 01:48:02.850
<v Speaker 2>have like self driving cars and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole slamming into self driving cars.</v>

2332
01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:04.350

<v Speaker 2>like an hour later with a new periscope</v>

2357
01:49:00.791 --> 01:49:01.740
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

2358
01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I run into him at the comedy</v>

2359
01:49:03.901 --> 01:49:05.040
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on periscope.</v>

2360
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I've been in like five of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>periscopes.</v>

2361
01:49:08.150 --> 01:49:08.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

2362
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.670
<v Speaker 2>He walks in periscope and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

2363
01:49:11.671 --> 01:49:14.160
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking character man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a character,</v>

2364
01:49:14.490 --> 01:49:17.550
<v Speaker 2>but he's one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's embraced that aspect of social</v>

2365
01:49:17.551 --> 01:49:20.130
<v Speaker 2>media at a ridiculous level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you literally will.</v>

2366
01:49:20.131 --> 01:49:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Periscope has whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian was doing it a lot for awhile,</v>

2367
01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.880
<v Speaker 2>but he's kind of abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still does it some,</v>

2368
01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:28.080
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it at all anymore.</v>

2369
01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I haven't periscoped in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

2370
01:49:30.151 --> 01:49:31.560
<v Speaker 2>It's taken off a little bit more because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2371
01:49:31.770 --> 01:49:33.870
<v Speaker 2>it's on apps now for TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Apple TV.</v>

2372
01:49:33.871 --> 01:49:37.110
<v Speaker 2>It's built in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something else had it built into it too,</v>

2373
01:49:37.111 --> 01:49:40.470
<v Speaker 2>so you can watch it on a big screen</v>
<v Speaker 2>without having to have it just on your</v>

2374
01:49:40.471 --> 01:49:43.260
<v Speaker 2>phone and having to choose what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch and they're giving you things to</v>

2375
01:49:43.261 --> 01:49:44.490
<v Speaker 2>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now to dude,</v>

2376
01:49:44.491 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm super suspicious about apple tv now</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my apple tv</v>

2377
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:50.770
<v Speaker 3>used to work great until the new apple</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV came out.</v>

2378
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Now my appletv fucks up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kicks me off and reboots it,</v>

2379
01:49:55.961 --> 01:49:58.780
<v Speaker 3>stops shows and goes right back to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>main menu.</v>

2380
01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:01.150
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm suspicious about one another beer.</v>

2381
01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm suspicious about the,</v>

2382
01:50:04.571 --> 01:50:07.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a class action lawsuit that</v>

2383
01:50:07.211 --> 01:50:11.320
<v Speaker 3>someone filed about the old phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said that the old phones stopped</v>

2384
01:50:11.321 --> 01:50:14.320
<v Speaker 3>working when the new operating system</v>
<v Speaker 3>would come out because the new operating</v>

2385
01:50:14.321 --> 01:50:17.260
<v Speaker 3>system is designed for the new phones</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had made it so that the old</v>

2386
01:50:17.261 --> 01:50:18.130
<v Speaker 3>phones were slow.</v>

2387
01:50:19.630 --> 01:50:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they would actually do that</v>

2388
01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:26.980
<v Speaker 1>to Brian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Brian's convinced it could also be a</v>

2389
01:50:27.010 --> 01:50:30.770
<v Speaker 1>matter of just like they're making so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much great new software that the old uh,</v>

2390
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:33.490
<v Speaker 1>processes and whatnot just aren't made</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use it.</v>

2391
01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:34.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not,</v>

2392
01:50:34.590 --> 01:50:37.270
<v Speaker 1>that's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun to think like that.</v>

2393
01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Not The way they sell it either though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sell it as the.</v>

2394
01:50:39.161 --> 01:50:40.740
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2395
01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Well you should be able to have an</v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone four and fucking keep the old</v>

2396
01:50:45.091 --> 01:50:47.190
<v Speaker 3>operating system and be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to work.</v>

2397
01:50:47.191 --> 01:50:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does it work good anymore?</v>

2398
01:50:48.901 --> 01:50:50.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fucking play games on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2399
01:50:50.331 --> 01:50:51.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to watch videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to.</v>

2400
01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:53.113
<v Speaker 3>Goddammit,</v>

2401
01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:57.240
<v Speaker 1>right is a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need an actual opener.</v>

2402
01:50:58.330 --> 01:51:00.200

<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2403
01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I think ever the sales on iphones or</v>
<v Speaker 1>down</v>

2404
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:06.420
<v Speaker 3>for the quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However they wonder why because</v>

2405
01:51:06.421 --> 01:51:09.320
<v Speaker 3>everybody has one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why is because everybody's</v>

2406
01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:11.580
<v Speaker 3>switching to Samsung.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a monkey.</v>

2533
01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2534
01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:07.680
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

2535
01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Am I being called a monkey by a white</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman from Williamsburg in Tokyo right</v>

2536
01:57:14.941 --> 01:57:18.120
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is why you should take</v>

2537
01:57:18.121 --> 01:57:20.070
<v Speaker 1>pictures of her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it up all around Williamsburg.</v>

2538
01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just this dummy have you said I should</v>

2539
01:57:24.901 --> 01:57:26.430
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about starting to film,</v>

2540
01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:29.640
<v Speaker 1>but it was just so weird that she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Real,</v>

2541
01:57:29.641 --> 01:57:32.320
<v Speaker 1>all I did objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't that fade,</v>

2542
01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:36.300
<v Speaker 1>so I'd have a clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a recall of a situation.</v>

2543
01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I only just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you just asked me if this is my wife</v>

2544
01:57:40.771 --> 01:57:42.660
<v Speaker 1>three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what I told,</v>

2545
01:57:42.661 --> 01:57:47.010
<v Speaker 1>you know the first two times sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she just went off tilt.</v>

2546
01:57:47.011 --> 01:57:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the weirdest.</v>

2547
01:57:48.061 --> 01:57:50.790
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the weirdest things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a weird thing that happens</v>

2548
01:57:50.791 --> 01:57:55.410
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when someone's famous like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not where they feel like</v>

2549
01:57:55.860 --> 01:58:00.390
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that you think you're cool</v>

2550
01:58:00.391 --> 01:58:01.410
<v Speaker 1>because you're famous.</v>

2551
01:58:01.410 --> 01:58:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you think you're better than them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2552
01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:06.090
<v Speaker 1>so like they look for any little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any little thing.</v>

2553
01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you're too good?</v>

2554
01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:10.080
<v Speaker 1>You know that they're looking for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're too good to listen to me.</v>

2555
01:58:10.081 --> 01:58:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Repeat Myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to it,</v>

2556
01:58:12.961 --> 01:58:14.160
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

2557
01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:18.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that you're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the.</v>

2558
01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:20.040
<v Speaker 1>It was so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2559
01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone's that blasted,</v>

2560
01:58:23.431 --> 01:58:25.240
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's going on in their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2561
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:29.850
<v Speaker 1>it definitely was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tell she was because when she</v>

2562
01:58:29.851 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 1>started getting raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't affect me,</v>

2563
01:58:31.471 --> 01:58:32.790
<v Speaker 1>but it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tell she goes,</v>

2564
01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:36.180
<v Speaker 1>I accidentally hurt her feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was trying to hurt you.</v>

2565
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:41.270
<v Speaker 1>She was trying to hurt me and I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>see she was almost on the verge of when</v>

2566
01:58:41.801 --> 01:58:44.590
<v Speaker 1>all I said was I stopped saying the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing over and over,</v>

2567
01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:47.230
<v Speaker 1>which I would say to anybody if I said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to one of my buddies,</v>

2568
01:58:47.231 --> 01:58:48.220
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

2569
01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2570
01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:51.680
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't know someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say that to them and then</v>

2571
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:54.820
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're dumb and no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls them out on their stupidity,</v>

2572
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:57.120
<v Speaker 2>it could be devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2573
01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sometimes people do have that sort</v>

2574
01:58:59.351 --> 01:58:59.860
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2575
01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:02.140
<v Speaker 2>When they meet you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that guy from TV.</v>

2576
01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:05.610
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him on comedy central.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to call her and talk to them</v>

2577
01:59:08.110 --> 01:59:09.720
<v Speaker 1>and it was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she just was,</v>

2578
01:59:09.721 --> 01:59:12.600
<v Speaker 1>she got into repetitive boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

2579
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't handle you checking her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Checked her too hard.</v>

2580
01:59:17.070 --> 01:59:20.500
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a soft check was light work.</v>

2581
01:59:22.670 --> 01:59:27.670
<v Speaker 1>But I do find that sometimes where even</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'll joke around with people too</v>

2582
01:59:30.061 --> 01:59:31.980
<v Speaker 1>harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like a,</v>

2583
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:36.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fighter pilot,</v>

2584
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:38.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sparring with some,</v>

2585
01:59:38.121 --> 01:59:41.580
<v Speaker 1>like it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't act the same when you</v>

2586
01:59:41.581 --> 01:59:44.970
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if people don't know you then it's</v>

2587
01:59:44.971 --> 01:59:47.470
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be kind of taken aback and throw</v>

2588
01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.840
<v Speaker 1>it off because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2589
01:59:48.841 --> 01:59:50.190
<v Speaker 1>this dude's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2590
01:59:50.191 --> 01:59:52.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just how I talk with people.</v>

2591
01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Well also you're a New York comic or</v>
<v Speaker 1>your comment that lives in New York.</v>

2592
01:59:56.101 --> 01:59:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York in particular.</v>

2593
01:59:58.290 --> 02:00:02.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun place to be a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun place to interact with other comics.</v>

2594
02:00:02.401 --> 02:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>But like people are fucking ruthless to</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

2595
02:00:06.250 --> 02:00:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what did I just tell you bitch?</v>

2596
02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.320
<v Speaker 2>And you would start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would laugh,</v>

2597
02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:14.770
<v Speaker 2>but if you said that to someone in real</v>
<v Speaker 2>life that's like super sensitive,</v>

2598
02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:16.080
<v Speaker 2>like what did I just tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitch?</v>

2599

<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

2602
02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:20.610
<v Speaker 2>You think just because you're on comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>central,</v>

2603
02:00:20.611 --> 02:00:21.600
<v Speaker 2>you can call me boot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>key drivers in a couple of other people.</v>

2615
02:00:45.131 --> 02:00:46.960
<v Speaker 2>maybe we understand that other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

2616
02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:48.093
<v Speaker 2>I did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2617
02:00:48.150 --> 02:00:53.080
<v Speaker 2>a theater in Miami and Wanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wanda Sykes and Keith Robinson were</v>

2618
02:00:53.081 --> 02:00:56.490
<v Speaker 2>doing the early show and I was doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>late shift fillmore.</v>

2619
02:00:56.770 --> 02:00:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might've been the fillmore.</v>

2620
02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what theater was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

2621
02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:03.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got there I said,</v>

2622
02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I said to them they were leaving and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I got to my dressing room and there</v>

2623
02:01:07.301 --> 02:01:10.660
<v Speaker 2>was two napkins that they'd left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wanda left a Napkin.</v>

2624
02:01:10.690 --> 02:01:12.370
<v Speaker 2>I hope you have a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2625
02:01:12.371 --> 02:01:13.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill them.</v>

2626
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Wanda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Keith Robinson wrote,</v>

2627
02:01:16.090 --> 02:01:18.760
<v Speaker 2>I hope you bomb harder than you ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>have in your life,</v>

2628
02:01:19.150 --> 02:01:19.983
<v Speaker 2>your friend.</v>

2629
02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:24.640
<v Speaker 2>I'd saved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a picture of it and put it</v>

2630
02:01:24.641 --> 02:01:26.260
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's to me,</v>

2631
02:01:26.261 --> 02:01:28.300
<v Speaker 2>it was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

2632
02:01:28.301 --> 02:01:31.360
<v Speaker 2>if someone's like fucking real sensitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they see something like that,</v>

2633
02:01:31.361 --> 02:01:32.380
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what the fuck,</v>

2634
02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Keith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen you in 10 years,</v>

2635
02:01:34.031 --> 02:01:36.730
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe me.</v>

2636
02:01:37.110 --> 02:01:39.530
<v Speaker 2>But it was warm for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt good.</v>

2637
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:42.090
<v Speaker 2>They took the time to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2638
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:46.010
<v Speaker 2>It felt good to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he keeps graded that that's.</v>

2639
02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:49.040
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the whole New York style</v>
<v Speaker 2>of comedy.</v>

2640
02:01:49.041 --> 02:01:52.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a very different style than like La</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comics.</v>

2641
02:01:52.221 --> 02:01:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Like la comics is not</v>

2642
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>sort of the only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's only a handful that I</v>

2643
02:01:59.041 --> 02:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>know well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2644
02:02:02.010 --> 02:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm close with like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's different.</v>

2645
02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>It is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2646

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York's a harsher environment.</v>

2647
02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I did have a situation where somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>joked with me,</v>

2648
02:02:11.311 --> 02:02:16.311
<v Speaker 1>it was a very specific situation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody joked with me and I haven't</v>

2649
02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:22.100
<v Speaker 1>talked to that person for five years</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that joke to a,</v>

2650

<v Speaker 1>not to say the name of won't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

2651

<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2670
02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I just woke up in the hospital and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so uh,</v>

2671
02:03:28.290 --> 02:03:30.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I'm in the hospital.</v>

2673
02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2674
02:03:34.110 --> 02:03:37.830
<v Speaker 1>tweeted out a photo of my fucked up ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>face and</v>

2675
02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:43.650
<v Speaker 1>to go back a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a comic friend of mine.</v>

2676
02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I had a got tickets to see the clippers</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the Lakers and I invited him.</v>

2677
02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:55.050
<v Speaker 1>I pick him up my rental car out here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't wearing my seatbelt and he's</v>

2678
02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:56.520
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna,</v>

2679
02:03:56.521 --> 02:03:57.620
<v Speaker 1>wear your seat back.</v>

2680
02:03:57.630 --> 02:03:58.271
<v Speaker 1>And flood was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2681
02:03:58.271 --> 02:04:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not wearing my seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got sometimes I don't wear my</v>

2682
02:04:00.271 --> 02:04:01.104
<v Speaker 1>seatbelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2683
02:04:01.650 --> 02:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm laid up after I posted this</v>
<v Speaker 1>ad,</v>

2684
02:04:04.050 --> 02:04:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm laid up in the hospital but with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>scope.</v>

2685
02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:09.450
<v Speaker 1>And then this was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't even been talking to them that</v>

2686
02:04:09.451 --> 02:04:14.451
<v Speaker 1>much around this time and had heard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a text that you gonna wear your</v>

2687
02:04:15.361 --> 02:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>seat belt now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2688
02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:17.753
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck,</v>

2689
02:04:21.690 --> 02:04:23.520
<v Speaker 1>but I thought I didn't think that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right time.</v>

2690
02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:26.100
<v Speaker 1>My skull was fractured and I had never</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in a month,</v>

2691
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:28.910
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2692
02:04:29.190 --> 02:04:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he meant it maliciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was a bit tone deaf.</v>

2693
02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:32.964
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

2694
02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:36.880
<v Speaker 2>It depends on who it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if it was a good friend,</v>

2695
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>like if I got</v>

2696
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:40.680
<v Speaker 3>in a car accident and like Ari,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ari Shaffir.</v>

2697
02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:43.370
<v Speaker 3>If he did that I would laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2698
02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Cause he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's such a close friend that he can't</v>

2699
02:04:47.311 --> 02:04:50.190
<v Speaker 3>really do anything that would hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2700
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:56.030
<v Speaker 1>But I think it was based off of he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was holding onto this seatbelt</v>

2701
02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:58.770
<v Speaker 1>argument from a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2702
02:04:58.771 --> 02:05:02.310
<v Speaker 1>so you guys had a real disagreement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might've been real on it,</v>

2703
02:05:02.311 --> 02:05:05.610
<v Speaker 1>but it was just me being more like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>seatbelt that day.</v>

2704
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:09.500
<v Speaker 3>He must not have liked that dude because</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really liked him you'd laugh.</v>

2705
02:05:09.710 --> 02:05:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Like if it was Keith Robinson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you laugh,</v>

2706
02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:15.860
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like his style,</v>

2707
02:05:15.861 --> 02:05:18.320
<v Speaker 3>like that's something you could say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You bet you wear a seatbelt now.</v>

2708
02:05:18.321 --> 02:05:20.510
<v Speaker 3>Dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he would say you would probably</v>

2709
02:05:20.511 --> 02:05:24.140
<v Speaker 3>laugh if you saw that man meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depends on how bad your hurt too.</v>

2710
02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:26.450
<v Speaker 3>When you're hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not feeling any jokes.</v>

2711
02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:29.270
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking head's pounding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got a fractured skull</v>

2712
02:05:29.450 --> 02:05:30.870
<v Speaker 1>in late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2713
02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:34.400
<v Speaker 1>fractious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go doped up is my birthday now.</v>

2714
02:05:36.150 --> 02:05:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like that job.</v>

2715
02:05:40.710 --> 02:05:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about it with a mutual</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and I think I might try to bury</v>

2716
02:05:45.921 --> 02:05:48.290
<v Speaker 1>the hatchet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So five years later.</v>

2717
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

2718
02:05:49.610 --> 02:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>It takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stubborn person put A.</v>

2719
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:54.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2720
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:57.900
<v Speaker 3>well I understand there's certain people</v>
<v Speaker 3>can joke with you,</v>

2721
02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:02.070
<v Speaker 3>like someone may be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well here you and Keith or someone like</v>

2722
02:06:02.071 --> 02:06:05.430
<v Speaker 3>that joke around like that and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll see you at a club and they'll</v>

2723
02:06:05.431 --> 02:06:09.060
<v Speaker 3>say some stupid shit to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll think it's funny because</v>

2724
02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:11.250
<v Speaker 3>they think they can get away with things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2725
02:06:11.490 --> 02:06:13.890
<v Speaker 3>But the not in with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2726

<v Speaker 3>fucking settle down.</v>

2728
02:06:18.190 --> 02:06:20.410
<v Speaker 1>It was neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was because I hadn't even</v>

2729
02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:24.870
<v Speaker 1>talked with that person for months and</v>
<v Speaker 1>months and it didn't even lead with you.</v>

2730
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the joke,</v>

2731
02:06:28.661 --> 02:06:33.661
<v Speaker 1>it was just out of nowhere to joke and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last text was like six months prior.</v>

2732
02:06:33.970 --> 02:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you</v>

2733
02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:38.170
<v Speaker 3>think that person is funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2736
02:06:41.770 --> 02:06:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't like them as a person?</v>

2737
02:06:43.901 --> 02:06:44.734
<v Speaker 3>Maybe</v>

2738
02:06:46.230 --> 02:06:47.490
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slightly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

2740
02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I haven't hung out with them in years,</v>

2741
02:06:52.730 --> 02:06:54.290
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

2742
02:06:54.570 --> 02:06:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could this,</v>

2743
02:06:55.880 --> 02:06:58.390

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Laid up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the hospital is different.</v>

2745
02:07:03.590 --> 02:07:05.150
<v Speaker 3>It really depends on who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2746
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:06.790
<v Speaker 3>It just depends on some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's uh,</v>

2747
02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:09.830
<v Speaker 3>that's one of those fine lines where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right person can send you that you'd be</v>

2748
02:07:09.831 --> 02:07:12.350
<v Speaker 3>laughing your ass off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the wrong person could send you</v>

2749
02:07:12.351 --> 02:07:12.831
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>

2750
02:07:12.831 --> 02:07:14.570
<v Speaker 3>fuck this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking to this guy in the game</v>

2751
02:07:15.170 --> 02:07:19.280
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody sending you that.</v>

2752
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:23.300
<v Speaker 3>You'd be upset like a Byron Bauer sent</v>
<v Speaker 3>you that you'd be upset.</v>

2753
02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:25.903
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2754
02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I think in that situation I'd be upset</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe afterwards talking shit,</v>

2755
02:07:33.010 --> 02:07:34.960
<v Speaker 1>maybe talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess context,</v>

<v Speaker 1>went out once I got a tweet when I was</v>

02:07:47.291 --> 02:07:52.291
<v Speaker 1>was about to crash out and I for sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll check my twitter and it was a good</v>

2762
02:07:52.721 --> 02:07:55.630
<v Speaker 1>show at the comedy cellar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got fat though and I was like</v>

2763
02:07:57.430 --> 02:08:01.930
<v Speaker 1>right before I'm out to fucking fuck my</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend,</v>

2764
02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you get fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was at the bar and I just happened</v>

2765
02:08:07.001 --> 02:08:07.631
<v Speaker 1>to check it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2766
02:08:07.631 --> 02:08:08.351
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get fat.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

2768

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2769
02:08:12.641 --> 02:08:16.660
<v Speaker 1>this is rough time for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it is timing and timing is</v>

2770
02:08:16.661 --> 02:08:19.540
<v Speaker 1>everything I might burn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they meant it in malicious</v>

2771
02:08:19.541 --> 02:08:21.310
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that shit was like really?</v>

<v Speaker 1>South Carolina of all places.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I had a few stitches here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still got the scar from that.</v>

2795
02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a skull was fractured.</v>

2796
02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Skull was fractured right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was [inaudible] I was wearing</v>

2797
02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:47.140
<v Speaker 1>glasses and the glasses went into here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2798

<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how bad is a fraction?</v>

2799
02:09:49.290 --> 02:09:50.630

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2800
02:09:50.650 --> 02:09:52.060
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let it,</v>

2801
02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:54.760
<v Speaker 1>let it a heel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let it heal on.</v>

2802
02:09:54.850 --> 02:09:56.540
<v Speaker 1>It's on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2803
02:09:56.541 --> 02:09:59.480
<v Speaker 1>he can't put it in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably if you,</v>

2804
02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:00.970
<v Speaker 1>if you want to pay for that.</v>

2805
02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:08.220
<v Speaker 1>We want to pay extra iron man cast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2806
02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:11.680
<v Speaker 1>we have to push back production on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2807
02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that was going into first season</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Eric Andre Show,</v>

2808
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.240
<v Speaker 1>so we have to push back production</v>
<v Speaker 1>because my face was all fucked up for</v>

2809
02:10:19.260 --> 02:10:19.871
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2810
02:10:19.871 --> 02:10:22.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a pretty gnarly waking up on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretcher.</v>

2811
02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be a bizarre feeling.</v>

2812
02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

2813
02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you think about that when you get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars now are getting cars,</v>

2814
02:10:30.481 --> 02:10:31.630
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a,</v>

2815
02:10:31.631 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

2816
02:10:34.101 --> 02:10:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

2817
02:10:35.691 --> 02:10:38.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think about that.</v>

2818
02:10:38.001 --> 02:10:38.751
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

2819
02:10:38.751 --> 02:10:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who caused the accident?</v>

2820
02:10:40.610 --> 02:10:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't tell you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't tell you.</v>

2821
02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:44.720
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2822
02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're missing some missing chunk of</v>

2823
02:10:47.871 --> 02:10:49.120
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just something missing.</v>

2824
02:10:49.130 --> 02:10:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Chunk of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking head injuries.</v>

2825
02:10:52.090 --> 02:10:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was no fun.</v>

2826
02:10:53.890 --> 02:10:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's scary shit.</v>

2827
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bury the hatchet with your friend.</v>

2828
02:10:59.090 --> 02:11:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I think so grown up lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're growing up growing up,</v>

2829
02:11:03.441 --> 02:11:06.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to be nicer,</v>

2830
02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:10.790
<v Speaker 1>more positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing about being more</v>

2831
02:11:10.791 --> 02:11:15.791
<v Speaker 1>recognizable is that it gives me a</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant opportunities to work</v>

2832
02:11:17.890 --> 02:11:22.790
<v Speaker 2>my social skills</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fun.</v>

2833
02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2834
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I fucked it up with that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was weird,</v>

2835
02:11:25.811 --> 02:11:28.750
<v Speaker 2>so let me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did I learn to be more?</v>

2836
02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Giving people more energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be positive to people it can help to.</v>

2837
02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Also it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a little time to recognize that</v>

2838
02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:39.580
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling about you than you have about</v>

2839
02:11:39.581 --> 02:11:43.990
<v Speaker 2>them to get them to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a person that you've never met</v>

2840
02:11:44.230 --> 02:11:46.750
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to them meeting you is all.</v>

2841
02:11:46.751 --> 02:11:50.410
<v Speaker 2>It's weighted a lot of weight to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of gravity to the moment and</v>

2842
02:11:50.411 --> 02:11:54.700
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people just get overwhelmed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and they they fuck up and stumble and</v>

2843
02:11:54.701 --> 02:11:58.990
<v Speaker 2>then they call you a monkey and screen</v>
<v Speaker 2>matcha and fucking crazy bitch.</v>

2844
02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I stopped doing it.</v>

2845
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I stopped correcting people that call me</v>
<v Speaker 1>by character names.</v>

2846
02:12:03.650 --> 02:12:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that.</v>

2847
02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I used to be that dude I used to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I do the show broad city,</v>

2848
02:12:09.970 --> 02:12:13.510
<v Speaker 1>probably my most popular character and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will say,</v>

2849
02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:16.730
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lincoln</v>

2850
02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>and I used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Lincoln as a character that play name</v>

2851
02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:23.940
<v Speaker 1>was Hannibal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be that like that and I'm just</v>

2852
02:12:23.941 --> 02:12:24.774
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

2853
02:12:24.810 --> 02:12:25.643
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2854
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Just say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>High doing.</v>

2856
02:12:29.730 --> 02:12:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky man.</v>

2857
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.600
<v Speaker 2>The learning how to navigate the waters</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people knowing you and you don't know</v>

2858
02:12:37.601 --> 02:12:39.100
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also alcohol,</v>

2859
02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:41.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out when they recognize you and</v>

2860
02:12:41.081 --> 02:12:43.170
<v Speaker 2>they're drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

2861
02:12:43.171 --> 02:12:45.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met this a fucking God damn it.</v>

2862
02:12:45.911 --> 02:12:48.550
<v Speaker 2>This guy has been in a million movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember his name,</v>

2863
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:52.390
<v Speaker 2>but I met him once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably good that I won't say his</v>

2864
02:12:52.391 --> 02:12:53.380
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember his name,</v>

2865
02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:55.750
<v Speaker 2>but I met him at one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2866

<v Speaker 2>one of those fucking things.</v>

2869
02:13:05.051 --> 02:13:06.820
<v Speaker 2>And reporters are wandering around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

2870
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:09.310
<v Speaker 2>they interview people when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking and they do it.</v>

2871
02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Pasadena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pasadena.</v>

<v Speaker 2>into this dude and I've seen him in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 movies and everything like that.</v>

2875
02:13:18.461 --> 02:13:19.720
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up man?</v>

2876
02:13:19.721 --> 02:13:22.000
<v Speaker 2>How you doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing here man?</v>

2877
02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:23.530
<v Speaker 2>And I remember he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2878
02:13:23.531 --> 02:13:27.430
<v Speaker 2>a world working and he walked by me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2879
02:13:27.431 --> 02:13:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an idiot.</v>

2880
02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:29.980
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2881
02:13:30.010 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 2>I just dorked out</v>

2882
02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:36.810
<v Speaker 1>drunk and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't respond the way I thought</v>

2883
02:13:36.811 --> 02:13:38.840
<v Speaker 1>he was gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He responded like I'm a Dork,</v>

2884
02:13:39.210 --> 02:13:41.880
<v Speaker 1>drunk dork and that was the right way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

2885
02:13:42.210 --> 02:13:43.350
<v Speaker 1>But I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2886
02:13:43.351 --> 02:13:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I got to be aware if someone ever does</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me.</v>

2887
02:13:46.610 --> 02:13:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Like how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is a feeling when you see</v>

2888
02:13:49.201 --> 02:13:51.410
<v Speaker 1>somebody that's been in movies before</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like fuck,</v>

2889
02:13:53.630 --> 02:13:55.650

<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2890
02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.690
<v Speaker 1>it's just a lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so people don't think I was working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Art I,</v>

2917
02:15:09.610 --> 02:15:14.080
<v Speaker 1>that's a good size though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 seats because I wanted to kind of,</v>

2918
02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2919
02:15:14.970 --> 02:15:18.660
<v Speaker 1>instead of doing just two shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did six shows total.</v>

2920
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to get comfortable in a venue</v>

2921
02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:24.000
<v Speaker 1>that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then film the last two.</v>

2922
02:15:24.030 --> 02:15:27.090
<v Speaker 1>So I was there Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday,</v>

2923
02:15:27.091 --> 02:15:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday in Minneapolis and it was dead</v>

2924
02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:33.690
<v Speaker 1>then by the end of the week it felt like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2925
02:15:34.190 --> 02:15:35.370
<v Speaker 1>just a club Gig.</v>

2926
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:36.031
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2927
02:15:36.031 --> 02:15:38.640
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a bigger spot in a club Gig.</v>

2928
02:15:38.641 --> 02:15:40.430
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was loose,</v>

2929
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:42.020
<v Speaker 1>let loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was just a,</v>

2930
02:15:42.580 --> 02:15:47.580
<v Speaker 1>it was a weird thing is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most times,</v>

2931
02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:50.510
<v Speaker 1>at least in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2932
02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:52.770
<v Speaker 1>the second show is usually the better</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2933
02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:54.870
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first show,</v>

2934
02:15:55.530 --> 02:15:59.550
<v Speaker 1>knocked it out of the park it in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second show was weird.</v>

2935
02:16:00.810 --> 02:16:05.810
<v Speaker 1>We probably only used two or three</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes from the second show.</v>

2936
02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
