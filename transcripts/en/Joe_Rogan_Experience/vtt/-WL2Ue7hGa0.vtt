<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

188
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>It might be like one quarter of that.</v>

189
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them also don't use currency that much.</v>

<v Speaker 1>take rice,</v>

200
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>plant it and like they take you through the whole steps in Thailand,</v>

201
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.970
<v Speaker 1>they give you the outfits and everything needed.</v>

202
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 1>All the people that farm rice where,</v>

203
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but you realize like before industrialized agriculture,</v>

204
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 1>what a process it was to actually get rice.</v>

205
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck that.</v>

206
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 1>It is a giant process.</v>

207
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy how much work is involved.</v>

208
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

209

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

211
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>I saw a dead dog in a rice patty wants to face down.</v>

212
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 1>They're still serving that rise,</v>

213
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

214
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:39.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to waste that rice.</v>

216
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

217
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they wash it off at all or like maybe</v>

218
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to put dead dog on it anyway.</v>

219
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

220

<v Speaker 1>Well the thing about the rices,</v>

222
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>like I thought that at least when you get the rice you'd just get the rice off</v>

223
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 1>the plant and then you could boil it and need it.</v>

224
00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

225
00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

226
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like a husk and you've got to beat it down and break it open and then the</v>

227
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>actual rice is underneath it.</v>

228
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

229

231
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.361
<v Speaker 1>smoke it and like,</v>

232
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:10.511
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

233
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>you've got to curate and dry and cure it.</v>

234
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>You know it's the worst female weed is which one?</v>

498
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:31.270
<v Speaker 2>really does go well with an experienced stake in a nice glass of red wine.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That really puts a pressure on me.</v>

509
00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 2>It really hurt me to not,</v>

510
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I finally joined a gym because of this.</v>

511
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I have two blankets,</v>

512

<v Speaker 1>a small gym,</v>

513
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:01.270

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

590
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I saw one.</v>

591
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.081
<v Speaker 1>How Fun was that?</v>

592
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Thai kickboxing.</v>

593
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty fun.</v>

594
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Thai fights.</v>

595
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

596
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 1>And they played the most,</v>

597
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:45.791
<v Speaker 1>the instrument,</v>

598
00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:46.624
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

599
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.471
<v Speaker 1>How Fun.</v>

600
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:48.151
<v Speaker 1>Fun Is that?</v>

601
00:13:48.151 --> 00:13:48.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

602
00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:49.154
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty wild.</v>

603
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I've been to those out here where they play it,</v>

604
00:13:51.251 --> 00:13:54.820
<v Speaker 1>but Americans get real bored with the y crew.</v>

605
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:55.421
<v Speaker 1>The dance.</v>

606
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:56.254
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

607
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:56.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

608
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:57.250
<v Speaker 1>They do a dance for their,</v>

609
00:13:57.251 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 1>for their own Dojo.</v>

610
00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

611
00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Well they do.</v>

612
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does it and there's a real logic behind it.</v>

613
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.590
<v Speaker 1>The logic is that you warm up and that you really relax yourself.</v>

614
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of performing in front of all these dance moves and also people are</v>

615
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:11.440
<v Speaker 1>staring at you.</v>

616
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.330
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of wears off your nerves.</v>

617
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a reality to that.</v>

618
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

619
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 1>it's actually really wise,</v>

620
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:17.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:14:17.961 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>and you lose,</v>

622
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you limber up your body to like,</v>

623
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the stuff they're doing is they're getting down on one knee like a</v>

624
00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>lunge and they're bouncing a little bit and so their limb bring up their body</v>

625
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:30.940
<v Speaker 1>and then on top of that they're actually doing this dance in front of all these</v>

626
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:33.040
<v Speaker 1>people and it calms the nerves a little bit.</v>

627
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

628
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:33.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

629
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:34.241
<v Speaker 1>John Fixed,</v>

630
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:35.021
<v Speaker 1>we're always talking about that.</v>

631
00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:36.820
<v Speaker 1>About like the idea of people watching you.</v>

632
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.810
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a big thing.</v>

633
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:39.970
<v Speaker 1>And the UFC is like a bigger people watching you it then.</v>

634
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.611
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

635
00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:41.111
<v Speaker 1>Anywhere else.</v>

636
00:14:41.111 --> 00:14:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a tougher people watching you.</v>

637
00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:43.830
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hot.</v>

638
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean people watching you and you shoot a free throw,</v>

639
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.110
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

640
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.831
<v Speaker 1>Good Dude.</v>

641
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:48.664
<v Speaker 1>Good Dude.</v>

642
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.541
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of people watch it.</v>

643
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:49.871
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

644
00:14:49.871 --> 00:14:50.261
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

645
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

646
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.500
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

647
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's just like five of your friends.</v>

648
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:53.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

649
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

650
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Pressure.</v>

651
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 1>The pressure's and fucking real man.</v>

652
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

653
00:14:57.651 --> 00:14:59.960
<v Speaker 1>that's what everybody's most terrified about what we do.</v>

654
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.363
<v Speaker 1>Public speaking.</v>

655
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I had somebody that we were giving a talk on Shakespeare's home.</v>

656
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.440
<v Speaker 1>It was a group project.</v>

657
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.880
<v Speaker 1>We each had to write one paragraph.</v>

658
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.040
<v Speaker 1>We wrote three paragraphs at each one of us read one,</v>

659
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 1>so I think I read mine,</v>

660
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.440
<v Speaker 1>just reading it off a paper.</v>

661
00:15:13.441 --> 00:15:14.210
<v Speaker 1>It was paying attention.</v>

662
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.043
<v Speaker 1>The next day was like,</v>

663
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.830
<v Speaker 1>and then later Shakespeare had the off time</v>

664
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.350
<v Speaker 1>and was just looking at her like,</v>

665
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:22.071
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

666
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:22.660
<v Speaker 1>And the teacher was like,</v>

667
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.001
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

668
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:23.241
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

669
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

670
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:23.931
<v Speaker 1>It's all right.</v>

671
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:24.281
<v Speaker 1>Let's start.</v>

672
00:15:24.281 --> 00:15:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with always on wheels route.</v>

673
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.271
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

674
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

675
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a phrase he is waiting.</v>

676
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:30.314
<v Speaker 1>It was a standup,</v>

677
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.450
<v Speaker 1>but like to make any sense,</v>

678
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I used to panic when I would talk to bank towers.</v>

679
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.050
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

680
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

681
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I used to go to a bank till I get super nervous right before I'd have to talk to</v>

682
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 1>a bank teller.</v>

683
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

684
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:41.443
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

685
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.343
<v Speaker 1>It's no reason for it.</v>

686
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid I've,</v>

687
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I really felt like a loser.</v>

688
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.981
<v Speaker 1>I really did.</v>

689
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I had like serious low self esteem issues up until like high school you up until</v>

690
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:51.794
<v Speaker 1>martial arts.</v>

691
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.620
<v Speaker 1>And then once I started doing martial arts and getting really good at it and</v>

692
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:55.454
<v Speaker 1>then teaching,</v>

693
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 1>it kind of calmed me down experience and then it kind of like,</v>

694
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 1>was it,</v>

695
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

696
00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 1>almost like a natural path to stand up.</v>

697
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.440
<v Speaker 1>But I remember before that being very awkward talking to people like very</v>

698
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 1>nervous talking to people I didn't know,</v>

699
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:12.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

700
00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:13.064
<v Speaker 1>just didn't,</v>

701
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.830
<v Speaker 1>didn't feel like I still get that where I'm like,</v>

702
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to talk.</v>

703
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

704
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.361
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to draw.</v>

705
00:16:18.361 --> 00:16:19.194
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to talk to.</v>

706
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

707

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

709
00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:25.541
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it's an odd thing and you know what was worse when I know you too</v>

710
00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:27.980
<v Speaker 1>and ask your questions are so broad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

737
00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you want to do it,</v>

738
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:00.320

<v Speaker 1>I'm not being responsible for this.</v>

746
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:05.940

763
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:26.870
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about,</v>

764
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:27.230

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:30.381
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

767
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:31.840
<v Speaker 1>he needs surgery and he,</v>

768
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 1>his bone is changing shape because of arthritis.</v>

769
00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>It's building up in his joint.</v>

770
00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:37.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

771
00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

772
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:43.180
<v Speaker 1>And he's a young guy and he just makes you realize like the fucking punishment</v>

773
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:45.770
<v Speaker 1>these guys are putting on their body.</v>

774
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's like totally below the surface that people don't know it's behind the</v>

775
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:51.834
<v Speaker 1>curtain.</v>

776
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.920
<v Speaker 1>No one knows about it.</v>

777
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 1>And they've got like these devastating injuries at,</v>

778
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 1>they're fighting off and then competing against worldclass fighters with</v>

779
00:17:59.191 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Speaker 1>injuries.</v>

780
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 1>He's torn ligaments and Tony Ferguson,</v>

781
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:03.361
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

782
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't look comfortable on that leg.</v>

783
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

784
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

785
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:06.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

786
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:07.560
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

787
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:07.951
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

788
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:12.951
<v Speaker 1>He went six months from catastrophic knee injury where the bone literally</v>

789
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:14.310
<v Speaker 1>separated from the ligament.</v>

790
00:18:14.311 --> 00:18:15.630
<v Speaker 1>The ligament tore off the boat.</v>

791
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:16.870
<v Speaker 1>You ever see the,</v>

792
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:17.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

793
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 1>the picture of his surgery?</v>

794
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

795
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Jayman push it up,</v>

796
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 1>pull that shit up.</v>

797
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Chain.</v>

798
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy surgery because it's,</v>

799
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exaggerating,</v>

800
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:26.790
<v Speaker 1>it might be a 12 inch scar.</v>

801
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.660
<v Speaker 1>It's enormous.</v>

802
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:31.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like that big and it's all jagged and shit and it's just,</v>

803
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.460
<v Speaker 1>he ripped it apart.</v>

804
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 1>They had an open amount of 12 months,</v>

805
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:35.760
<v Speaker 1>not even six months.</v>

806
00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:36.151
<v Speaker 1>Six months.</v>

807
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:36.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

808
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

809
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

810
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how that,</v>

811
00:18:38.721 --> 00:18:40.350
<v Speaker 1>that guy doesn't clearly get the title shot.</v>

812
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:40.980
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

813
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

814
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.120
<v Speaker 1>We should talk about that.</v>

815
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

816
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

817
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

818
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:49.850
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is that was just from a trip he just tripped was fucking bananas.</v>

819
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

820
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.170
<v Speaker 1>What's the second image,</v>

821
00:18:55.171 --> 00:18:56.004
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy?</v>

822
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.481
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

823
00:18:57.481 --> 00:18:58.314
<v Speaker 1>the other side.</v>

824
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

825
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

826
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.511
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

827
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:01.344
<v Speaker 1>The um,</v>

828
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 1>the extent of that injury.</v>

829
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:03.250
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

830
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he came back in six months and what's really interesting is he</v>

831
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:08.010
<v Speaker 1>came back in six months.</v>

832
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:09.360
<v Speaker 1>He didn't spar apparently.</v>

833
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Really need to talk to him about this and I'm going to have him on with Eddie.</v>

834
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

835
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 1>he didn't spar.</v>

836
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 1>He just prepared.</v>

837
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Prepared.</v>

838
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

839
00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:18.390
<v Speaker 1>He's want to Eddie's black belts.</v>

840
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:18.841
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

841
00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

842
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

843
00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.470
<v Speaker 1>To,</v>

844
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:21.303
<v Speaker 1>he's a black belt.</v>

845
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:23.423
<v Speaker 1>You should be.</v>

846
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I think he is.</v>

847
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it's fine.</v>

848
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>

849
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure Eddie gave him his black belt after he submitted Kevin Lee.</v>

850
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.011
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

851
00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:29.844
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

852
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

853
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:31.051
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

854
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 1>He's uh,</v>

855
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 1>he's 10th Planet Guy.</v>

856
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

857
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.170
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>

858
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.280
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad ass.</v>

859
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 1>He's got a nasty Darce choke probably.</v>

860
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:38.980
<v Speaker 1>He should clearly get the title shot.</v>

861
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense to me.</v>

862
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Even that when he came back he shouldn't have even gotten stripped.</v>

863
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.030
<v Speaker 1>In hindsight.</v>

864
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100% and then it's like you have copy Ayp is the title holder fair and</v>

865
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:49.591
<v Speaker 1>square I guess.</v>

866
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 1>But like you never beat the champion.</v>

867
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:51.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

868
00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:54.680
<v Speaker 1>he's more of a legit title holder in my opinion than could be blessed before</v>

869
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Connor because he didn't ally Quinta who wasn't even supposed to be fighting for</v>

870
00:19:58.381 --> 00:19:59.130
<v Speaker 1>the title.</v>

871
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Kevin Lee is a way more like Ferguson got it from,</v>

872
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.280
<v Speaker 1>well Ferguson Fuck Kevin leak for the interim title because Connor left it.</v>

873
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.610
<v Speaker 1>But Kevin Lee prepared for Tony Ferguson.</v>

874
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.390
<v Speaker 1>They met,</v>

875
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 1>they fought for the interim title and Kevin Lee is like a top contender.</v>

876
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:17.603
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

877
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking tough guy.</v>

878
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he went five rounds with,</v>

879
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:22.590
<v Speaker 1>could be Connor couldn't go five rounds with,</v>

880
00:20:22.591 --> 00:20:22.950
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>

881
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.461
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

882
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:23.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

883
00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:25.140
<v Speaker 1>he put up resistance.</v>

884
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:25.621
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

885
00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:26.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a good fight.</v>

886
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.740
<v Speaker 1>He would never make anyone a title shot.</v>

887
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:29.610
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

888
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in the discussion.</v>

889
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Well he's fighting Kevin Lee.</v>

890
00:20:32.391 --> 00:20:33.480
<v Speaker 1>If he beats Kevin Lee,</v>

891
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.630
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

892
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.030
<v Speaker 1>that's the next cat look.</v>

893
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Ally Quinta is fucking legit.</v>

894
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.600
<v Speaker 1>He's very legit.</v>

895
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:40.500
<v Speaker 1>He's underrated.</v>

896
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Like really underrated in my opinion.</v>

897
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.411
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>

898
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:45.060
<v Speaker 1>the way he got up from Khabib,</v>

899
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:45.781
<v Speaker 1>taken him down.</v>

900
00:20:45.781 --> 00:20:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's been able to do that.</v>

901
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 1>He got up like</v>

902
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.120
<v Speaker 3>pretty consistently,</v>

903
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.830
<v Speaker 3>took very little damage on the ground.</v>

904
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:51.221
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't,</v>

905
00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:52.070
<v Speaker 3>wasn't copied,</v>

906
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 3>was never able to pound him out the way he pounded out.</v>

907
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Connor,</v>

908
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 3>if you go back and watch ally Quinta versus Khabib and Connor versus could be,</v>

909
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.710
<v Speaker 3>you realize how fucking good ally Quinta is.</v>

910
00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.760
<v Speaker 3>Just ton of nothing on the ground.</v>

911
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.910
<v Speaker 3>Well he didn't in that fight.</v>

912
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

913
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:06.870
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

914
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.570
<v Speaker 2>that's when Mendez took him down on two weeks notice and it was like if he</v>

915
00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:10.751
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

916
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Gas Mendez would have beat him.</v>

917
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.490
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

918
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like he can't fight them right</v>

919
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:14.610
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

920
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.443
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

921
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.670
<v Speaker 3>he did very well in the ground and gets Max Holloway,</v>

922
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.820
<v Speaker 3>which was a early in Max's career.</v>

923
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Max was only like 21 at the time.</v>

924
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.193
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

925
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:26.550
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

926
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.570
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely his weakest part of his game and the strongest part of</v>

927
00:21:30.571 --> 00:21:31.350
<v Speaker 3>Khabib's game.</v>

928
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:35.880
<v Speaker 3>My point was just that ally Quinta did not get beat up on the ground like that</v>

929
00:21:35.881 --> 00:21:37.440
<v Speaker 3>did not get close to being stopped,</v>

930
00:21:37.441 --> 00:21:40.470
<v Speaker 3>went full five rounds and could be clearly won the fight.</v>

931
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.680
<v Speaker 3>But Alec went to provided resistance and provided more of a struggle than Conor</v>

932
00:21:45.811 --> 00:21:46.080
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

933
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.240
<v Speaker 2>I to honestly thanks to some of the reason that's holding la Quinta back from</v>

934
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:52.390
<v Speaker 2>the fans being from them thinking of him as like a top is his name.</v>

935
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:53.403
<v Speaker 2>It's just not,</v>

936
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Speaker 2>he has a name of someone who would be like in the early route of Mike Tyson's</v>

937
00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:56.974
<v Speaker 2>punch out.</v>

938
00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:57.701
<v Speaker 2>You say that,</v>

939
00:21:57.701 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 2>but if you started starching world champions,</v>

940
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:01.510
<v Speaker 2>nobody would give a fuck about his name.</v>

941
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.230
<v Speaker 2>If he went out there and destroyed could beam and fucking head kicked him into</v>

942
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:06.064
<v Speaker 2>another dimension.</v>

943
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

944
00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

945
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

946
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would give him some of talking about like how hot like celebrities are</v>

947
00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:11.650
<v Speaker 2>and like you wouldn't say that if he wasn't a nine movies.</v>

948
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:12.611
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

949
00:22:12.611 --> 00:22:13.180
<v Speaker 2>who?</v>

950
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

951
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.070

952
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

953

955
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

956
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.441

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.170
<v Speaker 2>but like even back then it was like,</v>

964
00:22:23.171 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

965
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:23.771

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:25.331
<v Speaker 2>he's fine.</v>

968
00:22:25.331 --> 00:22:27.670
<v Speaker 2>But for a comedian for super successful,</v>

969
00:22:27.671 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 2>so you're like,</v>

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:29.980
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Not like,</v>

975
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:31.873
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

976
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:32.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

977
00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:32.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

978
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.633
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Renner.</v>

979
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I remember him on commercial days and it was like good looking guy.</v>

980
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:40.180
<v Speaker 2>But now people are like so gorgeous and it's like that's success is on that.</v>

981
00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:40.721
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

982
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

983
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:41.883
<v Speaker 2>For gals.</v>

984
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:42.401
<v Speaker 2>And then funding,</v>

985
00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:45.220
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work like that with girls at all at all.</v>

986
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:46.001
<v Speaker 2>And matter of fact,</v>

987
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:47.230
<v Speaker 2>it makes them look a little gross.</v>

988
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 2>What if they're,</v>

989
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.610
<v Speaker 2>if they're,</v>

990
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:49.480
<v Speaker 2>if they're more successful,</v>

991
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 2>super successful and not that good looking like,</v>

992
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.370
<v Speaker 2>it works the opposite.</v>

994
00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:56.800
<v Speaker 2>If they're gross looking and then it gets successful.</v>

995
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.663
<v Speaker 2>Like Joan Jett,</v>

996
00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:58.571
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck Joan Jett.</v>

00:22:58.571 --> 00:22:59.410

1001
00:23:01.271 --> 00:23:01.651
<v Speaker 2>But in the,</v>

1002
00:23:01.651 --> 00:23:02.720
<v Speaker 2>in the Harvey,</v>

1003
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.200
<v Speaker 2>there's these women without their fame are like,</v>

1004
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.160
<v Speaker 2>get away from me.</v>

1005
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1006
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.030
<v Speaker 2>We're talking Joan Jett.</v>

1007
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:09.940
<v Speaker 2>I love rock and roll.</v>

1008
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Put another dime that jukebox babies get outta here.</v>

1009
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:13.240
<v Speaker 2>Go put a diamond.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1012
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.080
<v Speaker 2>I disagree strongly.</v>

1013
00:23:17.081 --> 00:23:18.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it's only because of her fame.</v>

1014
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I always thought she was hot and I know you did,</v>

1015
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.840
<v Speaker 2>but when I was in high school,</v>

1176
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.350
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>not a journalist.</v>

1192
00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 1>One of the info wars,</v>

1193
00:27:57.361 --> 00:28:01.830
<v Speaker 1>real news Twitter band after MSM outcry over Hillary satire.</v>

1194
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.450
<v Speaker 1>So it was a satire piece.</v>

1195
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I just found the piece and I was like,</v>

1196
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:06.300
<v Speaker 1>there's no way that this is real.</v>

1197
00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 1>They thought it was that tire.</v>

1198
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who did,</v>

1199
00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:09.570
<v Speaker 1>but can I just tell you about,</v>

1200
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.500
<v Speaker 1>about Hillary Clinton?</v>

1201
00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 1>We this DNA test proving she's only half lizard person all the way up,</v>

1202
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.110
<v Speaker 1>but like she's doing,</v>

1203
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.130
<v Speaker 1>she relates it to clear her name.</v>

1204
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you know Elizabeth Warren released that thing that says that she's got</v>

1205
00:28:21.361 --> 00:28:22.680
<v Speaker 1>actual native American blood,</v>

1206
00:28:22.681 --> 00:28:24.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's literally like one,</v>

1207
00:28:24.691 --> 00:28:27.960
<v Speaker 1>100024th fucking million trillion.</v>

1208
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.880
<v Speaker 1>She has like the smallest amount of your bench of Shapiro tweeted about that.</v>

1210
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:33.420
<v Speaker 1>What'd he say?</v>

1211
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.211
<v Speaker 1>Oh Fuck Jay.</v>

1212
00:28:34.211 --> 00:28:35.044
<v Speaker 1>We've tried to find it.</v>

1213
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:35.731
<v Speaker 1>Your great,</v>

1214
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:35.941

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.390
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1219
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.300
<v Speaker 1>and then it was something else,</v>

1220
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:40.950
<v Speaker 1>but I forgot what it was.</v>

1221
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.193
<v Speaker 1>See if we could find it.</v>

1222
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.540
<v Speaker 1>But I think I'm 1.6% African.</v>

1223
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I did one of those DNA tests.</v>

1224
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1225
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.223

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.203
<v Speaker 1>Goodbye.</v>

1228
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm at least 10 times more African than Hershey issues.</v>

1229
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Native American.</v>

1230
00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1231
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.640
<v Speaker 1>That's how ridiculous it is.</v>

1232
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong with these numbers because Jamie and I were trying to work it</v>

1233
00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:07.140
<v Speaker 1>out and we're both stupid.</v>

1234
00:29:07.141 --> 00:29:07.561
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

1235
00:29:07.561 --> 00:29:08.281
<v Speaker 1>She released that.</v>

1236
00:29:08.281 --> 00:29:09.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like c instead of going like,</v>

1237
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:10.021
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1238
00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:10.691
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm not that.</v>

1239
00:29:10.691 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 1>She was lying.</v>

1240
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 1>She was also lied to.</v>

1241
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.621
<v Speaker 1>Probably her family was like,</v>

1242
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:13.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1243
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:17.520
<v Speaker 1>you know we have native and have something like that does happen when people do</v>

1244
00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:17.790
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>

1245
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.623
<v Speaker 1>Like Jamie.</v>

1246
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Jamie thought he had a gang gang of native American enemies.</v>

1247
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.650
<v Speaker 1>A chat supposedly do.</v>

1248
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.491
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to prove.</v>

1249
00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:24.960
<v Speaker 1>It's from what I'm trying to find out.</v>

1250
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1251
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to do one of those tests.</v>

1252
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I just have it to see if I'm over 90% 7% Jewish,</v>

1253
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.580
<v Speaker 1>other 97% Jewish.</v>

1254
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Mine is almost exactly what I thought.</v>

1255
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.120
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly Italian.</v>

1256
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It's some other European like Irish and English.</v>

1257
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be part monkey.</v>

1258
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1259
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:41.861
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>

1260
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>does</v>

1261
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 2>some neanderthal I found the editorial in there.</v>

1262
00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.290
<v Speaker 2>57% more than the average person park on that.</v>

1264
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1265
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.490
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to prove that he was a minority so we can claim victim hood.</v>

1266
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:52.160
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1267
00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.911
<v Speaker 2>I know to take the test,</v>

1268
00:29:52.911 --> 00:29:53.800
<v Speaker 2>the swab your mouth.</v>

1269
00:29:53.801 --> 00:29:56.380
<v Speaker 2>So of course he found an native American and just started making out with them</v>

1270
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:57.523
<v Speaker 2>swab.</v>

1271
00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.620
<v Speaker 2>And I know who like came up kind of weird.</v>

1272
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 2>They're like 98% native Americans so we can get a blood test.</v>

1273
00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:08.770
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't any minority except he was like 2% neanderthal and he goes,</v>

1274
00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:09.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we did.</v>

1317
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

1318
00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.080
<v Speaker 2>he might might've actually,</v>

1319
00:30:53.081 --> 00:30:54.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a real kiss.</v>

1320
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:55.140
<v Speaker 2>The frost.</v>

1321
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.170
<v Speaker 2>He's just watching the Monitor.</v>

1322
00:30:56.171 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not even looking at us.</v>

1323
00:30:57.101 --> 00:30:57.820
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1324
00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.500
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had held a little log that in this.</v>

1325
00:30:59.501 --> 00:31:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was over.</v>

1326
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:03.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1327
00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 2>That's intense.</v>

1328
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.260
<v Speaker 2>You grabbed his face too.</v>

1329
00:31:05.261 --> 00:31:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Like you really loved him.</v>

1330
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:06.761
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1331
00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:07.211
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

1332
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:11.740
<v Speaker 2>And put his hand on your shoulder and sort of like a submissive stance and look</v>

1333
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:13.930
<v Speaker 2>at Joe Silva just fight as interesting.</v>

1334
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.880
<v Speaker 2>She'll sell these guy's hands crossed.</v>

1335
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Totally oblivious to the homosexual activity going on behind his was back when</v>

1336
00:31:19.181 --> 00:31:20.800
<v Speaker 2>the fighters could actually make a living in a,</v>

1337
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.300
<v Speaker 2>in a sponsorship.</v>

1338
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1339
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.950
<v Speaker 2>We're get a short wouldn't sponsor.</v>

1340
00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:30.700
<v Speaker 2>That's a big selling point for Bella tour for a lot of fighters come here and</v>

1341
00:31:30.701 --> 00:31:31.630
<v Speaker 2>actually make some cash.</v>

1342
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1343
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:35.950
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more money to be made if you can get sponsors.</v>

1344
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1345
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.670
<v Speaker 2>shop was making more than $150,000 a fight.</v>

1346
00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:40.850
<v Speaker 2>John is short sponsors.</v>

1347
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1348
00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1349
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 2>and that flag behind you afterwards,</v>

1350
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:44.170
<v Speaker 2>a flag behind you,</v>

1351
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 2>the shorts.</v>

1352
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:49.450
<v Speaker 2>They quickly rush to put the tee shirt on and tee shirts around the week of the</v>

1353
00:31:49.451 --> 00:31:49.930
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1354
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1355
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:50.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1356
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:52.750
<v Speaker 2>people would pay you to wear it for all your training footage.</v>

1357
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1358
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1359
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I remember when the sponsor,</v>

1360
00:31:55.811 --> 00:31:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I remember when they did away with it,</v>

1361
00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:57.790
<v Speaker 2>the fighters going,</v>

1362
00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.181
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1363

00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:00.251

1366
00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:01.084
<v Speaker 2>Come to shush.</v>

1367
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.850
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be shorter and I'm going to stump fucking nightclubs.</v>

1368
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:04.733
<v Speaker 2>They haven't begun.</v>

1369
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I have to parties.</v>

1370
00:32:06.251 --> 00:32:06.750
<v Speaker 2>It's shush.</v>

1371
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:07.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1372
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to open up a and then they're like,</v>

1373
00:32:11.201 --> 00:32:11.741
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>

1374
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:12.431
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that anymore.</v>

1375
00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:13.264
<v Speaker 2>It's gross.</v>

1376
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I think that came out of the time,</v>

1377
00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:15.820
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

1378
00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.950
<v Speaker 2>I remember one of the earlier ones in Sacramento.</v>

1379
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.371
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1380
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:19.270
<v Speaker 2>I got to see,</v>

1381
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.490
<v Speaker 2>luckily not from when you were in the UFC,</v>

1382
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.700
<v Speaker 2>but from this middle range to where it is now of like all the fighters would say</v>

1383
00:32:26.741 --> 00:32:30.230
<v Speaker 2>at the same hotel and like we'd have the after party there.</v>

1384
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.570
<v Speaker 2>We'd all hang out,</v>

1385
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.510
<v Speaker 2>four or five fans would show up who knew about it,</v>

1386
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.540
<v Speaker 2>but generally it was just a way you can drink with Keith Jardeen and all these</v>

1387
00:32:37.541 --> 00:32:38.640
<v Speaker 2>guys and late times,</v>

1388
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 2>great times.</v>

1389
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I remember you eventually had to make a decision like,</v>

1390
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.591
<v Speaker 1>I can't be here anymore.</v>

1391
00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:42.681
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1392
00:32:42.681 --> 00:32:44.000
<v Speaker 1>it could become overrun with fans,</v>

1393
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.250
<v Speaker 1>but for a while it was awesome.</v>

1394
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1395
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 1>The ring card girl would hae two things changed.</v>

1396
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:51.780
<v Speaker 1>One cell phones with cameras,</v>

1397
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 1>they changed because it used to be would just want to say hi.</v>

1398
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Then it was everyone had a phone out and they all wanted to take a photo and</v>

1399
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:00.680
<v Speaker 1>they would wait for you in the elevator bank.</v>

1400
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 1>So you would get out of the elevator and there would be 50 people there and you</v>

1401
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:05.414
<v Speaker 1>couldn't go anywhere.</v>

1402
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.910
<v Speaker 1>You always so late to the event like,</v>

1403
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:07.371
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1404
00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I have to go.</v>

1405
00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1406
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.590
<v Speaker 1>I should've left 20 minutes ago.</v>

1407
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.461
<v Speaker 1>What about the fence?</v>

1408
00:33:10.461 --> 00:33:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1409
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my job.</v>

1410
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Do my job.</v>

1411
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Do it for a million fans so you for don't really matter as much.</v>

1412
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Running to the fucking way ends.</v>

1413
00:33:16.591 --> 00:33:19.670
<v Speaker 1>These guys are starving to death right now and I got to get there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1416
00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.290
<v Speaker 1>but people would get so angry if he didn't take their photo,</v>

1417
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.060
<v Speaker 1>but it was such good times.</v>

1418
00:33:26.061 --> 00:33:27.110
<v Speaker 1>I remember it in Sacramento.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There was a hotel bar are all at and it was like this is fucking awesome.</v>

1420
00:33:31.191 --> 00:33:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Hanging out casually.</v>

1421
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.700
<v Speaker 1>You happen to get into conversations with fighters.</v>

1422
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1423
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.141

<v Speaker 1>it completely changed.</v>

1429
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.360
<v Speaker 1>It completely changed as a,</v>

1430
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.800
<v Speaker 1>well 2005 is really when it changed because that's when the ultimate fighter</v>

1431
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.700
<v Speaker 1>came on and when the ultimate fighter took off in the sport became,</v>

1432
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.170
<v Speaker 1>it just became much bigger,</v>

1433
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.120
<v Speaker 1>like almost within a year.</v>

1434
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 1>It was like significantly bigger and then it kept going and then 2000 like what</v>

1435
00:33:57.501 --> 00:33:59.240
<v Speaker 1>was the iPhone 2007</v>

1436
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 1>six ish.</v>

1437
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.700
<v Speaker 1>That's when shit really changed with the cameras on the phones.</v>

<v Speaker 1>nine and then I was like,</v>

1440
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this anymore.</v>

1441
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I have to because we would do shows.</v>

1442
00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go to Dennis Hotel.</v>

1443
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Well there was no way.</v>

1444
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:15.290
<v Speaker 1>It was just too crazy.</v>

1445
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like you would get stocked coming into the hotel.</v>

1446
00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:20.000
<v Speaker 1>You get stocked leaving the hotel.</v>

1447
00:34:20.001 --> 00:34:22.010
<v Speaker 1>People would find your door and knock on your door.</v>

1448
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.560
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't like that and it was so fun.</v>

00:34:40.671 --> 00:34:42.440
<v Speaker 1>we found out a way to crank texts people.</v>

1458
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.640
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you put in 10 different contacts of a text,</v>

1459
00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.190
<v Speaker 1>all the same number and they say,</v>

1460
00:34:49.191 --> 00:34:49.401
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1461
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:50.150
<v Speaker 1>how you doing?</v>

1462
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.130
<v Speaker 1>And then they would just get 10 individual texts.</v>

1463
00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:53.300
<v Speaker 1>That's it's,</v>

1464
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.380
<v Speaker 1>you just keep doing that.</v>

1465
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:56.143
<v Speaker 1>Fucking stupid.</v>

1466
00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1467
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.470
<v Speaker 1>They would take pictures of people,</v>

1468
00:34:57.471 --> 00:35:00.440
<v Speaker 1>but I remember you doing the way it's going and it was back then,</v>

1469
00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:01.940
<v Speaker 1>it was only the camps showed up.</v>

1470
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1471
00:35:02.211 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 1>it was small.</v>

1472
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1473
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.640
<v Speaker 1>It was just an a in a,</v>

1474
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:06.170
<v Speaker 1>like a hall,</v>

1475
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1476
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:07.191
<v Speaker 1>not a hallway,</v>

1477
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:08.024
<v Speaker 1>but like a cup,</v>

1478
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:10.340
<v Speaker 1>like a banquet hall and you go,</v>

1543
00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:27.510
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know who any of these people,</v>

1549
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.360
<v Speaker 4>Trying to figure out how to do that.</v>

1550
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.090
<v Speaker 4>A rear naked choke defense got good fast.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You got pretty good.</v>

1553
00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:45.960
<v Speaker 4>I remember you tapping people.</v>

1554
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.240
<v Speaker 4>I remember looking over and watching you tap some guys going,</v>

1555
00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:49.051
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fucking Jujitsu if you brought,</v>

1558

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:54.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing Jujitsu.</v>

1560
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.640
<v Speaker 4>It'd be the most fun thing to do.</v>

1561
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.990
<v Speaker 4>If bodies were way more durable,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like next didn't give out.</v>

1563
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Like Eddie's had three surgeries inside of the last year.</v>

1564
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.210
<v Speaker 4>He had knee surgery,</v>

1565
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.740
<v Speaker 4>he had his back disc replaced in his back and then he just had shoulder surgery.</v>

1566
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like your body just gets blown apart.</v>

1567
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.610
<v Speaker 4>When I tore my meniscus,</v>

1568
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 4>I had surgery on it.</v>

1569
00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:17.161
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know what it was.</v>

1570
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:17.994
<v Speaker 4>For the longest time.</v>

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.411
<v Speaker 4>it's probably that,</v>

1582
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:29.160
<v Speaker 4>just tell them to scope it.</v>

1583
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.090
<v Speaker 4>They went in there and found it,</v>

1584
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:31.343
<v Speaker 4>did it right then.</v>

1585

1601
00:37:44.551 --> 00:37:45.540
<v Speaker 4>why don't do that.</v>

1602
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:46.200
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1603
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.150
<v Speaker 4>oh that's I have to do as part of it.</v>

1604
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 4>Like it was,</v>

1605
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.250
<v Speaker 4>why would you bend your leg like that?</v>

1606
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.260
<v Speaker 4>Like that's everyday man,</v>

1607
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.940
<v Speaker 4>that's twice a week.</v>

1608
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.290
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what the fuck they're talking about.</v>

1609
00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:56.700
<v Speaker 4>That's just a flexibility issue.</v>

1610
00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.673
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1611
00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.220
<v Speaker 4>That never bothered my knees.</v>

1612
00:37:59.520 --> 00:37:59.970
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1613
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:00.490
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1614
00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:00.751
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1615
00:38:00.751 --> 00:38:01.411
<v Speaker 4>If you're flexible,</v>

1616
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:02.340
<v Speaker 4>that's most kettlebells.</v>

1617
00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.290
<v Speaker 4>More than chits that yeah,</v>

1618
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.650
<v Speaker 4>cause I remember we were doing some stuff like you were doing cleans and presses</v>

1619
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:08.130
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

1620
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:08.963
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1621
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.100
<v Speaker 4>for guide doesn't ever lift weights.</v>

1622
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.900
<v Speaker 4>This is a pretty explosive movement.</v>

1623
00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:13.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1624
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.430
<v Speaker 4>And my technique's not perfect.</v>

1625
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:17.660
<v Speaker 4>So then it's like really opening it up to like more very much.</v>

1626
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.050
<v Speaker 4>And it's also when,</v>

1627
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.330
<v Speaker 4>when you get sore from doing something like that,</v>

1628
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:23.010
<v Speaker 4>you really should take a long time off.</v>

1629
00:38:23.011 --> 00:38:26.070
<v Speaker 4>Like the real hard thing for people that are just starting to lift weights is</v>

1630
00:38:26.071 --> 00:38:27.330
<v Speaker 4>the building process.</v>

1631
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.360
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of the things that we had talked about with this fitness challenge</v>

1632
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:35.361
<v Speaker 4>was lifting the most amount of weights and in improving your Max weight over the</v>

1633
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:35.501
<v Speaker 4>month.</v>

1634
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:35.741
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1635
00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 4>okay</v>

1636
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.460
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

1637
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 3>let's be,</v>

1638
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.860
<v Speaker 3>let's slow down here because you guys,</v>

1639
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know Tom Lifts weights a little.</v>

1640
00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 3>You don't lift weights at all?</v>

1641
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:43.061
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1642
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 3>I do not.</v>

1643
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I lift weights a lot and I'm like,</v>

1644
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:46.181
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1645
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:49.380
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to improve my macs and things were,</v>

1646
00:38:49.381 --> 00:38:51.790
<v Speaker 3>were running the risk of catastrophic injury,</v>

1647
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 3>like we're running the risk of tearing ligaments.</v>

1648
00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Also be bad for the contest.</v>

1649
00:38:55.811 --> 00:38:57.010
<v Speaker 3>How somebody you have to drop out.</v>

1650
00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1651
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.710
<v Speaker 3>it could fuck you up pretty bad.</v>

1652
00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't lift Max weight.</v>

1653
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 3>I lift like considerably less than my max weight and I don't go to failure.</v>

1654
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:07.540
<v Speaker 3>I do this.</v>

1655
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 3>You don't go to failure?</v>

1656
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:08.740
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1657
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I operate under these principles of uh,</v>

1658
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:15.520
<v Speaker 3>this Guy Pavel Tatsu lean who came up with this company called strong first.</v>

1659
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.200
<v Speaker 3>And what the idea is,</v>

1660
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 3>is you do less.</v>

1661
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Like say if I can do 70 pound kettle bell and I can press it over my head 15</v>

1662
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:24.460
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

1663
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't do 15 times.</v>

1664
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 3>I do six,</v>

1665
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:31.620
<v Speaker 3>five or six and then I put it down and I leave it alone for like 10 minutes and</v>

1666
00:39:32.651 --> 00:39:37.651
<v Speaker 3>then a comeback and I do another five and I do low repetitions and unless I'm</v>

1667
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:39.640
<v Speaker 3>doing conditioning,</v>

1668
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.390
<v Speaker 3>in which case I'll use a much lighter weight and I'll do weight.</v>

1669
00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:43.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1670
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:46.420
<v Speaker 3>But Cam does different shit cause like 40 reps of fun.</v>

1671
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.890
<v Speaker 3>He does a bunch of ridiculous shit.</v>

1672
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.270
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking maniac.</v>

1673
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:51.830
<v Speaker 3>You can't pay attention to him because he doesn't make sense outside the norm.</v>

1674
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:52.240
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1675
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.680
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't make any sense.</v>

1676
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.850
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't get injured.</v>

1677
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.680
<v Speaker 3>He fucking runs marathons every day and he'll do hundreds of repetitions.</v>

1678
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.100
<v Speaker 3>I killed two sets of 25 like four sets of 25 yeah.</v>

1679
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:05.470
<v Speaker 3>He like when he's preparing for one of those big races,</v>

1680
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.540
<v Speaker 3>he runs a marathon a day.</v>

1681
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

1682
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:08.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1683
00:40:08.681 --> 00:40:09.670
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense,</v>

1684
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 3>but also you have to recognize that he built himself into that state over</v>

1685
00:40:14.561 --> 00:40:15.394
<v Speaker 3>decades.</v>

1686
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Do you know marathon where it comes from?</v>

1687
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:18.581
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1688
00:40:18.581 --> 00:40:22.750
<v Speaker 3>It was a distance that they had to run to alert someone of something.</v>

1689
00:40:22.751 --> 00:40:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1690
00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:24.071
<v Speaker 3>I did know the guy,</v>

1691
00:40:24.071 --> 00:40:25.180
<v Speaker 3>I guess his name was marathon,</v>

1692
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.350
<v Speaker 3>the right afterwards,</v>

1693
00:40:26.351 --> 00:40:28.000
<v Speaker 3>afterwards and died.</v>

1694
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:29.770
<v Speaker 3>But it was more than an actual marathon.</v>

1695
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:30.171
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it,</v>

1696
00:40:30.171 --> 00:40:30.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1697
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:30.411
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1698
00:40:30.411 --> 00:40:31.390
<v Speaker 3>it was 26.2,</v>

1699
00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:32.470
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a hundred miles.</v>

1700
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.520
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got rid in a hundred.</v>

1701
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:34.563
<v Speaker 3>See if that's true.</v>

1702
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:36.700
<v Speaker 3>The origin of the term marathon,</v>

1703
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.570
<v Speaker 3>we call that up.</v>

1704
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Origin of marathon please.</v>

1705
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.393
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1706
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1707
00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.713

1708
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.353

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.210
<v Speaker 3>Cam doesn't count.</v>

1712
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1713
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand how he's not always hurt,</v>

1714
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.311
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>

1715
00:40:50.311 --> 00:40:51.144

1716
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:52.721

1722
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.003

<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1735
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:15.510
<v Speaker 3>I'll do what you want me to hear.</v>

1736
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:19.690
<v Speaker 3>The buzz on the first marathon commemorated the run of soldier for deputies from</v>

1737
00:41:19.691 --> 00:41:24.691
<v Speaker 3>a battlefield near the town of marathon grease to areas in for 90 BC.</v>

1738
00:41:25.331 --> 00:41:29.680
<v Speaker 3>According to Legend for deputies ran the approximately 25 miles to announce the</v>

1739
00:41:29.681 --> 00:41:32.530
<v Speaker 3>defeat of the Persians to some anxious Athenians.</v>

1740
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 3>But doesn't say that the guy died.</v>

1741
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.211
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1742
00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:37.220
<v Speaker 3>it does not say died.</v>

1743
00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.450
<v Speaker 3>See how that guy's running?</v>

1744
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.313
<v Speaker 3>Look up.</v>

1745
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:42.560
<v Speaker 3>See where the guys striking with his heel.</v>

1746
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.280
<v Speaker 3>It's wrong.</v>

1747
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.090
<v Speaker 3>Totally wrong.</v>

1748
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:44.871
<v Speaker 3>Not only is it wrong,</v>

1749
00:41:44.871 --> 00:41:46.640
<v Speaker 3>human beings never ran like that before.</v>

1750
00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:48.530
<v Speaker 3>They invented those stupid fucking shoes.</v>

1751
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:49.580
<v Speaker 3>I tried it.</v>

1752
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.860
<v Speaker 3>I heard you say that before when you're talking about the gold shoes.</v>

1753
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 3>So I try to like lead with my,</v>

1754
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.590
<v Speaker 3>with yeah,</v>

1755
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.870
<v Speaker 3>not so what is it you,</v>

1756
00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:57.381
<v Speaker 3>your Paul,</v>

1757
00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:57.890
<v Speaker 3>your phone.</v>

1758
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1759
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're supposed to lean forward more.</v>

1760
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.000
<v Speaker 3>And when you lean forward more,</v>

1761
00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:05.480
<v Speaker 3>you strike down and you almost hit with your foot flat.</v>

1762
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:09.290
<v Speaker 3>But what you never want to do is run like that asshole heel down.</v>

1763
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.030
<v Speaker 3>That's how people destroy their knees running.</v>

1764
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Speaker 3>And that was all created by Nike.</v>

1765
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Nike created that stupid bubble fat heel shoe.</v>

1766
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:17.211
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

1767
00:42:17.211 --> 00:42:18.380
<v Speaker 3>to give you more cushioning,</v>

1768
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Speaker 3>but it's just the mechanics of it are totally wrong.</v>

1769
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 3>If you ever watch little kids run,</v>

1770
00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 3>they're run ball of the foot first.</v>

1771
00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 3>That's natural.</v>

1772
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.030
<v Speaker 3>That's how you're supposed to naturally run.</v>

1773
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.910
<v Speaker 3>That's your foot is literally designed as a shock absorber.</v>

1774
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.920
<v Speaker 3>I run with those minimalist shoes.</v>

1775
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.960
<v Speaker 3>My shoes have zero cushioning,</v>

1776
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.823
<v Speaker 3>zero,</v>

1777
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:36.140
<v Speaker 3>so I'm running mountains and hills and shit like that.</v>

1778
00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Even when I hunted elk last week,</v>

1779
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.290
<v Speaker 3>see these guys?</v>

1780
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1781
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:40.760
<v Speaker 3>right on the ball.</v>

1782
00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1783
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.281
<v Speaker 3>the black ones,</v>

1784
00:42:43.281 --> 00:42:44.720
<v Speaker 3>the real dark black ones who are good,</v>

1785
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:45.950
<v Speaker 3>they run barefoot,</v>

1786
00:42:45.951 --> 00:42:46.790
<v Speaker 3>those fucking guys.</v>

1787
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.840
<v Speaker 3>But these guys are,</v>

1788
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.100
<v Speaker 3>they're landing flat.</v>

1789
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 3>They Dev a lot of cushioning on the shoes.</v>

1790
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:53.720
<v Speaker 3>You have to realize like it and some of these guys are landing heel,</v>

1791
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 3>that kind of the back of the heel first and that's because those God damn shoes,</v>

1792
00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't have shoes like that,</v>

1793
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:02.300
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking way that guys all,</v>

1794
00:43:02.301 --> 00:43:03.890
<v Speaker 3>he'll see that last guy.</v>

1795
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.050
<v Speaker 3>That guy's all heal.</v>

1796
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.290
<v Speaker 3>You would never run like that.</v>

1797
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.600
<v Speaker 3>It's against the mechanics of the human knee.</v>

1798
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:09.141
<v Speaker 3>Hold it.</v>

1799
00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:09.741
<v Speaker 3>Go back to that.</v>

1800
00:43:09.741 --> 00:43:11.090
<v Speaker 3>What does that video that does come up?</v>

1801
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:12.103
<v Speaker 3>It's the elite.</v>

1802
00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.330
<v Speaker 3>What was that video that was just coming up next?</v>

1803
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:14.871
<v Speaker 3>Not to come up?</v>

1804
00:43:14.871 --> 00:43:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Neck said Candace running cadence.</v>

1805
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:18.531
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1806
00:43:18.531 --> 00:43:19.070
<v Speaker 3>cadence.</v>

1807
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1808
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1809
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:21.050
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1810
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.220
<v Speaker 3>that video,</v>

1811
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:26.330
<v Speaker 3>like that's the only reason that people are running like that.</v>

1812
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.800
<v Speaker 3>It's because of the invention of those shoes.</v>

1813
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:28.521
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

1814
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:29.570
<v Speaker 3>you run quite a bit,</v>

1815
00:43:29.571 --> 00:43:30.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1816
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:30.993
<v Speaker 3>I've seen,</v>

1817
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.560
<v Speaker 1>the reason I look for that it's because I've seen a video from the Olympics,</v>

1818
00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it was last year where they showing long distance runners and all of</v>

1819
00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:40.910
<v Speaker 1>them had a different stride somewhere running ball foot or first summer running.</v>

1820
00:43:40.911 --> 00:43:43.820
<v Speaker 1>He'll first the winter it was different.</v>

1821
00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was also goes to all their bodies are different.</v>

1822
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:46.440
<v Speaker 1>They have different,</v>

1823
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:46.621
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1824
00:43:46.621 --> 00:43:47.431
<v Speaker 3>you can run,</v>

1825
00:43:47.431 --> 00:43:50.370
<v Speaker 3>he'll first with those shoes and you can get away with it for a long time.</v>

1826
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:50.581
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1827
00:43:50.581 --> 00:43:50.840
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1828
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.300
<v Speaker 3>the issue is that's not the way your body's designed and the only reason why</v>

1829
00:43:54.301 --> 00:43:56.250
<v Speaker 3>people are running like that's cause those fucking shoes,</v>

1830
00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:57.331
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1831
00:43:57.331 --> 00:43:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1832
00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:02.760
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to physiologists and people study anatomy and the loads and the</v>

1833
00:44:02.761 --> 00:44:03.430
<v Speaker 3>human nature,</v>

1834
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.600
<v Speaker 3>there's massive loads.</v>

1835
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.370
<v Speaker 3>There's massive problems with running.</v>

1836
00:44:08.371 --> 00:44:09.990
<v Speaker 3>He'll first just not,</v>

1837
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:10.291
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1838
00:44:10.291 --> 00:44:11.011
<v Speaker 3>you're not designed,</v>

1839
00:44:11.011 --> 00:44:11.450
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1840
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1841
00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:12.481
<v Speaker 1>I would say though,</v>

1842
00:44:12.481 --> 00:44:13.350
<v Speaker 1>just as a disclaimer,</v>

1843
00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:15.870
<v Speaker 1>the biggest problem for most people who were probably those doors,</v>

1844
00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you don't run it all.</v>

1845
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1846
00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:17.371
<v Speaker 1>That too.</v>

1847
00:44:17.371 --> 00:44:20.610
<v Speaker 1>So go ahead and get up to fucking ass and run and then figure out the exact</v>

1848
00:44:20.611 --> 00:44:21.331
<v Speaker 1>right technique later.</v>

1849
00:44:21.331 --> 00:44:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I remember when we trying to convince Bert that running on a treadmill is not</v>

1850
00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:25.290
<v Speaker 1>the same as running and he was like,</v>

1851
00:44:25.291 --> 00:44:25.771
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

1852
00:44:25.771 --> 00:44:26.760
<v Speaker 1>And they try real running.</v>

1853
00:44:26.761 --> 00:44:27.040
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1854
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.530
<v Speaker 1>no swollen charter dude.</v>

1855
00:44:28.531 --> 00:44:29.880
<v Speaker 1>It is so much harder.</v>

1856
00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Of course the fucking coming towards you.</v>

1857
00:44:32.221 --> 00:44:33.510
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is pick your legs up.</v>

1858
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:33.901
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1859
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:35.460
<v Speaker 1>it's way like for me anyway,</v>

1860
00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:40.020
<v Speaker 1>that I've noticed while running on actual ground versus burst pavement ground is</v>

1861
00:44:40.021 --> 00:44:41.890
<v Speaker 1>ways here oh ways on my joints.</v>

1862
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 1>So I can go longer.</v>

1863
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1864
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a Gig or something.</v>

1865
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:45.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like putting our core,</v>

1866
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:46.410
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

1867
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 1>you can run and pavement,</v>

1868
00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:48.340
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

1869
00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:49.540
<v Speaker 1>As long as you run up hill.</v>

1870
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1871
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1872
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Cause then it's,</v>

1873
00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:51.723
<v Speaker 1>then it's toto.</v>

1874
00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not just that,</v>

1875
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.520
<v Speaker 1>it's you just know pounding when you're running up hill because you're</v>

1876
00:44:56.521 --> 00:44:57.600
<v Speaker 1>decelerating.</v>

1877
00:44:57.601 --> 00:44:59.970
<v Speaker 1>As you catch yourself and you're pushing off.</v>

1878
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're doing lunges.</v>

1879
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.020
<v Speaker 1>The problem is not with pat is unless you're running in a Dali painting,</v>

1880
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.050
<v Speaker 1>then it's fucking impossible to keep running up hill.</v>

1881
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:07.621
<v Speaker 1>It's good point.</v>

1882
00:45:07.621 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Good reference to painting.</v>

1883
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I will not matter how many,</v>

1884
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:12.960
<v Speaker 1>how many Dolly Robinson's you have in this MMA podcast?</v>

1885
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Zero cause the first one ever.</v>

1886
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I Walk Downhill basically and then run uphill.</v>

1887
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1888
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I kind of,</v>

1889
00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1890
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean I go way slower.</v>

1891
00:45:22.351 --> 00:45:22.861
<v Speaker 1>Downhill.</v>

1892
00:45:22.861 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 1>It's just dangerous.</v>

1893
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It's bad for your joints.</v>

1894
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Pound like going downhill,</v>

1895
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.530
<v Speaker 1>like deceleration,</v>

1896
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:31.590
<v Speaker 1>like running downhill and catching yourself like that.</v>

1897
00:45:31.591 --> 00:45:32.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just not good.</v>

1898
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:34.260
<v Speaker 1>But the deceleration only when you,</v>

1899
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not even deceleration really,</v>

1900
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 1>but when you run up hill there's no pounding because you're,</v>

1901
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:42.780
<v Speaker 1>you're just reaching that area and then pushing.</v>

1902
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.070
<v Speaker 1>But it wears you out more.</v>

1903
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:45.210
<v Speaker 1>But like your muscles.</v>

1904
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:45.751
<v Speaker 1>But you're right,</v>

1905
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:46.210
<v Speaker 1>the Jordan's.</v>

1906
00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:46.441
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1907
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:47.380
<v Speaker 1>We were hiking the Alps.</v>

1908
00:45:47.381 --> 00:45:48.300
<v Speaker 1>This here in July</v>

1909
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.930
<v Speaker 1>and man there's uphills with like really have to push,</v>

1910
00:45:51.931 --> 00:45:53.820
<v Speaker 1>but the downhills like you're pushing off.</v>

1911
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1912
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.710
<v Speaker 1>and it's like it just hurts more.</v>

1913
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:59.580
<v Speaker 1>It hurts or quads beats up your knees to really beats up your knees.</v>

1914
00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I've found that a elk hunting too,</v>

1915
00:46:01.681 --> 00:46:04.320
<v Speaker 1>but the really the painful stuff was the downhill.</v>

1916
00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.000
<v Speaker 1>You're just stopping yourself,</v>

1917
00:46:06.001 --> 00:46:06.811
<v Speaker 1>stopping yourself,</v>

1918
00:46:06.811 --> 00:46:09.780
<v Speaker 1>stopping herself and then there's also a lot of sliding,</v>

1919
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:13.080
<v Speaker 1>almost like got to push a foot sideways to like go in that way.</v>

1920
00:46:13.081 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It's almost easier.</v>

1921
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1922
00:46:14.221 --> 00:46:15.900
<v Speaker 1>That's why they have such stiff shoes.</v>

1923
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 1>When those you don't like shoes,</v>

1924
00:46:17.971 --> 00:46:18.930
<v Speaker 1>you don't come over the edge,</v>

1925
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.720
<v Speaker 1>get an edge and you can dig that edge into the ground.</v>

1926
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I got some good luck boots for that and it was like really good.</v>

1927
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:25.620
<v Speaker 1>It makes a big difference.</v>

1928
00:46:25.621 --> 00:46:27.780
<v Speaker 1>I tried hiking with these minimal issues.</v>

1929
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.100
<v Speaker 1>This last trip that I was on,</v>

1930
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like him.</v>

1931
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a fan.</v>

1932
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:32.011
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1933
00:46:32.011 --> 00:46:34.200
<v Speaker 1>they're fine for running if I'm running on a trail.</v>

1934
00:46:34.201 --> 00:46:37.350
<v Speaker 1>But for hiking like the human body is just,</v>

1935
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.550
<v Speaker 1>we have bitch ass bodies a week with boots.</v>

1936
00:46:41.551 --> 00:46:44.370
<v Speaker 1>You want to be able to walk into a creek without having to worry about like</v>

1937
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:45.121
<v Speaker 1>there's going to soak my shoes,</v>

1938
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:46.260
<v Speaker 1>socks to the next four hours.</v>

1939
00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1940
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:47.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:50.430

1943
00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:51.420
<v Speaker 1>So after that fight,</v>

1944
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:52.440

2016
00:48:39.031 --> 00:48:43.950
<v Speaker 3>but most people think you should spar at like 60 to 70% maximum.</v>

2028
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:08.920
<v Speaker 5>Something like real dark,</v>

2029
00:49:08.921 --> 00:49:10.210
<v Speaker 5>just your comic friends and they're like,</v>

2030
00:49:10.211 --> 00:49:11.090
<v Speaker 5>you should do that on stage.</v>

2031
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.670
<v Speaker 5>It's like this challenge of like,</v>

2032
00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.370
<v Speaker 5>oh right you are.</v>

2033
00:49:14.371 --> 00:49:14.840
<v Speaker 5>He goes on</v>

2034
00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.050
<v Speaker 3>stage at the comedy connection in Faneuil Hall and he will,</v>

2035
00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:19.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the exact wording of it,</v>

2036
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:21.490
<v Speaker 3>but you were like a,</v>

2037
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:21.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2038
00:49:21.771 --> 00:49:24.960
<v Speaker 3>the problem with Boston is women are just really not that good looking.</v>

2039
00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:25.670
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2040
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:26.580
<v Speaker 3>and people like,</v>

2041
00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 5>I love that training it to now I can go after a crowd and just like,</v>

2042
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.130
<v Speaker 5>you can go with maybe you want,</v>

2043
00:49:35.131 --> 00:49:35.964
<v Speaker 5>I'm being honest,</v>

2044
00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:37.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2045
00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:37.621
<v Speaker 5>training.</v>

2046
00:49:37.621 --> 00:49:38.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2047
00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:38.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2048
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.740
<v Speaker 5>The way that you can see that in like a,</v>

2049
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:44.730
<v Speaker 5>in like a cat Williams when he's shitting on Michael Jackson when he was still a</v>

2050
00:49:44.731 --> 00:49:46.320
<v Speaker 5>hero and it was like boom.</v>

2051
00:49:46.321 --> 00:49:46.561
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

2052
00:49:46.561 --> 00:49:48.670
<v Speaker 5>fuck you children fescue.</v>

2053
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:49.650
<v Speaker 5>He's a molester.</v>

2054
00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.753
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2055
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:51.810
<v Speaker 5>That go right at them.</v>

2056
00:49:51.811 --> 00:49:53.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't care how you feel.</v>

2057
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.811
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2058
00:49:53.811 --> 00:49:54.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm justified in this.</v>

2059
00:49:54.811 --> 00:49:56.310
<v Speaker 5>Super justified with that.</v>

2060
00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:56.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2061
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was just some xy.</v>

2062
00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:00.150
<v Speaker 5>Boston women are disgusting.</v>

2063
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.470
<v Speaker 5>Even if they're good looking,</v>

2064
00:50:01.471 --> 00:50:02.670
<v Speaker 5>they're voices are garbage.</v>

2065
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:08.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck me and my pussy fucking Quia.</v>

2066
00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.073
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2067
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:13.300
<v Speaker 3>those were fun times too,</v>

2068
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:13.491
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2069
00:50:13.491 --> 00:50:16.000
<v Speaker 3>because when we first started going on the road together,</v>

2070
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.700
<v Speaker 3>like one of the more fun things was,</v>

2071
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2072
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.260
<v Speaker 3>you was really fun hanging out and doing shows,</v>

2073
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.850
<v Speaker 3>but it was also fun saying like,</v>

2074
00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:26.080
<v Speaker 3>you can't get fired.</v>

2075
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:26.850
<v Speaker 3>Kicked out.</v>

2076
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Did,</v>

2077
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 3>was such an influential</v>

2078
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.461
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2079
00:50:28.461 --> 00:50:31.130
<v Speaker 5>I stand up that specifically where it was like,</v>

2080
00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:34.700
<v Speaker 5>we're at the hotel five minute walk from Faneuil hall and you're like,</v>

2081
00:50:34.701 --> 00:50:35.534
<v Speaker 5>let's get high.</v>

2082
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:36.111
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2083
00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:36.311
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

2084
00:50:36.311 --> 00:50:39.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm about four months crazy kick at high right now.</v>

2085
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:41.660
<v Speaker 5>That's what I had been high 20 times maybe.</v>

2086
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:43.543
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

2087
00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:44.300
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

2088
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:44.541
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2089
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 5>because I won't do good.</v>

2090
00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:45.980
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

2091
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.060
<v Speaker 5>so I'm like,</v>

2092
00:50:47.061 --> 00:50:47.421
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean?</v>

2093
00:50:47.421 --> 00:50:48.254
<v Speaker 5>So he goes,</v>

2094
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.093
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2095
00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.570
<v Speaker 5>but then he goes,</v>

2096
00:50:50.571 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 5>you won't get fired.</v>

2097
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:52.160
<v Speaker 5>They didn't hire you.</v>

2098
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:53.181
<v Speaker 5>You can't play here.</v>

2099
00:50:53.181 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 5>It's 450 seats.</v>

2100
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.980
<v Speaker 5>And also like it because it's too far for you to go to feature and you just way</v>

2101
00:50:57.981 --> 00:50:58.970
<v Speaker 5>too big for you to headline.</v>

2102
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.750
<v Speaker 5>So I'm hiring you and I don't care if you get too fucked up.</v>

2103
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 5>So smoked pot.</v>

2104
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.840
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

2105
00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:05.673
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2106
00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:07.630
<v Speaker 3>why don't you to feel free?</v>

2107
00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:12.631
<v Speaker 3>And that there's these moments when you get high and you go on stage where,</v>

2108
00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:13.960
<v Speaker 3>and they don't always happen,</v>

2109
00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:19.110
<v Speaker 3>but there are moments where you take a right turn into brilliant Ville and that</v>

2110
00:51:20.711 --> 00:51:22.210
<v Speaker 3>right turn doesn't exist.</v>

2111
00:51:22.211 --> 00:51:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes if you're sober,</v>

2112
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.191
<v Speaker 3>you're sober,</v>

2113
00:51:24.191 --> 00:51:25.210
<v Speaker 3>you'll stick to the script.</v>

2114
00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.380
<v Speaker 3>But if you're high,</v>

2115
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:27.250
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2116
00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.260
<v Speaker 3>so what if I did fuck my dog?</v>

2117
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:30.953
<v Speaker 3>Let's try,</v>

2118
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:32.023
<v Speaker 3>let's try this for a while.</v>

2119
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:37.230
<v Speaker 3>How to know where you might come up with this premise or this tagline or this</v>

2120
00:51:37.271 --> 00:51:40.330
<v Speaker 3>thing that comes from you being in this altered state of conscious.</v>

2121
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2122
00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:41.510
<v Speaker 5>And you can't do it.</v>

2123
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:42.680
<v Speaker 5>Any comic listening,</v>

2124
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:45.260
<v Speaker 5>I would not advise you doing it on a big showcase.</v>

2125
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:48.200
<v Speaker 5>We have to show like William Marsh and Mclennan or when you're taping something</v>

2126
00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:49.010
<v Speaker 5>where it's important,</v>

2127
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.610
<v Speaker 5>but for workout sets when you're really just trying to get work out of this.</v>

2128
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:53.893
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2129
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.441
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2130
00:51:54.441 --> 00:51:55.190
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2131
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.510
<v Speaker 5>and back then I could get hot.</v>

2132
00:51:56.511 --> 00:51:57.261
<v Speaker 5>Now you and I,</v>

2133
00:51:57.261 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 5>we get high for a couple hours,</v>

2134
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2135
00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.820
<v Speaker 5>maybe then I was high for nine hours.</v>

2136
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:03.740
<v Speaker 5>I smoked three hits.</v>

2137
00:52:03.741 --> 00:52:04.574
<v Speaker 5>There was no like,</v>

2138
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.360
<v Speaker 5>so anyway,</v>

2139
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.460
<v Speaker 5>we had two sets at night or Friday or Saturday night.</v>

2140
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:08.683
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2141
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.000
<v Speaker 5>the first set was awful.</v>

2142
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.470
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2143
00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:13.130
<v Speaker 5>I forgot what I was saying.</v>

2144
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:15.350
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea where I was going.</v>

2145
00:52:15.351 --> 00:52:15.690
<v Speaker 5>I remember,</v>

2146
00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:16.523
<v Speaker 5>isn't that bad?</v>

2147
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:17.450
<v Speaker 5>I was bad.</v>

2148
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:17.581
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2149
00:52:17.581 --> 00:52:17.661
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2150
00:52:17.661 --> 00:52:17.781
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2151
00:52:17.781 --> 00:52:19.220
<v Speaker 5>Parts of it were really far to have it.</v>

2152
00:52:19.221 --> 00:52:19.700
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2153
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.090
<v Speaker 5>But then by the second set now,</v>

2154
00:52:21.091 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 5>then you went on for an hour,</v>

2155
00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:25.130
<v Speaker 5>then we had a half hour break and then want to again by then I come down a</v>

2156
00:52:25.131 --> 00:52:25.581
<v Speaker 5>little bit.</v>

2157
00:52:25.581 --> 00:52:27.440
<v Speaker 5>And the second set was what you were talking about.</v>

2158
00:52:27.441 --> 00:52:29.450
<v Speaker 5>Free flowing.</v>

2159
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Get high about an hour and a half before you go onstage.</v>

2160
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Not like right before I fucked up and got a high right before.</v>

2161
00:52:36.651 --> 00:52:37.460
<v Speaker 3>That's not,</v>

2162
00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:38.300
<v Speaker 3>that's not wise.</v>

2163
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.141
<v Speaker 3>What's wise,</v>

2164
00:52:39.141 --> 00:52:39.580
<v Speaker 3>isn't it</v>

2165
00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:40.390
<v Speaker 5>on your way down.</v>

2166
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.390
<v Speaker 5>You already know where it's gone and now you're coasting.</v>

2167
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:44.350
<v Speaker 5>You know what Edgar would do medic or we're due for a while.</v>

2168
00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:47.800
<v Speaker 5>He would go on late at the comedy store and he wouldn't get high off that.</v>

2169
00:52:47.801 --> 00:52:47.921
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2170
00:52:47.921 --> 00:52:49.930
<v Speaker 5>your first hit of the day is like your biggest one.</v>

2171
00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:51.183
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

2172
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.450
<v Speaker 5>cigarette smokers have the suits.</v>

2173
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.271
<v Speaker 5>Only time you get a buzz,</v>

2174
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:55.130
<v Speaker 5>that first cigarette you know it,</v>

2175
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:56.800
<v Speaker 5>but your first we'd hit,</v>

2176
00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:57.663
<v Speaker 5>it's the biggest one.</v>

2177
00:52:57.970 --> 00:52:59.170
<v Speaker 5>He wouldn't smoke all day.</v>

2178
00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:01.000
<v Speaker 5>He'd have a 12:15 AM spot.</v>

2179
00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:02.080
<v Speaker 5>And when they go,</v>

2180
00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:02.501
<v Speaker 5>Hey Matt,</v>

2181
00:53:02.501 --> 00:53:03.400
<v Speaker 5>we're letting the Tony,</v>

2182
00:53:03.401 --> 00:53:03.701
<v Speaker 5>he'd go,</v>

2183
00:53:03.701 --> 00:53:04.240
<v Speaker 5>cool,</v>

2184
00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.073

2185
00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.070
<v Speaker 5>smoke a bunch.</v>

2186
00:53:06.071 --> 00:53:08.440
<v Speaker 5>And that three minutes and then go on stage.</v>

2187
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.900
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>

2188
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:09.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2189
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.770
<v Speaker 5>and he'd be going up and feeling it while he's off.</v>

2190
00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.690
<v Speaker 5>Like it wouldn't even hit him until he's two minutes on.</v>

2191
00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.553
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus.</v>

2192
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:16.240
<v Speaker 5>He did that for like six months.</v>

2193
00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:18.270
<v Speaker 3>Be Good if you had notes.</v>

2194
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2195
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:21.540
<v Speaker 3>And if you followed what you talked about already.</v>

2196
00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:24.750
<v Speaker 5>That's what I tell them when they play Clandestina or comedy underground,</v>

2197
00:53:24.751 --> 00:53:25.710
<v Speaker 5>they call and Toronto.</v>

2198
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2199
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.060
<v Speaker 1>That place is crazy.</v>

2200
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2201
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.681
<v Speaker 1>any advice?</v>

2202
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2203
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.450
<v Speaker 1>my advice is bring a set list.</v>

2204
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I normally don't say that,</v>

2205
00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:34.410
<v Speaker 1>but this is one you will lose your place.</v>

2206
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:36.630
<v Speaker 1>There was no air in that room.</v>

2207
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:41.631
<v Speaker 1>Once green is only pot like you were breathing pot and exhaling pot.</v>

2208
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.810
<v Speaker 1>It was all pot.</v>

2209
00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.040
<v Speaker 1>My Buddy Minola so he was like,</v>

2210
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:44.611
<v Speaker 1>I don't smoke.</v>

2211
00:53:44.611 --> 00:53:46.230
<v Speaker 1>And then he's in the back for 20 minutes.</v>

2212
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Like two of them high shit.</v>

2213
00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2214
00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Tripoli.</v>

2215
00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Tripoli wasn't getting high back then and yes you are standing.</v>

2216
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.210
<v Speaker 1>He was barbecued.</v>

2217
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.550
<v Speaker 1>That's where I started to believe secondhand smoke is a real thing.</v>

2218
00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it was until then.</v>

2219
00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:00.190
<v Speaker 1>People that don't think it's real,</v>

2220
00:54:00.191 --> 00:54:00.481
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

2221
00:54:00.481 --> 00:54:01.990
<v Speaker 1>When we used to mock tape cause take,</v>

2222
00:54:01.991 --> 00:54:04.470
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to get high and we would just smoke pot and Tate would have to stick</v>

2223
00:54:04.471 --> 00:54:05.970
<v Speaker 1>his head out the window like an ostrich.</v>

2224
00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I feel like what the fuck is wrong with her?</v>

2225
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:12.210
<v Speaker 1>He was worried and you want to get hotboxing if that's when we used to get vans.</v>

2226
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Remember we used to get vans for awhile?</v>

2227
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Conversion vans.</v>

2228
00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2229
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.400
<v Speaker 1>We would rent vans because it was so many of us.</v>

2230
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:19.063
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

2231
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2232
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.970
<v Speaker 1>We would entourage it and red van would film it.</v>

2233
00:54:23.971 --> 00:54:26.490
<v Speaker 1>We would just have shenanigans and every time we went to</v>

2234
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:28.890
<v Speaker 1>you of course.</v>

2235
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 1>And then Eddie Tate and red band as the non comedians and then me and Duncan or</v>

2236
00:54:33.931 --> 00:54:35.940
<v Speaker 1>me and dia or whatever.</v>

2237
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2238
00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 1>there was a shitload of us.</v>

2239
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:38.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2240
00:54:38.641 --> 00:54:39.121
<v Speaker 1>So five,</v>

2241
00:54:39.121 --> 00:54:41.370
<v Speaker 1>six people and then we would feast.</v>

2242
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.800
<v Speaker 1>We'd go to these fucking amazing restaurants.</v>

2243
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Fogo a lot.</v>

2244
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:46.350
<v Speaker 1>We went to a lot of photos.</v>

2245
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:47.700
<v Speaker 1>It brings me back to one of my memories,</v>

2246
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was Cincinnati was nearby.</v>

2247
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Right near the hotel.</v>

2248
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you want us to Korea?</v>

2249
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2250
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:55.020
<v Speaker 1>right across the street.</v>

2251
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2252
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And a as relieving fucking newly a botox.</v>

2253
00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:00.363
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2254
00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I came in and like,</v>

2255
00:55:01.501 --> 00:55:01.681
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2256
00:55:01.681 --> 00:55:03.840
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking Vandelay and he was,</v>

2257
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:07.520
<v Speaker 1>he was the most fierce pregame fighter.</v>

2258
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:08.430
<v Speaker 1>The way he'd look at you like,</v>

2259
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I want to kill you for taking this flight.</v>

2260
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was scary that him and his prime cro cop was scary because he would just</v>

2261
00:55:13.861 --> 00:55:14.820
<v Speaker 1>be so calm.</v>

2262
00:55:14.821 --> 00:55:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't care what do this cop stared him down more than anybody ever stared</v>

2263
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:20.003
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay town.</v>

2264
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:20.780
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't break,</v>

2265
00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:21.181
<v Speaker 1>it could move.</v>

2266
00:55:21.181 --> 00:55:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Cro Cop was a straight up killer,</v>

2267
00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Croatian Croatian antiterrorist squad.</v>

2268
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:31.260
<v Speaker 1>They begged for mercy and I've showed them and he's a world class kickboxer like</v>

2269
00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:34.890
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't afraid of Vandelay strike and he was a heavyweight and Vandelay really</v>

2270
00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:35.724
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a heavyweight.</v>

2271
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.350
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

2272
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:38.820
<v Speaker 1>we saw him checking in and we went to eat.</v>

2273
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.610
<v Speaker 1>He was in that true husker Rhea 15 minutes late.</v>

2274
00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Like he threw his shit down and came in.</v>

2275
00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.080
<v Speaker 1>They were like so excited about it.</v>

2276
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:45.301
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2277
00:55:45.301 --> 00:55:46.134
<v Speaker 1>look at Cro cop.</v>

2278
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:47.063
<v Speaker 1>Wow</v>

2279
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:49.733
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2280
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's stared down.</v>

2281
00:55:51.301 --> 00:55:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Cro Cop back then,</v>

2282
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:55.990
<v Speaker 1>that was when cro cop was at the peak was Japanese got going through his routine</v>

2283
00:55:55.991 --> 00:55:56.824
<v Speaker 1>and it's like fuck.</v>

2284
00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.160
<v Speaker 1>And I'm pretty sure this was before,</v>

2285
00:55:59.220 --> 00:55:59.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2286
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Cro cop really had sort of mastered MMA.</v>

2287
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.180
<v Speaker 1>He was coming over as a straight kickboxer and they had different rules for him.</v>

2288
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:10.350
<v Speaker 1>The rules for Cro cop where like you can only fight on the ground for like 30</v>

2289
00:56:10.351 --> 00:56:14.250
<v Speaker 1>seconds they had and if the fight went to a distance it would be a draw.</v>

2290
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2291
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:20.330
<v Speaker 1>because he really didn't have a lot of experience with take down defense or any</v>

2292
00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:21.810
<v Speaker 1>MMA fighting back then.</v>

2293
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.070
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

2294
00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:23.950
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get botox.</v>

2295
00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

2296
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.140
<v Speaker 3>had his face reconstructed cause his nose,</v>

2297
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.670
<v Speaker 3>he had been in so many brawls,</v>

2298
00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 3>his nose had completely flattened where he couldn't breathe out of it and he had</v>

2299
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:34.900
<v Speaker 3>so much scar tissue over his eyes that his eyes were drooping down.</v>

2300
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.910
<v Speaker 3>So He'd get cut instantly.</v>

2301
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Any,</v>

2302
00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:39.760
<v Speaker 3>any punched him would hit him with open them up like a gas.</v>

2303
00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:42.270
<v Speaker 3>And he and his nose was completely flat.</v>

2304
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:47.200
<v Speaker 3>So they took a chunk of his rib and rebuilt his nose and he had his nose built</v>

2305
00:56:47.201 --> 00:56:49.090
<v Speaker 3>big so he could breathe out of it more.</v>

2306
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:53.320
<v Speaker 3>And then he had all the scar tissue from his eyebrows and then pull back.</v>

2307
00:56:53.321 --> 00:56:54.460
<v Speaker 3>And according to Dana,</v>

2308
00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:54.880
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2309
00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:55.481
<v Speaker 3>but the is like,</v>

2310
00:56:55.481 --> 00:56:55.721
<v Speaker 3>it got,</v>

2311
00:56:55.721 --> 00:56:59.100
<v Speaker 3>it's done in Brazil on the cheap and it's just like wasn't,</v>

2312
00:56:59.340 --> 00:56:59.860
<v Speaker 3>it didn't,</v>

2313
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.360
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really make them look like Vander.</v>

2314
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2315
00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:04.570
<v Speaker 3>So he went from Vandelay Silva.</v>

2316
00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:09.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like Vandelay Silva has the most profound facial form change in all of MMA</v>

2317
00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.510
<v Speaker 3>because he went from pretty,</v>

2318
00:57:13.511 --> 00:57:14.344
<v Speaker 3>if go back,</v>

2319
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:19.430
<v Speaker 3>because I ended up Silva Vandelay Silva versus go to Vandelay Silva versus Dan</v>

2320
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Henderson one.</v>

2321
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:23.350
<v Speaker 3>When they first fought in pride,</v>

2322
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.010
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2323
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:25.060
<v Speaker 3>he was a normal,</v>

2324
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.560
<v Speaker 3>actually pretty good looking guy,</v>

2325
00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.330
<v Speaker 3>like regular good looking guy.</v>

2326
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:30.430
<v Speaker 3>And then by the time he left pride,</v>

2327
00:57:30.431 --> 00:57:32.200
<v Speaker 3>his face was just smashed in.</v>

2328
00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.730
<v Speaker 3>By the time he fought chocolate Dell,</v>

2329
00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.380
<v Speaker 3>his face was just smashed in.</v>

2330
00:57:35.381 --> 00:57:37.600
<v Speaker 3>His nose had been literally flattened.</v>

2331
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2332
00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 3>For from punches and kicks and not just from fights,</v>

2333
00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:42.250
<v Speaker 3>but also from training.</v>

2334
00:57:42.251 --> 00:57:45.580
<v Speaker 3>The training that he did it shoot to box and karate.</v>

2335
00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:47.150
<v Speaker 3>Ba was legendary.</v>

2336
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 3>It was fucked up.</v>

2337
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:49.234
<v Speaker 3>Fucked up.</v>

2338
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:51.070
<v Speaker 3>That also okay would bring me to another thing.</v>

2339
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.570
<v Speaker 3>We got to go to Brazil one time.</v>

2340
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:54.130
<v Speaker 3>We didn't do a show that time,</v>

2341
00:57:54.131 --> 00:57:58.210
<v Speaker 3>but that's him versus Dan Henderson can make that a little bigger.</v>

2342
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:59.260
<v Speaker 3>So you could see.</v>

2343
00:57:59.260 --> 00:57:59.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2344
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:00.880
<v Speaker 3>super normal kid.</v>

2345
00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Just a normal combat ass.</v>

2346
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:04.600
<v Speaker 3>That was the first fight.</v>

2347
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Oil fought Dan Henderson Chin look like it was drawn on.</v>

2348
00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Guys got him hooked.</v>

2349
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Somebody fucked up.</v>

2350
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:11.000
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2351
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.100
<v Speaker 3>He's drawing a bone,</v>

2352
00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 3>which I let him let him see that picture of annually above that with the eye all</v>

2353
00:58:16.331 --> 00:58:17.080
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

2354
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.340
<v Speaker 3>That was him from that fight.</v>

2355
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2356
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:22.140
<v Speaker 3>And Henderson connected with a haymaker of her right hand and fucked up his up.</v>

2357
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Smile on that.</v>

2358
00:58:23.441 --> 00:58:24.274
<v Speaker 3>Like look at this bad.</v>

2359
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.700
<v Speaker 3>Look at this cool picture on by the tick.</v>

2360
00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:29.800
<v Speaker 3>But you mean look at vandelays face there in comparison to his face later on his</v>

2361
00:58:29.801 --> 00:58:30.400
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>

2362
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Totally different.</v>

2363
00:58:31.271 --> 00:58:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Dan Henderson looks exactly the same.</v>

2364
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:35.740
<v Speaker 3>He looks like the same guy.</v>

2365
00:58:35.741 --> 00:58:37.180
<v Speaker 3>He's just an other version.</v>

2366
00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:39.400
<v Speaker 3>He might be one of the toughest guys ever lived.</v>

2367
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.300
<v Speaker 3>So tough.</v>

2368
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:40.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2369
00:58:40.991 --> 00:58:45.991
<v Speaker 3>Dan is just a fucking picture up there with the tattoos and the shoulders go to</v>

2370
00:58:46.061 --> 00:58:46.690
<v Speaker 3>that one.</v>

2371
00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Now that's him after facial reconstruction,</v>

2372
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:52.840
<v Speaker 3>make that larger c that's after the facial reconstruction has settled in,</v>

2373
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:53.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2374
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:57.090
<v Speaker 3>or we saw him right then and he just fought real recently,</v>

2375
00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:57.940
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weeks ago.</v>

2376
00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.430
<v Speaker 3>He's still fighting gun knocked out by rampage.</v>

2377
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Rampage flatline them.</v>

2378
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2379
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:03.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2380
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Pages still fun to Yup.</v>

2381
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.630
<v Speaker 3>Rampage still carries that power.</v>

2382
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:12.631
<v Speaker 3>That was when he KOD rampage Kao to him in the UFC with and knocking him through</v>

2383
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:16.600
<v Speaker 3>the ring through the pride was one of the coolest.</v>

2384
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:17.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2385
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:18.220
<v Speaker 3>I saw that later.</v>

2386
00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:18.461
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2387
00:59:18.461 --> 00:59:18.700
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2388
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:19.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2389
00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 3>way later I come to the UFC and it's like all these highlights,</v>

2390
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.790
<v Speaker 2>this backlog of highlights of MMA mile,</v>

2391
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 2>especially if the UFC purchase price.</v>

2392
00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:27.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2393
00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Rio was really cool.</v>

2394
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2395
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:32.151
<v Speaker 2>It's a place to go.</v>

2396
00:59:32.151 --> 00:59:35.570
<v Speaker 2>And actually that fight that in terms of the audience response,</v>

2397
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:40.730
<v Speaker 2>the two biggest ones were Sylvia couture in Columbus.</v>

2398
00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.200
<v Speaker 2>First time they'd ever been in Columbus.</v>

2399
00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:45.560
<v Speaker 2>And that real fight Josie Aldo versus,</v>

2400
00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:45.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2401
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.120
<v Speaker 2>that was a Chad Mendez,</v>

2402
00:59:47.121 --> 00:59:47.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2403
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.433
<v Speaker 2>Which one?</v>

2404
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:49.431
<v Speaker 2>The one in Brazil,</v>

2405
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:50.150
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

2406
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:51.380
<v Speaker 2>It was a spinning back kick.</v>

2407
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:51.981
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2408
00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:52.761
<v Speaker 2>that was Terry.</v>

2409
00:59:52.761 --> 00:59:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Adam versus a Edson Barboza dude from day from fight,</v>

2410
00:59:56.541 --> 01:00:00.110
<v Speaker 2>one of the undercard the place was so that you could feel it shaking.</v>

2411
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:03.320
<v Speaker 2>And I remember them chanting something in the crowd.</v>

2412
01:00:03.321 --> 01:00:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Cause Dana did smart.</v>

2413
01:00:04.161 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 2>There's one of the first like foreign ones and he made a Brazilian fighter on</v>

2414
01:00:07.161 --> 01:00:07.994
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

2415
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:08.833
<v Speaker 2>on every fight.</v>

2416
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.530
<v Speaker 2>He fucked up a little by having a couple of times Brazilian verse Brazilian,</v>

2417
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.500
<v Speaker 2>but at every fight and they were chanting something in the audience.</v>

2418
01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2419
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:16.761

2420
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:17.600
<v Speaker 2>you go to the translator,</v>

2421
01:00:17.601 --> 01:00:19.800
<v Speaker 2>like what are they saying you're going to die?</v>

2422
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:20.210
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2423
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:21.320
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

2424

2430
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:28.551
<v Speaker 2>And I believed it.</v>

2431
01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Like we've got to figure out how we're gonna get Chelsea on and out of here.</v>

2432
01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.491
<v Speaker 2>Fights Anderson here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2441
01:00:34.971 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 2>they're fiercely,</v>

2442
01:00:36.201 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 2>fiercely nationalistic.</v>

2443
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:39.210
<v Speaker 2>And also that's where I'm at.</v>

2444
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Started.</v>

2445
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:40.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2446
01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:43.420
<v Speaker 6>MMA martial arts started in the Orient.</v>

2447
01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.920
<v Speaker 6>They started in Japan and China and,</v>

2448
01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.130
<v Speaker 6>but in terms of like legitimate,</v>

2449
01:00:48.131 --> 01:00:51.010
<v Speaker 6>mixed martial arts valley to though those no rules,</v>

2450
01:00:51.011 --> 01:00:51.730
<v Speaker 6>fights,</v>

2451

2453
01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.420
<v Speaker 6>Brazil changed Jujitsu.</v>

2454
01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.340
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2455
01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.710
<v Speaker 2>you leave the airport and they're these giant,</v>

2456
01:00:58.810 --> 01:00:59.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2457
01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.900
<v Speaker 2>like Jujitsu guys in,</v>

2458
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:04.860
<v Speaker 2>he's like looking at each other like it's part of their organization culture.</v>

2459
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:06.630
<v Speaker 6>It's huge over there.</v>

2460
01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:07.501
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2461
01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:11.490
<v Speaker 6>I had on a Rafael Lovato who's like one of the top Brazilian Jujitsu fighters in</v>

2462
01:01:11.491 --> 01:01:13.590
<v Speaker 6>the world who fights for Bela Tarr now,</v>

2463
01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:16.470
<v Speaker 6>and he's actually an American from Oklahoma at fights,</v>

2464
01:01:16.471 --> 01:01:17.070
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2465
01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:17.371
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2466
01:01:17.371 --> 01:01:19.310
<v Speaker 6>and really represents Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

2467
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:21.270
<v Speaker 6>But he was saying that like,</v>

2468
01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:23.280
<v Speaker 6>for the longest time,</v>

2469
01:01:23.281 --> 01:01:25.650
<v Speaker 6>the Brazilians dominated the world championships.</v>

2470
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:28.620
<v Speaker 6>He was one of the first Americans to win a gold medal in the world</v>

2471
01:01:28.621 --> 01:01:29.454
<v Speaker 6>championships.</v>

2472
01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:30.720
<v Speaker 6>But for the longest time,</v>

2473
01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:32.030
<v Speaker 6>like even to this shame,</v>

2474
01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:36.120
<v Speaker 6>the Brazilian still have a disproportionate number of gold medalist.</v>

2475
01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2476
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2477
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:40.020
<v Speaker 2>It's huge part of the culture and they're so proud,</v>

2478
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:40.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2479
01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.753
<v Speaker 2>so proud.</v>

2480
01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:43.230
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the coolest places I've ever been through.</v>

2481
01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.640
<v Speaker 2>I remember also when we went to</v>

2482
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Australia to Sydney and uh,</v>

2483
01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:51.990
<v Speaker 2>we did do a show that we did two shows.</v>

2484
01:01:51.991 --> 01:01:52.800
<v Speaker 2>That was cool.</v>

2485
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:53.633
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2486
01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:58.350
<v Speaker 2>it was in your contract FirstClass companion ticket way before we were ever</v>

2487
01:01:58.351 --> 01:01:59.700
<v Speaker 2>going to go to Australia for that.</v>

2488
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.740
<v Speaker 2>And then it was just as a UFC grew,</v>

2489
01:02:01.741 --> 01:02:02.910
<v Speaker 2>which is grandfathered in.</v>

2490
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:07.200
<v Speaker 2>And so I remember Dana coming up to me half joking and half serious,</v>

2491
01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:07.920
<v Speaker 2>just going,</v>

2492
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.180
<v Speaker 2>do you know how much I fucking ticket cost?</v>

2493
01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.221
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2494
01:02:11.221 --> 01:02:11.670
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2495
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:12.690

2496
01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:13.020
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2497
01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.580
<v Speaker 2>that's how much I'm paying for you to go to Australia.</v>

2498
01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:17.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2499
01:02:17.071 --> 01:02:18.050
<v Speaker 2>those were good times.</v>

2500
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:19.501
<v Speaker 2>I almost want to like,</v>

2501

<v Speaker 1>I could use the money.</v>

2504
01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:23.911
<v Speaker 1>I'll split the difference.</v>

2505
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Don't suffer for 14 hours for 12 grand.</v>

2506
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:28.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2507
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:29.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:29.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2509
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Those are like apartments.</v>

2510
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.560
<v Speaker 1>If like a little apartment.</v>

2511
01:02:31.561 --> 01:02:32.394
<v Speaker 1>I was so proud.</v>

2512
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:33.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2513
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a girl told me he brought him the year before and he was like,</v>

2514
01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:36.661
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2515
01:02:36.661 --> 01:02:37.081
<v Speaker 1>get ready.</v>

2516
01:02:37.081 --> 01:02:37.861
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be so good.</v>

2517
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>They give you socks that I jerked off into</v>

2518
01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>such a fucking cool grand experience.</v>

2519
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2520
01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:46.150
<v Speaker 1>you can do a lot of fucking UFC live,</v>

2521
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2522
01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>

2523
01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.020
<v Speaker 1>let's just talk about Anderson for a cause.</v>

2524
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>I believe my very first UFC was at the Pearl.</v>

2525
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.311
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2526
01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:54.050
<v Speaker 1>At the palms.</v>

2527
01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Anderson Bearse.</v>

2528
01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Chris Leeman.</v>

2529
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:56.431
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2530
01:02:56.431 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>It was fun fight.</v>

2531
01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2532
01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess Anderson,</v>

2533
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>I might've been his first fight in the UFC was okay.</v>

2534
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>And people were like,</v>

2535
01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:02.941
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2536
01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:04.530
<v Speaker 1>he's highly touted but not crazy.</v>

2537
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Like he's the best.</v>

2538
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Just like I knew who he was and I was telling everybody like whatever the</v>

2539
01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:11.191
<v Speaker 1>betting line is,</v>

2540
01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:12.024
<v Speaker 1>it's off.</v>

2541
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:13.410
<v Speaker 1>You told me that on um,</v>

2542
01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:13.741
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2543
01:03:13.741 --> 01:03:14.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2544
01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.750
<v Speaker 1>fuck Glover to sharer.</v>

2545
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2546
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:16.441
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2547
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:16.710
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>

2548
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:17.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't really tell you.</v>

2549
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Go fucking take money on this.</v>

2550
01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Put all the money.</v>

2551
01:03:19.891 --> 01:03:22.770
<v Speaker 1>He was home early in the undercard Glover foot.</v>

2552
01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Kyle Kingsbury,</v>

2553
01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 1>just like people don't know.</v>

2554
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:26.641
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2555
01:03:26.641 --> 01:03:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Glover,</v>

2556
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.391
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2557
01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:27.751
<v Speaker 1>what's the line?</v>

2558
01:03:27.751 --> 01:03:28.020
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>

2559
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter to her.</v>

2560
01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.600
<v Speaker 1>He'll when he got a rough deal man,</v>

2561
01:03:30.601 --> 01:03:35.070
<v Speaker 1>because he couldn't get a visa to fight in the UFC for a loan for six fucking</v>

2562
01:03:35.071 --> 01:03:35.730
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2563
01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:36.541
<v Speaker 1>For six years.</v>

2564
01:03:36.541 --> 01:03:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Glover had a toil and other countries,</v>

2565
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.740
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the best ever.</v>

2566
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.440
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking phenomenal back then man.</v>

2567
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

2568
01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:44.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2569
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:47.700
<v Speaker 1>when we got them in the UFC was at the tail end of his greatness.</v>

2570
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

2571
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think we never really got a chance to see glow over at his very best in</v>

2572
01:03:52.591 --> 01:03:53.424
<v Speaker 1>the UFC.</v>

2573
01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.800
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like a Jackie Robinson.</v>

2574
01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Like what were the steps would have been if he could have played his whole</v>

2575
01:03:56.821 --> 01:03:57.654
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

2576
01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.130
<v Speaker 1>it's euro or something like that.</v>

2577
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:01.140
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those guys that,</v>

2578
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:01.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2579
01:04:01.531 --> 01:04:02.400
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he fought,</v>

2580
01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:03.234
<v Speaker 1>so could you,</v>

2581
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:03.871
<v Speaker 1>he fought.</v>

2582
01:04:03.871 --> 01:04:04.441
<v Speaker 1>So could you,</v>

2583
01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in the dubby c and the early days of the WEC when it was in</v>

2584
01:04:09.061 --> 01:04:14.061
<v Speaker 1>northern California and he was a chocolate Dell sparring partner and it was one</v>

2585
01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:18.960
<v Speaker 1>of the rare times that he got to fight in the U S and I remember watching him</v>

2586
01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:20.480
<v Speaker 1>fight and I would hear about them.</v>

2587
01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I think Hackman told me about him too because he was training with chuck and I</v>

2588
01:04:23.521 --> 01:04:23.731
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

2589
01:04:23.731 --> 01:04:25.590
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a mother fucker.</v>

2590
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:27.150
<v Speaker 1>He is so good.</v>

2591
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:29.100
<v Speaker 1>He was so solid and he was like,</v>

2592
01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:29.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2593
01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:33.480
<v Speaker 1>training with Hackleman and training with Chuck Liddell in the early days when</v>

2594
01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:34.740
<v Speaker 1>you know they're just savages,</v>

2595
01:04:34.741 --> 01:04:35.461
<v Speaker 1>man and his,</v>

2596
01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:36.540
<v Speaker 1>he had wrestling too.</v>

2597
01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:38.580
<v Speaker 1>There was one thing that a lot of Brazilians didn't have.</v>

2598
01:04:38.581 --> 01:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>They were more Jujitsu oriented and he was a wrestler as well.</v>

2599
01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:42.383
<v Speaker 1>There was Bob Ballou.</v>

2600
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Lou had a real good wrestling base too,</v>

2601
01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>and that was the first guy I remember making money by leaving the UFC.</v>

2602
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.440
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the straight guys.</v>

2603
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll get paid as a UFC vet.</v>

2604
01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I have a name and I'll get paid a bunch off this fucking chuck fight,</v>

2605
01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2606
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll get paid a bunch of the rest of my career until everybody started going.</v>

2607
01:04:58.381 --> 01:04:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>

2608
01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't worth that much anymore to be a form of Europe's force opened up.</v>

2609
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2610
01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:05.160
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people realize that there was like,</v>

2611
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.920
<v Speaker 1>there was a legitimate venue and they weren't showtime.</v>

2612
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Strikeforce was on showtime.</v>

2613
01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2614
01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:12.630
<v Speaker 1>You mean when Kimbo fought there?</v>

2615
01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean it all of a sudden it was a big fucking deal.</v>

2616
01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:17.040
<v Speaker 1>That was a lead XC let the chick that went on to uh,</v>

2617
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.913
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>

2618
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Gina Carano and they would like make ms people and that's actually where you've</v>

2619
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>heard about Cyborg.</v>

2620
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2621
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

2622
01:05:23.530 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2623
01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:24.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2624
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:26.560
<v Speaker 1>There was like a lead XC and that.</v>

2625
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:27.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2626
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:28.631
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2627
01:05:28.631 --> 01:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2628
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:29.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2629
01:05:29.651 --> 01:05:30.401
<v Speaker 1>and strike force,</v>

2630
01:05:30.401 --> 01:05:34.840
<v Speaker 1>those were two legit venues outside the UFC that really kind of,</v>

2631
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>because the UFC wasn't as big back then.</v>

2632
01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2633
01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.820
<v Speaker 1>And then they were pretty legit and there were more men,</v>

2634
01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.441
<v Speaker 1>you could get it,</v>

2635
01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have to pay per view it.</v>

2636
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2637
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>You could actually just watch him,</v>

2638
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>which is what Bellah tour has going for it too.</v>

2639
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>But now Bella is on that new thing.</v>

2640
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Does zone Dazn do you know what that is?</v>

2641
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Well they,</v>

2642
01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is they're splitting,</v>

2643
01:05:53.711 --> 01:05:55.030
<v Speaker 1>it's like a streaming service.</v>

2644
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.910
<v Speaker 1>They're splitting half the half the fights.</v>

2645
01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2646
01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Bella tour on paramount,</v>

2647
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.280
<v Speaker 1>which is used to be spike Fairmount.</v>

2648
01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Half the fights on this DAZN network.</v>

2649
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:10.530
<v Speaker 1>But what's crazy is the DAZN network just gave Canelo Alvarez $365 million.</v>

2650
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:16.930
<v Speaker 1>They just gave him this giant deal because they had no Canelo.</v>

2651
01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Just one could just beat triple g unconcerned about boxing.</v>

2652
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:21.341
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2653
01:06:21.341 --> 01:06:21.641
<v Speaker 1>Of blocks.</v>

2654
01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:21.881
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2655
01:06:21.881 --> 01:06:22.714
<v Speaker 1>I fully left it.</v>

2656
01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 1>What we went to your place once you're old house.</v>

2657
01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you Eti,</v>

2658
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe a couple other people.</v>

2659
01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.710
<v Speaker 1>We were watching some pride stuff that you Dvr,</v>

2660
01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:33.653
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2661
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.070
<v Speaker 1>And it cut off the last fight cause it went long.</v>

2662
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.761
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's right.</v>

2663
01:06:36.761 --> 01:06:37.660
<v Speaker 1>And then we watch watched boxing,</v>

2664
01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>

2665
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:40.510
<v Speaker 1>And after watching two hours of MMA,</v>

2666
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.130
<v Speaker 1>you see a guy get knocked down and they're just like,</v>

2667
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>go to work.</v>

2668
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Go to word.</v>

2669
01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Let them get up.</v>

2670
01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:43.841
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2671
01:06:43.841 --> 01:06:45.070
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

2672
01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:49.820
<v Speaker 1>So much hugging and fucking boxing socks.</v>

2673
01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:53.860
<v Speaker 1>It's great if you watch really good boxers and if you'd know you're going to go</v>

2674
01:06:53.861 --> 01:06:56.950
<v Speaker 1>see boxing Canelo Alvarez fight.</v>

2675
01:06:56.951 --> 01:06:57.970
<v Speaker 1>That happened a couple of weeks ago.</v>

2676
01:06:57.971 --> 01:06:58.960
<v Speaker 1>It was a really good fight.</v>

2677
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.460
<v Speaker 1>It was a really good fight.</v>

2678
01:07:00.461 --> 01:07:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought triple g.</v>

2679
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Well I thought it was a real close fight,</v>

2680
01:07:04.691 --> 01:07:05.650
<v Speaker 1>but if I was going to give it to someone,</v>

2681
01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I think I would've given it to triple g but it was close enough where you can</v>

2682
01:07:09.461 --> 01:07:09.641
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2683
01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:09.851
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2684
01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:12.760
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a robbery but good fight,</v>

2685
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:18.580
<v Speaker 1>but leg kicks and and and take downs and it just makes fighting more interest as</v>

2686
01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I was just way too many fucking,</v>

2687
01:07:20.231 --> 01:07:21.400
<v Speaker 1>let's see what the judges said.</v>

2688
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:22.211
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

2689
01:07:22.211 --> 01:07:23.470
<v Speaker 1>So nobody really one.</v>

2690
01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.540
<v Speaker 1>They just got it just did better.</v>

2691
01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2692
01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:26.531
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2693
01:07:26.531 --> 01:07:27.460
<v Speaker 1>we're not Beto guy.</v>

2694
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2695
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Rarely.</v>

2696
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean it happens rarely.</v>

2697
01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.060
<v Speaker 1>It happens less.</v>

2698
01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:31.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2699
01:07:31.571 --> 01:07:32.620
<v Speaker 1>The thing about Pacquiao,</v>

2700
01:07:32.621 --> 01:07:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Mayweather was like,</v>

2701
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could have kept fighting,</v>

2702
01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:35.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2703
01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.120
<v Speaker 1>So what have we decided?</v>

2704
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.511
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2705
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:37.721
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2706
01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:38.140
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2707
01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:38.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2708
01:07:38.381 --> 01:07:39.220
<v Speaker 1>After 12 rounds,</v>

2709
01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:41.050
<v Speaker 1>they could've gotten 12 I like the early pride,</v>

2710
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.660
<v Speaker 1>like the early UFC with hoist,</v>

2711
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:44.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're going to find me for 35 minutes.</v>

2712
01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2713
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll see eventually I'll fucking wear you down.</v>

2714
01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2715
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what Nate always says.</v>

2716
01:07:50.051 --> 01:07:50.831
<v Speaker 1>Like if this was war,</v>

2717
01:07:50.831 --> 01:07:51.664
<v Speaker 1>you'd be dead.</v>

2718
01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2719
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2720
01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:56.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like I choked her out that he's able to kept choking you and then just put</v>

2721
01:07:56.141 --> 01:07:57.670
<v Speaker 1>a fucking twisted your neck.</v>

2722
01:07:57.850 --> 01:07:58.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2723
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean if someone came along today and did no time limit fights,</v>

2724
01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I wonder like if you had like three big no time limit fights like Nate versus</v>

2725
01:08:10.121 --> 01:08:10.954
<v Speaker 1>Connor,</v>

2726
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:14.050
<v Speaker 1>John Jones versus DC,</v>

2727
01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:14.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2728
01:08:14.531 --> 01:08:16.460
<v Speaker 1>and have just three</v>

2729
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:20.130
<v Speaker 3>giant fights and have no time limit,</v>

2730
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.950
<v Speaker 3>no fight,</v>

2731
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

2732
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.751
<v Speaker 3>carry thing.</v>

2733
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:24.980
<v Speaker 3>To go into that kind of a fight.</v>

2734
01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:27.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a different feeling like would hoist went into and those early days of</v>

2735
01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:28.520
<v Speaker 3>the UFC,</v>

2736
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.480
<v Speaker 3>it took a lot of abuse just to get like pass guard and that slow like eight</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean he really didn't a wrestling background.</v>

2847
01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:14.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2848
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.200
<v Speaker 3>you see how high his hips are,</v>

2849
01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:16.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2850
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:17.161
<v Speaker 3>he didn't,</v>

2851
01:11:17.161 --> 01:11:19.320
<v Speaker 3>he didn't drop down and go for a double.</v>

2852
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.110
<v Speaker 3>He was basically claim changed.</v>

2853
01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:21.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2854
01:11:21.721 --> 01:11:25.290
<v Speaker 3>He was basically clinching and then hoping he get to fight to the ground with a</v>

2855
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:26.310
<v Speaker 3>trip and there he goes.</v>

2856
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:27.660
<v Speaker 3>And then when he tripped him,</v>

2857
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 3>chemo wound up on top of him,</v>

2858
01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:30.630
<v Speaker 3>which is hilarious.</v>

2859
01:11:30.631 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 3>Like this flatten out.</v>

2860
01:11:31.891 --> 01:11:33.600

2861
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.620
<v Speaker 3>terrible position.</v>

2862
01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:38.250
<v Speaker 3>Blue Hoist places just happy that he's on the ground.</v>

2863
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.851
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2864
01:11:38.851 --> 01:11:39.840
<v Speaker 3>keep wrestling with me.</v>

2865
01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:41.010
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking get you.</v>

2866
01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.870
<v Speaker 3>But look at this chemos riding his back.</v>

2867
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:47.160
<v Speaker 3>But Chemo is maybe 80 or 90 pounds heavier than him.</v>

2868
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:48.960
<v Speaker 3>It seems a lot to get off your back.</v>

2869
01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:52.170
<v Speaker 3>You voice was like one 75 g two yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he was one 75 and chemo is easily,</v>

2871
01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:58.860
<v Speaker 3>easily two 50 he was a big fucking guy man.</v>

2872
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 3>And there's no back of the head.</v>

2873
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:02.760
<v Speaker 3>So he's got to protect themselves with distance and know like,</v>

2874
01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:05.550
<v Speaker 3>and also chemo is holding on to hoist as Geeky.</v>

2880
01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:12.240
<v Speaker 3>And then he just didn't even try to,</v>

2881
01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:13.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2882
01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:13.891
<v Speaker 3>but he bought,</v>

2883
01:12:13.891 --> 01:12:15.870
<v Speaker 3>he bucked him off just from sheer size,</v>

2884
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:19.320
<v Speaker 3>but chemo just got exhausted because when you're that big,</v>

2885
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:22.290
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have like a real rigorous strength and conditioning program,</v>

2886
01:12:22.291 --> 01:12:24.130
<v Speaker 3>you just get fucking trying going in there.</v>

2887
01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:24.900
<v Speaker 3>You've got no idea.</v>

2888
01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh no arm bar,</v>

2889
01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:27.090
<v Speaker 3>but looks not that good.</v>

2890
01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.050
<v Speaker 3>A sloppy.</v>

2891
01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:28.681
<v Speaker 3>He's tired,</v>

2892
01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:29.160
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2893
01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.900
<v Speaker 3>He's carrying this fucking big guys.</v>

2894
01:12:30.901 --> 01:12:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Wait.</v>

2895
01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:32.040
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2896
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.200
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have strength and conditioning back then,</v>

2897
01:12:34.201 --> 01:12:34.590
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2898
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:36.120
<v Speaker 3>No one knew what the fuck they were doing.</v>

2899
01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:37.480
<v Speaker 3>This was all just cut.</v>

2900
01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:38.403
<v Speaker 3>Wade.</v>

2901
01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:39.803
<v Speaker 3>He didn't cut anyway.</v>

2902
01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know shit about nutrition.</v>

2903
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean in 93 man that now he,</v>

2904
01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:48.270
<v Speaker 3>I remember he got ahold of that hair and he got a fist full of hair and started</v>

2905
01:12:48.271 --> 01:12:49.220
<v Speaker 3>punching him in the face.</v>

2906
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.501
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2907
01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:50.970
<v Speaker 3>Chris Distance for their arm triangle there.</v>

2908
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.770
<v Speaker 3>No look at it.</v>

2909
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Still can't cut it at fist full of hair.</v>

2910
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not letting go of this.</v>

2911
01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:55.891
<v Speaker 3>He's a bitch.</v>

2912
01:12:55.891 --> 01:12:57.030
<v Speaker 3>I got your hair fucked up,</v>

2913
01:12:57.031 --> 01:12:57.240
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2914
01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Should get a haircut.</v>

2915
01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:58.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2916
01:12:58.351 --> 01:13:01.020
<v Speaker 3>you try to be sexy Tong Po Bullshit.</v>

2917
01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:02.700
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2918
01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:03.160
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

2919
01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.750
<v Speaker 3>we learned so much about martial arts from these fights because everybody had</v>

2920
01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:08.780
<v Speaker 3>these ideas like woodwork and what wouldn't.</v>

2921
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:09.810
<v Speaker 3>And then once they did that it's like,</v>

2922
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.070
<v Speaker 3>oh I have to work on my ground.</v>

2923
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.360
<v Speaker 3>And then that evolved and I have all been involved.</v>

2924
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Well like the old opened up Jujitsu schools worldwide everywhere.</v>

2925
01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:20.520
<v Speaker 3>And everybody wanted to be a Gracie.</v>

2926
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.361
<v Speaker 3>You know guys,</v>

2927
01:13:21.361 --> 01:13:25.440
<v Speaker 3>we're changing their name to Gracie guys were like Marion Gracie's just to have</v>

2928
01:13:25.441 --> 01:13:28.680
<v Speaker 3>the Gracie name guys and marry a female Gracie and then changed their name to</v>

2929
01:13:28.681 --> 01:13:29.514
<v Speaker 3>Gracie.</v>

2930
01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was crazy.</v>

2931
01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:34.470
<v Speaker 3>It was a difference between you making $1 million and you make it nothing.</v>

2932
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wanted to go to Fred's Jujitsu.</v>

2933
01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.240
<v Speaker 3>What wanted to be a part of the Gracie Academy,</v>

2934
01:13:42.241 --> 01:13:42.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2935
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:43.071
<v Speaker 3>like look,</v>

2936
01:13:43.071 --> 01:13:44.340
<v Speaker 3>you just get all that hair on the ground.</v>

2937
01:13:44.341 --> 01:13:44.761
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>

2938
01:13:44.761 --> 01:13:44.881
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2939
01:13:44.881 --> 01:13:45.681
<v Speaker 3>it's a hair chemo.</v>

2940
01:13:45.681 --> 01:13:46.221
<v Speaker 3>His hair.</v>

2941
01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:47.910
<v Speaker 3>If he pulled a fistful of fucking hand,</v>

2942
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.780
<v Speaker 3>pulled it out.</v>

2943
01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2944
01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.100
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

2945
01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.260
<v Speaker 3>They're both so tired.</v>

2946
01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:52.471
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2947
01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.550
<v Speaker 3>exhausted Ben.</v>

2948
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.080
<v Speaker 3>And this is the only thing fortunately.</v>

2949
01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.600
<v Speaker 3>How long's this Viko I think it went seven minutes,</v>

2950
01:13:57.601 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Speaker 3>if I have to remember exactly.</v>

2951
01:13:58.890 --> 01:13:59.671
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2952
01:13:59.671 --> 01:14:01.320
<v Speaker 3>They're both so worn out.</v>

2953
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.530
<v Speaker 3>It looks like it's more of,</v>

2954
01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.230
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

2955
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:05.640
<v Speaker 3>what's that James Right here?</v>

2956
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:08.370
<v Speaker 3>It's about to end here for 22 oh hey.</v>

2957
01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:09.230
<v Speaker 3>He catches him,</v>

2958
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.200
<v Speaker 3>keeps going for the arm,</v>

2959
01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:10.351
<v Speaker 3>Bar,</v>

2960
01:14:10.351 --> 01:14:10.951
<v Speaker 3>the triangle,</v>

2961
01:14:10.951 --> 01:14:11.621
<v Speaker 3>and eventually it's like,</v>

2962
01:14:11.621 --> 01:14:12.401
<v Speaker 3>I'll get one over here.</v>

2963
01:14:12.401 --> 01:14:12.881
<v Speaker 3>He gets it.</v>

2964
01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:15.490
<v Speaker 3>So it was like four 28 he's catching the arm bar.</v>

2965
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:17.200
<v Speaker 3>So this is like first round.</v>

2966
01:14:17.201 --> 01:14:17.650
<v Speaker 3>I wonder,</v>

2967
01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:20.440
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if UFC today even knows what he's going for here.</v>

2968
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.360
<v Speaker 3>A hoist does chemo,</v>

2969
01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:23.290
<v Speaker 3>chemo.</v>

2970
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:23.741
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

2971
01:14:23.741 --> 01:14:24.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>

2972
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:24.670
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2973
01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:27.460
<v Speaker 3>I think he more tap cause he was exhausted than anything.</v>

2974
01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Like look at him.</v>

2975
01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.020
<v Speaker 3>He's exhausted.</v>

2976
01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:30.543
<v Speaker 3>Made a bear.</v>

2977
01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:31.960
<v Speaker 3>He got the arm bar for sure.</v>

2978
01:14:31.961 --> 01:14:32.920
<v Speaker 3>But I mean barely.</v>

2979
01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:38.130
<v Speaker 3>But then hoist was so beaten down by this fight that he couldn't go on,</v>

2980
01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.820
<v Speaker 3>but Hixon would have destroyed chemo.</v>

2981
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:46.150
<v Speaker 3>It would have been a completely different thing because Hickson was strong as</v>

2982
01:14:46.151 --> 01:14:47.020
<v Speaker 3>fuck man.</v>

2983
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.160
<v Speaker 3>And Hickson was,</v>

2984
01:14:48.161 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 3>there's Joseph Hickson was a different animal.</v>

2985
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Like Hickson was much more physically imposing.</v>

2986
01:14:56.110 --> 01:15:00.640
<v Speaker 3>He was about one 9,200 pounds and he was smaller than chemo,</v>

2987
01:15:00.641 --> 01:15:02.410
<v Speaker 3>but he was jacked bodies.</v>

2988
01:15:02.411 --> 01:15:02.731
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>

2989
01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:03.031
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

2990
01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.840
<v Speaker 3>His body is just like rustler body.</v>

2991
01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:05.590
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

2992
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Well marginal wrestler bought it.</v>

2993
01:15:06.971 --> 01:15:07.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2994
01:15:07.181 --> 01:15:08.100
<v Speaker 3>More bodybuilder.</v>

2995
01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:08.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2996
01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2997
01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Whereas hoist is just,</v>

2998
01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.010
<v Speaker 3>if you saw hoist with his shirt off,</v>

2999
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:13.690
<v Speaker 3>you would think that guy's a fighter.</v>

3000
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:16.830
<v Speaker 5>Wrap you up like a fucking package.</v>

3001
01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.000
<v Speaker 5>So back to Anderson though.</v>

3002
01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:18.331
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3003
01:15:18.331 --> 01:15:23.331
<v Speaker 5>so my book ends with him are that first leap and fight and then shattering his</v>

3004
01:15:23.941 --> 01:15:24.480
<v Speaker 5>leg,</v>

3005
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:27.130
<v Speaker 5>which I was in the front row for which you didn't even believe it.</v>

3006
01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.670
<v Speaker 5>It didn't make sense to see a leg move like that.</v>

3007
01:15:29.671 --> 01:15:30.200
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

3008
01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:30.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

3009
01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.433
<v Speaker 5>I don't get it.</v>

3010
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:36.200
<v Speaker 5>It looked like somebody filled up a sock with pebbles and just like hit it</v>

3011
01:15:36.201 --> 01:15:37.800
<v Speaker 5>against something and it's like it doesn't,</v>

3012
01:15:37.801 --> 01:15:40.710
<v Speaker 5>it didn't make sense and it was so gross.</v>

3013
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:42.540
<v Speaker 5>But in the interim,</v>

3014
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:47.910
<v Speaker 5>seeing that first Charleston and fight when he was,</v>

3015
01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:49.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean he won 400 a half rounds.</v>

3016
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:50.703
<v Speaker 5>Chael Sonnen,</v>

3017
01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:53.100
<v Speaker 5>he almost won the title and then to cut that,</v>

3018
01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was a la,</v>

3019
01:15:54.330 --> 01:15:56.820
<v Speaker 5>such a legendary sports thing,</v>

3020
01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:57.781
<v Speaker 5>not UFC,</v>

3021
01:15:57.781 --> 01:15:58.591
<v Speaker 5>but sports thing.</v>

3022
01:15:58.591 --> 01:16:02.100
<v Speaker 5>How this guy's down like crazy in a title fight.</v>

3023
01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:07.100
<v Speaker 5>A guy who's never been tested was finally tested and was losing.</v>

3024
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:07.980
<v Speaker 5>It was over.</v>

3025
01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:08.813
<v Speaker 5>This guy could,</v>

3026
01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:09.960
<v Speaker 5>Chael Sonnen was beating him.</v>

3027
01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:15.410
<v Speaker 5>He figured them out and then to get that triangle with 40 seconds left,</v>

3028
01:16:15.661 --> 01:16:16.310
<v Speaker 5>two minutes left.</v>

3029
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:17.143
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

3030
01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:21.900
<v Speaker 5>but I remember what's so clear and indelible in my head is afterwards we're at</v>

3031
01:16:21.901 --> 01:16:22.770
<v Speaker 5>the entrance,</v>

3032
01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.180
<v Speaker 5>everyone's cleared out of the stadium.</v>

3033
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.950
<v Speaker 5>We're at the entrance to the,</v>

3034
01:16:25.951 --> 01:16:26.400
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3035
01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:26.760
<v Speaker 5>to the,</v>

3036
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:27.330
<v Speaker 5>under the,</v>

3037
01:16:27.330 --> 01:16:27.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3038
01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:28.440
<v Speaker 5>the caves of the,</v>

3039
01:16:28.441 --> 01:16:29.251
<v Speaker 5>of the stadium,</v>

3040
01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:30.084
<v Speaker 5>whatever it was.</v>

3041
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.991
<v Speaker 5>And it's me,</v>

3042
01:16:30.991 --> 01:16:31.501
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3043
01:16:31.501 --> 01:16:32.520
<v Speaker 5>I think Dana,</v>

3044
01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.880
<v Speaker 5>Randy was there and we're all talking.</v>

3045
01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:39.880
<v Speaker 5>And then every once in a while somebody's mind would go to that fight and you</v>

3046
01:16:39.881 --> 01:16:40.591
<v Speaker 5>just see him go like,</v>

3047
01:16:40.591 --> 01:16:40.831
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3048
01:16:40.831 --> 01:16:41.071
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3049
01:16:41.071 --> 01:16:42.210
<v Speaker 5>I think the weather is pretty nice here.</v>

3050
01:16:42.211 --> 01:16:43.140
<v Speaker 5>And then you see someone go like,</v>

3051
01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:46.411
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3052
01:16:46.411 --> 01:16:47.460
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't believe it.</v>

3053
01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.980
<v Speaker 5>I remember seeing Randek a tour dude.</v>

3054
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.903
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3055
01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:51.100
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3056
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.000
<v Speaker 5>like why do this?</v>

3057
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Four minutes into the fight grabs a hold of it or four rounds in the fight,</v>

3058
01:16:58.021 --> 01:16:58.854
<v Speaker 3>grabs a hold of that,</v>

3059
01:16:58.890 --> 01:17:02.790
<v Speaker 3>syncs up the triangle and gets a triangle armbar combination and tabs him.</v>

3060
01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:03.713
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3061
01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.030
<v Speaker 3>And this is an Anderson came into that fight,</v>

3062
01:17:06.031 --> 01:17:11.031
<v Speaker 3>injured and are Anderson had a fucked up rib entering into that fight and a lot</v>

3063
01:17:11.181 --> 01:17:12.470
<v Speaker 3>of people thought he should have pulled out.</v>

3064
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:14.600
<v Speaker 3>What kind of weird edit is this?</v>

3065
01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:15.503
<v Speaker 3>All the blurriness,</v>

3066
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:17.660
<v Speaker 3>all these strange fan,</v>

3067
01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:18.830
<v Speaker 3>and it was nuts.</v>

3068
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.450
<v Speaker 3>It was nuts for that guy.</v>

3069
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:22.380
<v Speaker 3>He'll come see how he's holding his side and the mode.</v>

3070
01:17:22.450 --> 01:17:22.791
<v Speaker 3>The first,</v>

3071
01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:25.100
<v Speaker 3>that was the first trash talk fight ever remember to Oh,</v>

3072
01:17:25.101 --> 01:17:28.340
<v Speaker 3>Chels son and people forget how good he was a talking shit.</v>

3073
01:17:28.341 --> 01:17:29.174
<v Speaker 3>He was the best,</v>

3074
01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:29.600
<v Speaker 3>the best.</v>

3075
01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.321
<v Speaker 3>He was the best.</v>

3076
01:17:30.321 --> 01:17:31.160
<v Speaker 3>When I come it,</v>

3077
01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:33.500
<v Speaker 3>when Anderson Silva walks into the ring,</v>

3078
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:36.410
<v Speaker 3>you could hear a mouse pissing on cotton.</v>

3079
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:38.000
<v Speaker 3>When I walk in,</v>

3080
01:17:38.001 --> 01:17:38.950
<v Speaker 3>it's thunder.</v>

3081
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean the promos he would cut.</v>

3082
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3083
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:44.870
<v Speaker 3>We're just the APP that hadn't been done yet.</v>

3084
01:17:44.871 --> 01:17:45.704
<v Speaker 3>Now we've done a lot.</v>

3085
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:46.071
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3086
01:17:46.071 --> 01:17:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Conor Mcgregor Prob,</v>

3087
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3088
01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:51.770
<v Speaker 3>it's arguable that shale was even better than Conor.</v>

3089
01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:54.890
<v Speaker 3>If you take time period into accounts,</v>

3090
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:56.060
<v Speaker 3>no one was doing right.</v>

3091
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:56.870
<v Speaker 3>He was the first.</v>

3092
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3093
01:17:57.170 --> 01:18:02.000
<v Speaker 3>and he was building up fights as a heel for the first time ever and brought them</v>

3094
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.050
<v Speaker 3>in a little bit later.</v>

3095
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:05.060
<v Speaker 3>People forget how to chill,</v>

3096
01:18:05.061 --> 01:18:05.421
<v Speaker 3>could fight.</v>

3097
01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:06.710
<v Speaker 3>If you go back to really,</v>

3098
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:07.401
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

3099
01:18:07.401 --> 01:18:07.611
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

3100
01:18:07.611 --> 01:18:11.120
<v Speaker 3>one of his most impressive victories was Nate Marquardt because he fought Nate</v>

3101
01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Marquardt wouldn't meet,</v>

3102
01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:16.310
<v Speaker 3>Nate was one of the best and he ragdolled them and it was a bloody crazy chaotic</v>

3103
01:18:16.311 --> 01:18:16.970
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

3104
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:17.930
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

3105
01:18:17.931 --> 01:18:18.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3106
01:18:18.381 --> 01:18:20.390
<v Speaker 3>he basically dominated him with wrestling,</v>

3107
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:21.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3108
01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.730
<v Speaker 3>chill just fought last week.</v>

3109
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:24.620
<v Speaker 3>He just got knocked out by fader.</v>

3110
01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:25.533
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

3111
01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:26.710
<v Speaker 3>He's stopped by fate.</v>

3112
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3113
01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:27.921
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3114
01:18:27.921 --> 01:18:29.330
<v Speaker 3>he had some good moments in that fight.</v>

3115
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:30.680
<v Speaker 3>He had faith doors back.</v>

3116
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.903
<v Speaker 3>He tried,</v>

3117
01:18:32.210 --> 01:18:33.920
<v Speaker 3>he tried to roll them over.</v>

3118
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:37.940
<v Speaker 3>There's a move that you do go under the Chin when you have someone's back,</v>

3119
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:39.640
<v Speaker 3>you go under the Chin and then you,</v>

3120
01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:43.670
<v Speaker 3>you somersault over and try to carry with momentum.</v>

3121
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Try to carry them over.</v>

3122
01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:48.600
<v Speaker 3>But it's a core strength move head and arm.</v>

3123
01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.381
<v Speaker 3>Well you,</v>

3124
01:18:49.381 --> 01:18:49.821
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3125
01:18:49.821 --> 01:18:50.300
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>

3126
01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:54.020
<v Speaker 3>he had the back and he was kind of like riding high on the back end.</v>

3127
01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:54.440
<v Speaker 3>He went,</v>

3128
01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.410
<v Speaker 3>he felt like he had a grip under the chin.</v>

3129
01:18:57.411 --> 01:18:58.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how he held his hands.</v>

3130
01:18:58.701 --> 01:19:01.460
<v Speaker 3>But what you do is when you have a guy's back,</v>

3131
01:19:01.730 --> 01:19:02.210
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3132
01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:05.090
<v Speaker 3>you hold it like this and then you go forward.</v>

3133
01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:07.580
<v Speaker 3>So you take them forward with you.</v>

3134
01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 3>That way you have their back.</v>

3135
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.000
<v Speaker 3>When you're on your back,</v>

3136
01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:12.890
<v Speaker 3>you could cinch up a body triangle.</v>

3137
01:19:12.891 --> 01:19:17.840
<v Speaker 3>You could cinch up the choke but fade or shook them off and then beat them on</v>

3138
01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:18.180
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>

3139
01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:18.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3140
01:19:18.271 --> 01:19:18.981
<v Speaker 3>watch how he does it.</v>

3141
01:19:18.981 --> 01:19:20.210
<v Speaker 3>So he tries to flip them,</v>

3142
01:19:20.211 --> 01:19:20.750
<v Speaker 3>oversee,</v>

3143
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:21.471
<v Speaker 3>but he lost.</v>

3144
01:19:21.471 --> 01:19:21.830
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

3145
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:23.480
<v Speaker 3>he lost control and then boom,</v>

3146
01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:27.140
<v Speaker 3>hey makers coming down from one of the greatest ground and pound experts of all</v>

3147
01:19:27.141 --> 01:19:30.710
<v Speaker 3>time and giant difference that was getting that are not cutting it also,</v>

3148
01:19:30.711 --> 01:19:30.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3149
01:19:30.981 --> 01:19:35.060
<v Speaker 3>chill fought one 85 fade or has been heavyweight his whole life.</v>

3150
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.261
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3151
01:19:36.261 --> 01:19:36.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3152
01:19:36.561 --> 01:19:38.090
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of factors in there,</v>

3153
01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.240
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3154
01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:42.810
<v Speaker 3>it was a good fight for as long as it landed long as it lasted.</v>

3155
01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Brother,</v>

3156
01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:47.960
<v Speaker 3>one of the cool things that we've gotten is the big ability to hang out casually</v>

3157
01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:48.794
<v Speaker 3>with these fighters.</v>

3158
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Like having breakfast with Randy Singh,</v>

3159
01:19:52.281 --> 01:19:55.580
<v Speaker 3>him having with enough times with you that I remember one time I was like going</v>

3160
01:19:55.581 --> 01:19:57.920
<v Speaker 3>into a buffet or whatever or the hotel,</v>

3161
01:19:57.921 --> 01:20:01.490
<v Speaker 3>like free breakfast and like looking around and just having him go sit with me.</v>

3162
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:02.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3163
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3310
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.221
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3311
01:22:57.221 --> 01:23:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a good conversation to have with a young guy.</v>

3312
01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:00.331
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3313
01:23:00.331 --> 01:23:00.750
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3314
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:01.460
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

3315
01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:01.620
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3316
01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:01.900
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3317
01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:02.600
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3318
01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.960
<v Speaker 2>you have real talent.</v>

3319
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Like you could really be something,</v>

3320
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:07.360
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta be,</v>

3321
01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:12.480
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be coached by guys who are going to find out your tendency technique</v>

3322
01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:13.511
<v Speaker 1>isn't worth,</v>

3323
01:23:13.511 --> 01:23:15.040
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to go take you that far.</v>

3324
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:15.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3325
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3326
01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:16.601
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

3327
01:23:16.601 --> 01:23:17.440
<v Speaker 1>he was so good.</v>

3328
01:23:17.441 --> 01:23:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how far he might've been a world champion,</v>

3329
01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:21.310
<v Speaker 1>even with the camp that he was in.</v>

3330
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:25.960
<v Speaker 1>He's so good and his wrestling is so powerful and he's so physically talented,</v>

3331
01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:31.290
<v Speaker 1>but it made a big difference for him to go to Jackson's and be able to train on</v>

3332
01:23:33.731 --> 01:23:38.731
<v Speaker 1>a regular basis with world class fighters being there on a daily basis with</v>

3333
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Carlos condit who is,</v>

3334
01:23:41.531 --> 01:23:41.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3335
01:23:41.741 --> 01:23:43.480
<v Speaker 1>at the top of his game back then.</v>

3336
01:23:43.481 --> 01:23:47.920
<v Speaker 1>And I mean Keith Jardeen and they just had a massive,</v>

3337
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:49.410
<v Speaker 1>they had ruined tailors,</v>

3338
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:50.380
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3339
01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:55.180
<v Speaker 1>they called it the ring of fire where you would go five rounds of sparring with</v>

3340
01:23:55.181 --> 01:23:59.410
<v Speaker 1>to get ready for a fight with a different high level.</v>

3341
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.273
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3342
01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:01.780
<v Speaker 1>highest level fighter.</v>

3343
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.100
<v Speaker 1>So like Nate Marquardt like,</v>

3344
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:03.341
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

3345
01:24:03.341 --> 01:24:05.950
<v Speaker 1>That was where I won't out of here at Giardia and you'd come in and now I just</v>

3346
01:24:05.951 --> 01:24:07.390
<v Speaker 1>finished a fucking route with Nate Marquardt.</v>

3347
01:24:07.391 --> 01:24:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Now I gotta go with kicked Jardeen cool.</v>

3348
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.903
<v Speaker 1>Round three.</v>

3349
01:24:09.930 --> 01:24:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3350
01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:10.461
<v Speaker 1>charge.</v>

3351
01:24:10.461 --> 01:24:10.991
<v Speaker 1>Didn't get out.</v>

3352
01:24:10.991 --> 01:24:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones who come in and it's like,</v>

3353
01:24:12.791 --> 01:24:13.150
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3354
01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:13.983
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3355
01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:15.070
<v Speaker 1>the training you got there.</v>

3356
01:24:15.071 --> 01:24:15.311
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

3357
01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:16.001
<v Speaker 1>Johnson's camp.</v>

3358
01:24:16.001 --> 01:24:16.450
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

3359
01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:16.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3360
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3361
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3362
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.641
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3363
01:24:18.641 --> 01:24:22.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why so many extremely high level fighters are coming down</v>

3364
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.151
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3365
01:24:22.151 --> 01:24:24.010
<v Speaker 1>And then Rashad Evans was there as well too.</v>

3366
01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And Rashad had a real problem with John Coming there because Rashad was like,</v>

3367
01:24:27.491 --> 01:24:27.641
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3368
01:24:27.641 --> 01:24:29.140
<v Speaker 1>this guy's in my weight class,</v>

3369
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.521
<v Speaker 1>but what are you going to do?</v>

3370
01:24:30.521 --> 01:24:31.031
<v Speaker 1>I have one guy,</v>

3371
01:24:31.031 --> 01:24:31.790
<v Speaker 1>he's way class.</v>

3372
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3373
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:33.423
<v Speaker 1>It's an issue.</v>

3374
01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3375
01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:35.440
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

3376
01:24:35.441 --> 01:24:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Rishad and John became friends.</v>

3377
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.453
<v Speaker 1>They did fight.</v>

3378
01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Did they would,</v>

3379
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:40.840
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3380
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:41.440
<v Speaker 1>they fought.</v>

3381
01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And John beat the shit out of him.</v>

3382
01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:46.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember that they fought after they had a big falling out because</v>

3383
01:24:46.511 --> 01:24:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Rashad was upset that,</v>

3384
01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3385
01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:49.540
<v Speaker 1>John Wound up,</v>

3386
01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:51.280
<v Speaker 1>John Wound up getting a title shot,</v>

3387
01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:52.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3388
01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:54.790
<v Speaker 1>and beat Shogun because Rashad got injured.</v>

3389
01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Rashad was supposed to get the title shot,</v>

3390
01:24:57.610 --> 01:25:02.050
<v Speaker 1>John Steps in and they were friends at the time and then somewhere along the</v>

3391
01:25:02.051 --> 01:25:03.820
<v Speaker 1>line then the trash talk started,</v>

3392
01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:04.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3393
01:25:04.061 --> 01:25:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight Rashad,</v>

3394
01:25:05.051 --> 01:25:05.560
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

3395
01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.221
<v Speaker 1>And then it was like,</v>

3396
01:25:06.221 --> 01:25:06.371
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3397
01:25:06.371 --> 01:25:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I thought we were friends and then,</v>

3398
01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:08.021
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

3399
01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:08.980
<v Speaker 1>that's back when it was like,</v>

3400
01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:09.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3401
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:10.570
<v Speaker 1>you guys can fight as front and [inaudible].</v>

3402
01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:12.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to like be at enemies.</v>

3403
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Everybody fight.</v>

3404
01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:16.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a sport and it's a money thing.</v>

3405
01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:18.340
<v Speaker 1>And then when John beat him,</v>

3406
01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:23.370
<v Speaker 1>it was a real drubbing and it was a five rounds.</v>

3407
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:27.010
<v Speaker 1>It was a decision and uh,</v>

3408
01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.900
<v Speaker 1>it was a real clear cut,</v>

3409
01:25:28.901 --> 01:25:29.770
<v Speaker 1>unanimous decision.</v>

3410
01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:31.810
<v Speaker 1>He did some crazy shit to him.</v>

3411
01:25:31.811 --> 01:25:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Like step in elbow to the face.</v>

3412
01:25:34.730 --> 01:25:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I kind of do remember this one now.</v>

3413
01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:38.670
<v Speaker 1>This was John when he was developing John.</v>

3414
01:25:38.690 --> 01:25:39.521
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even John,</v>

3415
01:25:39.521 --> 01:25:41.290
<v Speaker 1>like the John that knocked out DC.</v>

3416
01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:42.970
<v Speaker 1>I remember him when he sang it in fights.</v>

3417
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:46.420
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really ever see this with the fighters where he would talk about after</v>

3418
01:25:46.421 --> 01:25:46.930
<v Speaker 1>wins,</v>

3419
01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:48.130
<v Speaker 1>talking about the holes,</v>

3420
01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.170
<v Speaker 1>the fuck ups he had more than the,</v>

3421
01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.020
<v Speaker 1>what he did right was most guys would be braggadocious,</v>

3422
01:25:53.021 --> 01:25:53.890
<v Speaker 1>but I loved it.</v>

3423
01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:56.290
<v Speaker 1>But it was like he was upset at things that went wrong.</v>

3424
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3425
01:25:56.501 --> 01:25:57.610
<v Speaker 1>I guess I got to cover that up.</v>

3426
01:25:57.611 --> 01:25:58.540
<v Speaker 1>That could get exposed.</v>

3427
01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.793
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3428
01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.120
<v Speaker 1>John's a fucking smart dude.</v>

3429
01:26:01.121 --> 01:26:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean is reckless and chaotic as he is.</v>

3430
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.501
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3431
01:26:03.501 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I've said this before</v>

3432
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:08.030
<v Speaker 6>that I don't know what causes that kind of recklessness,</v>

3433
01:26:08.031 --> 01:26:13.031
<v Speaker 6>but there is a direct correlation between traumatic brain injury,</v>

3434
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.120
<v Speaker 6>brain damage and impulsive behavior and recklessness.</v>

3435
01:26:17.150 --> 01:26:18.020
<v Speaker 6>It's a fact.</v>

3436
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:19.460
<v Speaker 6>It's well researched.</v>

3437
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.670
<v Speaker 6>It's well documented in neuroscience.</v>

3438
01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:24.050
<v Speaker 6>They know that this,</v>

3439
01:26:24.051 --> 01:26:24.680
<v Speaker 6>this is a,</v>

3440
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.550
<v Speaker 6>there's a connection.</v>

3441
01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to exonerate him from his past behavior,</v>

3442
01:26:29.031 --> 01:26:31.880
<v Speaker 6>but we see that in football players,</v>

3443
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:35.990
<v Speaker 6>we see that in BMX riders that go crazy and fucking land on their head a bunch</v>

3444
01:26:35.991 --> 01:26:36.620
<v Speaker 6>of times.</v>

3445
01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:36.980
<v Speaker 6>People,</v>

3446
01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:37.850
<v Speaker 6>they get crazy,</v>

3447
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:39.980
<v Speaker 6>they get wild and impulsive.</v>

3448
01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.090
<v Speaker 6>It's just a fact.</v>

3449
01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.290
<v Speaker 6>It's just a part of the game.</v>

3450
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:43.101
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3451
01:26:43.101 --> 01:26:43.440
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3452
01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:43.880
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

3453
01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:48.880
<v Speaker 6>those people that engage in any kind of an activity where you bring gets rattled</v>

3454
01:26:48.951 --> 01:26:50.000
<v Speaker 6>on a regular basis,</v>

3455
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:54.110
<v Speaker 6>you are way more likely to do ridiculous things that don't make any sense.</v>

3456
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:55.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3457
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:56.203
<v Speaker 6>it does.</v>

3458
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.650
<v Speaker 6>And so what I said about John,</v>

3459
01:26:57.651 --> 01:26:58.820
<v Speaker 6>have you talked to John about it?</v>

3460
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.900
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3461
01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:00.733
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3462
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:02.263
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

3463
01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.700
<v Speaker 6>I know John was upset with me after one of those things before we actually did a</v>

3464
01:27:07.701 --> 01:27:08.540
<v Speaker 6>podcast together.</v>

3465
01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:09.470
<v Speaker 6>He was upset and I said,</v>

3466
01:27:09.471 --> 01:27:10.070
<v Speaker 6>listen man,</v>

3467
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:13.130
<v Speaker 6>I have to be honest about everything.</v>

3468
01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.430
<v Speaker 6>I have to be honest about how I feel about every single aspect of your</v>

3469
01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:17.264
<v Speaker 6>performance,</v>

3470
01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.680
<v Speaker 6>of your behavior.</v>

3471
01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:19.573
<v Speaker 6>I have to be,</v>

3472
01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:20.630
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't mean I don't love you.</v>

3473
01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:21.650
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't mean I don't think you were great.</v>

3474
01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:24.360
<v Speaker 5>I hate to give your commentary on stuff.</v>

3475
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.400
<v Speaker 6>I have to be,</v>

3476
01:27:25.401 --> 01:27:26.480
<v Speaker 6>you don't really choose sides.</v>

3477
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:27.051
<v Speaker 6>I can't,</v>

3478
01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:27.501
<v Speaker 6>I can't,</v>

3479
01:27:27.501 --> 01:27:29.090
<v Speaker 6>not only can I not choose sides,</v>

3480
01:27:29.091 --> 01:27:31.100
<v Speaker 6>I have to call what I see.</v>

3481
01:27:31.130 --> 01:27:31.520
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3482
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.320
<v Speaker 6>it's everything because if I don't,</v>

3483
01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:34.580
<v Speaker 6>then no one's going to listen to me.</v>

3484
01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:35.910
<v Speaker 5>There's just cause I have a comment on it.</v>

3485
01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:36.630
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead.</v>

3486
01:27:36.630 --> 01:27:36.781
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3487
01:27:36.781 --> 01:27:37.440
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>

3488
01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:37.600
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3489
01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:41.850
<v Speaker 5>I remember finding it interesting that after Brock beat heath herring,</v>

3490
01:27:42.150 --> 01:27:42.630
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3491
01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:43.463
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3492
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:48.510
<v Speaker 5>went to whatever steakhouse he wants to and heath coming in afterwards and</v>

3493
01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:49.711
<v Speaker 5>looking right at,</v>

3494
01:27:49.711 --> 01:27:51.270
<v Speaker 5>you said like it wasn't good.</v>

3495
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:51.380
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

3496
01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.010
<v Speaker 5>you were critical of him,</v>

3497
01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:53.580
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3498
01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.600
<v Speaker 5>He sought you out as I can.</v>

3499
01:27:54.601 --> 01:27:55.110
<v Speaker 5>I talk to you.</v>

3500
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.530
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>

3501
01:27:55.530 --> 01:27:55.951
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck,</v>

3502
01:27:55.951 --> 01:27:56.491
<v Speaker 5>he's mad.</v>

3503
01:27:56.491 --> 01:27:57.030
<v Speaker 5>But he's like,</v>

3504
01:27:57.030 --> 01:28:00.090
<v Speaker 5>he just wanted to express to you they had this leg injury and that's why he</v>

3505
01:28:00.091 --> 01:28:01.590
<v Speaker 5>couldn't really defend that takedown.</v>

3506
01:28:02.190 --> 01:28:06.150
<v Speaker 5>But it's interesting how the fighters that I get to see these fighters respect</v>

3507
01:28:06.151 --> 01:28:09.210
<v Speaker 5>your opinion enough to want to explain their side of it.</v>

3508
01:28:09.630 --> 01:28:10.463
<v Speaker 5>Well I appreciate it.</v>

3509
01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:11.970
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3510
01:28:11.970 --> 01:28:13.320
<v Speaker 6>and there's always a side,</v>

3511
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:16.200
<v Speaker 6>like what was talking about that fighter that has this pretty significant injury</v>

3512
01:28:16.201 --> 01:28:17.220
<v Speaker 6>that he's dealing with right now.</v>

3513
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:21.210
<v Speaker 6>Like most people don't even know and they wouldn't have known if he didn't tell</v>

3514
01:28:21.211 --> 01:28:21.630
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

3515
01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:24.000
<v Speaker 6>And there's a lot of these guys that go into fights and they're really</v>

3516
01:28:24.001 --> 01:28:24.711
<v Speaker 6>compromised.</v>

3517
01:28:24.711 --> 01:28:24.940
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3518
01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:26.460
<v Speaker 6>they have hand injuries,</v>

3519
01:28:26.461 --> 01:28:27.211
<v Speaker 6>back injuries,</v>

3520
01:28:27.211 --> 01:28:28.044
<v Speaker 6>neck injuries.</v>

3521
01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.110
<v Speaker 6>And this is just a part of this crazy sport where you're,</v>

3522
01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.660
<v Speaker 6>the whole objective is to injure people.</v>

3523
01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.360
<v Speaker 6>So you're injuring each other in training and</v>

3524
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:38.270
<v Speaker 5>when you got to hide those injuries,</v>

3525
01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:39.440
<v Speaker 5>cause then they'll exploit them.</v>

3526
01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:40.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3527
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:42.210
<v Speaker 6>But then there's the,</v>

3528
01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:45.760
<v Speaker 6>but this is why one of the reasons why I have to be honest all the time is</v>

3529
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:46.660
<v Speaker 6>because people,</v>

3530
01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.550
<v Speaker 6>they respect the fact that I'm not going to,</v>

3531
01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:52.540
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying things because it sounds cool.</v>

3532
01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:56.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying things because this is actually what I see and it maybe you have a</v>

3533
01:28:56.591 --> 01:28:59.350
<v Speaker 6>different perspective and maybe you could share your perspective with me and</v>

3534
01:28:59.351 --> 01:29:01.800
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you why I thought this and maybe I'll change my mind</v>

3535
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:03.480
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not scared to change my mind,</v>

3536
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:05.520
<v Speaker 3>but we've got to say what I think.</v>

3537
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:05.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3538
01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:06.390
<v Speaker 3>And it's cool.</v>

3539
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.751
<v Speaker 3>The fighters,</v>

3540
01:29:06.751 --> 01:29:07.290
<v Speaker 3>like I just said,</v>

3541
01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:08.550
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't being a pussy to see it.</v>

3542
01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:09.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3543
01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:13.350
<v Speaker 3>I would never think Keith haring would be a pussy care that you know,</v>

3544
01:29:13.351 --> 01:29:14.250
<v Speaker 3>the real truth of it.</v>

3545
01:29:14.251 --> 01:29:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3546
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 3>And not that it was bad,</v>

3547
01:29:15.331 --> 01:29:16.260
<v Speaker 3>but like here's the reason.</v>

3548
01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:19.380
<v Speaker 3>It was interesting how they respect your opinion like that.</v>

3549
01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.110
<v Speaker 3>What guy?</v>

3550
01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:21.300
<v Speaker 3>Like Brock list or man,</v>

3551
01:29:21.330 --> 01:29:24.240
<v Speaker 3>I swear that if Brock Lesnar got into the,</v>

3552
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:28.980
<v Speaker 3>into mixed martial arts right out of college when college wrestler right into</v>

3553
01:29:28.981 --> 01:29:29.491
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>

3554
01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:34.350
<v Speaker 3>really learned striking and learned slowly like took some small fight.</v>

3555
01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones did.</v>

3556
01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3557
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:36.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3558
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:37.103
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3559
01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:42.410
<v Speaker 3>but really learn striking instead of like spending all that time doing WWE,</v>

3560
01:29:42.541 --> 01:29:44.670
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sure he made a fuck load of money.</v>

3561
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean good for him.</v>

3562
01:29:46.890 --> 01:29:48.330
<v Speaker 3>That's all great and everything like that.</v>

3563
01:29:48.331 --> 01:29:49.230
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

3564
01:29:49.231 --> 01:29:52.500
<v Speaker 3>I think he could have been one of the all time greats are really do a really</v>

3565
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:54.090
<v Speaker 3>song.</v>

3566
01:29:54.090 --> 01:29:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Nobody,</v>

3567
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:55.261
<v Speaker 3>nobody.</v>

3568
01:29:55.261 --> 01:29:57.540
<v Speaker 3>I remember cutting that much to heavyweight,</v>

3569
01:29:58.110 --> 01:29:58.970
<v Speaker 3>these giant,</v>

3570
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.910
<v Speaker 3>but that was all weights would weigh in with their jeans on because they're</v>

3571
01:30:01.911 --> 01:30:02.061
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3572
01:30:02.061 --> 01:30:02.610
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

3573
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:03.310
<v Speaker 3>whatever I am.</v>

3574
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:04.080
<v Speaker 3>It was also,</v>

3575
01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.640
<v Speaker 3>there was no testing back then.</v>

3576
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:09.330
<v Speaker 3>I know you've got to realize that the testing back then was horse shit.</v>

3577
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:10.440
<v Speaker 3>And the way to be,</v>

3578
01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 3>the best way to show the testing was horseshit was to show when Alistair Overeem</v>

3579
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:15.534
<v Speaker 3>fought Brock.</v>

3580
01:30:15.630 --> 01:30:17.100
<v Speaker 3>That was the steroid Olympics,</v>

3581
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.980
<v Speaker 3>those two guys together inside the octagon.</v>

3582
01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3583
01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:25.700
<v Speaker 3>but that was also Brock less than a year from diverticulitis surgery where they</v>

3584
01:30:26.161 --> 01:30:31.161
<v Speaker 3>had to remove I think 12 inches of his colon or is um,</v>

3585
01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:32.290
<v Speaker 3>well it was,</v>

3586
01:30:32.290 --> 01:30:35.130
<v Speaker 3>it's not even an immediate or I thought it was at the time then I talked to,</v>

3587
01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.451
<v Speaker 3>of all people,</v>

3588
01:30:36.451 --> 01:30:41.170
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bordain told me now people get diverticulitis sometimes from seeds like</v>

3589
01:30:41.171 --> 01:30:41.420
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3590
01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:42.930
<v Speaker 3>it'll get stuck in your intestines.</v>

3591
01:30:43.170 --> 01:30:44.003
<v Speaker 3>So they had wrong.</v>

3592
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3593
01:30:44.281 --> 01:30:46.350
<v Speaker 3>well it's just things get caught and stuck.</v>

3594
01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3595
01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:47.530
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

3596
01:30:47.530 --> 01:30:51.060
<v Speaker 3>they had to remove 12 inches of his intestines.</v>

3597
01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.110
<v Speaker 3>So that opened him</v>

3598
01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:54.391
<v Speaker 3>while he was,</v>

3599
01:30:54.391 --> 01:30:55.470
<v Speaker 3>and then he came back.</v>

3600
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:56.620
<v Speaker 3>But he was done as,</v>

3601
01:30:56.621 --> 01:30:58.650
<v Speaker 3>as the Brock Lesnar that everybody feared.</v>

3602
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:59.011
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3603
01:30:59.011 --> 01:30:59.460
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3604
01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.040
<v Speaker 3>he says that he was compromised even before that.</v>

3605
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:06.540
<v Speaker 3>He said he was compromised before the cane fight and before a lot of his other</v>

3606
01:31:06.541 --> 01:31:06.781
<v Speaker 3>fights,</v>

3607
01:31:06.781 --> 01:31:09.650
<v Speaker 3>even the fight with chain Carwyn from diverticulitis,</v>

3608
01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:12.450
<v Speaker 3>like who is suffering from it from a law for a long time.</v>

3609
01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:13.890
<v Speaker 3>And he just thought that,</v>

3610
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:14.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3611
01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:15.930
<v Speaker 3>it was just exhausted from training,</v>

3612
01:31:15.931 --> 01:31:19.140
<v Speaker 3>but really he was having this blockage and all this issue.</v>

3613
01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

3614
01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.120
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

3615
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:21.781
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3616
01:31:21.781 --> 01:31:22.141
<v Speaker 3>it was fun.</v>

3617
01:31:22.141 --> 01:31:24.690
<v Speaker 3>Talking to a as two 56 is incorrect.</v>

3618
01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:25.171
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

3619
01:31:25.171 --> 01:31:26.040
<v Speaker 3>that's not true.</v>

3620
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:27.451
<v Speaker 3>When he waited,</v>

3621
01:31:27.451 --> 01:31:29.220
<v Speaker 3>he was to 65.</v>

3622
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:30.870
<v Speaker 3>If you look at it over him over,</v>

3623
01:31:30.871 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 3>he was over in was to 65 as well.</v>

3624
01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:37.020
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at ovary on the scale for that fight,</v>

3625
01:31:37.170 --> 01:31:37.560
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

3626
01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:37.881
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3627
01:31:37.881 --> 01:31:38.280
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3628
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:42.020
<v Speaker 3>that's a great picture of the two of them facing down like Jesus Christ or bolts</v>

3629
01:31:42.021 --> 01:31:42.854
<v Speaker 3>so jacked,</v>

3630
01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:43.830
<v Speaker 3>so big.</v>

3631
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:44.730
<v Speaker 3>But it's not like there's six,</v>

3632
01:31:44.731 --> 01:31:45.330
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>

3633
01:31:45.330 --> 01:31:46.163
<v Speaker 3>When Overeem,</v>

3634
01:31:48.630 --> 01:31:50.100
<v Speaker 3>when Overeem was,</v>

3635
01:31:50.101 --> 01:31:50.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3636
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.800
<v Speaker 3>was standing there flexing on the scale,</v>

3637
01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:53.191

3671
01:32:34.991 --> 01:32:36.370
<v Speaker 2>they put it in the contract.</v>

3672
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.360
<v Speaker 2>We do not test for steroids.</v>

3673
01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3674
01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I thought he said they tested it and then just like,</v>

3675
01:32:40.331 --> 01:32:41.164
<v Speaker 2>we don't give a shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but just want to know.</v>

3677
01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.390
<v Speaker 2>I think they test,</v>

3678
01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:43.870
<v Speaker 2>they took,</v>

3679
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:44.950
<v Speaker 2>they took tests,</v>

3680
01:32:44.951 --> 01:32:46.480
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't really test you.</v>

3681
01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:46.901
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

3682
01:32:46.901 --> 01:32:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are big ring card girl that she was so young.</v>

3683
01:32:50.081 --> 01:32:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Which one was that?</v>

3684
01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:51.483
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3685
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:54.160
<v Speaker 2>he was a gold Barilla son.</v>

3686
01:32:54.161 --> 01:32:54.994
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

3687
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.800
<v Speaker 2>It's blonde hair.</v>

3688
01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.281
<v Speaker 2>He should,</v>

3689
01:32:57.281 --> 01:33:00.630
<v Speaker 2>he should have been Nazi in the war that he's missed his call.</v>

3690
01:33:01.170 --> 01:33:03.640
<v Speaker 2>He would have been the one of the most feared Nazis there were.</v>

3691
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:04.571
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

3692
01:33:04.571 --> 01:33:05.620
<v Speaker 2>if he was a fucking Nazi,</v>

3693
01:33:05.621 --> 01:33:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I would have rooted for the other team.</v>

3694
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:09.520
<v Speaker 2>He was a viking Nazi's dude.</v>

3695
01:33:09.521 --> 01:33:11.920
<v Speaker 2>He would have been on one of them boats with a dragon on the front of it.</v>

3696
01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:15.813
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

3697
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean underrated Jon Jones for a weed head.</v>

3698
01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:20.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3699
01:33:20.141 --> 01:33:20.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3700
01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:23.610
<v Speaker 2>everybody gives all the credit to fucking Nate and nick fair.</v>

3701
01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:24.483
<v Speaker 2>They've earned it.</v>

3702
01:33:24.610 --> 01:33:27.000
<v Speaker 2>But when you would give a fuck at those breast strips,</v>

3703
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:28.840
<v Speaker 2>half a strip was the dose.</v>

3704
01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

3705
01:33:30.010 --> 01:33:30.631
<v Speaker 2>And on the plane.</v>

3706
01:33:30.631 --> 01:33:30.971
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

3707
01:33:30.971 --> 01:33:31.560
<v Speaker 2>how'd you got it?</v>

3708
01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:32.111
<v Speaker 2>What am I find?</v>

3709
01:33:32.111 --> 01:33:33.550
<v Speaker 2>His compliments was Jon Jones.</v>

3710
01:33:33.551 --> 01:33:34.540
<v Speaker 2>I heard somebody else goes,</v>

3711
01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:34.901
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3712

3714
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:37.383
<v Speaker 2>or just your fear.</v>

3715
01:33:37.450 --> 01:33:38.440
<v Speaker 2>It's always got great weed.</v>

3716
01:33:39.190 --> 01:33:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3717
01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Hell fucking yes.</v>

3718
01:33:40.931 --> 01:33:41.764
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that.</v>

3719
01:33:42.190 --> 01:33:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I gave him a package of breath strips and he ate the whole bag</v>

3720
01:33:47.650 --> 01:33:48.371
<v Speaker 2>is the dose.</v>

3721
01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:49.750
<v Speaker 2>He took two and you're like,</v>

3722
01:33:49.751 --> 01:33:49.901
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

3723
01:33:49.901 --> 01:33:50.060
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

3724
01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:50.670
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

3725
01:33:50.670 --> 01:33:51.071
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3726
01:33:51.071 --> 01:33:51.491
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan,</v>

3727
01:33:51.491 --> 01:33:52.324
<v Speaker 2>I'll be fine.</v>

3728
01:33:52.410 --> 01:33:53.050
<v Speaker 2>It was fine.</v>

3729
01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I was so scared for him.</v>

3730
01:33:54.730 --> 01:33:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I was paranoid because I gave Tommy buns a half and we flew to Florida.</v>

3731
01:33:59.710 --> 01:34:00.400
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3732
01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.420
<v Speaker 2>he told me,</v>

3733
01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:02.170

3734

3735
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:03.130
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3736
01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I swear to God when we landed,</v>

3737
01:34:04.471 --> 01:34:04.730
<v Speaker 2>he told,</v>

3738
01:34:04.730 --> 01:34:04.990
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3739
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:06.540
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I was gonna make it.</v>

3740
01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.110
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of those with you before.</v>

3741
01:34:08.111 --> 01:34:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I really thought,</v>

3742
01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I really thought I couldn't make it.</v>

3743
01:34:10.151 --> 01:34:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I really thought there's no way I'm going to be able to survive this flight.</v>

3744
01:34:13.571 --> 01:34:14.351
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to freak out.</v>

3745
01:34:14.351 --> 01:34:15.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have them land somewhere.</v>

3746
01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.830
<v Speaker 2>I almost told the stewardess before he took off.</v>

3747
01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I was close to be like,</v>

3748
01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:20.490
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing,</v>

3749
01:34:20.490 --> 01:34:22.240
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing this before we were on the runway.</v>

3750
01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:25.330
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that stopped me from doing it is knowing the abuse I would have</v>

3751
01:34:25.331 --> 01:34:26.350
<v Speaker 2>taken from you verbally.</v>

3752
01:34:26.630 --> 01:34:27.520
<v Speaker 2>That's two years.</v>

3753
01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:28.241
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm like,</v>

3754
01:34:28.241 --> 01:34:29.074
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather die.</v>

3755
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.940
<v Speaker 2>I love those days.</v>

3756
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:32.170
<v Speaker 2>It was so fun.</v>

3757
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:33.423
<v Speaker 2>I was actually,</v>

3758
01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I felt bad for you a couple of times in my life.</v>

3759
01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3760
01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 2>One time me and nick use,</v>

3761
01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:41.200
<v Speaker 2>if we're doing a corporate and Vegas and went to the new Aria and we took</v>

3762
01:34:41.201 --> 01:34:43.270
<v Speaker 2>edibles and we walked around and I was like,</v>

3763
01:34:43.330 --> 01:34:43.451
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3764

<v Speaker 2>Rogan's too famous and Bega,</v>

3765
01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:45.640
<v Speaker 2>he can't do this.</v>

3766
01:34:45.641 --> 01:34:47.200
<v Speaker 2>He can't get this fucked up and walk around,</v>

3767
01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:48.760
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3768
01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.310
<v Speaker 2>but watching the fights on edibles,</v>

3769
01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3770
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.141

01:34:52.721 --> 01:34:53.840
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to experience that.</v>

3773
01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3774
01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:55.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

3775
01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:57.950
<v Speaker 2>You can't have to do commentary 100% sober.</v>

3776
01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I tried early in the days,</v>

3777
01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:00.741
<v Speaker 2>early in the day.</v>

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3845
01:36:33.271 --> 01:36:34.650
<v Speaker 3>That guy was the shit.</v>

3846
01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:35.221
<v Speaker 3>He gave me.</v>

3849
01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:40.110
<v Speaker 3>But this little little person that lived,</v>

3850
01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:40.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3851
01:36:40.690 --> 01:36:42.150
<v Speaker 3>alongside human beings,</v>

3852
01:36:42.450 --> 01:36:42.990
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3853
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:44.460
<v Speaker 3>see if my timeline is right.</v>

3854
01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:47.220
<v Speaker 3>They have speech they don't know,</v>

3855
01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.780
<v Speaker 3>but they know they use tools.</v>

3856
01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:49.803
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3857
01:36:50.770 --> 01:36:52.720
<v Speaker 3>That always makes sure to paint them with tool to show you what,</v>

3858
01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:53.990
<v Speaker 3>95,000,</v>

3859
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:54.990
<v Speaker 3>70,000 years ago.</v>

3860
01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:55.141
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3861
01:36:55.141 --> 01:36:55.530
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

3862
01:36:55.530 --> 01:36:56.940
<v Speaker 3>17,000 years ago.</v>

3863
01:36:56.970 --> 01:36:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3864
01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.550
<v Speaker 3>Why does it say he bunked w what's that one?</v>

3865
01:36:59.551 --> 01:36:59.941
<v Speaker 3>Hobbit.</v>

3866
01:36:59.941 --> 01:37:01.140
<v Speaker 3>Human species debunked.</v>

3867
01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:02.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's correct.</v>

3868
01:37:02.461 --> 01:37:03.780
<v Speaker 3>It says new historian,</v>

3869
01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:04.681
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

3870
01:37:04.681 --> 01:37:08.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that's probably an old article or audiences.</v>

3871
01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:09.301
<v Speaker 3>What year?</v>

3872
01:37:09.301 --> 01:37:10.170
<v Speaker 3>What was that article?</v>

3873
01:37:10.171 --> 01:37:11.004
<v Speaker 3>When is that?</v>

3874
01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:12.083
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago.</v>

3875
01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:12.820
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago?</v>

3876
01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:13.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3877
01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:14.673
<v Speaker 3>Was it 10 years ago?</v>

3878
01:37:14.850 --> 01:37:17.950
<v Speaker 3>2004 the talking about it.</v>

3879
01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:18.893
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

3880
01:37:19.230 --> 01:37:21.930
<v Speaker 3>so it's 2014 is the article that's fairly recently.</v>

3881
01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:23.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the consensus.</v>

3882
01:37:23.881 --> 01:37:26.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the consensus is that it's been debunked.</v>

3883
01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Tongue part is about the cranial volume or something.</v>

3884
01:37:29.190 --> 01:37:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3885
01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:30.413
<v Speaker 3>brain size,</v>

3886
01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.250
<v Speaker 3>but not that it was a separate species.</v>

3887
01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Cranium volume was calculated to be 430 million milliliters,</v>

3888
01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.290
<v Speaker 3>which puts it within the range of modern human living in the same region.</v>

3889
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:44.490
<v Speaker 3>They went further comparing the size of the circumference of the Occipital,</v>

3890
01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:48.450
<v Speaker 3>said the word occipital frontal section of the skull to patients with</v>

3891
01:37:48.451 --> 01:37:50.220
<v Speaker 3>developmental disorders in that region.</v>

3892
01:37:50.221 --> 01:37:50.641
<v Speaker 3>The planet.</v>

3893
01:37:50.641 --> 01:37:52.920
<v Speaker 3>They found the measurements were indeed similar.</v>

3894
01:37:53.190 --> 01:37:55.830
<v Speaker 3>If lb one did have down syndrome,</v>

3895
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.680
<v Speaker 3>then it would explain this short femurs as well.</v>

3896
01:37:58.681 --> 01:37:59.400
<v Speaker 3>Hence,</v>

3897
01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.010
<v Speaker 3>when calculated statistically for normal growth,</v>

3898
01:38:02.011 --> 01:38:04.350
<v Speaker 3>they would yield a height of just over four feet,</v>

3899
01:38:04.351 --> 01:38:06.780
<v Speaker 3>which matches up with some humans living on Flores.</v>

3900
01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3901
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3902
01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:08.761
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

3903
01:38:08.761 --> 01:38:12.180
<v Speaker 3>I think this is probably one of those heavily debated things,</v>

3904
01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:13.800
<v Speaker 3>but you're trying to recreate,</v>

3905
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3906
01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:17.390
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing called island dwarfism that happens too.</v>

3907
01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3908
01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:18.020
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3909
01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:18.781
<v Speaker 3>it's a really odd,</v>

3910
01:38:18.781 --> 01:38:20.310
<v Speaker 3>because it happens to mammals,</v>

3911
01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:23.430
<v Speaker 3>but the opposite takes place with lizards and reptile.</v>

3912
01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:24.293
<v Speaker 3>Massive.</v>

3913
01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3914
01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Reptiles get massive like Komodo dragons on the island of Comodo.</v>

3915
01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Scariest giant.</v>

3916
01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.020
<v Speaker 3>They get huge.</v>

3917
01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:32.700
<v Speaker 3>They're their monitor lizards really,</v>

3918
01:38:32.701 --> 01:38:34.020
<v Speaker 3>essentially that are enormous.</v>

3919
01:38:34.050 --> 01:38:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Whereas elephants that live on islands get tiny.</v>

3920
01:38:37.291 --> 01:38:38.670
<v Speaker 3>They have these warf elephants.</v>

3921
01:38:38.671 --> 01:38:39.504
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3922
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:39.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3923
01:38:39.991 --> 01:38:43.350
<v Speaker 3>See that island morphis room to have to cover,</v>

3924
01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:45.180
<v Speaker 3>so no less resources.</v>

3925
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:47.650
<v Speaker 3>So they adapt to the taxes.</v>

3926
01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Less food.</v>

3927
01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:48.451
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3928
01:38:48.451 --> 01:38:50.760
<v Speaker 3>look how tiny that elephant is that lives on those.</v>

3929
01:38:50.761 --> 01:38:51.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3930
01:38:51.031 --> 01:38:52.800
<v Speaker 3>it's an elephant that's like shorter than you.</v>

3931
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:53.730
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3932
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:54.760
<v Speaker 3>And Elephant.</v>

3933
01:38:54.770 --> 01:38:55.530
<v Speaker 3>It's through.</v>

3934
01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3935
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:56.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3936
01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.400
<v Speaker 3>that's like a elephant that's like my kid's height.</v>

3937
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.811
<v Speaker 3>Like this is,</v>

3938
01:39:00.811 --> 01:39:02.520
<v Speaker 3>it happens with all sorts of different animals.</v>

3939
01:39:02.521 --> 01:39:03.810
<v Speaker 3>He Dwarf Buffalo.</v>

3940
01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3941
01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:05.910
<v Speaker 3>Island dwarfism.</v>

3942
01:39:05.911 --> 01:39:10.140
<v Speaker 3>They think it's because these animals adapt to the fact that there's a limited</v>

3943
01:39:10.141 --> 01:39:12.230
<v Speaker 3>amount of living on a territory.</v>

3944
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.580
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3945
01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.820
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to cover long distances to get to something.</v>

3946
01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:15.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3947
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.130
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy what happens with animals,</v>

3948
01:39:17.131 --> 01:39:20.820
<v Speaker 3>men when they figure out like what they need to do to survive.</v>

3949
01:39:21.150 --> 01:39:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the things that a I was reading about really recently was um,</v>

3950
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.110
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3951
01:39:26.110 --> 01:39:26.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3952
01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:27.361
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

3953
01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:29.640
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had it off the top of my head,</v>

3954
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.350
<v Speaker 3>but these moths that lived in a separate area,</v>

3955
01:39:34.351 --> 01:39:39.351
<v Speaker 3>an area where things were darker and they change from a light colored moth to a</v>

3956
01:39:39.571 --> 01:39:40.650
<v Speaker 3>black moth.</v>

3957
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Like really quickly.</v>

3958
01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:42.960
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3959
01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:43.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3960
01:39:43.351 --> 01:39:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Like really quickly.</v>

3961
01:39:44.341 --> 01:39:47.640
<v Speaker 3>Like they did it over a couple of generations and they're trying to figure out</v>

3962
01:39:47.641 --> 01:39:48.900
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck this happened.</v>

3963
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:52.590
<v Speaker 3>See if he could find that couple of generations peppered moth.</v>

3964
01:39:52.591 --> 01:39:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3965
01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:53.881
<v Speaker 3>Really fast.</v>

3966
01:39:53.881 --> 01:39:54.141
<v Speaker 3>Like it,</v>

3967
01:39:54.141 --> 01:39:55.170
<v Speaker 3>it blew them away.</v>

3968
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.510
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand how it happened so quickly.</v>

3969
01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I think there's like,</v>

3970
01:39:58.890 --> 01:39:59.311
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3971
01:39:59.311 --> 01:40:04.050
<v Speaker 3>there's so little that's truly understood about what adaptive changes can</v>

3972
01:40:04.051 --> 01:40:05.730
<v Speaker 3>possibly happen within animals.</v>

3973
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:10.050
<v Speaker 3>Like for instances is documentary called relentless enemies and it's all about</v>

3974
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.250
<v Speaker 3>you're going to piss in something</v>

3975
01:40:13.450 --> 01:40:14.550
<v Speaker 3>we're going to use though.</v>

3976
01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:15.413
<v Speaker 3>Kombucha bottle.</v>

3977
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.841
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3978
01:40:15.841 --> 01:40:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Where's the bottle?</v>

3979
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:17.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3980
01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:17.251
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3981
01:40:17.251 --> 01:40:17.800
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

3982
01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:17.901
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3983
01:40:17.901 --> 01:40:18.840
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was full.</v>

3984
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:19.860
<v Speaker 3>It's the widest mouth.</v>

3985
01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:20.651
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3986
01:40:20.651 --> 01:40:21.450
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3987
01:40:21.450 --> 01:40:22.111
<v Speaker 3>You know what you should do?</v>

3988
01:40:22.111 --> 01:40:23.580
<v Speaker 3>You should get one of those um,</v>

3989
01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.700
<v Speaker 3>ice bags that people use for.</v>

3990
01:40:26.701 --> 01:40:27.534
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3991
01:40:28.410 --> 01:40:30.510
<v Speaker 3>definitely don't show that it will get kicked off of Youtube.</v>

3992
01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.120
<v Speaker 3>There's a ice bags that um,</v>

3993
01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:37.860
<v Speaker 3>people use like compression ice bags and they have like a nice wide mouth.</v>

3994
01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:38.251
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3995
01:40:38.251 --> 01:40:38.780
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>

3996
01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I had some of them here,</v>

3997
01:40:39.781 --> 01:40:41.190
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to give it to God.</v>

3998
01:40:41.191 --> 01:40:42.024
<v Speaker 3>Dammit.</v>

3999
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.960
<v Speaker 3>That's listening in it.</v>

4000
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:44.610
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work so much.</v>

4001
01:40:44.611 --> 01:40:45.091
<v Speaker 3>Piss through.</v>

4002
01:40:45.091 --> 01:40:45.924
<v Speaker 3>Much piss.</v>

4003
01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4005
01:40:47.370 --> 01:40:48.203
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

4006
01:40:51.670 --> 01:40:53.580
<v Speaker 3>Top ones off the topping it off.</v>

4007
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 3>I'll use this.</v>

4008
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.730
<v Speaker 4>I'll use this.</v>

4009
01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:57.280
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you just run off to the bathroom real quick and just hold onto your</v>

4010
01:40:57.281 --> 01:40:57.951
<v Speaker 4>deck and scared.</v>

4011
01:40:57.951 --> 01:40:58.330
<v Speaker 4>Jeff,</v>

4012
01:40:58.330 --> 01:40:59.200
<v Speaker 4>why don't you just suck it?</v>

4013
01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:01.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I want to do that.</v>

4014
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:02.380
<v Speaker 4>Don't piss in that cup please.</v>

4015
01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:03.513
<v Speaker 4>What do you got?</v>

4016
01:41:04.330 --> 01:41:06.130
<v Speaker 4>What's that other of Tumbler?</v>

4017
01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:06.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4018
01:41:06.311 --> 01:41:06.581
<v Speaker 4>go ahead.</v>

4019
01:41:06.581 --> 01:41:07.414
<v Speaker 4>Pissing that could,</v>

4020
01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:08.273
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what that's for.</v>

4021
01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.490
<v Speaker 4>Definitely take the piss out of here though afterwards.</v>

4022
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.051
<v Speaker 4>You don't want it with me.</v>

4023
01:41:14.051 --> 01:41:14.884
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a wasted</v>

4024
01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:18.753
<v Speaker 4>pieces with it.</v>

01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:09.700
<v Speaker 4>I can't operate under the idea that you can tell him what to say.</v>

4068
01:42:10.330 --> 01:42:11.020
<v Speaker 4>What'd they say?</v>

4069
01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:12.850
<v Speaker 4>Don't say something they said it's offensive.</v>

<v Speaker 4>what did you say it?</v>

4072
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:18.460
<v Speaker 4>I think it was something along the lines of like a,</v>

4073
01:42:18.490 --> 01:42:22.250
<v Speaker 4>if you're a human resources person and you have to a higher,</v>

<v Speaker 4>doing something else.</v>

4078
01:42:25.901 --> 01:42:27.430
<v Speaker 4>You could fucking quickly hire somebody,</v>

<v Speaker 4>used Zipcar,</v>

4080

4081
01:42:29.831 --> 01:42:33.700
<v Speaker 4>You can bring in like a Ziploc bag and keep putting like use socks in there that</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm just going off top of my head trying to be funny.</v>

4085
01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.193
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty reasonable.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Three minute read on a one minute by yeah.</v>

4087
01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:41.531

4088
01:42:41.531 --> 01:42:42.010
<v Speaker 4>it's offensive.</v>

4089
01:42:42.010 --> 01:42:43.000
<v Speaker 4>Like that's fine.</v>

4090
01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:43.810
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

4091

<v Speaker 4>so I'll just give up the money.</v>

4099
01:42:52.991 --> 01:42:53.824
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

4100
01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:54.581

<v Speaker 2>but they always let me go do whatever I want.</v>

4171
01:44:20.871 --> 01:44:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck you mean.</v>

4172
01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:22.370

<v Speaker 2>if I started saying I wear me on,</v>

4174
01:44:23.731 --> 01:44:24.400
<v Speaker 2>these are super credible.</v>

4175
01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Also when you have that last bit of calm on your Dick,</v>

4176
01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.340
<v Speaker 2>it'll soak them up perfectly.</v>

4177
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.670
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

4178
01:44:28.670 --> 01:44:29.300
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>

4179
01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:29.930
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

4180
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:30.763
<v Speaker 2>They don't care.</v>

4181
01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:33.111
<v Speaker 2>They're not saying,</v>

4182
01:44:33.111 --> 01:44:33.920
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>

4183
01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.430

4188
01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:39.231
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4189
01:44:39.231 --> 01:44:40.400
<v Speaker 2>you're not shitting on the product.</v>

4190
01:44:40.401 --> 01:44:41.510
<v Speaker 2>You're not saying it's uncomfortable.</v>

4191
01:44:41.511 --> 01:44:42.344
<v Speaker 2>So go ahead.</v>

4192
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4193
01:44:43.050 --> 01:44:44.600
<v Speaker 2>So super corporate guys,</v>

4194
01:44:44.690 --> 01:44:47.410
<v Speaker 2>the ones that zip recruiter or that kind of shit.</v>

4195
01:44:47.411 --> 01:44:48.244
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4196
01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:48.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4197
01:44:48.450 --> 01:44:49.190
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

4198
01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:49.611
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

4199
01:44:49.611 --> 01:44:50.181
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

4200
01:44:50.181 --> 01:44:51.014
<v Speaker 2>It's just signs.</v>

4201
01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4202
01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I make money by continuously focusing on free speech and I'll lose money in some</v>

4203
01:44:58.341 --> 01:45:01.040
<v Speaker 2>spots and makes money and other spots and this is all just part of it.</v>

4204
01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:01.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4205
01:45:01.401 --> 01:45:05.810
<v Speaker 2>You can't really think about it like only looking to make money every time.</v>

4206
01:45:05.811 --> 01:45:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Make more cause that universal growth paradigm,</v>

4207
01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:09.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4208
01:45:09.171 --> 01:45:12.020
<v Speaker 2>that's only for corporations and then I'm going to be doing straight ad reads</v>

4209
01:45:12.021 --> 01:45:13.370
<v Speaker 2>and my listeners can get bored as fuck.</v>

4210
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lose listeners.</v>

4211
01:45:14.301 --> 01:45:17.240
<v Speaker 2>So then I'll be able to make less money off ads in the long run because of that</v>

4212
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:19.590
<v Speaker 2>more as less money as opposed to like fewer ads more.</v>

4213
01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:20.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4214
01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:21.290
<v Speaker 2>well not only that,</v>

4215
01:45:21.291 --> 01:45:23.420
<v Speaker 2>it's like how much time do we really have left?</v>

4216
01:45:23.530 --> 01:45:24.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4217
01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.310
<v Speaker 2>If we,</v>

4218
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:28.400
<v Speaker 2>if both of us live another 45 years,</v>

4219
01:45:28.401 --> 01:45:30.320
<v Speaker 2>would it be fucking amazing?</v>

4220
01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4221
01:45:31.130 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 2>That's 45 seasons of sober October's,</v>

4222
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:36.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4223
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:37.490
<v Speaker 2>that would be amazing.</v>

4224
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

4225
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Two 45 the less sober October done.</v>

4226
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't have gotten roped into this one.</v>

4227
01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Are you done because of the contest?</v>

4228
01:45:44.631 --> 01:45:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Are you done because of the sobriety.</v>

4229
01:45:46.341 --> 01:45:48.020
<v Speaker 2>So what can we do in January?</v>

4230
01:45:48.210 --> 01:45:48.981
<v Speaker 2>Why January?</v>

4231
01:45:48.981 --> 01:45:51.320
<v Speaker 2>So October is the best drinking month in New York.</v>

4232
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:52.610
<v Speaker 2>We could definitely do it in January,</v>

4233
01:45:52.611 --> 01:45:54.140
<v Speaker 2>but w w New Year's Eve.</v>

4234
01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:55.463
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4235
01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Or February even.</v>

4236
01:45:58.350 --> 01:45:59.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4237
01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:03.840
<v Speaker 2>because technically after midnight you'd still be fucked up and you would never,</v>

4238
01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:04.940
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't mind November.</v>

4239
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:09.780
<v Speaker 2>You want a nice,</v>

4248
01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:11.960

4249
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.471
<v Speaker 2>the memories.</v>

4250

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.770
<v Speaker 2>They're not alcohol based?</v>

4253
01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:16.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4254
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:17.383
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

4255
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:18.291
<v Speaker 2>You might want something,</v>

4256
01:46:18.291 --> 01:46:19.410
<v Speaker 2>but that's what she really wants.</v>

4257
01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.720
<v Speaker 2>If you said no stuffing,</v>

4258
01:46:20.721 --> 01:46:20.961
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>

4259
01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:21.351
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

4260
01:46:21.351 --> 01:46:22.184
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it.</v>

4261
01:46:22.730 --> 01:46:24.040
<v Speaker 2>But no alcohol and Thanksgiving,</v>

4262
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:24.920
<v Speaker 2>that's not a big deal.</v>

4263
01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:27.960
<v Speaker 2>What about March?</v>

4264
01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:28.853
<v Speaker 2>March is okay.</v>

4280
01:46:43.170 --> 01:46:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Quarter Irish spring big.</v>

4281
01:46:45.621 --> 01:46:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Well guess what we're in.</v>

4282
01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:47.550
<v Speaker 2>We don't have that anymore.</v>

4283
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:49.890
<v Speaker 2>You've got to go whatever.</v>

4284
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.780
<v Speaker 5>There's always a reason by October is a one of them.</v>

4285
01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 5>All the Nyu kids have calmed down and going to classes.</v>

4286
01:46:54.151 --> 01:46:54.890
<v Speaker 5>So like you can actually,</v>

4301
01:47:11.641 --> 01:47:12.000
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

4302
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.530
<v Speaker 5>what's really important is that we beat Bert.</v>

4303

<v Speaker 5>I for sure.</v>

4304

4305
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:16.160

01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:22.110
<v Speaker 5>can we talk about drugs at the UFC for a little bit?</v>

4311
01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:22.950
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

4312
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:27.950
<v Speaker 5>So with Diaz always bringing the breath strips there be this time where it</v>

4313
01:47:29.131 --> 01:47:29.950
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't kick in,</v>

4314
01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:30.600
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't kick it.</v>

4315
01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.680
<v Speaker 5>And you look over like feeling it.</v>

4316
01:47:31.681 --> 01:47:31.950
<v Speaker 5>You'd be like,</v>

4317
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:32.130
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

4318
01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:33.270
<v Speaker 5>maybe sort of or,</v>

4319
01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:35.460
<v Speaker 5>or one of those jolly ranchers that they'd have.</v>

4320
01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:36.740
<v Speaker 5>I remember having a side,</v>

4321
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.140
<v Speaker 5>I remember eating a jolly rancher like before the fight started because I would</v>

4322
01:47:40.141 --> 01:47:41.100
<v Speaker 5>get an answer early with you.</v>

4323
01:47:41.610 --> 01:47:43.350
<v Speaker 5>And I'm kind shocking.</v>

4324
01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm like the US and some other guy.</v>

4325
01:47:45.090 --> 01:47:47.010
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knew me back then and it was like,</v>

4326
01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:47.371
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

4327
01:47:47.371 --> 01:47:48.700
<v Speaker 5>I think somebody's smoking weed or look,</v>

4328
01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:49.720
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4329
01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.160
<v Speaker 5>we come from,</v>

4330
01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:53.190
<v Speaker 5>from home and he smelled the weed from the jolly ranchers.</v>

4331
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:54.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4332
01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:57.330
<v Speaker 5>And nobody could comprehend back then that it could be coming from your jolly</v>

4333
01:47:57.331 --> 01:47:57.661
<v Speaker 5>rancher.</v>

4334
01:47:57.661 --> 01:48:00.030
<v Speaker 5>It's Olay from smokeable 2003.</v>

4335
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:02.663
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4336
01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.030
<v Speaker 5>and then you look over,</v>

4337
01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:04.980
<v Speaker 5>you're feeling it sort of,</v>

4338
01:48:05.010 --> 01:48:06.030
<v Speaker 5>and then you look over again.</v>

4339
01:48:06.031 --> 01:48:10.320
<v Speaker 5>And Diaz just like in a trance when you realized you are too,</v>

4340
01:48:10.321 --> 01:48:11.530
<v Speaker 5>and you both look and Diego</v>

4341
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:14.761
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

4342
01:48:14.761 --> 01:48:15.650
<v Speaker 5>he bought the devil in.</v>

4343
01:48:15.650 --> 01:48:16.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4344
01:48:16.170 --> 01:48:17.730
<v Speaker 5>And it was just fucking great.</v>

4345
01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:18.151
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

4346
01:48:18.151 --> 01:48:18.331
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4347
01:48:18.331 --> 01:48:18.990
<v Speaker 5>I've talked about something,</v>

4348
01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:19.681
<v Speaker 5>this is not happening.</v>

4349
01:48:19.681 --> 01:48:21.630
<v Speaker 5>Stories where it's like you don't even know who's winning fights.</v>

4350
01:48:21.631 --> 01:48:23.100
<v Speaker 5>You just know you're enjoying watching them.</v>

4351
01:48:23.101 --> 01:48:23.670
<v Speaker 5>Acid,</v>

4352
01:48:23.670 --> 01:48:24.720
<v Speaker 5>one of the UFC events.</v>

4353
01:48:25.170 --> 01:48:25.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4354
01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:27.360
<v Speaker 5>Back when we were sitting with kill scene and,</v>

4355
01:48:27.361 --> 01:48:27.900
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

4356
01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:28.733
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

4357
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:32.580
<v Speaker 5>we didn't tell him red band new and just do an acid.</v>

4358
01:48:32.581 --> 01:48:33.290
<v Speaker 5>I remember how low,</v>

4359
01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:34.650
<v Speaker 5>how into it you were,</v>

4360
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:37.620
<v Speaker 5>that part of me is you never quite know how people can react to things.</v>

4361
01:48:37.621 --> 01:48:38.520
<v Speaker 5>So you really know them.</v>

4362
01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:41.970
<v Speaker 5>And like it could have gone like it was my place of work.</v>

4363
01:48:41.971 --> 01:48:42.570
<v Speaker 5>You can't,</v>

4364
01:48:42.570 --> 01:48:43.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4365
01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:44.550
<v Speaker 5>a small part of me thinks maybe,</v>

4366
01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:47.970
<v Speaker 5>but then you're texting us while you're in the fights where all you guys,</v>

4367
01:48:47.971 --> 01:48:48.481
<v Speaker 5>where are you got to sit?</v>

4368
01:48:48.481 --> 01:48:49.320
<v Speaker 5>And it wasn't one of those,</v>

4369
01:48:49.321 --> 01:48:50.071
<v Speaker 5>we got bottom floor,</v>

4370
01:48:50.071 --> 01:48:51.840
<v Speaker 5>we're in the fucking stands for that one.</v>

4371
01:48:52.290 --> 01:48:54.630
<v Speaker 5>And we kept looking at us until you found us.</v>

4372
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:59.380
<v Speaker 5>Like Dan's every I like you're doing as a great,</v>

4373
01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:00.421
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>

4374
01:49:00.421 --> 01:49:02.100
<v Speaker 5>I've never saw see stuff so clearly.</v>

4375
01:49:02.101 --> 01:49:05.910
<v Speaker 5>I remember Forrest Griffin coming in with a shipping up to Boston playing and</v>

4376
01:49:05.911 --> 01:49:06.691
<v Speaker 5>everyone cheering.</v>

4377
01:49:06.691 --> 01:49:07.111
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

4378
01:49:07.111 --> 01:49:07.980
<v Speaker 5>this is the Colosseum.</v>

4379
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:11.140
<v Speaker 5>We're watching what it was like in the coliseum for a few people fighting lions.</v>

4380
01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.190
<v Speaker 5>This is the,</v>

4381
01:49:12.190 --> 01:49:13.590
<v Speaker 5>everyone's cheering for blood.</v>

4382
01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.660
<v Speaker 5>How are we different than the Romans?</v>

4383
01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:18.060
<v Speaker 5>Pretty fucking similar in a lot of ways.</v>

4384
01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:18.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4385
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:19.171
<v Speaker 5>Just a modern,</v>

4386
01:49:19.171 --> 01:49:20.640
<v Speaker 5>more acceptable version of it.</v>

4387
01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:21.451
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4388
01:49:21.451 --> 01:49:23.790
<v Speaker 5>that acid that you have seen with so fucking good.</v>

4389
01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.280
<v Speaker 5>It was great.</v>

4390
01:49:25.281 --> 01:49:26.490
<v Speaker 5>He didn't want any food.</v>

4391
01:49:26.491 --> 01:49:28.380
<v Speaker 5>Red Bank sorta took care of you a little bit.</v>

4392
01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:29.130
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

4393
01:49:29.130 --> 01:49:29.311
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4397
01:49:34.530 --> 01:49:35.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4398
01:49:35.250 --> 01:49:39.780
<v Speaker 5>I went to a bunch of events outside of the UFC where we got really fucked up on</v>

4399
01:49:39.781 --> 01:49:43.530
<v Speaker 5>Adam went to that one and a at the playboy mansion Strikeforce.</v>

01:49:44.191 --> 01:49:45.120
<v Speaker 5>we got fucked on those.</v>

4403
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:46.230
<v Speaker 5>Blasted in that one.</v>

4404
01:49:46.290 --> 01:49:46.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4405
01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:47.410
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

4406
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 5>I missed out</v>

4407
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.940
<v Speaker 3>on a lot of that.</v>

4408
01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:52.300
<v Speaker 3>Like you guys sitting there in the audience had a lot more fun than</v>

4409
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:55.190
<v Speaker 5>six hours of fucking greatness.</v>

4410
01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:58.770
<v Speaker 5>So you take him early and by the very end it's like you're just coming down</v>

01:50:14.271 --> 01:50:14.811
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to come.</v>

4426
01:50:14.811 --> 01:50:15.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to take mushrooms right now.</v>

4427
01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:16.350
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

4428
01:50:16.350 --> 01:50:16.641
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4429
01:50:16.641 --> 01:50:17.360
<v Speaker 5>I'll just throw them out.</v>

4430
01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.530
<v Speaker 5>I'll have to get the mushrooms I have for you.</v>

4431
01:50:18.531 --> 01:50:19.161
<v Speaker 5>I'll throw them out,</v>

4432
01:50:19.161 --> 01:50:20.720
<v Speaker 5>I'll step on them on the ground and throw them out.</v>

4433
01:50:20.721 --> 01:50:21.071
<v Speaker 5>So he went to,</v>

4434
01:50:21.071 --> 01:50:21.291
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

4435
01:50:21.291 --> 01:50:21.591
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

4436
01:50:21.591 --> 01:50:22.011
<v Speaker 5>relax.</v>

4437
01:50:22.011 --> 01:50:22.844
<v Speaker 5>I'll take them off.</v>

4438
01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.250
<v Speaker 5>And Man,</v>

4439
01:50:25.670 --> 01:50:29.180
<v Speaker 5>it's so fun there because like you would take them,</v>

4440
01:50:29.181 --> 01:50:29.751
<v Speaker 5>you get bored,</v>

4441
01:50:29.751 --> 01:50:30.740
<v Speaker 5>there's some wrestling fight,</v>

4442
01:50:30.741 --> 01:50:31.071
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4443
01:50:31.071 --> 01:50:33.860
<v Speaker 5>where it's like they're trying to outpoint each other and you're like,</v>

4444
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:34.723
<v Speaker 5>let's go wander.</v>

4445
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:35.840
<v Speaker 5>And you just go wander.</v>

4446
01:50:35.841 --> 01:50:36.830
<v Speaker 5>You could get a hot dog.</v>

4447
01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:38.360
<v Speaker 5>We put him into a Maynard's,</v>

4448
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:39.690
<v Speaker 5>which is like jolly rancher,</v>

4449
01:50:39.691 --> 01:50:39.920
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4450
01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:40.610
<v Speaker 5>like gummy,</v>

4451
01:50:40.610 --> 01:50:41.330
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

4452
01:50:41.330 --> 01:50:44.180
<v Speaker 5>We'd stick them in there so you could reach farther and Maynard or you reach in</v>

4453
01:50:44.181 --> 01:50:46.220
<v Speaker 5>there and you feel something crunchy like a stick and you're like,</v>

4454
01:50:46.221 --> 01:50:46.641
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4455
01:50:46.641 --> 01:50:47.301
<v Speaker 5>I'm going for that.</v>

4456
01:50:47.301 --> 01:50:49.010
<v Speaker 5>We just keep eating these mushrooms.</v>

4457
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:50.840
<v Speaker 5>Some random dudes were like,</v>

4458
01:50:51.230 --> 01:50:52.010

4460
01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:57.510
<v Speaker 5>And so we went to some skybox for awhile until we got kicked out by security and</v>

4461
01:50:57.511 --> 01:50:57.930
<v Speaker 5>that was fun.</v>

4464
01:51:05.781 --> 01:51:07.610

4473
01:51:16.581 --> 01:51:17.430
<v Speaker 5>Security officer.</v>

4474
01:51:17.431 --> 01:51:19.130
<v Speaker 5>I knew about shrooms was like a cop,</v>

4475
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:21.110
<v Speaker 5>one of those that they hire there.</v>

4476
01:51:21.170 --> 01:51:21.561
<v Speaker 5>It kind of,</v>

4477
01:51:21.561 --> 01:51:23.150
<v Speaker 5>Calgary was fun.</v>

4478
01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:24.320

01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4481
01:51:26.630 --> 01:51:27.100
<v Speaker 5>doing,</v>

4482
01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:28.850
<v Speaker 5>doing that during the edibles.</v>

4483
01:51:28.851 --> 01:51:32.060
<v Speaker 5>I remember Alex Jones being there once in d has given him a cookie and it goes</v>

4484
01:51:32.061 --> 01:51:32.351
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4485
01:51:32.351 --> 01:51:32.571
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

4486
01:51:32.571 --> 01:51:32.751
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

4487
01:51:32.751 --> 01:51:33.380
<v Speaker 5>this cookie.</v>

4488
01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:33.681
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4489
01:51:33.681 --> 01:51:34.760
<v Speaker 5>And Alex Jones is like,</v>

4490
01:51:34.761 --> 01:51:35.301
<v Speaker 5>what's in the cookie?</v>

4491
01:51:35.301 --> 01:51:36.740
<v Speaker 5>And Diaz eat the fucking cookie.</v>

4492
01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:37.880
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4493
01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:39.200
<v Speaker 5>like what kind of stupid question is that?</v>

4494
01:51:39.201 --> 01:51:39.860
<v Speaker 5>You know what's in there?</v>

4495
01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:40.940
<v Speaker 5>We went to eat with him afterwards.</v>

4496
01:51:40.941 --> 01:51:42.500
<v Speaker 5>He was barbecued barbecue,</v>

4497
01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:43.820
<v Speaker 5>much more reasonable back then.</v>

4498
01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:45.553
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>

4499
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:50.830
<v Speaker 5>I never understood how they made him from crazy conspiracy theorists to alter</v>

4500
01:51:52.611 --> 01:51:53.444
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

4501
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:54.740
<v Speaker 5>I didn't get the connection there.</v>

4502
01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:55.560
<v Speaker 5>Well</v>

4503
01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:00.090
<v Speaker 3>that connection happened when he became United with like Alex Jones became</v>

4504
01:52:00.091 --> 01:52:01.320
<v Speaker 3>United with Donald Trump.</v>

4505
01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4506
01:52:02.190 --> 01:52:02.341
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4507
01:52:02.341 --> 01:52:04.370
<v Speaker 3>cause he was a big part of Donald Trump in,</v>

4508
01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:05.790
<v Speaker 3>in the campaign days,</v>

4509
01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump would call in,</v>

4510
01:52:08.670 --> 01:52:12.930
<v Speaker 3>he would call into info wars and he knew that Alex Jones had a big base and Alex</v>

4511
01:52:12.930 --> 01:52:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Jones would help them get elected.</v>

4512
01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:14.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4513
01:52:14.970 --> 01:52:15.803
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump,</v>

4514
01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:16.860
<v Speaker 3>it's very clever.</v>

4515
01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:18.450
<v Speaker 3>And who he aligns himself with.</v>

4516
01:52:18.570 --> 01:52:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see him standing there listening to Kanye West,</v>

4517
01:52:22.231 --> 01:52:27.231
<v Speaker 3>what Kanye West is ranting and saying all this crazy fucking skitzo nonsense and</v>

4518
01:52:27.241 --> 01:52:27.930
<v Speaker 3>he's like this,</v>

4519
01:52:27.930 --> 01:52:28.480
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

4520
01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.313
<v Speaker 3>That's a smart cookie.</v>

4521
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:31.080
<v Speaker 3>He's very smart.</v>

4522
01:52:31.081 --> 01:52:33.540
<v Speaker 3>And when he calls bullshit and when he doesn't call bullshit,</v>

4523
01:52:33.570 --> 01:52:34.403
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

4524
01:52:34.650 --> 01:52:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4525
01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:35.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4526
01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:39.930
<v Speaker 3>imagine if Kanye West was debating him and they were doing a presidential debate</v>

4527
01:52:39.931 --> 01:52:41.100
<v Speaker 3>and Kanye was talking like that.</v>

4528
01:52:41.101 --> 01:52:41.431
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like,</v>

4529
01:52:41.431 --> 01:52:43.590
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this guy saying?</v>

4530
01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:44.810
<v Speaker 3>What are you saying?</v>

4531
01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 3>Give enough for me so I'll let you talk.</v>

4532
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:47.083
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4533
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:48.103
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

4534
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:48.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4535
01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:53.350
<v Speaker 4>I just don't get how stones what it was because he would have him on a bunch.</v>

4536
01:52:53.690 --> 01:52:53.961
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4537
01:52:53.961 --> 01:52:54.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4538
01:52:54.231 --> 01:52:57.170
<v Speaker 4>also out outright wasn't a thing back then.</v>

4539
01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.033
<v Speaker 4>You got to realize when,</v>

4540
01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.340
<v Speaker 4>when Alex came with us to,</v>

4541
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:01.243
<v Speaker 4>to the fights,</v>

4542
01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:02.660
<v Speaker 4>that was no outright,</v>

4543
01:53:02.661 --> 01:53:03.830
<v Speaker 4>but he was more like lizard.</v>

4544
01:53:03.831 --> 01:53:05.150
<v Speaker 4>People are like are like,</v>

4545
01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:05.361
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4546
01:53:05.361 --> 01:53:07.100
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking government conspiracy.</v>

4547
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.521
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4548
01:53:07.521 --> 01:53:11.150
<v Speaker 4>He was all about don't get him started on nine 11 it's like he was all about</v>

4549
01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:12.740
<v Speaker 4>certain conspiracies.</v>

4550
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:15.730
<v Speaker 4>I remember we were in Austin once when there was a shooting at a,</v>

4551
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:17.660
<v Speaker 4>at an army base.</v>

4552
01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:19.880
<v Speaker 4>We were there right with him.</v>

4553
01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:23.210
<v Speaker 4>When the thing went out about and we were at a bar that goes,</v>

4554
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:25.820
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you they're not taking that guy alive.</v>

4555
01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:26.990
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee they won't let him talk.</v>

4556
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:28.100
<v Speaker 4>And then an hour later,</v>

4557
01:53:28.101 --> 01:53:28.870
<v Speaker 4>like they got them alive,</v>

4558
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:30.590
<v Speaker 4>the shot him in the leg or they got them alive because yeah,</v>

4559
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:33.050
<v Speaker 4>of course it got him a lot because they want them to be a fucking martyr for</v>

4560
01:53:33.051 --> 01:53:34.580
<v Speaker 4>this thing and it's like or whatever.</v>

4561
01:53:34.890 --> 01:53:35.720
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be Marta,</v>

4562
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:35.961
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4563
01:53:35.961 --> 01:53:36.171
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4564
01:53:36.171 --> 01:53:37.970
<v Speaker 4>And it's like no matter what,</v>

4565
01:53:37.971 --> 01:53:38.391
<v Speaker 4>he's just,</v>

4566
01:53:38.391 --> 01:53:41.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm spinning this to conspiracy and then I just,</v>

4567
01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:42.950
<v Speaker 4>that business is a tricky business.</v>

4568
01:53:42.951 --> 01:53:43.650
<v Speaker 4>I just don't,</v>

4569
01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:44.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I said like,</v>

4570
01:53:44.610 --> 01:53:44.771
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4571
01:53:44.771 --> 01:53:45.950
<v Speaker 4>you've got to be off the air now.</v>

4572
01:53:45.951 --> 01:53:46.460
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

4573
01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:49.070
<v Speaker 4>well that's where it's fucked up.</v>

4574
01:53:49.071 --> 01:53:50.540
<v Speaker 4>It just elicit person guy.</v>

4575
01:53:50.610 --> 01:53:51.800
<v Speaker 4>Well it's not though,</v>

4576
01:53:51.801 --> 01:53:56.750
<v Speaker 4>because like people were concerned that you're giving out bad information.</v>

4577
01:53:56.751 --> 01:53:57.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4578
01:53:57.170 --> 01:53:58.400
<v Speaker 4>And they're concerned about it.</v>

4579
01:53:58.401 --> 01:54:00.020
<v Speaker 4>But then with Alex,</v>

4580
01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:02.270
<v Speaker 4>what came out was the sandy hook thing,</v>

4581
01:54:02.630 --> 01:54:04.160
<v Speaker 4>the Sandy Hook denial thing.</v>

4582
01:54:04.330 --> 01:54:05.330
<v Speaker 4>It was when again,</v>

4583
01:54:05.331 --> 01:54:05.961
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy,</v>

4584
01:54:05.961 --> 01:54:06.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't get why that's right.</v>

4585
01:54:06.911 --> 01:54:10.100
<v Speaker 4>But it was a conspiracy involving children being murdered and their parents</v>

4586
01:54:10.101 --> 01:54:11.480
<v Speaker 4>being actors.</v>

4587
01:54:11.690 --> 01:54:14.720
<v Speaker 4>And then everyone was like some sort of a crisis actor and they were hired by</v>

4588
01:54:14.721 --> 01:54:16.310
<v Speaker 4>the government to take away people's guns.</v>

4589
01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:17.010
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

4590
01:54:17.010 --> 01:54:19.970
<v Speaker 4>this is the most radical version of shirts.</v>

4591
01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:22.850
<v Speaker 4>I understand and I understand that that's wrong and crazy.</v>

4592
01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Where do you get from there to,</v>

4593
01:54:26.001 --> 01:54:27.680
<v Speaker 4>you can't be allowed to say these crazy.</v>

4594
01:54:27.710 --> 01:54:29.660
<v Speaker 4>You've been saying these made up things before,</v>

4595
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:30.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4596
01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:31.310
<v Speaker 4>You're saying it's still,</v>

4597
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.481
<v Speaker 4>what's a free,</v>

4598
01:54:32.481 --> 01:54:33.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't get why it's a hate monger.</v>

4599
01:54:33.890 --> 01:54:34.970
<v Speaker 4>You got a really good argument.</v>

4600
01:54:34.971 --> 01:54:35.930
<v Speaker 4>But here's the argument.</v>

4601
01:54:35.931 --> 01:54:39.080
<v Speaker 4>The argument is what is Facebook?</v>

4602
01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:40.940
<v Speaker 4>What is Twitter?</v>

4603
01:54:41.210 --> 01:54:42.260
<v Speaker 4>What is Youtube?</v>

4604
01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:44.060
<v Speaker 4>Are they private companies?</v>

4605
01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:45.320
<v Speaker 4>Mercer,</v>

4606
01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:45.831
<v Speaker 4>most certainly,</v>

4607
01:54:45.831 --> 01:54:48.560
<v Speaker 4>or even more so are they utilities?</v>

4608
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:50.330
<v Speaker 4>Is it like the electricity?</v>

4609
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:51.740
<v Speaker 4>Is it like a phone?</v>

4610
01:54:51.930 --> 01:54:54.290
<v Speaker 4>Like what should you be allowed to tell someone?</v>

4611
01:54:54.291 --> 01:54:55.124
<v Speaker 4>They can't use it?</v>

4612
01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:57.680
<v Speaker 4>Like I wonder if Jack said,</v>

4613
01:54:57.681 --> 01:54:57.831
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4614
01:54:57.831 --> 01:54:58.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm shutting down Twitter.</v>

4615
01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:59.540
<v Speaker 4>If the government is like,</v>

4616
01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:00.530
<v Speaker 4>we're opening it back up again.</v>

4617
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.860
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4618
01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.420
<v Speaker 4>Or is it like NBC?</v>

4619
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:06.020
<v Speaker 4>Cause if NBC is a private company and Ari Shaffir says,</v>

4620
01:55:06.021 --> 01:55:06.440
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4621
01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.440
<v Speaker 4>the lizard people are eating kids and that's,</v>

4622
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:10.100
<v Speaker 4>that's death to run 60 minutes.</v>

4623
01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:10.791
<v Speaker 4>And they say,</v>

4624
01:55:10.791 --> 01:55:10.931
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4625
01:55:10.931 --> 01:55:10.991
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4626
01:55:10.991 --> 01:55:11.180
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4627
01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:11.451
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

4628
01:55:11.451 --> 01:55:12.284
<v Speaker 4>you're fired.</v>

4629
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:13.101
<v Speaker 4>Like Bro,</v>

4630
01:55:13.101 --> 01:55:17.120
<v Speaker 4>Zan made one fucking bad ambien joke and they canceled her.</v>

4631
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:18.290
<v Speaker 4>They kicked her off of,</v>

4632
01:55:18.291 --> 01:55:19.124
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4633
01:55:19.730 --> 01:55:19.960
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

4634
01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:20.793
<v Speaker 4>for any other reason.</v>

4635
01:55:21.610 --> 01:55:22.070
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

4636
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.670
<v Speaker 4>they weren't,</v>

4637
01:55:22.670 --> 01:55:23.503
<v Speaker 4>that's not true.</v>

4638
01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 4>Why do you say that show was a huge hit?</v>

4639
01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:28.220
<v Speaker 4>Because of the outrage over the first season when she was like,</v>

4640
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:29.090
<v Speaker 4>she supports Trump.</v>

4641
01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:29.511
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4642
01:55:29.511 --> 01:55:32.090
<v Speaker 4>but there was a giant hit,</v>

4643
01:55:32.150 --> 01:55:36.260
<v Speaker 4>but they were looking to get rid of her at this whole group was already saying,</v>

4644
01:55:36.261 --> 01:55:36.921
<v Speaker 4>we want you out.</v>

4645
01:55:36.921 --> 01:55:37.671
<v Speaker 4>We're looking for an excuse.</v>

4646
01:55:37.671 --> 01:55:41.420
<v Speaker 4>Kind of like when they got rid of you at the comedy store over filming,</v>

4647
01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:42.553
<v Speaker 4>when it was like,</v>

4648
01:55:42.710 --> 01:55:43.650
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

4649
01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:45.240
<v Speaker 4>They already wanted to get rid of you.</v>

4650
01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:46.853
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4651
01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:49.050
<v Speaker 4>and then they found an excuse to get it done.</v>

4652
01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:53.880
<v Speaker 4>That's a tricky argument because they wanted her so bad.</v>

4653
01:55:53.881 --> 01:55:54.690
<v Speaker 4>They wanted her out.</v>

4654
01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:56.960
<v Speaker 4>I think they wanted to minimize her paid.</v>

4655
01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:58.350
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

4656
01:55:58.350 --> 01:56:02.070
<v Speaker 4>But she was telling me how they were changing the way they were writing things</v>

4657
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:06.360
<v Speaker 4>and they weren't including her in the process where she was very much included</v>

4658
01:56:06.361 --> 01:56:09.360
<v Speaker 4>in the process during the first season when they were writing for the second</v>

4659
01:56:09.361 --> 01:56:09.870
<v Speaker 4>season.</v>

4660
01:56:09.870 --> 01:56:13.620
<v Speaker 4>They were there basically excluding her from the process of premises and the way</v>

4661
01:56:13.621 --> 01:56:14.820
<v Speaker 4>they were writing the show.</v>

4662
01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:15.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4663
01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:15.660
<v Speaker 4>I read,</v>

4664
01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:18.330
<v Speaker 4>I read all the outrage about early on it was like,</v>

4665
01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:19.470
<v Speaker 4>you're a Trump supporter.</v>

4666
01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:20.940
<v Speaker 4>And I read,</v>

4667
01:56:20.970 --> 01:56:23.640
<v Speaker 4>I saw someone like Ray Sani,</v>

4668
01:56:23.641 --> 01:56:26.330
<v Speaker 4>some young female comedian going like it when,</v>

4669
01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:26.780
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

4670
01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:28.050
<v Speaker 4>when Silverman was like,</v>

4671
01:56:28.051 --> 01:56:28.231
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4672
01:56:28.231 --> 01:56:29.840
<v Speaker 4>watch my friends show Rosanne.</v>

4673
01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:30.480
<v Speaker 4>She's great,</v>

4674
01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:30.921
<v Speaker 4>great show.</v>

4675
01:56:30.921 --> 01:56:31.210
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>

4676
01:56:31.210 --> 01:56:31.330
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4677
01:56:31.330 --> 01:56:33.720
<v Speaker 4>this is the bitch I got to be fake with at a party and kissed her on the cheek,</v>

4678
01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:34.680
<v Speaker 4>pretend I'm cool with her.</v>

4679
01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:36.083
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

4680
01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:38.670
<v Speaker 4>what is all this outrage over this pro Trump thing?</v>

4681
01:56:38.671 --> 01:56:39.091
<v Speaker 4>And I finally,</v>

4682
01:56:39.091 --> 01:56:39.271
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4683
01:56:39.271 --> 01:56:40.104
<v Speaker 4>let me go watch it.</v>

4684
01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:41.453
<v Speaker 4>And my friend,</v>

4685
01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Jewish female leftist Morgan Murphy who wrote it,</v>

4686
01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:46.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4687
01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:47.580
<v Speaker 4>I talked to her later about it,</v>

4688
01:56:47.581 --> 01:56:48.540
<v Speaker 4>but I finally watched it.</v>

4689
01:56:48.541 --> 01:56:50.940
<v Speaker 4>And it's this 12 characters in the show,</v>

4690
01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:54.270
<v Speaker 4>10 of them don't talk about who they voted for it all.</v>

4691
01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.590
<v Speaker 4>One of them is pro Trump,</v>

4692
01:56:55.870 --> 01:56:56.570
<v Speaker 4>anti Trump.</v>

4693
01:56:56.570 --> 01:56:59.130
<v Speaker 4>It's also a little trans kid on there and that's it.</v>

4694
01:56:59.250 --> 01:57:00.300
<v Speaker 4>Just one pro Trump,</v>

4695
01:57:00.301 --> 01:57:02.640
<v Speaker 4>one anti anti-Trump and the outrage dies.</v>

4696
01:57:02.641 --> 01:57:04.110
<v Speaker 4>Saw was almost like,</v>

4697
01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:07.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you guys could've possibly watch this episode.</v>

4698
01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:10.080
<v Speaker 4>I think you're all reading headlines about stories.</v>

4699
01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:11.770
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I talked to Morgan about it.</v>

4700
01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:12.613
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4701
01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:16.140
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem like it could have come from the actual facts,</v>

4702
01:57:16.230 --> 01:57:17.063
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4703
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:18.930
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of that going on.</v>

4704
01:57:18.930 --> 01:57:19.620
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4705
01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:20.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4706
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.730
<v Speaker 4>And so I,</v>

4707
01:57:20.730 --> 01:57:22.950
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's the same thing with Alex Jones.</v>

4708
01:57:22.951 --> 01:57:23.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm going hate monitor.</v>

4709
01:57:23.851 --> 01:57:24.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4710
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.961
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

4711
01:57:24.961 --> 01:57:26.070
<v Speaker 4>Alex Jones,</v>

4712
01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:28.080
<v Speaker 4>just crazy conspiracy guy.</v>

4713
01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:29.093
<v Speaker 4>Most of it.</v>

4714
01:57:29.250 --> 01:57:29.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4715
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:31.050
<v Speaker 4>Most of the hate monger.</v>

4716
01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:31.471
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4717
01:57:31.471 --> 01:57:32.130
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4718
01:57:32.130 --> 01:57:32.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4719
01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:35.220
<v Speaker 4>do you talk about taking away trans rights or anything like that?</v>

4720
01:57:35.221 --> 01:57:36.780
<v Speaker 4>Doing some talk?</v>

4721
01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:40.050
<v Speaker 4>There was some talk Alex Jones was saying and one of the,</v>

4722
01:57:40.051 --> 01:57:41.850
<v Speaker 4>one of the last final straws,</v>

4723
01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:46.410
<v Speaker 4>it was talking about people taking up arms and that people are not going to</v>

4724
01:57:46.411 --> 01:57:47.131
<v Speaker 4>stand it.</v>

4725
01:57:47.131 --> 01:57:47.461
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4726
01:57:47.461 --> 01:57:47.671
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4727
01:57:47.671 --> 01:57:49.740
<v Speaker 4>it's basically rabble rousing,</v>

4728
01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:53.730
<v Speaker 4>which is like a lot of what people do when they're there talking about the other</v>

4729
01:57:53.731 --> 01:57:54.181
<v Speaker 4>side,</v>

4730
01:57:54.181 --> 01:57:55.290
<v Speaker 4>trying to take away your rights,</v>

4731
01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:56.730
<v Speaker 4>trying to take away your guns.</v>

4732
01:57:56.850 --> 01:57:57.810
<v Speaker 4>We're not gonna stand for it.</v>

4733
01:57:58.060 --> 01:57:58.540
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4734
01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:01.290
<v Speaker 4>you know people are going to get shot,</v>

4735
01:58:01.410 --> 01:58:02.790
<v Speaker 4>you know that kind of talk.</v>

4736
01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:03.361
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4737
01:58:03.361 --> 01:58:05.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't know specifically what he said,</v>

4738
01:58:05.671 --> 01:58:08.520
<v Speaker 4>but this is a problem that you don't know specifically.</v>

4739
01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4740
01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:13.230
<v Speaker 4>There's a problem that they can just decide that you represent a certain faction</v>

4741
01:58:13.231 --> 01:58:17.220
<v Speaker 4>of thought and that this should be eliminated from,</v>

4742
01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:21.990
<v Speaker 4>you should be deep platformed instead like the platform for a conspiracy guy and</v>

4743
01:58:21.991 --> 01:58:22.260
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

4744
01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.380
<v Speaker 4>people are going up to those those parents and saying like your kid's not dead.</v>

4745
01:58:25.650 --> 01:58:26.520
<v Speaker 4>And it's like a real issue.</v>

4746
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4747
01:58:26.641 --> 01:58:28.380
<v Speaker 4>but it's like he's not calling for that.</v>

4748
01:58:28.381 --> 01:58:30.000
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're doing on their own.</v>

4749
01:58:30.590 --> 01:58:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Somebody shot two cops in New York because of the black lives matter movement.</v>

4750
01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:35.970
<v Speaker 4>You don't shut down the black lives matter movement over that.</v>

4751
01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:38.130
<v Speaker 4>They weren't asking for them to shoot cops.</v>

4752
01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:40.200
<v Speaker 4>Someone did on their own who was also an,</v>

4753
01:58:40.201 --> 01:58:41.630
<v Speaker 4>he was an avenue to do that,</v>

4754
01:58:41.631 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4755
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:42.251
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4756
01:58:42.251 --> 01:58:42.820
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't.</v>

4757
01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:43.450
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

4758
01:58:43.450 --> 01:58:46.690
<v Speaker 4>so like I don't see how you deep plat for the only great article I read was by a</v>

4759
01:58:46.691 --> 01:58:47.530
<v Speaker 4>trans woman who said,</v>

4760
01:58:47.531 --> 01:58:49.030
<v Speaker 4>when I hear crazy shit like that,</v>

4761
01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:52.150
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's supposed to roll your eyes and then walk away.</v>

4762
01:58:52.630 --> 01:58:53.350
<v Speaker 4>You don't say,</v>

4763
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.531
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

4764
01:58:53.531 --> 01:58:54.460
<v Speaker 4>you need to get gone.</v>

4765
01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:56.933
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4766
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:58.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4767
01:58:58.190 --> 01:58:59.330
<v Speaker 4>d platforming people,</v>

4768
01:58:59.331 --> 01:59:00.260
<v Speaker 4>that's a good way to put it,</v>

4769
01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:00.651
<v Speaker 4>dad.</v>

4770
01:59:00.651 --> 01:59:01.580
<v Speaker 4>That is what they're saying.</v>

4771
01:59:01.581 --> 01:59:02.630
<v Speaker 4>And it's also,</v>

4772
01:59:02.631 --> 01:59:06.200
<v Speaker 4>it seemed like it was a universal d platforming because Twitter was the one of</v>

4773
01:59:06.201 --> 01:59:07.850
<v Speaker 4>the last places that kept him on.</v>

4774
01:59:08.150 --> 01:59:10.460
<v Speaker 4>And then they decided that they were going to remove him,</v>

4775
01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:12.620
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't see anything specifically.</v>

4776
01:59:12.650 --> 01:59:13.870
<v Speaker 4>Cause yeah,</v>

4777
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:14.211
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

4778
01:59:14.211 --> 01:59:15.590
<v Speaker 4>they have some rules like that when they got,</v>

4779
01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:16.453
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4780
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:20.870

4781
01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:21.561
<v Speaker 4>and people are like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and then a u d platform or from Matt or you just took it out from that?</v>

4788
01:59:28.170 --> 01:59:28.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4789
01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:29.301
<v Speaker 4>and that was the story.</v>

4790
01:59:29.301 --> 01:59:29.901
<v Speaker 4>That was a headline.</v>

4791
01:59:29.901 --> 01:59:30.291
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's like,</v>

4794
01:59:32.090 --> 01:59:32.631
<v Speaker 4>Jack Dorsey?</v>

4795
01:59:32.631 --> 01:59:32.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4796
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:33.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4797
01:59:33.110 --> 01:59:33.591
<v Speaker 4>How dare you.</v>

4798
01:59:33.591 --> 01:59:34.930
<v Speaker 4>And then he actually responded.</v>

4799
01:59:34.931 --> 01:59:35.110
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

4800
01:59:35.110 --> 01:59:35.291
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

4801
01:59:35.291 --> 01:59:35.371
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4802
01:59:35.371 --> 01:59:35.810
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4803
01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:36.770
<v Speaker 4>She docked somebody's,</v>

4804
01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:40.100
<v Speaker 4>she gave somebody information about where they live and stuff like that.</v>

4805
01:59:40.101 --> 01:59:40.551
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

4806
01:59:40.551 --> 01:59:41.450
<v Speaker 4>we already had that role.</v>

4807
01:59:41.451 --> 01:59:42.284
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that.</v>

4808
01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:42.441
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4809
01:59:42.441 --> 01:59:44.540
<v Speaker 4>Nothing to do with why she dox them.</v>

4810
01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:44.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4811
01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:45.120
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

4812
01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:46.310
<v Speaker 4>let's just over that,</v>

4813
01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:51.050
<v Speaker 4>why don't you Google what exactly got Alex Jones kicked off Twitter?</v>

4814
01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:52.553
<v Speaker 4>Cause he would,</v>

4815
01:59:52.670 --> 01:59:57.670
<v Speaker 4>Twitter was one of the last platforms and then they can say hate speech and hate</v>

4816
01:59:58.281 --> 01:59:59.580
<v Speaker 4>speech is one of those weird,</v>

4817
01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:00.260
<v Speaker 4>broad,</v>

4818
02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:01.280
<v Speaker 4>broad terms.</v>

4819
02:00:01.410 --> 02:00:02.243
<v Speaker 4>It's like I hate you.</v>

4820
02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:03.253
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4821
02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:04.273
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4822
02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:05.500
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

4823
02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:05.891
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

4824
02:00:05.891 --> 02:00:06.910
<v Speaker 4>I really am like,</v>

4825
02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:07.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

4826
02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:12.600
<v Speaker 4>I think people are forgetting how the ACL you defended the Klan members because</v>

4827
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:14.530
<v Speaker 4>the free speech is too big.</v>

4828
02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:14.820
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4829
02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:15.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4830
02:00:15.010 --> 02:00:15.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4831
02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:19.690
<v Speaker 4>a fucking issue to worry about how I feel about what they're saying.</v>

4832
02:00:19.810 --> 02:00:19.961
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4833
02:00:19.961 --> 02:00:23.140
<v Speaker 4>you know what's really interesting is that left leaning people,</v>

4834
02:00:23.141 --> 02:00:27.850
<v Speaker 4>the leftists are the ones that want to censor and d platform and silence people</v>

4835
02:00:27.851 --> 02:00:28.330
<v Speaker 4>on the right.</v>

4836
02:00:28.330 --> 02:00:28.721
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

4837
02:00:28.721 --> 02:00:29.441
<v Speaker 4>It's also both.</v>

4838
02:00:29.441 --> 02:00:30.920
<v Speaker 4>I think we see the left more cause word,</v>

4839
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:31.540
<v Speaker 4>that bubble.</v>

4840
02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:32.620
<v Speaker 4>I think it goes the right is doing it.</v>

4841
02:00:32.621 --> 02:00:33.071
<v Speaker 4>So we just don't,</v>

4842
02:00:33.071 --> 02:00:33.800
<v Speaker 4>we're not friends with her.</v>

4843
02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:34.481
<v Speaker 4>The white doing it.</v>

4844
02:00:34.481 --> 02:00:35.030
<v Speaker 4>They have no,</v>

4845
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:38.500
<v Speaker 4>no power in technology that the tech companies,</v>

4846
02:00:38.501 --> 02:00:39.370
<v Speaker 4>whether it's Facebook,</v>

4847
02:00:39.371 --> 02:00:39.851
<v Speaker 4>Google,</v>

4848
02:00:39.851 --> 02:00:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Twitter,</v>

4849
02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:41.260
<v Speaker 4>they're all left.</v>

4850
02:00:41.290 --> 02:00:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4851
02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.370
<v Speaker 4>And they're the ones who have the mean.</v>

4852
02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:44.350
<v Speaker 4>This is where it's weird.</v>

4853
02:00:44.351 --> 02:00:45.184
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4854
02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:46.510
<v Speaker 4>It's because nobody saw this coming.</v>

4855
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:47.620
<v Speaker 4>It was media.</v>

4856
02:00:47.770 --> 02:00:49.180
<v Speaker 4>Like you had Fox News,</v>

4857
02:00:49.181 --> 02:00:50.140
<v Speaker 4>you had NBC,</v>

4858
02:00:50.141 --> 02:00:50.500
<v Speaker 4>you had,</v>

4859
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:51.970
<v Speaker 4>you had your left and you had your right.</v>

4860
02:00:52.150 --> 02:00:54.040
<v Speaker 4>More left than right of sure.</v>

4861
02:00:54.220 --> 02:00:56.590
<v Speaker 4>But there was power in the Fox News,</v>

4862
02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:57.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4863
02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:58.120
<v Speaker 4>faction,</v>

4864
02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:59.140
<v Speaker 4>they had their voice.</v>

4865
02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:00.640
<v Speaker 4>But in the,</v>

4866
02:01:00.641 --> 02:01:01.030
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

4867
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:02.380
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to technology,</v>

4868
02:01:02.381 --> 02:01:05.740
<v Speaker 4>there's not really an equivalent or commensurate company.</v>

4869
02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:06.700
<v Speaker 4>It's all left.</v>

4870
02:01:06.701 --> 02:01:06.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4871
02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:07.960
<v Speaker 4>It's all left.</v>

4872
02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:12.700
<v Speaker 4>There's not one right leaning large social media platform.</v>

4873
02:01:12.850 --> 02:01:13.330
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4874
02:01:13.330 --> 02:01:14.260
<v Speaker 4>They don't exist.</v>

4875
02:01:14.590 --> 02:01:15.500
<v Speaker 4>It should just stay out of it.</v>

4876
02:01:15.501 --> 02:01:15.581
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4877
02:01:15.581 --> 02:01:15.761
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

4878
02:01:15.761 --> 02:01:16.560
<v Speaker 4>I get why they,</v>

4879
02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:16.860
<v Speaker 4>you're getting,</v>

4880
02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:18.070
<v Speaker 4>you gotta read it situation where it's like,</v>

4881
02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:18.311
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4882
02:01:18.311 --> 02:01:23.230
<v Speaker 4>but suddenly it devolved into just child porn will read it.</v>

4883
02:01:23.231 --> 02:01:27.460
<v Speaker 4>The problem with Reddit is an anonymity when you give people anonymity and one</v>

4884
02:01:27.461 --> 02:01:31.180
<v Speaker 4>guy actually lost his job because of it because somebody decided,</v>

4885
02:01:31.181 --> 02:01:31.271

4887
02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Let's find out who the fuck he is.</v>

4888
02:01:35.170 --> 02:01:38.500
<v Speaker 4>And he got his Ip and then they figured out who he was and then he was like some</v>

4889
02:01:38.501 --> 02:01:39.710
<v Speaker 4>guy who is a dad,</v>

4890
02:01:39.810 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4891
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.510
<v Speaker 3>It was like some regular guy with a job and they got him fire and like,</v>

4892
02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:43.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4893
02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:45.140
<v Speaker 3>he had a bunch of weird,</v>

4894
02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:46.153
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4895
02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.620
<v Speaker 3>kid fucking type posts and</v>

4896
02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:50.200
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of shit that just people,</v>

4897
02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:53.860
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like role playing where it's like you're not serious.</v>

4898
02:01:53.890 --> 02:01:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

4899
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:59.320
<v Speaker 5>And it's all said [inaudible] people were running out of the room yesterday or</v>

4900
02:01:59.321 --> 02:01:59.891
<v Speaker 5>two days ago.</v>

4901
02:01:59.891 --> 02:02:02.200
<v Speaker 5>He got a full room randomly the end of the night.</v>

4902
02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:03.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4903
02:02:03.110 --> 02:02:04.670
<v Speaker 5>He spent his first three minutes like,</v>

4904
02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:06.093
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4905
02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:07.030
<v Speaker 5>it's cable.</v>

4906
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.580
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

4907
02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:07.901
<v Speaker 5>it's due.</v>

4908
02:02:07.901 --> 02:02:09.160
<v Speaker 5>I never got up out of this many people,</v>

4909
02:02:09.161 --> 02:02:10.240
<v Speaker 5>like he couldn't handle it.</v>

4910
02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:11.351
<v Speaker 5>And then he starts going,</v>

4911
02:02:11.351 --> 02:02:13.900
<v Speaker 5>they start leaving and he starts getting angry and born to his pocket,</v>

4912
02:02:13.901 --> 02:02:14.141
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4913
02:02:14.141 --> 02:02:15.250
<v Speaker 5>into where he's belongs.</v>

4914
02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:18.640
<v Speaker 5>And that asks people to leave in like he's talking about child fucking and stuff</v>

4915
02:02:18.641 --> 02:02:19.090
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

4916
02:02:19.090 --> 02:02:19.923
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4917
02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:21.033
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>

4918
02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:24.100
<v Speaker 5>it was a peek behind the curtain.</v>

4919
02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:25.720
<v Speaker 5>I didn't fuck a baby,</v>

4920
02:02:27.190 --> 02:02:27.850
<v Speaker 5>just so you know,</v>

4921
02:02:27.850 --> 02:02:28.840
<v Speaker 5>there were no babies fucked.</v>

4922
02:02:29.710 --> 02:02:30.543
<v Speaker 5>So calm down.</v>

4923
02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:31.841
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4924
02:02:31.841 --> 02:02:34.390
<v Speaker 5>people don't want to hear about that subject and that's fair.</v>

4925
02:02:34.690 --> 02:02:35.890
<v Speaker 5>That's to the comedy store.</v>

4926
02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:38.680
<v Speaker 5>Do your some wonderful jokes about people losing socks in the dryer.</v>

4927
02:02:38.710 --> 02:02:38.891
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4928
02:02:38.891 --> 02:02:39.401
<v Speaker 5>So actually,</v>

4929
02:02:39.401 --> 02:02:40.690
<v Speaker 5>honestly walking out,</v>

4930
02:02:40.691 --> 02:02:41.590
<v Speaker 5>is it fine response?</v>

4931
02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:42.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4932
02:02:42.130 --> 02:02:43.480
<v Speaker 5>Saying he can't go up anymore.</v>

4933
02:02:43.481 --> 02:02:47.110
<v Speaker 5>It's not a fine response response and saying you're going to boycott the comedy</v>

4934
02:02:47.111 --> 02:02:49.070
<v Speaker 5>store because they don't do your kind of comedy and you,</v>

4935
02:02:49.130 --> 02:02:50.140
<v Speaker 5>if you want to boycott.</v>

4936
02:02:50.141 --> 02:02:50.980
<v Speaker 5>And that's also okay.</v>

4937
02:02:50.981 --> 02:02:51.350
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

4938
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:52.520
<v Speaker 5>just trying to get other people to</v>

4939
02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:53.640
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

4940
02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:54.400
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

4941
02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:55.940
<v Speaker 3>But there's that,</v>

4942
02:02:55.950 --> 02:03:00.370
<v Speaker 3>this is a problem in that there's no balance,</v>

4943
02:03:00.430 --> 02:03:00.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4944
02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:05.830
<v Speaker 3>If people are just right leaning and people want a deep plat form them because</v>

4945
02:03:05.831 --> 02:03:07.300
<v Speaker 3>they have right-leaning beliefs,</v>

4946
02:03:07.301 --> 02:03:07.601
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4947
02:03:07.601 --> 02:03:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Leaning ideas like say if they support president Trump,</v>

4948
02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean he is the president.</v>

4949
02:03:12.281 --> 02:03:13.114
<v Speaker 3>Whether you like it,</v>

4950
02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:14.830
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to like it or not.</v>

4951
02:03:14.831 --> 02:03:16.450
<v Speaker 3>You want whether you like it or not,</v>

4952
02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:19.810
<v Speaker 3>that guy's the president and when do you like his policies or not?</v>

4953
02:03:19.811 --> 02:03:20.890
<v Speaker 3>They are his policies.</v>

4954
02:03:20.891 --> 02:03:24.910
<v Speaker 3>He's the president of the United States and if someone supports that deep</v>

4955
02:03:24.911 --> 02:03:29.080
<v Speaker 3>platforming people who support him and support that is not the right response.</v>

4956
02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:34.320
<v Speaker 3>The right response is a well-worded argument against that is against that.</v>

4957
02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:39.480
<v Speaker 3>That is convincingly articulate to the point where you,</v>

4958
02:03:40.990 --> 02:03:44.440
<v Speaker 3>you make an argument that this is a terrible policy,</v>

4959
02:03:44.441 --> 02:03:49.441
<v Speaker 3>a terrible idea and an objective fence rider like myself that watches that and</v>

4960
02:03:49.451 --> 02:03:50.650
<v Speaker 3>reads it might go,</v>

4961
02:03:50.651 --> 02:03:50.981
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4962
02:03:50.981 --> 02:03:51.741
<v Speaker 3>this guy's got a good point.</v>

4963
02:03:51.741 --> 02:03:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4964
02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:53.040
<v Speaker 5>I want to hear both sides,</v>

4965
02:03:53.041 --> 02:03:55.680
<v Speaker 5>but I need to hear that side in order to hear the alternative side,</v>

4966
02:03:55.681 --> 02:03:57.570
<v Speaker 5>like Dave Smith who hates all politicians,</v>

4967
02:03:57.571 --> 02:03:58.404
<v Speaker 5>pretty much,</v>

4968
02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:01.320
<v Speaker 5>he was pointing out these like separating their kids from their parents thing</v>

4969
02:04:01.321 --> 02:04:01.681
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>

4970
02:04:01.681 --> 02:04:03.240
<v Speaker 5>it's gotten real bad with Trump now.</v>

4971
02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:03.931
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

4972
02:04:03.931 --> 02:04:04.231
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4973
02:04:04.231 --> 02:04:04.950
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

4974
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:07.260
<v Speaker 5>But look at the picture they're using on the bottom right hand corner.</v>

4975
02:04:07.261 --> 02:04:10.020
<v Speaker 5>There's a date stamp on it and it's 2014 yeah,</v>

4976
02:04:10.021 --> 02:04:11.460
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely a lot of shenanigans.</v>

4977
02:04:11.461 --> 02:04:12.160
<v Speaker 5>So like your,</v>

4978
02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:13.920
<v Speaker 5>your anger is not even who,</v>

4979
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:15.750
<v Speaker 5>I can't even bring that up.</v>

4980
02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:18.600
<v Speaker 3>Elysium the what that is and,</v>

4981
02:04:18.601 --> 02:04:21.030
<v Speaker 3>and online journalism look,</v>

4982
02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:23.770
<v Speaker 3>journalism my fucking fighting for their lives right down back there.</v>

4983
02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:24.950
<v Speaker 3>And it's terrible.</v>

4984
02:04:24.951 --> 02:04:25.784
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

4985
02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:26.601
<v Speaker 3>And it's also,</v>

4986
02:04:26.601 --> 02:04:27.500
<v Speaker 3>there's no money in it.</v>

4987
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:30.800
<v Speaker 3>There's a problem is nobody wants to buy newspapers and we want to buy magazines</v>

4988
02:04:30.801 --> 02:04:35.730
<v Speaker 3>and it's really hard for online journalism to not resort clicktale anger shit.</v>

4989
02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:36.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4990
02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:39.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's literally how they make their living now as click bait shit.</v>

4991
02:04:39.330 --> 02:04:39.950
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

4992
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:40.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4993
02:04:40.170 --> 02:04:40.921
<v Speaker 3>they have a photo.</v>

4994
02:04:40.921 --> 02:04:42.030
<v Speaker 3>This is what the stock photo.</v>

4995
02:04:42.031 --> 02:04:45.450
<v Speaker 3>We got a little fucking kid who's crying and he's standing in front of a border</v>

4996
02:04:45.451 --> 02:04:46.110
<v Speaker 3>patrol guy,</v>

4997
02:04:46.110 --> 02:04:46.943
<v Speaker 3>throw it up,</v>

4998
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:49.500
<v Speaker 3>use it is what we got the stories real.</v>

4999
02:04:49.501 --> 02:04:50.370
<v Speaker 3>The photo's not,</v>

5000
02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:51.960
<v Speaker 3>it's it's Shit Journal.</v>

5001
02:04:52.110 --> 02:04:55.520
<v Speaker 5>I think it really comes down to like when you see like a norm McDonald where</v>

5002
02:04:55.521 --> 02:04:55.850
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

5003
02:04:55.850 --> 02:04:56.091
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

5004
02:04:56.091 --> 02:04:58.880
<v Speaker 5>I haven't done anything to anybody wrong.</v>

5005
02:04:59.690 --> 02:05:02.270
<v Speaker 5>I just want to look at with compassionate and other human.</v>

5006
02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:02.691
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>

5011
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:07.190
<v Speaker 5>Just be specific what you're saying about norm Macdonald.</v>

5012
02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:11.150
<v Speaker 5>He said like Roseanne and Louie and like they'd lost everything in a day and</v>

5013
02:05:11.151 --> 02:05:12.590
<v Speaker 5>people don't really understand what it's like.</v>

5014
02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:12.980
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5015
02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:15.020
<v Speaker 5>And I would like to see these friends,</v>

<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>

5019
02:05:18.831 --> 02:05:20.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Rosanne who that lady was black.</v>

5020
02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:21.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't think she makes that comment.</v>

5021
02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:22.671
<v Speaker 5>And then people go,</v>

02:05:27.051 --> 02:05:28.220
<v Speaker 5>why do you even do anything?</v>

5027
02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:29.750
<v Speaker 5>When we tell him he didn't do anything,</v>

5028
02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:31.970
<v Speaker 5>instead of taking that opportunity to go,</v>

5029
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:32.841
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

5030
02:05:32.841 --> 02:05:33.620
<v Speaker 5>let's hear him out.</v>

5031
02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:35.180
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you can clarify what you mean,</v>

5032
02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:36.333
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5033
02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:36.951
<v Speaker 5>Even say,</v>

5034
02:05:36.951 --> 02:05:37.161
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

5035
02:05:37.161 --> 02:05:38.270
<v Speaker 5>I didn't mean it that way.</v>

5036
02:05:38.490 --> 02:05:39.200
<v Speaker 5>The platform,</v>

5037
02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:39.891
<v Speaker 5>the platform,</v>

5038
02:05:39.891 --> 02:05:41.360
<v Speaker 5>cause he's women or people,</v>

5039
02:05:41.361 --> 02:05:44.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't really know who they were at the tonight show had their opportunity to</v>

5040
02:05:44.901 --> 02:05:46.370
<v Speaker 5>fall on their sword and they go,</v>

5041
02:05:46.371 --> 02:05:49.130
<v Speaker 5>now we get to stand up for women's rights and we get to stand up for racial</v>

5042
02:05:49.131 --> 02:05:51.590
<v Speaker 5>rights instead of going like,</v>

5043
02:05:51.591 --> 02:05:52.424
<v Speaker 5>let's have him on,</v>

5044
02:05:52.770 --> 02:05:53.810
<v Speaker 5>have him on and say,</v>

5045
02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:55.130
<v Speaker 5>Jimmy Fallon go,</v>

5046
02:05:55.700 --> 02:05:55.851
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

5047
02:05:55.851 --> 02:05:56.511
<v Speaker 5>What did you mean by that?</v>

5048
02:05:56.511 --> 02:05:56.901
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

5049
02:05:56.901 --> 02:05:58.970
<v Speaker 5>And then to clarify his position to now show,</v>

5050
02:05:59.060 --> 02:05:59.271
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5051
02:05:59.271 --> 02:06:00.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm on your side,</v>

5052
02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:01.130
<v Speaker 5>but people don't want that.</v>

5053
02:06:01.131 --> 02:06:01.740
<v Speaker 5>They're more interested.</v>

5054
02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:03.200
<v Speaker 5>They're more interested in punishment.</v>

5055
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:07.880
<v Speaker 5>And so now you're punishing people who are on your side so you can feel right at</v>

5056
02:06:07.881 --> 02:06:08.720
<v Speaker 5>the comedy cellar.</v>

5057
02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:11.300
<v Speaker 5>A waitress was traveling to fucking work,</v>

5058
02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:12.140
<v Speaker 5>wearing her comedy cell,</v>

5059
02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:14.180
<v Speaker 5>a t shirt off to Louis came back and somebody said,</v>

5060
02:06:14.181 --> 02:06:14.420
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

5061
02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:14.990
<v Speaker 5>headphones,</v>

5062
02:06:14.990 --> 02:06:15.920
<v Speaker 5>like take your headphones out.</v>

5063
02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:16.521
<v Speaker 5>And she did.</v>

5064
02:06:16.521 --> 02:06:16.761
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>

5065
02:06:16.761 --> 02:06:16.970
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

5066
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:17.360
<v Speaker 5>And they go,</v>

5067
02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:18.260
<v Speaker 5>shame on you.</v>

5068
02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:20.210
<v Speaker 5>To some waitress who by the way,</v>

5069
02:06:20.211 --> 02:06:21.470
<v Speaker 5>he's not in charge of him coming back.</v>

5070
02:06:21.590 --> 02:06:25.010
<v Speaker 5>She might've actually guy or girl that said shame on you don't know.</v>

5071
02:06:25.011 --> 02:06:25.844
<v Speaker 5>I think a woman,</v>

5072
02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:26.953
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure,</v>

5073
02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:29.900
<v Speaker 5>but this waitress might've been like heavily against him coming back,</v>

5074
02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:31.880
<v Speaker 5>but there's no research done.</v>

5075
02:06:31.881 --> 02:06:32.390
<v Speaker 5>It's just like,</v>

5076
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:36.470
<v Speaker 5>I get my chance to show that I've stuck up for somebody instead of ruining some</v>

5077
02:06:36.471 --> 02:06:38.840
<v Speaker 5>other woman's Day who might be on your side.</v>

5078
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:39.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5079
02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:42.140
<v Speaker 5>Well this is one of the stuck a finger in Val's face after he came back.</v>

5080
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:43.303
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>

5081
02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:44.413
<v Speaker 5>After they were leaving,</v>

5082
02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:46.400
<v Speaker 5>that was one of the managers of the seller.</v>

5083
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:47.540
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

5084
02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:50.780
<v Speaker 5>so here's a fellow woman who hasn't done anything wrong.</v>

5085
02:06:51.110 --> 02:06:51.650
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5086
02:06:51.650 --> 02:06:52.180
<v Speaker 5>And you're,</v>

5087
02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:52.650
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

5088
02:06:52.650 --> 02:06:56.210
<v Speaker 5>you're cursing her out so you can feel like I've done something for the cause.</v>

5089
02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:56.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5090
02:06:56.920 --> 02:06:57.550
<v Speaker 5>Well this is,</v>

5091
02:06:57.550 --> 02:06:57.760
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5092
02:06:57.760 --> 02:06:59.170
<v Speaker 3>the left does that.</v>

5093
02:06:59.171 --> 02:07:01.810
<v Speaker 3>The right doesn't do the left attacks its own.</v>

5094
02:07:02.210 --> 02:07:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5095
02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:02.711
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

5096
02:07:02.711 --> 02:07:03.544
<v Speaker 3>they attack.</v>

5097
02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:05.350
<v Speaker 5>Tina Fey once said,</v>

5098
02:07:05.351 --> 02:07:06.520
<v Speaker 5>your antifeminist and she was like,</v>

5099
02:07:06.521 --> 02:07:08.140
<v Speaker 5>you're out of your fucking mind about what,</v>

5100
02:07:08.141 --> 02:07:08.351
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

5101
02:07:08.351 --> 02:07:09.071
<v Speaker 5>six years ago,</v>

5102
02:07:09.071 --> 02:07:09.611
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

5103
02:07:09.611 --> 02:07:09.911
<v Speaker 5>And she goes,</v>

5104
02:07:09.911 --> 02:07:10.510
<v Speaker 5>you out of your mind.</v>

5105
02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:11.343
<v Speaker 5>I'm your leader,</v>

5106
02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:12.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm on your side.</v>

5107
02:07:12.911 --> 02:07:14.740
<v Speaker 5>You're attacking me for being antifeminist.</v>

5108
02:07:14.770 --> 02:07:16.180
<v Speaker 5>You're out of your fucking mind.</v>

5109
02:07:16.181 --> 02:07:16.841
<v Speaker 5>They eat their own.</v>

5110
02:07:16.841 --> 02:07:17.171
<v Speaker 5>They can't.</v>

5111
02:07:17.171 --> 02:07:18.730
<v Speaker 5>They have blood loss and they know how to control it.</v>

5112
02:07:18.731 --> 02:07:20.400
<v Speaker 5>You're not trained in fucking fighting.</v>

5113
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:20.701
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5114
02:07:20.701 --> 02:07:22.320
<v Speaker 3>they're always looking for targets.</v>

5115
02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:25.290
<v Speaker 3>They're always looking for targets and in finding and establishing a target,</v>

5116
02:07:25.291 --> 02:07:29.070
<v Speaker 3>you clearly establish that you are better and more virtuous than that person.</v>

5117
02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5118
02:07:29.250 --> 02:07:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Because you find a fence in something that they do.</v>

5119
02:07:31.471 --> 02:07:34.140
<v Speaker 3>They're not progressive enough and they are a part of the problem.</v>

5120
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:38.140
<v Speaker 3>And so he cast them out or you shut them down or you d platform.</v>

5121
02:07:38.230 --> 02:07:38.501
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5122
02:07:38.501 --> 02:07:39.670
<v Speaker 5>so I think with Alex Jones,</v>

5123
02:07:39.671 --> 02:07:40.080
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>

5124
02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:40.250
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

5125
02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:41.380
<v Speaker 5>they pointed to that one a lot.</v>

5126
02:07:41.381 --> 02:07:41.770
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

5127
02:07:41.770 --> 02:07:42.130
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

5128
02:07:42.130 --> 02:07:44.320
<v Speaker 5>he said fucking Sandy Hook didn't happen.</v>

5129
02:07:44.530 --> 02:07:45.363
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

5130
02:07:45.530 --> 02:07:46.001
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

5131
02:07:46.001 --> 02:07:46.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

5132
02:07:46.570 --> 02:07:47.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying I'm not.</v>

5133
02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:47.921
<v Speaker 5>You've tried it.</v>

5134
02:07:47.921 --> 02:07:49.990
<v Speaker 5>Now I get Straw man me into saying,</v>

5135
02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:50.621
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying,</v>

5136
02:07:50.621 --> 02:07:51.880
<v Speaker 5>that's okay or that's right.</v>

5137
02:07:52.170 --> 02:07:52.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying this right.</v>

5138
02:07:52.930 --> 02:07:55.150
<v Speaker 5>I just don't see the connection to this.</v>

5139
02:07:55.151 --> 02:07:57.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't see the connection to Michael Vick killing dogs,</v>

5140
02:07:57.821 --> 02:07:59.350
<v Speaker 5>which I'm not in the side of too.</v>

5141
02:07:59.351 --> 02:08:00.550
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't play football.</v>

5142
02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:01.240
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5143
02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:02.970
<v Speaker 5>You haven't made that connection to me and be like,</v>

5144
02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:03.101
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5145
02:08:03.101 --> 02:08:04.270
<v Speaker 5>you're saying it's okay to kill dogs?</v>

5146
02:08:04.271 --> 02:08:05.104
<v Speaker 5>Like no,</v>

5147
02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:07.360
<v Speaker 5>it's just why is that job not allowed?</v>

5148
02:08:07.361 --> 02:08:07.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5149
02:08:07.770 --> 02:08:10.500
<v Speaker 3>The connection would be if you have a private company,</v>

5150
02:08:11.130 --> 02:08:11.850
<v Speaker 3>this is where we're,</v>

5151
02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:13.380
<v Speaker 3>we're all boils down to like,</v>

5152
02:08:13.381 --> 02:08:18.381
<v Speaker 3>do you have a right to use their platform so you're not taking Alex Jones off</v>

5153
02:08:18.721 --> 02:08:19.440
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>

5154
02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:19.741
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5155
02:08:19.741 --> 02:08:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones still has this website in the Internet,</v>

5156
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.823
<v Speaker 3>but if you have,</v>

5157
02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:23.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5158
02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:28.080
<v Speaker 3>if Ari should fear.com all the sudden becomes Twitter.</v>

5159
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:29.080
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5160
02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:29.370
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

5161
02:08:29.370 --> 02:08:30.290
<v Speaker 5>there's a separate thing though.</v>

5162
02:08:30.291 --> 02:08:30.891
<v Speaker 5>Private company,</v>

5163
02:08:30.891 --> 02:08:32.660
<v Speaker 5>are they allowed and it's private company.</v>

5164
02:08:32.690 --> 02:08:33.920
<v Speaker 5>Should you be doing that?</v>

5165
02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:36.200
<v Speaker 5>Should you be doing with the laws are,</v>

5166
02:08:36.201 --> 02:08:37.760
<v Speaker 5>I agree with only a portion of it.</v>

5167
02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:38.593
<v Speaker 3>The laws,</v>

5168
02:08:38.770 --> 02:08:39.603
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5169
02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:43.160
<v Speaker 3>this is in response to like the cockpit type of shit that has happened at reddit</v>

5170
02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:48.220
<v Speaker 3>that reddit has gotten so fucking out there in so many different ways and so</v>

5171
02:08:48.651 --> 02:08:49.730
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

5172
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.010
<v Speaker 3>especially the Trump section of reddit.</v>

5173
02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5174
02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Like people let them be there.</v>

5175
02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:55.280
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing anything to anybody.</v>

5176
02:08:55.281 --> 02:08:56.390
<v Speaker 3>They're not planning attacks.</v>

5177
02:08:56.630 --> 02:08:58.310
<v Speaker 3>But people who,</v>

5178
02:08:58.370 --> 02:08:59.090
<v Speaker 3>if you save,</v>

5179
02:08:59.090 --> 02:09:04.090
<v Speaker 3>you own that company and you were one of the people that was responsible for</v>

5180
02:09:04.191 --> 02:09:06.750
<v Speaker 3>trying to sell ads for Twitter or for whatever.</v>

5181
02:09:06.850 --> 02:09:08.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Twitter has ads,</v>

5182
02:09:08.690 --> 02:09:11.960
<v Speaker 3>but if you had like established guidelines,</v>

5183
02:09:11.961 --> 02:09:13.460
<v Speaker 3>which you could and couldn't say,</v>

5184
02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.840
<v Speaker 3>one of those things would probably be no hate speech,</v>

5185
02:09:17.841 --> 02:09:19.100
<v Speaker 3>no racism,</v>

5186
02:09:19.101 --> 02:09:19.821
<v Speaker 3>no this,</v>

5187
02:09:19.821 --> 02:09:20.654
<v Speaker 3>no that.</v>

5188
02:09:20.810 --> 02:09:25.810
<v Speaker 3>But you can't promote false conspiracy theories that hurt other people.</v>

5189
02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5190
02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:27.320
<v Speaker 3>That you,</v>

5191
02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:29.030
<v Speaker 3>you could get away with saying that.</v>

5192
02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:31.173
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5193
02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:32.201
<v Speaker 5>So it's not about,</v>

5194
02:09:32.201 --> 02:09:33.001
<v Speaker 5>so it's kind of like the,</v>

5195
02:09:33.001 --> 02:09:33.280
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

5196
02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:33.700
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

5197
02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:35.330
<v Speaker 5>the Rose McGowan thing where it's like,</v>

5198
02:09:35.370 --> 02:09:35.651
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>

5199
02:09:35.651 --> 02:09:36.071
<v Speaker 5>it's not about,</v>

5200
02:09:36.071 --> 02:09:37.150
<v Speaker 5>you just can't talk to anybody.</v>

5201
02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:37.781
<v Speaker 3>What does this,</v>

5202
02:09:37.781 --> 02:09:38.614
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

5203
02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:43.570
<v Speaker 3>this is from a NPR interview with a Washington Post reporter about why,</v>

5204
02:09:43.630 --> 02:09:44.350
<v Speaker 3>what's read this?</v>

5205
02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:44.800
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>

5206
02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:46.360
<v Speaker 3>and when I spoke to somebody at Twitter,</v>

5207
02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:49.870
<v Speaker 3>they said one thing that weighed very heavily on them was the way that Jones</v>

5208
02:09:49.871 --> 02:09:53.500
<v Speaker 3>conducted himself outside of a congressional hearing where Twitter CEO,</v>

5209
02:09:53.501 --> 02:09:54.161
<v Speaker 3>Jack Dorsey,</v>

5210
02:09:54.161 --> 02:09:57.850
<v Speaker 3>was testifying about the way the company moderates content online.</v>

5211
02:09:57.851 --> 02:09:58.201
<v Speaker 3>Jones.</v>

5212
02:09:58.201 --> 02:10:00.630
<v Speaker 3>Specif essentially went after Republicans,</v>

5213
02:10:00.631 --> 02:10:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Senator Mark Marco Rubio interrupted one of his press conferences.</v>

5214
02:10:05.110 --> 02:10:09.010
<v Speaker 3>He yelled at Dorsey at one point as he was trying to leave the building and then</v>

5215
02:10:09.011 --> 02:10:12.700
<v Speaker 3>he live streamed the incident where he was attacking a CNN reporter,</v>

5216
02:10:12.730 --> 02:10:14.680
<v Speaker 3>hurling verbal insults at him.</v>

5217
02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:16.990
<v Speaker 3>The video was broadcast on periscope,</v>

5218
02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:21.310
<v Speaker 3>which is the live streaming site owned by Twitter and so in the minds of the</v>

5219
02:10:21.311 --> 02:10:23.110
<v Speaker 3>company and essentially was too much.</v>

5220
02:10:23.170 --> 02:10:26.380
<v Speaker 3>He had gone too far and so they kicked him off the site.</v>

5221
02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:26.801
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5222
02:10:26.801 --> 02:10:28.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean I guess if you're talking about you're right.</v>

5223
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.840
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

5224
02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:29.261
<v Speaker 5>sure,</v>

5225
02:10:29.261 --> 02:10:30.041
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's their right,</v>

5226
02:10:30.041 --> 02:10:31.420
<v Speaker 5>but I disagree with them doing it.</v>

5227
02:10:31.450 --> 02:10:31.900
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

5228
02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:33.380
<v Speaker 5>I would like a world where you were like,</v>

5229
02:10:33.381 --> 02:10:34.214
<v Speaker 5>we don't,</v>

5230
02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:37.100
<v Speaker 5>unless it's physical harm to someone,</v>

5231
02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:38.330
<v Speaker 5>possibly monetary,</v>

5232
02:10:38.331 --> 02:10:39.740
<v Speaker 5>like direct monetary harm,</v>

5233
02:10:39.741 --> 02:10:40.760
<v Speaker 5>like I'm stealing from you.</v>

5234
02:10:41.170 --> 02:10:44.240
<v Speaker 5>It infringes on your rights then do what you want.</v>

5235
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:45.200
<v Speaker 5>Say what you want.</v>

5236
02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:45.860
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5237
02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:48.170
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't infringe on your rights and keep going.</v>

5238
02:10:48.230 --> 02:10:48.351
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5239
02:10:48.351 --> 02:10:52.040
<v Speaker 5>the problem he comes who's to decide what is hate speech.</v>

5240
02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:52.630
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

5241
02:10:52.630 --> 02:10:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Who we don't decide that and who is to decide.</v>

5242
02:10:56.090 --> 02:10:59.750
<v Speaker 5>Is it saying retard in a Thompson Gora special hate speech?</v>

5243
02:11:00.730 --> 02:11:01.230
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

5244
02:11:01.230 --> 02:11:01.890
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

5245
02:11:01.890 --> 02:11:06.890
<v Speaker 5>it's such a slippery slope that the only way to do it is if you infringe on</v>

5246
02:11:07.011 --> 02:11:07.640
<v Speaker 5>someone's right,</v>

5247
02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:09.770
<v Speaker 5>you've gone too far because you haven't,</v>

5248
02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:13.220
<v Speaker 5>you have not yelling fire in a crowded theater.</v>

5249
02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:13.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5250
02:11:13.810 --> 02:11:14.150
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

5251
02:11:14.150 --> 02:11:15.240
<v Speaker 5>it's free speech until you,</v>

5252
02:11:15.241 --> 02:11:16.580
<v Speaker 5>like someone is going to get,</v>

5253
02:11:16.610 --> 02:11:19.730
<v Speaker 5>is getting hurt from this or it's very possible that they will,</v>

5254
02:11:19.731 --> 02:11:22.730
<v Speaker 5>you can see why they would not just like it might hurt their feelings.</v>

5255
02:11:22.731 --> 02:11:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Am I making it harder for them to,</v>

5256
02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:24.620
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

5257
02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:26.450
<v Speaker 5>to be a kid in this world?</v>

5258
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:27.763
<v Speaker 5>It's like no.</v>

5259
02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:28.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5260
02:11:28.530 --> 02:11:28.741
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5261
02:11:28.741 --> 02:11:29.490
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

5262
02:11:29.490 --> 02:11:30.990
<v Speaker 3>But I also agree that if you,</v>

5263
02:11:30.991 --> 02:11:35.991
<v Speaker 3>or NBC or ABC or CBS and someone says things that you feel violate your</v>

5264
02:11:38.251 --> 02:11:39.660
<v Speaker 3>company's policies,</v>

5265
02:11:39.690 --> 02:11:40.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5266
02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:44.940
<v Speaker 3>So if someone promotes some outlandish conspiracy theory about children that</v>

5267
02:11:44.941 --> 02:11:47.220
<v Speaker 3>gets shot in Parkland really never died.</v>

5268
02:11:47.221 --> 02:11:50.530
<v Speaker 3>And their parents are all crisis actors paid by the CIA.</v>

5269
02:11:50.531 --> 02:11:52.560
<v Speaker 3>It's a psy op and you know,</v>

5270
02:11:52.561 --> 02:11:54.410
<v Speaker 3>this person is on CBS,</v>

5271
02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:57.340
<v Speaker 3>you can fire them right now.</v>

5272
02:11:57.341 --> 02:11:58.174
<v Speaker 3>Worries the question.</v>

5273
02:11:58.200 --> 02:11:59.700
<v Speaker 3>But let me finish here.</v>

5274
02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:03.060
<v Speaker 3>So is Twitter like CBS Ppas,</v>

5275
02:12:03.061 --> 02:12:04.380
<v Speaker 3>they're both private companies.</v>

5276
02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:09.560
<v Speaker 3>And are the people who are on broadcasting on periscope and on Youtube,</v>

5277
02:12:11.130 --> 02:12:14.790
<v Speaker 3>are they essentially someone who is,</v>

5278
02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:15.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean you kind of,</v>

5279
02:12:15.810 --> 02:12:20.810
<v Speaker 3>are you working with or for Youtube if you're broadcasting on Youtube?</v>

5280
02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:21.181
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5281
02:12:21.181 --> 02:12:22.014
<v Speaker 3>how do you look at it?</v>

5282
02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:22.951
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

5283
02:12:22.951 --> 02:12:23.820
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a private thing.</v>

5284
02:12:23.821 --> 02:12:24.240
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>

5285
02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:27.870
<v Speaker 5>I think if you're making a video on how to make a bomb,</v>

5286
02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:28.890
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5287
02:12:28.890 --> 02:12:30.450
<v Speaker 5>I think the authority should get in there,</v>

5288
02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:30.780
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5289
02:12:30.780 --> 02:12:31.740
<v Speaker 5>So you can't do that.</v>

5290
02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:36.440
<v Speaker 3>But what if you making a video about how there's some people out there that are</v>

5291
02:12:36.441 --> 02:12:38.380
<v Speaker 3>lying about their children being shot?</v>

5292
02:12:38.410 --> 02:12:39.090
<v Speaker 5>Same thing.</v>

5293
02:12:39.090 --> 02:12:39.811
<v Speaker 5>Got The authorities.</v>

5294
02:12:39.811 --> 02:12:41.100
<v Speaker 5>Then if you think it's leading to harm,</v>

5295
02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:42.630
<v Speaker 5>but it's not the company,</v>

5296
02:12:42.631 --> 02:12:43.300
<v Speaker 5>so you don't do it,</v>

5297
02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:44.320
<v Speaker 3>you should be allowed.</v>

5298
02:12:44.321 --> 02:12:45.280
<v Speaker 3>If your youtube,</v>

5299
02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:47.020
<v Speaker 3>you don't think you should be allowed to tell someone,</v>

5300
02:12:47.021 --> 02:12:47.381
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

5301
02:12:47.381 --> 02:12:48.430
<v Speaker 3>you say a bunch of shit,</v>

5302
02:12:48.431 --> 02:12:50.560
<v Speaker 3>that's not true and it hurts people.</v>

5303
02:12:51.090 --> 02:12:51.670
<v Speaker 3>What's your,</v>

5304
02:12:51.670 --> 02:12:52.091
<v Speaker 3>what's the word?</v>

5305
02:12:52.091 --> 02:12:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Hurt me.</v>

5306
02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

5307
02:12:53.110 --> 02:12:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

5308
02:12:53.530 --> 02:12:58.530
<v Speaker 3>if your children were murdered and there's some guy screaming on youtube that</v>

5309
02:12:58.781 --> 02:13:02.110
<v Speaker 3>you're a crisis actor and nothing ever happened to your kid and your kids,</v>

5310

<v Speaker 3>it's a lie.</v>

5311
02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:07.090
<v Speaker 3>And there's rubber kids in the ground with fake blood and they can prove it with</v>

5312
02:13:07.091 --> 02:13:08.230
<v Speaker 3>the Hologram.</v>

5320
02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:20.530

<v Speaker 4>And then other people had to do things like create a blockade around their cars</v>

5344
02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:52.840
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>

02:13:57.210 --> 02:13:58.230
<v Speaker 4>that's sucky behavior.</v>

5351
02:13:58.260 --> 02:13:59.460
<v Speaker 4>You can't stop them from doing it.</v>

5352
02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:00.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5353
02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:00.920
<v Speaker 4>You so,</v>

5354
02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:01.200
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5355
02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:03.450
<v Speaker 4>so go to CME terms of public discourse.</v>

5356
02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:05.420
<v Speaker 4>So go to CBS and say that and say like,</v>

5357
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.880
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5358
02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:08.520
<v Speaker 4>we can take you down because you've said things that are totally untrue.</v>

5359
02:14:08.970 --> 02:14:12.090
<v Speaker 4>What about the guy who gets caught smoking weed in,</v>

5360
02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:12.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5361
02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:15.030
<v Speaker 4>I was a legal state and I'm in Alabama.</v>

5362
02:14:15.690 --> 02:14:16.590
<v Speaker 4>Could you fire from that?</v>

5363
02:14:17.250 --> 02:14:17.401
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5364
02:14:17.401 --> 02:14:18.390
<v Speaker 4>but that's a different thing.</v>

5365
02:14:18.510 --> 02:14:20.160
<v Speaker 4>It goes against what we think is okay.</v>

5366
02:14:20.970 --> 02:14:21.900
<v Speaker 4>That's a slippery slope.</v>

5367
02:14:21.930 --> 02:14:22.141
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5368
02:14:22.141 --> 02:14:22.620
<v Speaker 4>if you're saying,</v>

5369
02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:24.030
<v Speaker 4>are you allowed legally?</v>

5370
02:14:24.060 --> 02:14:24.271
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

5371
02:14:24.271 --> 02:14:25.104
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

5372
02:14:25.650 --> 02:14:26.371
<v Speaker 4>But morally,</v>

5373
02:14:26.371 --> 02:14:26.850
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

5374
02:14:26.850 --> 02:14:27.420
<v Speaker 4>I think you,</v>

5375
02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:29.430
<v Speaker 4>you're a fucking platform for speech.</v>

5376
02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:30.840
<v Speaker 4>So let all the speech in.</v>

5377
02:14:30.980 --> 02:14:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Mm.</v>

5378
02:14:31.590 --> 02:14:34.800
<v Speaker 4>And four Chan got written up as this fucking hateful place.</v>

5379
02:14:34.801 --> 02:14:35.191
<v Speaker 4>We're really,</v>

5380
02:14:35.191 --> 02:14:36.270
<v Speaker 4>they're just trolls.</v>

5381
02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:39.570
<v Speaker 4>And they know one of the best ways to troll is using Donald Trump.</v>

5382
02:14:39.630 --> 02:14:39.751
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5383
02:14:39.751 --> 02:14:39.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5384
02:14:39.910 --> 02:14:43.260
<v Speaker 4>there was a really interesting case with four Chan that I found preposterous</v>

5385
02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:45.680
<v Speaker 4>where they trolled Sheil booth.</v>

5386
02:14:45.790 --> 02:14:46.623
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

5388
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:48.331
<v Speaker 4>that podcast.</v>

5389
02:14:48.331 --> 02:14:48.721
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

5390
02:14:48.721 --> 02:14:50.570
<v Speaker 4>We tell us it was great.</v>

5391
02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:51.390
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>

5392
02:14:51.390 --> 02:14:52.051
<v Speaker 4>It was hilarious.</v>

5393
02:14:52.051 --> 02:14:52.411
<v Speaker 4>And people go,</v>

5398
02:14:56.970 --> 02:14:59.040
<v Speaker 4>We've just said that they're not a hate group.</v>

02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Well most of that frog thing was fun.</v>

5455
02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:23.273
<v Speaker 4>It was fun.</v>

5456
02:16:23.310 --> 02:16:23.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5457
02:16:23.670 --> 02:16:26.190
<v Speaker 4>And there was a few instances of that frog,</v>

5458
02:16:26.191 --> 02:16:29.770
<v Speaker 4>which were racist or KKK versions or Nazi versions.</v>

5459
02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:32.470
<v Speaker 4>And then people decided that whole frog racist.</v>

5460
02:16:32.471 --> 02:16:35.410
<v Speaker 4>But he's all over in Geneva as a good luck sign.</v>

5461
02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:36.400
<v Speaker 4>Different different case.</v>

5462
02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:40.170
<v Speaker 4>The vast majority of the use of that frog was not racist.</v>

5463
02:16:40.300 --> 02:16:41.500
<v Speaker 4>The vast majority was,</v>

5464
02:16:41.501 --> 02:16:42.161
<v Speaker 4>feels bad,</v>

5465
02:16:42.161 --> 02:16:42.660
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5466
02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:42.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5467
02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:44.140
<v Speaker 4>It was silly trolling.</v>

5468
02:16:44.290 --> 02:16:45.340
<v Speaker 4>It was just being silly.</v>

5469
02:16:45.341 --> 02:16:45.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5470
02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:46.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5471
02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:47.230
<v Speaker 4>And then there was like,</v>

5472
02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:50.440
<v Speaker 4>you can't let people coopt a frog,</v>

5473
02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:51.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5474
02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:52.360
<v Speaker 4>NPR,</v>

5475
02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:54.760
<v Speaker 4>I think it was NPR podcasts.</v>

5476
02:16:54.761 --> 02:16:55.570
<v Speaker 4>It might've been,</v>

5477
02:16:55.570 --> 02:16:56.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure what the company was.</v>

5478
02:16:57.140 --> 02:16:57.581
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

5479
02:16:57.581 --> 02:16:57.671
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5480
02:16:57.671 --> 02:16:58.270
<v Speaker 4>we'll take it down.</v>

5481
02:16:58.270 --> 02:16:58.871
<v Speaker 4>You can still have it.</v>

5482
02:16:58.871 --> 02:17:00.520
<v Speaker 4>It's still on Radiolab.</v>

5483
02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:01.030
<v Speaker 4>Radiolab.</v>

5484
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.290
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5485
02:17:01.290 --> 02:17:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5486
02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:02.141
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

5487
02:17:02.141 --> 02:17:02.771
<v Speaker 4>sorry about that.</v>

5488
02:17:02.771 --> 02:17:04.360
<v Speaker 4>We'll take it out on youtube.</v>

5489
02:17:04.930 --> 02:17:05.763
<v Speaker 4>I just heard it.</v>

5490
02:17:05.770 --> 02:17:05.981
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5491
02:17:05.981 --> 02:17:06.761
<v Speaker 4>I have two was taking,</v>

5492
02:17:06.761 --> 02:17:07.511
<v Speaker 4>downloaded it.</v>

5493
02:17:07.511 --> 02:17:08.980
<v Speaker 4>And then when I went to send people to it,</v>

5494
02:17:08.981 --> 02:17:13.420
<v Speaker 4>I found out on the show on the podcast that it had been taken down and I was</v>

5495
02:17:13.421 --> 02:17:13.511
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

5496
02:17:13.511 --> 02:17:15.250
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be fucking version is down,</v>

5497
02:17:15.251 --> 02:17:16.540
<v Speaker 4>but you can still get it other places.</v>

5498
02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:18.610
<v Speaker 4>But for them to apologize is meet saying,</v>

5499
02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:18.881
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5500
02:17:18.881 --> 02:17:19.540
<v Speaker 4>you're weak.</v>

5501
02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:20.710
<v Speaker 4>You're allowed to take that down.</v>

5502
02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:21.160
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5503
02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:23.200
<v Speaker 4>But for someone else to come in and say,</v>

5504
02:17:23.201 --> 02:17:25.540
<v Speaker 4>you can't make podcasts anymore,</v>

5505
02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:26.210
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

5506
02:17:26.210 --> 02:17:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Is like really dangerous.</v>

5507
02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:30.370
<v Speaker 4>And that could have happened from that.</v>

5508
02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:31.390
<v Speaker 4>If someone had said,</v>

5509
02:17:31.391 --> 02:17:31.601
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5510
02:17:31.601 --> 02:17:32.890
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to take it down.</v>

5511
02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.890
<v Speaker 4>So radio lab is now hate monger.</v>

5512
02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:36.130
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

5513
02:17:36.130 --> 02:17:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Their support.</v>

5514
02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:40.330
<v Speaker 4>They support four Chan for Chan's about Hitler radio lab supports Hitler.</v>

5515
02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:40.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5516
02:17:40.810 --> 02:17:41.321
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is,</v>

5517
02:17:41.321 --> 02:17:42.640
<v Speaker 4>this is a circular logic.</v>

5518
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5519
02:17:42.991 --> 02:17:47.050
<v Speaker 4>So the only answer is you have to have a strong line and it's causing direct</v>

5520
02:17:47.051 --> 02:17:50.560
<v Speaker 4>physical damage to someone that's everything's allowed.</v>

5521
02:17:50.561 --> 02:17:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5522
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:51.610
<v Speaker 4>W Dave,</v>

5523
02:17:51.610 --> 02:17:52.300
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

5524
02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:53.740
<v Speaker 4>the Internet is a horrible place.</v>

5525
02:17:54.190 --> 02:17:55.510
<v Speaker 4>It's a great place to though.</v>

5526
02:17:55.630 --> 02:17:57.610
<v Speaker 4>They should have never fucking taken that down.</v>

5527
02:17:57.640 --> 02:17:57.910
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

5528
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:58.970
<v Speaker 4>They should have been like that podcast.</v>

5529
02:17:59.050 --> 02:18:02.880
<v Speaker 4>You listen to it and it made me laugh so hard.</v>

5530
02:18:02.890 --> 02:18:06.390
<v Speaker 4>They told him how they got together in a trolling Isaac [inaudible],</v>

5531
02:18:06.430 --> 02:18:08.460
<v Speaker 4>science logic.</v>

5532
02:18:08.470 --> 02:18:08.831
<v Speaker 4>These things.</v>

5533
02:18:08.831 --> 02:18:11.320
<v Speaker 4>These are smart fucking people that figured out where that flag was</v>

5534
02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:13.653
<v Speaker 4>hilarious.</v>

5535
02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:15.130
<v Speaker 4>It was such a good podcast.</v>

5536
02:18:15.131 --> 02:18:15.851
<v Speaker 4>But being wild,</v>

5537
02:18:15.851 --> 02:18:16.600
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

5538
02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:18.010
<v Speaker 4>meet talking about it on,</v>

5539
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.940
<v Speaker 4>on people.</v>

5540
02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:19.150
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

5541
02:18:19.150 --> 02:18:20.590
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe you don't get it.</v>

5542
02:18:20.770 --> 02:18:21.371
<v Speaker 4>You know you,</v>

5543
02:18:21.371 --> 02:18:22.091

02:18:22.091 --> 02:18:24.370
<v Speaker 4>you always have all these white supremacists on.</v>

5545
02:18:24.430 --> 02:18:25.480
<v Speaker 4>Are you all right?</v>

5546
02:18:25.510 --> 02:18:26.081
<v Speaker 4>Are you this?</v>

5547
02:18:26.081 --> 02:18:26.670

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5552
02:18:36.461 --> 02:18:37.690
<v Speaker 4>I used to think he was a good guy.</v>

5553
02:18:37.810 --> 02:18:40.510
<v Speaker 4>Now I think he's a white supremacist or he's a fucking racist.</v>

5554
02:18:40.511 --> 02:18:41.640
<v Speaker 4>He's a KKK person.</v>

5555
02:18:41.650 --> 02:18:42.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5556
02:18:42.090 --> 02:18:42.671
<v Speaker 4>I guess so.</v>

5557
02:18:42.671 --> 02:18:43.331
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>

5558
02:18:43.331 --> 02:18:44.260
<v Speaker 4>One of my favorite books,</v>

5559
02:18:44.261 --> 02:18:44.951
<v Speaker 4>maybe my favorite,</v>

5560
02:18:44.951 --> 02:18:46.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't like to use that word favorite,</v>

5561
02:18:46.021 --> 02:18:51.021
<v Speaker 4>but like the fountainhead by Ayn rand and people go like,</v>

5562
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:52.780
<v Speaker 4>oh social isyou know,</v>

5563
02:18:52.810 --> 02:18:53.111

5564
02:18:53.111 --> 02:18:54.930
<v Speaker 4>she took fucking social security in her old age.</v>

5565
02:18:54.930 --> 02:18:55.763
<v Speaker 4>She never did.</v>

5566
02:18:55.870 --> 02:18:56.261
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

5567
02:18:56.261 --> 02:18:56.651
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5568
02:18:56.651 --> 02:18:57.140
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

5569
02:18:57.140 --> 02:18:59.590
<v Speaker 4>And I used to shit on it and I'm right all the time myself.</v>

5570
02:18:59.770 --> 02:19:01.840
<v Speaker 4>And then I realize I've actually never read a book,</v>

5571
02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:05.830
<v Speaker 4>read the fountainhead and it changed my life like not even a little bit to the</v>

5572
02:19:05.831 --> 02:19:06.970
<v Speaker 4>direction of my career.</v>

5573
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:09.340
<v Speaker 4>I still correct it freed me as an artist.</v>

5574
02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:09.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5575
02:19:09.540 --> 02:19:11.950
<v Speaker 4>so you've got to read it Bro.</v>

5576
02:19:11.951 --> 02:19:12.360
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

5577
02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:12.640
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5578
02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:14.830
<v Speaker 4>it's all about how to read a chapter of,</v>

5579
02:19:14.831 --> 02:19:18.130
<v Speaker 4>it took me a year and a half to read every chapter.</v>

5580
02:19:18.131 --> 02:19:18.670
<v Speaker 4>I'd sit down,</v>

5581
02:19:18.670 --> 02:19:19.690
<v Speaker 4>I think about it for two weeks.</v>

5582
02:19:19.691 --> 02:19:22.540
<v Speaker 4>What I read that the Jordan Peterson talks about her as a,</v>

5583
02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:23.411
<v Speaker 4>as a philosopher.</v>

5584
02:19:23.411 --> 02:19:25.360
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't like her as a novelist.</v>

5585
02:19:25.361 --> 02:19:25.901
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

5586
02:19:25.901 --> 02:19:26.400
<v Speaker 4>she's great.</v>

5587
02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:26.690
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

5588
02:19:26.690 --> 02:19:27.160
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

5589
02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:27.831
<v Speaker 4>what was it about it?</v>

5590
02:19:27.831 --> 02:19:27.971
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

5591
02:19:27.971 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 4>it</v>

5592
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:30.040
<v Speaker 5>shows you a true artist and it shows you a,</v>

5593
02:19:30.041 --> 02:19:32.570
<v Speaker 5>a jobber and the jobber.</v>

5594
02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:33.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5595
02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:34.220
<v Speaker 5>like pro wrestling style,</v>

5596
02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:38.330
<v Speaker 5>sort of someone who's just like doing it for the money as opposed to what a</v>

5597
02:19:38.331 --> 02:19:38.990
<v Speaker 5>pure,</v>

5598
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:39.823
<v Speaker 5>like Abby,</v>

5599
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:40.663
<v Speaker 5>Abby Martin,</v>

5600
02:19:40.780 --> 02:19:41.361
<v Speaker 5>he Harris,</v>

5601
02:19:41.361 --> 02:19:41.900
<v Speaker 5>what's her name?</v>

5602
02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:42.410
<v Speaker 5>Which one?</v>

5603
02:19:42.410 --> 02:19:43.150
<v Speaker 5>The journalists.</v>

5604
02:19:43.150 --> 02:19:44.120
<v Speaker 5>Abby Martin Martin,</v>

5605
02:19:44.121 --> 02:19:44.261
<v Speaker 5>who was,</v>

5606
02:19:44.261 --> 02:19:44.570
<v Speaker 5>she's like,</v>

5607
02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:44.721
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5608
02:19:44.721 --> 02:19:46.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to just take money for reporting.</v>

5609
02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:48.290
<v Speaker 5>I want to actually real report now.</v>

5610
02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:48.860
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

5611
02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:50.540
<v Speaker 5>So she's a ton of a true artist,</v>

5612
02:19:50.541 --> 02:19:51.374
<v Speaker 5>at least in that moment.</v>

5613
02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:55.460
<v Speaker 5>And none of us can be a fully true artist and none of us are really just full</v>

5614
02:19:55.470 --> 02:19:55.971
<v Speaker 5>jobbers.</v>

5615
02:19:55.971 --> 02:19:57.890
<v Speaker 5>We will have a little bit of artistic taste.</v>

5616
02:19:57.891 --> 02:19:59.810
<v Speaker 5>Even the jobbers have the fucking little bit of like,</v>

5617
02:19:59.811 --> 02:20:00.680
<v Speaker 5>I wanna do some interesting,</v>

5618
02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:01.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5619
02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:02.420
<v Speaker 5>and the full artists,</v>

5620
02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:03.373
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

5621
02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:04.490
<v Speaker 5>it's an almost an impossible,</v>

5622
02:20:04.491 --> 02:20:05.540
<v Speaker 5>a hundred percent ideal.</v>

5623
02:20:06.200 --> 02:20:08.120
<v Speaker 5>But if you can only aim for that,</v>

5624
02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:10.220
<v Speaker 5>if a sponsor says,</v>

5625
02:20:10.221 --> 02:20:13.100
<v Speaker 5>we need you to fucking tone it down to realize like,</v>

5626
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:14.390
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck,</v>

5627
02:20:14.450 --> 02:20:15.830
<v Speaker 5>I just came up another four grand.</v>

5628
02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:16.700
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5629
02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:17.181
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

5630
02:20:17.181 --> 02:20:18.200
<v Speaker 5>I can't use you anymore,</v>

5631
02:20:18.270 --> 02:20:18.830
<v Speaker 5>goddammit.</v>

5632
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:19.360
<v Speaker 5>I hate this.</v>

5633
02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:21.590
<v Speaker 5>That's what fuck you money is all about sort of.</v>

5634
02:20:21.591 --> 02:20:21.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5635
02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:24.010
<v Speaker 5>but this guy didn't have fuck you money in the,</v>

5636
02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:24.621
<v Speaker 5>this guy's like,</v>

5637
02:20:24.621 --> 02:20:25.170
<v Speaker 5>I'll go back up.</v>

5638
02:20:25.170 --> 02:20:25.760
<v Speaker 5>Mike's,</v>

5639
02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:26.840
<v Speaker 5>I'll go back to open mikes.</v>

5640
02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:31.340
<v Speaker 5>You can't take away my ability to freely do this no matter what.</v>

5641
02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:34.940
<v Speaker 5>So it freed me in terms of like being able to think that way,</v>

5642
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.931
<v Speaker 5>who's really,</v>

5643
02:20:35.931 --> 02:20:37.130
<v Speaker 5>really informative to me.</v>

5644
02:20:37.490 --> 02:20:38.930
<v Speaker 5>But if I had just heard these people going,</v>

5645
02:20:38.931 --> 02:20:39.381
<v Speaker 5>fuck her,</v>

5646
02:20:39.381 --> 02:20:40.340
<v Speaker 5>she's a socialist.</v>

5647
02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:41.473
<v Speaker 5>And then you read it like,</v>

5648
02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:41.721
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5649
02:20:41.721 --> 02:20:42.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm not getting what you're saying.</v>

5650
02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:43.260
<v Speaker 5>I did this,</v>

5651
02:20:43.260 --> 02:20:43.541
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

5652
02:20:43.541 --> 02:20:45.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm missing this amazing stuff.</v>

5653
02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:46.700
<v Speaker 5>So the people who will just say,</v>

5654
02:20:46.701 --> 02:20:47.421
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck you,</v>

5655
02:20:47.421 --> 02:20:48.620
<v Speaker 5>four Chan is hatemongers.</v>

5656
02:20:48.621 --> 02:20:49.760
<v Speaker 5>It's like you didn't really even,</v>

5657
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:51.380
<v Speaker 5>you're not even listening to what they're actually doing.</v>

5658
02:20:51.730 --> 02:20:53.740
<v Speaker 6>As soon as you eliminate nuance and you eat,</v>

5659
02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:55.960
<v Speaker 6>you have reductionist ideology,</v>

5660
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.350
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5661
02:20:56.350 --> 02:20:57.550
<v Speaker 6>You just want to reduce something to,</v>

5662
02:20:57.551 --> 02:20:57.710
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

5663
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:58.480
<v Speaker 6>he's racist.</v>

5664
02:20:58.480 --> 02:20:58.631
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

5665
02:20:58.631 --> 02:20:59.350
<v Speaker 6>he's hateful.</v>

5666
02:20:59.350 --> 02:20:59.471
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

5667
02:20:59.471 --> 02:20:59.861
<v Speaker 6>he's this.</v>

5668
02:20:59.861 --> 02:21:00.550
<v Speaker 6>He's that,</v>

5669
02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:01.000
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

5670
02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:01.780
<v Speaker 6>that is the,</v>

5671
02:21:01.780 --> 02:21:03.190
<v Speaker 6>that's where ideas go to die.</v>

5672
02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:03.950
<v Speaker 6>Does you,</v>

5673
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:04.610
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

5674
02:21:04.610 --> 02:21:07.870
<v Speaker 6>you eliminate what is what it is to be a human,</v>

5675
02:21:07.871 --> 02:21:10.510
<v Speaker 6>what needs to be a human is to be constantly conflicted,</v>

5676
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:13.150
<v Speaker 6>to deal with a bunch of different contrary ideas,</v>

5677
02:21:13.151 --> 02:21:15.280
<v Speaker 6>bouncing around your head left and right all the time.</v>

5678
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:16.300
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5679
02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:18.310
<v Speaker 6>and if you,</v>

5680
02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:22.690
<v Speaker 6>if you want to eliminate the ability to talk to people that you don't agree</v>

5681
02:21:22.691 --> 02:21:23.524
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

5682
02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:24.040
<v Speaker 6>boy,</v>

5683
02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:27.550
<v Speaker 6>you're living in a fucking bizarre bubble because you're not going to agree with</v>

5684
02:21:27.551 --> 02:21:28.690
<v Speaker 6>yourself five years from now.</v>

5685
02:21:28.691 --> 02:21:29.410
<v Speaker 6>Most likely.</v>

5686
02:21:29.410 --> 02:21:29.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5687
02:21:29.650 --> 02:21:29.951
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5688
02:21:29.951 --> 02:21:31.420
<v Speaker 6>if I had an argument today,</v>

5689
02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:33.190
<v Speaker 6>15 years ago,</v>

5690
02:21:33.370 --> 02:21:34.203
<v Speaker 6>I'd be like,</v>

5691
02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:34.571
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

5692
02:21:34.571 --> 02:21:35.620
<v Speaker 6>you're a fucking dumb ass.</v>

5693
02:21:36.010 --> 02:21:37.390
<v Speaker 6>You need to stop thinking this way.</v>

5694
02:21:37.391 --> 02:21:38.470
<v Speaker 6>You need to stop doing this.</v>

5695
02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:40.420
<v Speaker 6>He need to look at yourself more objectively.</v>

5696
02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:42.640
<v Speaker 5>Tell you why.</v>

5697
02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:43.141
<v Speaker 5>Think that.</v>

5698
02:21:43.141 --> 02:21:43.581
<v Speaker 5>And just like,</v>

5699
02:21:43.581 --> 02:21:43.741
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

5700
02:21:43.741 --> 02:21:43.870
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

5701
02:21:43.870 --> 02:21:46.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean the fact that we're so divisive,</v>

5702
02:21:46.681 --> 02:21:48.390
<v Speaker 5>but like no one listens.</v>

5703
02:21:48.391 --> 02:21:49.210
<v Speaker 5>The other side I'll,</v>

5704
02:21:49.210 --> 02:21:51.540
<v Speaker 5>I'll give the easiest argument to me is abortion.</v>

5705
02:21:52.050 --> 02:21:52.883
<v Speaker 5>Where it's like,</v>

5706
02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:53.161
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5707
02:21:53.161 --> 02:21:54.760
<v Speaker 5>both sides of pro life,</v>

5708
02:21:55.350 --> 02:21:58.830
<v Speaker 5>the idea of life and both sides are also pro choice.</v>

5709
02:21:58.831 --> 02:22:00.030
<v Speaker 5>No one's against choice,</v>

5710
02:22:00.420 --> 02:22:01.950
<v Speaker 5>but you're not hearing the other side.</v>

5711
02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:03.570
<v Speaker 5>So one side is saying,</v>

5712
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:04.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5713
02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:05.700
<v Speaker 5>it's a woman's right to choose her body.</v>

5714
02:22:05.730 --> 02:22:06.181
<v Speaker 5>It's her choice.</v>

5715
02:22:06.181 --> 02:22:06.480
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

5716
02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:06.751
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

5717
02:22:06.751 --> 02:22:08.160
<v Speaker 5>but yes,</v>

5718
02:22:08.161 --> 02:22:08.641
<v Speaker 5>it's her body,</v>

5719
02:22:08.641 --> 02:22:09.750
<v Speaker 5>but it ain't a tattoo.</v>

5720
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:10.471
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

5721
02:22:10.471 --> 02:22:10.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5722
02:22:10.831 --> 02:22:12.690
<v Speaker 5>there's more to it than just her body.</v>

5723
02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:13.801
<v Speaker 5>And then the other side,</v>

5724
02:22:13.801 --> 02:22:14.340
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

5725
02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:15.031
<v Speaker 5>it's a human life.</v>

5726
02:22:15.031 --> 02:22:15.270
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

5727
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.661
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

5728
02:22:15.661 --> 02:22:15.931
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

5729
02:22:15.931 --> 02:22:16.411
<v Speaker 5>it's a life,</v>

5730
02:22:16.411 --> 02:22:19.140
<v Speaker 5>but also this chick has to carry it for nine months.</v>

5731
02:22:19.410 --> 02:22:21.360
<v Speaker 5>She's gotta change her whole body in order to carry.</v>

5732
02:22:21.361 --> 02:22:22.410
<v Speaker 5>It's not just simply,</v>

5733
02:22:22.590 --> 02:22:23.220
<v Speaker 5>it's a life.</v>

5734
02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:24.750
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they're going in and murdering babies.</v>

5735
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:25.823
<v Speaker 5>It's in a cuma.</v>

5736
02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

5737
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.150
<v Speaker 4>can you guys actually talk,</v>

5738
02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:29.640
<v Speaker 4>can you guys really talk and own up to like,</v>

5739
02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:31.830
<v Speaker 4>it's no more than just one side ground.</v>

5740
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:32.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5741
02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:33.253
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5742
02:22:33.570 --> 02:22:36.120
<v Speaker 4>The people with the pro choice or saying no,</v>

5743
02:22:36.121 --> 02:22:38.670
<v Speaker 4>it's a woman's right to choose and the people that are pro life,</v>

5744
02:22:38.671 --> 02:22:41.790
<v Speaker 4>so you know you're killing a baby and if you give up any ground,</v>

5745
02:22:41.791 --> 02:22:42.780
<v Speaker 4>the baby's going to die.</v>

5746
02:22:42.970 --> 02:22:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Or I'm going to take away a woman's right to have an abortion and then she's</v>

5747
02:22:45.931 --> 02:22:47.940
<v Speaker 4>going to have to carry a bunch of kids from people that raped her.</v>

5748
02:22:48.420 --> 02:22:48.751
<v Speaker 4>And there's,</v>

5749
02:22:48.751 --> 02:22:51.420
<v Speaker 4>this is the worst case scenario and extremes on both ends.</v>

5750
02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:52.351
<v Speaker 4>As a booker,</v>

5751
02:22:52.351 --> 02:22:53.310
<v Speaker 4>as a former booker,</v>

5752
02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:55.050
<v Speaker 4>someone who books a show,</v>

5753
02:22:55.051 --> 02:22:55.321
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

5754
02:22:55.321 --> 02:22:55.921
<v Speaker 4>you need more women.</v>

5755
02:22:55.921 --> 02:22:56.160
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

5756
02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:56.311
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5757
02:22:56.311 --> 02:22:57.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at hard,</v>

5758
02:22:57.810 --> 02:23:00.420
<v Speaker 4>but you have to understand that I'm not going to hurt my product over.</v>

5759
02:23:00.421 --> 02:23:01.230
<v Speaker 4>I do want diversity.</v>

5760
02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:02.490
<v Speaker 4>I want diversity of opinion on there.</v>

5761
02:23:02.491 --> 02:23:03.690
<v Speaker 4>I want diversity of experience.</v>

5762
02:23:03.810 --> 02:23:05.010
<v Speaker 4>I want some Australians,</v>

5763
02:23:05.011 --> 02:23:06.840
<v Speaker 4>I want some fucking black people.</v>

5764
02:23:07.020 --> 02:23:10.740
<v Speaker 4>Ali Said deek cause a far different life experience than I do.</v>

5765
02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:11.180
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5766
02:23:11.180 --> 02:23:11.370
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5767
02:23:11.370 --> 02:23:12.300
<v Speaker 4>forget about my race.</v>

5768
02:23:12.301 --> 02:23:14.220
<v Speaker 4>Just his life experience is way different.</v>

5769
02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:14.851
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5770
02:23:14.851 --> 02:23:16.320
<v Speaker 4>all I see Deacon Byron Bowers,</v>

5771
02:23:16.321 --> 02:23:18.420
<v Speaker 4>both black guys gives a far different worldview.</v>

5772
02:23:18.570 --> 02:23:19.403
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5773
02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:21.480
<v Speaker 4>So I do want that diversity of experience,</v>

5774
02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:22.720
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not going to hurt my PR.</v>

5775
02:23:22.730 --> 02:23:24.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna get some shitty guy who just was in prison,</v>

5776
02:23:24.781 --> 02:23:25.800
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have to tell the story.</v>

5777
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:26.220
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5778
02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:27.330
<v Speaker 4>So I'll work hard,</v>

5779
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:29.040
<v Speaker 4>but meet me halfway.</v>

5780
02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:30.121
<v Speaker 4>I will do it,</v>

5781
02:23:30.121 --> 02:23:31.500
<v Speaker 4>but find me quality people.</v>

5782
02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:34.590
<v Speaker 4>So I'll go to fucking Atlanta and five ms pat.</v>

5783
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:35.513
<v Speaker 4>But I'll go,</v>

5784
02:23:35.580 --> 02:23:36.570
<v Speaker 4>I have to go far for it.</v>

5785
02:23:36.810 --> 02:23:39.750
<v Speaker 4>So if somebody cancels on my show and now I have five white guys,</v>

5786
02:23:39.751 --> 02:23:40.830
<v Speaker 4>don't be like fuck you.</v>

5787
02:23:41.610 --> 02:23:43.800
<v Speaker 4>Look into a little more like I just had two chicks cancel,</v>

5788
02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:46.020
<v Speaker 4>so meet me halfway.</v>

5789
02:23:46.470 --> 02:23:51.210
<v Speaker 4>Well whenever you're looking for diversity as opposed to looking for the best</v>

5790
02:23:51.211 --> 02:23:52.200
<v Speaker 4>possible product,</v>

5791
02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:53.453
<v Speaker 4>you've got an issue.</v>

5792
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:56.340
<v Speaker 4>And part of that best part is some diversity of opinion.</v>

5793
02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:56.781
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

5794
02:23:56.781 --> 02:23:57.121
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>

5795
02:23:57.121 --> 02:23:57.510
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

5796
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:58.590
<v Speaker 4>but it should be good.</v>

5797
02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:01.110
<v Speaker 4>And there's no reason why the two are mutually exclusive.</v>

5798
02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:06.980
<v Speaker 4>Like the idea that there's only a certain limited amount of good ideas that come</v>

5799
02:24:07.980 --> 02:24:09.780
<v Speaker 4>mostly from white people is ridiculous.</v>

5800
02:24:10.170 --> 02:24:10.411
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5801
02:24:10.411 --> 02:24:13.890
<v Speaker 4>So there's plenty of ideas that will come from Asians and plenty of ideas that</v>

5802
02:24:13.891 --> 02:24:17.370
<v Speaker 4>come from all sorts of different ethnicities that are also excellent.</v>

5803
02:24:17.550 --> 02:24:19.320
<v Speaker 4>So it's just finding them.</v>

5804
02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:24.450
<v Speaker 4>But when you guarantee that you're going to have five of this and five of that,</v>

5805
02:24:24.451 --> 02:24:25.720
<v Speaker 4>that's when you're going to have a real fucking thing.</v>

5806
02:24:25.721 --> 02:24:26.970
<v Speaker 4>So I had my friends,</v>

5807
02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:28.230
<v Speaker 4>my friend,</v>

5808
02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:29.273
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5809
02:24:29.490 --> 02:24:31.140
<v Speaker 4>Colette said that we're doing in the,</v>

5810
02:24:31.141 --> 02:24:31.531
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

5811
02:24:31.531 --> 02:24:31.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5812
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:34.380
<v Speaker 4>in the business world is they're taking what their industry is,</v>

5813
02:24:34.381 --> 02:24:36.060
<v Speaker 4>the number of let's say,</v>

5814
02:24:36.061 --> 02:24:36.880
<v Speaker 4>men and women only,</v>

5815
02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:38.460
<v Speaker 4>I forget I'm black and white and Latino,</v>

5816
02:24:38.461 --> 02:24:38.730
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

5817
02:24:38.730 --> 02:24:39.330
<v Speaker 4>Just men and women,</v>

5818
02:24:39.330 --> 02:24:42.960
<v Speaker 4>they're taking the number of people in the industry and in order to correct,</v>

5819
02:24:43.530 --> 02:24:43.951
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5820
02:24:43.951 --> 02:24:45.610
<v Speaker 4>an over use of males,</v>

5821
02:24:45.611 --> 02:24:45.991
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

5822
02:24:45.991 --> 02:24:49.290
<v Speaker 4>or the other way over use of females and like autistic training,</v>

5823
02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:50.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5824
02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:51.570
<v Speaker 4>but let's just say in the business world,</v>

5825
02:24:51.870 --> 02:24:53.160
<v Speaker 4>it's 70,</v>

5826
02:24:53.161 --> 02:24:53.710
<v Speaker 4>30,</v>

5827
02:24:53.710 --> 02:24:54.543
<v Speaker 4>making that up.</v>

5828
02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5829
02:24:54.970 --> 02:24:55.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5830
02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:59.460
<v Speaker 4>so what you do is they force you instead of his faith where California is like,</v>

5831
02:24:59.461 --> 02:25:00.930
<v Speaker 4>you must put a woman on your board.</v>

5832
02:25:00.970 --> 02:25:01.230
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

5833
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:01.800
<v Speaker 4>Which means like,</v>

5834
02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:02.041
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5835
02:25:02.041 --> 02:25:02.460
<v Speaker 4>if we just,</v>

5836
02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:03.570
<v Speaker 4>we had three board members,</v>

5837
02:25:03.571 --> 02:25:06.330
<v Speaker 4>one left and we have to hire a woman now wait,</v>

5838
02:25:06.331 --> 02:25:07.770
<v Speaker 4>Bill Gates just became available.</v>

5839
02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:08.910
<v Speaker 4>He wants to work on our board,</v>

5840
02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:09.750
<v Speaker 4>can't hire him,</v>

5841
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:10.583
<v Speaker 4>can't hire him.</v>

5842
02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:12.020
<v Speaker 4>That's hurting my company.</v>

5843
02:25:12.021 --> 02:25:13.070
<v Speaker 4>You got to hire a cigarette time.</v>

5844
02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:13.830
<v Speaker 4>He's great.</v>

5845
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:14.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5846
02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:16.080
<v Speaker 4>so what they said is in order to correct it,</v>

5847
02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:21.140
<v Speaker 4>they will interview at a 10% higher rate than the industry numbers so that</v>

5848
02:25:21.171 --> 02:25:24.040
<v Speaker 4>there'll be exposed slightly to more of the people</v>

5849
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.910
<v Speaker 3>that are underrepresented and over time that would correct the issue without</v>

5850
02:25:27.911 --> 02:25:28.691
<v Speaker 3>hurting any company.</v>

5851
02:25:28.691 --> 02:25:29.710
<v Speaker 3>I have to here,</v>

5852
02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:33.250
<v Speaker 3>well let me hear why you think you're right for the job and eventually you will</v>

5853
02:25:33.251 --> 02:25:33.731
<v Speaker 3>hear is people are like,</v>

5854
02:25:33.731 --> 02:25:33.941
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

5855
02:25:33.941 --> 02:25:35.020
<v Speaker 3>she was actually really good.</v>

5856
02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:36.730
<v Speaker 3>Let's actually heart here or there,</v>

5857
02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:38.050
<v Speaker 3>but if it's still bill gates,</v>

5858
02:25:38.051 --> 02:25:39.190
<v Speaker 3>you probably didn't get the job over him.</v>

5859
02:25:39.430 --> 02:25:40.480
<v Speaker 3>He's got his fucking,</v>

5860
02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:41.733
<v Speaker 3>he's got his resume.</v>

5861
02:25:41.890 --> 02:25:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Well that's where Jordan Peterson comes in with this equality of outcome id</v>

5862
02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:48.790
<v Speaker 3>argument and the equality of outcome argument is,</v>

5863
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:51.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a dangerous argument if you guarantee a quality of outcome.</v>

5864
02:25:52.420 --> 02:25:57.420
<v Speaker 3>But I want to hear it that women are going to make exactly the same amount as</v>

5865
02:25:57.491 --> 02:25:58.210
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>

5866
02:25:58.210 --> 02:26:01.000
<v Speaker 3>And so even if the man works harder,</v>

5867
02:26:01.090 --> 02:26:02.830
<v Speaker 3>the women is still gonna make the same amount of money.</v>

5868
02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:03.850
<v Speaker 3>Well that's ridiculous.</v>

5869
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:04.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5870
02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:05.373
<v Speaker 3>Then vice versa cut up.</v>

5871
02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

5872
02:26:06.470 --> 02:26:07.390
<v Speaker 3>But with the NFL,</v>

5873
02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:10.300
<v Speaker 3>the NFL said you have to interview,</v>

5874
02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:12.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're predominantly black.</v>

5875
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:13.870
<v Speaker 3>You have to interview,</v>

5876
02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:14.440
<v Speaker 3>interview,</v>

5877
02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:15.160
<v Speaker 3>not hire,</v>

5878
02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:18.220
<v Speaker 3>interview one black candidate before you hire somebody.</v>

5879
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.520
<v Speaker 3>So at least these people get heard and sometimes you go like,</v>

5880
02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:22.990
<v Speaker 3>that guy was actually pretty fucking good.</v>

5881
02:26:23.410 --> 02:26:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Let's really consider them.</v>

5882
02:26:24.370 --> 02:26:27.070
<v Speaker 3>And then they get hired a little more until it just shifts the needle.</v>

5883
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5884
02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:28.840
<v Speaker 3>I only qualified people.</v>

5885
02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Ideally what you would want is no racism,</v>

5886
02:26:32.140 --> 02:26:32.891
<v Speaker 3>no racism,</v>

5887
02:26:32.891 --> 02:26:33.611
<v Speaker 3>no sexism.</v>

5888
02:26:33.611 --> 02:26:34.340
<v Speaker 3>That's a deal.</v>

5889
02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:38.140
<v Speaker 3>And not to have to make some laws for it.</v>

5890
02:26:38.260 --> 02:26:38.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5891
02:26:38.381 --> 02:26:39.970
<v Speaker 3>but we're not in that world where we live,</v>

5892
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.230
<v Speaker 3>but it would be nice.</v>

5893
02:26:41.250 --> 02:26:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5894
02:26:41.530 --> 02:26:45.940
<v Speaker 3>that would be what we really would really want is this is never an issue at all.</v>

5895
02:26:45.941 --> 02:26:48.490
<v Speaker 3>You're only getting people that are great at it and that way we,</v>

5896
02:26:48.491 --> 02:26:48.910
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

5897
02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:49.270
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

5898
02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:50.920
<v Speaker 3>if racism was not an issue at all,</v>

5899
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:52.330
<v Speaker 3>if there was no racism whatsoever,</v>

5900
02:26:52.690 --> 02:26:54.460
<v Speaker 3>what you would say is,</v>

5901
02:26:54.490 --> 02:26:55.300
<v Speaker 3>oh look,</v>

5902
02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:58.090
<v Speaker 3>it seems like Asian people gravitate towards this.</v>

5903
02:26:58.210 --> 02:27:02.170
<v Speaker 3>It seems like people have this color or this culture rather gravitate towards</v>

5904
02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:04.660
<v Speaker 3>this activity and I wonder why that is.</v>

5905
02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:05.890
<v Speaker 3>And a set of saying,</v>

5906
02:27:05.891 --> 02:27:07.600
<v Speaker 3>why don't you hire more white people?</v>

5907
02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:07.991
<v Speaker 3>You'd say,</v>

5908
02:27:07.991 --> 02:27:11.260
<v Speaker 3>it seems like white people aren't really interested in that job at the cleaners.</v>

5909
02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:14.260
<v Speaker 3>The cleaners in New York is the variation job.</v>

5910
02:27:14.350 --> 02:27:15.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5911
02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:15.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5912
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:16.690
<v Speaker 3>you're not like you need to hire white people.</v>

5913
02:27:16.750 --> 02:27:17.650
<v Speaker 3>You need to hire black people.</v>

5914
02:27:17.651 --> 02:27:21.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a job.</v>

5915
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:22.240
<v Speaker 3>That's why nobody cares.</v>

5916
02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:23.081
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares.</v>

5917
02:27:23.081 --> 02:27:25.930
<v Speaker 3>But if it was a CEO of large financial institutions,</v>

5918
02:27:25.931 --> 02:27:26.261
<v Speaker 3>you would say,</v>

5919
02:27:26.261 --> 02:27:29.080
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous that it's all this and not that.</v>

5920
02:27:29.260 --> 02:27:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Ideally it would be a fascinating social experiment or a,</v>

5921
02:27:35.261 --> 02:27:39.400
<v Speaker 3>a social observation to find out what genders,</v>

5922
02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:41.350
<v Speaker 3>what sexual orientation,</v>

5923
02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:42.370
<v Speaker 3>what race,</v>

5924
02:27:42.371 --> 02:27:46.330
<v Speaker 3>what g w what ethnicities gravitate toward specific jobs.</v>

5925
02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:50.860
<v Speaker 3>If those jobs didn't have a hierarchy of desire,</v>

5926
02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:51.190
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5927
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.331
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

5928
02:27:51.331 --> 02:27:54.310
<v Speaker 3>if there wasn't some jobs that are far more desirable.</v>

5929
02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5930
02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:55.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5931
02:27:55.380 --> 02:28:00.100
<v Speaker 3>one of the arguments I had really early on in Hollywood was with this guy who</v>

5932
02:28:00.101 --> 02:28:00.911
<v Speaker 3>was a really nice guy,</v>

5933
02:28:00.911 --> 02:28:03.220
<v Speaker 3>but he was Asian and he was saying,</v>

5934
02:28:03.221 --> 02:28:05.200
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking rolls for Asian actors.</v>

5935
02:28:05.201 --> 02:28:06.070
<v Speaker 3>This is bullshit.</v>

5936
02:28:06.250 --> 02:28:06.641
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

5937
02:28:06.641 --> 02:28:07.360
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

5938
02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:08.500
<v Speaker 3>why don't you make roles?</v>

5939
02:28:08.501 --> 02:28:08.771
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

5940
02:28:08.771 --> 02:28:09.431
<v Speaker 3>it's not that easy.</v>

5941
02:28:09.431 --> 02:28:09.671
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

5942
02:28:09.671 --> 02:28:10.210
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

5943
02:28:10.210 --> 02:28:11.320
<v Speaker 3>I understand that it's not that easy,</v>

5944
02:28:11.321 --> 02:28:15.580
<v Speaker 3>but do you think that someone should have to write an Asian leading man because</v>

5945
02:28:15.581 --> 02:28:17.350
<v Speaker 3>you have a hard time getting a job,</v>

5946
02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:17.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5947
02:28:17.890 --> 02:28:19.300
<v Speaker 3>Like what should they do?</v>

5948
02:28:19.301 --> 02:28:21.830
<v Speaker 3>Like how should it show ugly people?</v>

5949
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.430
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5950
02:28:22.430 --> 02:28:22.870
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

5951
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:23.703
<v Speaker 5>Like what about,</v>

5952
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:25.730
<v Speaker 5>what about people who are dwarves?</v>

5953
02:28:26.010 --> 02:28:26.600
<v Speaker 5>There's no,</v>

5954
02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:29.510
<v Speaker 5>there's very few jobs for that and the one guy's killing it.</v>

5955
02:28:29.810 --> 02:28:32.210
<v Speaker 6>That one guys dominated that game of Thrones.</v>

5956
02:28:32.211 --> 02:28:32.920
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>

5957
02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:33.651
<v Speaker 6>what'd you do?</v>

5958
02:28:33.651 --> 02:28:34.201
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>

5959
02:28:34.201 --> 02:28:34.531
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

5960
02:28:34.531 --> 02:28:37.040
<v Speaker 6>What would you do to correct that is the question.</v>

5961
02:28:37.041 --> 02:28:38.810
<v Speaker 6>It's not whether or not the world is fair.</v>

5962
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:39.770
<v Speaker 6>The world's not fair.</v>

5963
02:28:39.890 --> 02:28:43.370
<v Speaker 6>There's no five foot tall white guys that are playing in the NBA.</v>

5964
02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:44.420
<v Speaker 6>That's not fair either.</v>

5965
02:28:44.470 --> 02:28:44.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5966
02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:47.930
<v Speaker 6>This weird shit that just happens to be reality.</v>

5967
02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:49.760
<v Speaker 6>Like what do you do to correct that?</v>

5968
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:50.361
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

5969
02:28:50.361 --> 02:28:53.580
<v Speaker 6>he was really adamant that Hollywood is racist and they're not,</v>

5970
02:28:53.620 --> 02:28:56.420
<v Speaker 6>not hiring Asians to be leading men and Asians.</v>

5971
02:28:56.500 --> 02:28:56.871
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

5972
02:28:56.871 --> 02:28:57.704
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

5973
02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:00.830
<v Speaker 6>I see how it would be frustrating for you as an actor.</v>

5974
02:29:01.010 --> 02:29:01.730
<v Speaker 6>But if you've,</v>

5975
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:06.470
<v Speaker 6>if you're a screenwriter and you're a guy who writes a story about a white guy</v>

5976
02:29:06.471 --> 02:29:08.420
<v Speaker 6>and moves into a haunted house and you know,</v>

5977
02:29:08.421 --> 02:29:11.450
<v Speaker 6>he falls in love with this woman and they buy a house together and the house</v>

5978
02:29:11.451 --> 02:29:12.950
<v Speaker 6>winds up being haunted and his monsters,</v>

5979
02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:14.510
<v Speaker 6>you're saying,</v>

5980
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:14.991
<v Speaker 6>should you,</v>

5981
02:29:14.991 --> 02:29:18.800
<v Speaker 6>should someone have to change that to an Asian guy so that you get a job?</v>

5982
02:29:18.890 --> 02:29:19.061
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5983
02:29:19.061 --> 02:29:22.250
<v Speaker 5>Well also simplistic because it's like not hearing the other,</v>

5984
02:29:22.310 --> 02:29:22.941
<v Speaker 5>the other argument,</v>

5985
02:29:22.941 --> 02:29:23.121
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

5986
02:29:23.121 --> 02:29:23.540
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

5987
02:29:23.540 --> 02:29:26.120
<v Speaker 5>sure that Becca could be anybody that could,</v>

5988
02:29:26.121 --> 02:29:26.690
<v Speaker 5>it could be any,</v>

5989
02:29:26.690 --> 02:29:27.260
<v Speaker 5>any race,</v>

5990
02:29:27.260 --> 02:29:27.710
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5991
02:29:27.710 --> 02:29:28.850
<v Speaker 5>But if me,</v>

5992
02:29:28.851 --> 02:29:29.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm not Hollywood,</v>

5993
02:29:30.050 --> 02:29:32.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm all guy making this one movie,</v>

5994
02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:32.810
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5995
02:29:32.810 --> 02:29:34.610
<v Speaker 5>And if I cast an Asian,</v>

5996
02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:40.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm probably going to make far less money than if I cast a guy who looks like</v>

5997
02:29:41.271 --> 02:29:42.950
<v Speaker 5>most of the movie ticket purchasers,</v>

5998
02:29:43.650 --> 02:29:46.280
<v Speaker 5>which was a white guy or a famous person,</v>

5999
02:29:46.281 --> 02:29:47.740
<v Speaker 5>which you know is going to sell it Brad Pitt.</v>

6000
02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:48.021
<v Speaker 5>Sure,</v>

6001
02:29:48.021 --> 02:29:48.680
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

6002
02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:52.010
<v Speaker 5>So then it's like you want me to correct what Hollywood is,</v>

6003
02:29:52.011 --> 02:29:53.060
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not Hollywood.</v>

6004
02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:55.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm just this producer for this movie</v>

6005
02:29:55.410 --> 02:29:56.243
<v Speaker 6>that becomes,</v>

6006
02:29:56.270 --> 02:29:59.540
<v Speaker 6>that's something that my friend Frankie Renzulli said to me once,</v>

6007
02:29:59.541 --> 02:29:59.811
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

6008
02:29:59.811 --> 02:30:00.710
<v Speaker 6>there's no Hollywood.</v>

6009
02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:01.940
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6010
02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:03.580
<v Speaker 5>That's what I said about the AIDS cure care.</v>

6011
02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:03.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6012
02:30:03.980 --> 02:30:04.970
<v Speaker 5>Doctors have the cure,</v>

6013
02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:06.180
<v Speaker 5>but they make more,</v>

6014
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:09.410
<v Speaker 5>they make more money in selling the treatment off the treatment.</v>

6015
02:30:09.411 --> 02:30:10.040
<v Speaker 5>But I'm like,</v>

6016
02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:11.750
<v Speaker 5>but there's no such thing as doctors.</v>

6017
02:30:11.751 --> 02:30:13.070
<v Speaker 5>There's doctors group.</v>

6018
02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:14.510
<v Speaker 5>So if one doctor had it,</v>

6019
02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:17.540
<v Speaker 5>he would be a billionaire if he just released the cure.</v>

6020
02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:17.721
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

6021
02:30:17.721 --> 02:30:21.380
<v Speaker 6>this is the main problem with conspiracy theory is that everyone's working</v>

6022
02:30:21.381 --> 02:30:22.214
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

6023
02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:26.150
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's working together as a part of some grand thing to keep the knowledge</v>

6024
02:30:26.151 --> 02:30:28.670
<v Speaker 6>that the world's flat away from the general public,</v>

6025
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:29.960
<v Speaker 6>like that kind of stupidity.</v>

6026
02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:34.520
<v Speaker 6>But that comes from a lack of understanding of how human beings interact with</v>

6027
02:30:34.521 --> 02:30:39.521
<v Speaker 6>each other and about how a magnificent a discovery so gigantic would be to the</v>

6028
02:30:39.951 --> 02:30:41.420
<v Speaker 6>one person that exposed it,</v>

6029
02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:44.930
<v Speaker 6>but that person is going to keep their mouth shut for what fucking reason.</v>

6030
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.710
<v Speaker 6>What reason?</v>

6031
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:46.640
<v Speaker 6>That's nonsense.</v>

6032
02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:48.210
<v Speaker 5>I will say with that in mind,</v>

6033
02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:54.200
<v Speaker 5>there is a thing that when you interview a white lady or a black dude for a job,</v>

6034
02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:58.920
<v Speaker 5>a lot of times your predispositions towards those races or genders go in and go</v>

6035
02:30:58.921 --> 02:30:59.130
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

6036
02:30:59.130 --> 02:31:01.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't respect you as much as your mind is there.</v>

6037
02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:03.720
<v Speaker 5>I kind of like disrespect you a little.</v>

6038
02:31:03.721 --> 02:31:08.721
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you have the brain that someone who looks different has so now</v>

6039
02:31:08.791 --> 02:31:11.340
<v Speaker 5>you're like not letting them get the part or get the job.</v>

6040
02:31:11.341 --> 02:31:15.540
<v Speaker 5>They would have gotten not the part that Holly was so garbage part doesn't work</v>

6041
02:31:15.541 --> 02:31:17.280
<v Speaker 5>but the job because like ah,</v>

6042
02:31:17.370 --> 02:31:18.630
<v Speaker 5>really you're smart.</v>

6043
02:31:18.631 --> 02:31:19.170
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

6044
02:31:19.170 --> 02:31:19.381
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6045
02:31:19.381 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 5>A woman's</v>

6046
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:21.150
<v Speaker 1>going to do the best job,</v>

6047
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:22.023
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out.</v>

6048
02:31:22.110 --> 02:31:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you see like a an actor who goes on to like write and direct his own</v>

6049
02:31:24.901 --> 02:31:25.830
<v Speaker 1>thing and like what?</v>

6050
02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Because most actors are fucking idiots.</v>

6051
02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:27.841
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6052
02:31:27.841 --> 02:31:29.090
<v Speaker 1>And when you see when it's actually intelligent,</v>

6053
02:31:29.091 --> 02:31:30.480
<v Speaker 1>like I would not have expected that from you.</v>

6054
02:31:30.510 --> 02:31:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And that happens also with race and gender,</v>

6055
02:31:32.190 --> 02:31:33.810
<v Speaker 1>so that you do want to correct.</v>

6056
02:31:33.930 --> 02:31:34.291
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6057
02:31:34.291 --> 02:31:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what Billy Bob Thornton did with Slingblade.</v>

6058
02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:38.580
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't get jobs made his own.</v>

6059
02:31:38.610 --> 02:31:39.181
<v Speaker 1>So he decided,</v>

6060
02:31:39.181 --> 02:31:42.000
<v Speaker 1>you know what have this crazy character swingers.</v>

6061
02:31:42.001 --> 02:31:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6062
02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:43.553
<v Speaker 1>Jon Favreau,</v>

6063
02:31:43.890 --> 02:31:45.540
<v Speaker 1>they decided to make his own movie.</v>

6064
02:31:45.570 --> 02:31:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Rocky.</v>

6065
02:31:46.110 --> 02:31:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6066
02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean sort of.</v>

6067
02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:48.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6068
02:31:48.201 --> 02:31:50.910
<v Speaker 1>he just made sure he played and he wrote it and he wrote it.</v>

6069
02:31:50.911 --> 02:31:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6070
02:31:51.660 --> 02:31:54.870
<v Speaker 1>but you did go to a major studio,</v>

6071
02:31:55.140 --> 02:31:56.130
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

6072
02:31:56.210 --> 02:31:59.010
<v Speaker 1>you can't mandate creativity.</v>

6073
02:31:59.070 --> 02:32:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Creativity is a different element because like,</v>

6074
02:32:01.530 --> 02:32:04.220
<v Speaker 1>look how many fucking books is Stephen King written about Maine.</v>

6075
02:32:04.690 --> 02:32:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Like every other book,</v>

6076
02:32:06.241 --> 02:32:06.841
<v Speaker 1>it's about Maine.</v>

6077
02:32:06.841 --> 02:32:09.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell him he can't write a book about Maine because people from</v>

6078
02:32:10.350 --> 02:32:10.891
<v Speaker 1>Kenosha,</v>

6079
02:32:10.891 --> 02:32:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin are upset and they think that you're,</v>

6080
02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6081
02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:15.030
<v Speaker 1>your location.</v>

6082
02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:18.750
<v Speaker 1>But I do like what they're doing in the UK and they're like the first year of</v>

6083
02:32:18.751 --> 02:32:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Black Mirror,</v>

6084
02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:20.670
<v Speaker 1>which was UK based.</v>

6085
02:32:22.140 --> 02:32:22.680
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

6086
02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:25.480
<v Speaker 1>they just let black guys play roles.</v>

6087
02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:25.921
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

6088
02:32:25.921 --> 02:32:27.240
<v Speaker 1>they're not playing black person.</v>

6089
02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:27.871
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>

6090
02:32:27.871 --> 02:32:29.100
<v Speaker 1>there's mixed race couples.</v>

6091
02:32:29.130 --> 02:32:29.640
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>

6092
02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:30.630
<v Speaker 1>they're just people.</v>

6093
02:32:30.930 --> 02:32:32.730
<v Speaker 1>They're way further along than we are in terms of that.</v>

6094
02:32:32.731 --> 02:32:35.430
<v Speaker 1>And so as a social consciousness of the design guys in general,</v>

6095
02:32:35.431 --> 02:32:38.940
<v Speaker 1>they don't see race as the European English,</v>

6096
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.510
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

6097
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:40.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6098
02:32:40.520 --> 02:32:41.353
<v Speaker 1>they say they see,</v>

6099
02:32:41.380 --> 02:32:44.010
<v Speaker 1>they see the ends and Pakistanis and stuff like that.</v>

6100
02:32:44.011 --> 02:32:46.260
<v Speaker 1>They see that race really hard still.</v>

6101
02:32:46.320 --> 02:32:47.850
<v Speaker 1>We actually probably see that less.</v>

6102
02:32:48.180 --> 02:32:49.560
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of black and white,</v>

6103
02:32:49.580 --> 02:32:50.060
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>

6104
02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:51.000
<v Speaker 1>which is way more like,</v>

6105
02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:51.950
<v Speaker 1>oh there's people.</v>

6106
02:32:52.470 --> 02:32:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6107
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:55.970
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting cause they don't have a history of slavery like we did</v>

6108
02:32:57.660 --> 02:32:58.081
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

6109
02:32:58.081 --> 02:32:58.651
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

6110
02:32:58.651 --> 02:33:02.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean way back they had the more [inaudible] Shakespeare but like I dunno,</v>

6111
02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:03.960
<v Speaker 1>it's just not as bad as us.</v>

6112
02:33:04.290 --> 02:33:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6113
02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:05.311
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>

6114
02:33:05.311 --> 02:33:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really sure the causes.</v>

6115
02:33:06.390 --> 02:33:07.200
<v Speaker 1>But then people,</v>

6116
02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:09.090
<v Speaker 1>black guys can just play a role.</v>

6117
02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:10.860
<v Speaker 1>You understand an argument about that with,</v>

6118
02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:13.590
<v Speaker 1>with Black Mirror that I found was kind of silly.</v>

6119
02:33:13.591 --> 02:33:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Someone was saying,</v>

6120
02:33:14.190 --> 02:33:14.401
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6121
02:33:14.401 --> 02:33:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm upset about black mirror because it's like every show has a woman lead in</v>

6122
02:33:18.931 --> 02:33:19.291
<v Speaker 1>every show.</v>

6123
02:33:19.291 --> 02:33:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I go step away and look at the shows,</v>

6124
02:33:22.321 --> 02:33:23.640
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking fantastic.</v>

6125
02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Is that good?</v>

6126
02:33:25.441 --> 02:33:25.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6127
02:33:25.621 --> 02:33:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Why do you,</v>

6128
02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:31.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's someone who was so upset by this whole idea of diversity and in</v>

6129
02:33:31.291 --> 02:33:35.250
<v Speaker 1>forced diversity that they're looking for it even when it's not relevant because</v>

6130
02:33:35.251 --> 02:33:36.720
<v Speaker 1>th the actual work itself,</v>

6131
02:33:36.721 --> 02:33:37.350
<v Speaker 1>it's so good.</v>

6132
02:33:37.350 --> 02:33:40.650
<v Speaker 1>She's like you shouldn't say the new Ghostbusters suck cause it was all women.</v>

6133
02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6134
02:33:40.850 --> 02:33:44.160
<v Speaker 1>You said the new Ghostbusters suck because no one was calling for a remake of it</v>

6135
02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:45.570
<v Speaker 1>and it sucked.</v>

6136
02:33:45.570 --> 02:33:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Or Star Wars,</v>

6137
02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:48.180
<v Speaker 1>the new star wars.</v>

6138
02:33:48.181 --> 02:33:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Like when you had uh,</v>

6139
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Carrie Fisher and Laura dern were like the major generals and you're like what?</v>

6140
02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:55.860
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't even work.</v>

6141
02:33:56.010 --> 02:34:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe it doesn't work because it wasn't written well and because they</v>

6142
02:34:00.331 --> 02:34:01.560
<v Speaker 1>didn't really pull it off.</v>

6143
02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:05.340
<v Speaker 1>But you're telling me you couldn't have some bad ass chick like Sigourney weaver</v>

6144
02:34:05.341 --> 02:34:08.700
<v Speaker 1>when she was in aliens who dominated the film and nobody gave a fuck that she</v>

6145
02:34:08.701 --> 02:34:10.980
<v Speaker 1>was the lead and we look up cause it was so good.</v>

6146
02:34:11.450 --> 02:34:12.181
<v Speaker 1>He was so good.</v>

6147
02:34:12.181 --> 02:34:13.770
<v Speaker 1>The blonde chick is from game of Thrones.</v>

6148
02:34:13.950 --> 02:34:14.311
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

6149
02:34:14.311 --> 02:34:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know and Searcy's yes,</v>

6150
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:17.470
<v Speaker 1>there are no one's like,</v>

6151
02:34:17.550 --> 02:34:18.190
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

6152
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:18.700
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

6153
02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:20.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like no one thinks of them is women.</v>

6154
02:34:20.411 --> 02:34:21.800
<v Speaker 4>They're just like strong characters.</v>

6155
02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:25.240
<v Speaker 4>Omar from the wire who was gay and black,</v>

6156
02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:29.620
<v Speaker 4>like no one cares because it was just like he nailed it.</v>

6157
02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:31.600
<v Speaker 4>But then how do you,</v>

6158
02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:33.100
<v Speaker 4>did you have to like,</v>

6159
02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:36.880
<v Speaker 4>like not see it and black who's going to be great in this and also give a</v>

6160
02:34:36.881 --> 02:34:37.750
<v Speaker 4>representation of,</v>

6161
02:34:37.930 --> 02:34:40.660
<v Speaker 4>you can't make all the gangsters white because it'd be unrealistic.</v>

6162
02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:41.651
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

6163
02:34:41.651 --> 02:34:43.540
<v Speaker 4>We've seen this in comedy too,</v>

6164
02:34:43.541 --> 02:34:43.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6165
02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:48.490
<v Speaker 4>We've seen there's a difference between in forced diversity and people who just</v>

6166
02:34:48.491 --> 02:34:49.570
<v Speaker 4>happen to be diverse,</v>

6167
02:34:49.571 --> 02:34:50.404
<v Speaker 4>but our brilliant,</v>

6168
02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:51.220
<v Speaker 4>true,</v>

6169
02:34:51.220 --> 02:34:55.720
<v Speaker 4>and we've seen this where they're trying to enforce like certain aspects of</v>

6170
02:34:55.780 --> 02:34:57.180
<v Speaker 4>standard mustaches.</v>

6171
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:58.570
<v Speaker 4>You're going to make your product worse.</v>

6172
02:34:58.600 --> 02:34:59.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6173
02:34:59.050 --> 02:34:59.860
<v Speaker 4>Well we,</v>

6174
02:34:59.860 --> 02:35:00.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6175
02:35:00.610 --> 02:35:01.840
<v Speaker 4>how many times have we seen this?</v>

6176
02:35:01.841 --> 02:35:02.800
<v Speaker 4>And people will say,</v>

6177
02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:03.550
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

6178
02:35:03.550 --> 02:35:03.791
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6179
02:35:03.791 --> 02:35:06.700
<v Speaker 4>why aren't there more women at the comedy store and why aren't there more this?</v>

6180
02:35:06.700 --> 02:35:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't there more that?</v>

6181
02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:08.613
<v Speaker 4>Whoops.</v>

6182
02:35:09.010 --> 02:35:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

6183
02:35:09.730 --> 02:35:10.570
<v Speaker 4>That lady who said like,</v>

6184
02:35:10.610 --> 02:35:11.051
<v Speaker 4>where'd he come?</v>

6185
02:35:11.051 --> 02:35:12.310
<v Speaker 4>He's only got three spots last month.</v>

6186
02:35:12.311 --> 02:35:12.820
<v Speaker 4>Explained that.</v>

6187
02:35:12.820 --> 02:35:15.070
<v Speaker 4>But where what you're doing is accusing,</v>

6188
02:35:15.071 --> 02:35:17.050
<v Speaker 4>but if you're actually asking why would it come and go?</v>

6189
02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:20.410
<v Speaker 4>I got three spots last month is because what it comes called in for three spots</v>

6190
02:35:20.411 --> 02:35:21.190
<v Speaker 4>last month,</v>

6191
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:22.930
<v Speaker 4>she gets every spot she wanted.</v>

6192
02:35:23.170 --> 02:35:25.060
<v Speaker 4>She will tell you that if you're asked to her face,</v>

6193
02:35:25.450 --> 02:35:29.140
<v Speaker 4>she's one of the ones who long you don't get,</v>

6194
02:35:29.141 --> 02:35:30.880
<v Speaker 4>you don't call in and not get a spot.</v>

6195
02:35:31.230 --> 02:35:33.340
<v Speaker 4>There are certain people that get the spots they want.</v>

6196
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:34.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6197
02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:35.440
<v Speaker 4>So she's one of them.</v>

6198
02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:35.771
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6199
02:35:35.771 --> 02:35:37.300
<v Speaker 4>So the answer is she's busy.</v>

6200
02:35:37.330 --> 02:35:37.691
<v Speaker 4>She has.</v>

6201
02:35:37.691 --> 02:35:37.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6202
02:35:37.871 --> 02:35:38.411
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

6203
02:35:38.411 --> 02:35:40.030
<v Speaker 4>The answer isn't causing sexism there.</v>

6204
02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:42.820
<v Speaker 4>Well that's nonsense though that that kind of thinking.</v>

6205
02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:44.650
<v Speaker 4>He almost always comes from people who suck.</v>

6206
02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:46.090
<v Speaker 4>If you look at their art,</v>

6207
02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:47.830
<v Speaker 4>they're almost always bad.</v>

6208
02:35:48.730 --> 02:35:49.600
<v Speaker 4>That's just a fact.</v>

6209
02:35:49.601 --> 02:35:52.600
<v Speaker 4>They want Liza about this recently.</v>

6210
02:35:53.230 --> 02:35:53.681
<v Speaker 4>It's not new.</v>

6211
02:35:53.681 --> 02:35:55.510
<v Speaker 4>It made me realize same thing when Dan Cook up,</v>

6212
02:35:55.511 --> 02:35:56.170
<v Speaker 4>big people are like,</v>

6213
02:35:56.170 --> 02:35:57.190
<v Speaker 4>oh cause he's good looking.</v>

6214
02:35:57.430 --> 02:36:01.090
<v Speaker 4>And that was a bunch of sucky guys who weren't killing every set like Dane was.</v>

6215
02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:01.600
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

6216
02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:02.433
<v Speaker 4>And they'll go on,</v>

6217
02:36:02.650 --> 02:36:05.740
<v Speaker 4>there must be a reason other than it's on me.</v>

6218
02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:07.780
<v Speaker 4>Why I'm not as big as him.</v>

6219
02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:10.090
<v Speaker 4>So how about the good looking thing that's off me?</v>

6220
02:36:10.091 --> 02:36:11.240
<v Speaker 4>I have no control over that.</v>

6221
02:36:11.650 --> 02:36:12.370
<v Speaker 4>And it's really like,</v>

6222
02:36:12.370 --> 02:36:12.581
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

6223
02:36:12.581 --> 02:36:16.310
<v Speaker 4>that Guy Kills 19 Times at a 20 and you kill two out of 20 yeah.</v>

6224
02:36:16.580 --> 02:36:19.570
<v Speaker 4>Like can you possibly say it could be based on that,</v>

6225
02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:22.870
<v Speaker 4>but it's the people that are complaining are almost never doing well anyway.</v>

6226
02:36:22.871 --> 02:36:24.460
<v Speaker 4>So this is why they complaining.</v>

6227
02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:25.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6228
02:36:25.601 --> 02:36:25.831
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

6229
02:36:25.831 --> 02:36:26.170
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

6230
02:36:26.170 --> 02:36:26.591
<v Speaker 4>what's going,</v>

6231
02:36:26.591 --> 02:36:29.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're not going to hear certain people.</v>

6232
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:31.590
<v Speaker 4>You're going to hear a bill burr complaining about other people don't.</v>

6233
02:36:31.591 --> 02:36:32.370
<v Speaker 4>Chappelle said it,</v>

6234
02:36:32.370 --> 02:36:33.100
<v Speaker 4>it goes,</v>

6235
02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:33.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6236
02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:35.200
<v Speaker 4>black comics who do well,</v>

6237
02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:37.090
<v Speaker 4>they're all successful hugely.</v>

6238
02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:37.720
<v Speaker 4>You guys.</v>

6239
02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:41.620
<v Speaker 4>If you're doing well on stage consistently as a black comic,</v>

6240
02:36:41.650 --> 02:36:42.970
<v Speaker 4>there's no question you'll be,</v>

6241
02:36:43.030 --> 02:36:43.863
<v Speaker 4>you'll be doing,</v>

6242
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:45.130
<v Speaker 4>you'll be making doctor money.</v>

6243
02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:45.731
<v Speaker 4>He didn't say that,</v>

6244
02:36:45.731 --> 02:36:46.840
<v Speaker 4>but like that's what it is.</v>

6245
02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:47.610
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

6246
02:36:47.610 --> 02:36:48.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6247
02:36:48.340 --> 02:36:53.340
<v Speaker 4>Well comedy in many ways is very egalitarian in that way.</v>

6248
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:54.510
<v Speaker 4>Last year.</v>

6249
02:36:54.510 --> 02:36:55.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6250
02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:55.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6251
02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:57.040
<v Speaker 4>you are what you are,</v>

6252
02:36:57.041 --> 02:36:57.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6253
02:36:57.220 --> 02:36:58.690
<v Speaker 4>either you're really funny or you're not.</v>

6254
02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:00.010
<v Speaker 4>And those black rooms of black comics,</v>

6255
02:37:00.011 --> 02:37:00.910
<v Speaker 4>it was something it's like,</v>

6256
02:37:00.940 --> 02:37:03.780
<v Speaker 4>so like I'm in that doesn't relate to certain white audiences.</v>

6257
02:37:03.790 --> 02:37:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Like I just can't figure it up.</v>

6258
02:37:04.931 --> 02:37:05.870
<v Speaker 4>But there's rooms for them.</v>

6259
02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:07.990
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of the Mexican rooms where they do half their pumps lines in</v>

6260
02:37:07.991 --> 02:37:08.480
<v Speaker 4>Spanish.</v>

6261
02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:10.330
<v Speaker 4>That wouldn't play the comedy store,</v>

6262
02:37:10.331 --> 02:37:13.570
<v Speaker 4>but it would play in certain audiences as used to do Miami.</v>

6263
02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:15.010
<v Speaker 4>He would do Spanglish.</v>

6264
02:37:15.380 --> 02:37:17.780
<v Speaker 4>He would have his punchlines to be in Spanish and people would follow the</v>

6265
02:37:17.781 --> 02:37:18.710
<v Speaker 4>fucking chair laughing.</v>

6266
02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:22.130
<v Speaker 4>And if you were a white guy who didn't swear,</v>

6267
02:37:22.250 --> 02:37:23.480
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>

6268
02:37:23.870 --> 02:37:24.201
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>

6269
02:37:24.201 --> 02:37:25.070
<v Speaker 4>Jump out a window.</v>

6270
02:37:25.100 --> 02:37:25.730
<v Speaker 4>That was another thing.</v>

6271
02:37:25.730 --> 02:37:25.851
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6272
02:37:25.851 --> 02:37:26.361
<v Speaker 4>you're dirty.</v>

6273
02:37:26.361 --> 02:37:27.200
<v Speaker 4>That's why he's successful.</v>

6274
02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:28.191
<v Speaker 4>That's a big thing,</v>

6275
02:37:28.191 --> 02:37:28.550
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

6276
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:30.590
<v Speaker 4>Just start crushing and it's won't be an issue.</v>

6277
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:31.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6278
02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:33.260
<v Speaker 4>Well that was a nonsense issue to like,</v>

6279
02:37:33.261 --> 02:37:34.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to fall someone dirty.</v>

6280
02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:34.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6281
02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:35.720
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>

6282
02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:36.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6283
02:37:36.450 --> 02:37:36.710
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

6284
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:37.830
<v Speaker 4>What difference does it have?</v>

6285
02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:39.200
<v Speaker 4>But this idea that like,</v>

6286
02:37:39.350 --> 02:37:40.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm not getting a hook as a reason.</v>

6287
02:37:40.491 --> 02:37:41.324
<v Speaker 4>It's not new.</v>

6288
02:37:42.110 --> 02:37:45.260
<v Speaker 4>This has been going on as a reason to be like off me,</v>

6289
02:37:45.261 --> 02:37:46.160
<v Speaker 4>why I'm not doing well.</v>

6290
02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:46.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6291
02:37:46.610 --> 02:37:47.443
<v Speaker 4>and it does.</v>

6292
02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:49.220
<v Speaker 4>I think the real sexism,</v>

6293
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:53.240
<v Speaker 4>especially for women is having to work with a bunch of people that are trying to</v>

6294
02:37:53.241 --> 02:37:54.350
<v Speaker 4>fuck you all the time.</v>

6295
02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Especially I think at open mics when you're already ready to quit anyway.</v>

6296
02:37:59.640 --> 02:37:59.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6297
02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:01.040
<v Speaker 4>you're about ready to quit.</v>

6298
02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:02.660
<v Speaker 4>And now this fucking,</v>

6299
02:38:02.661 --> 02:38:04.820
<v Speaker 4>these creeps around and there's no one to talk to.</v>

6300
02:38:04.821 --> 02:38:07.480
<v Speaker 4>What the fucking call the coffee shop on the homeless.</v>

6301
02:38:07.540 --> 02:38:10.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean for real homeless people line up for open mics.</v>

6302
02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:13.980
<v Speaker 4>There's a giant percentage of them that are out of their fucking mind.</v>

6303
02:38:13.981 --> 02:38:17.570
<v Speaker 4>So if you're some girl who already feels vulnerable around men to begin with</v>

6304
02:38:17.571 --> 02:38:22.571

02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:39.950
<v Speaker 4>If Mary Lynn Rice Cup today gets harassed,</v>

6322
02:38:40.310 --> 02:38:41.390
<v Speaker 4>she's not going to quit.</v>

6323
02:38:41.610 --> 02:38:42.590
<v Speaker 4>It's still making money.</v>

6324
02:38:42.700 --> 02:38:43.070
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.371
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6326
02:38:43.371 --> 02:38:43.660
<v Speaker 4>she'll,</v>

6327
02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:46.130
<v Speaker 4>she might not come to the store anymore if nobody does anything about it.</v>

6328
02:38:46.530 --> 02:38:47.300
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6329
02:38:47.300 --> 02:38:48.250
<v Speaker 4>but people would do,</v>

6330
02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:50.360
<v Speaker 4>so there's a place to go to for like,</v>

6331
02:38:50.361 --> 02:38:52.700
<v Speaker 4>hey you need to get rid of this guy and this audience member can't come anymore.</v>

02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:54.020
<v Speaker 4>And that's just comedy.</v>

6333
02:38:54.021 --> 02:38:57.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean with any job issue.</v>

6334
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:59.030
<v Speaker 4>Well also with men,</v>

6335
02:38:59.031 --> 02:39:00.230
<v Speaker 4>men are fucking stupid.</v>

6336
02:39:00.231 --> 02:39:00.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6337
02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:03.120
<v Speaker 4>If you're working with a man and a,</v>

6338
02:39:03.121 --> 02:39:04.370
<v Speaker 4>you're nice that man,</v>

6339
02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:08.730
<v Speaker 4>he assumes you want to fuck him cause this how this is evolution worked.</v>

6340
02:39:08.820 --> 02:39:09.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6341
02:39:09.050 --> 02:39:10.310
<v Speaker 4>we're monkeys just my arm and it's like,</v>

6342
02:39:10.570 --> 02:39:11.630
<v Speaker 4>oh for the next two days,</v>

6343
02:39:12.270 --> 02:39:15.530
<v Speaker 4>if a woman is like kind to a guy and get some coffee,</v>

6344
02:39:15.860 --> 02:39:19.310
<v Speaker 4>the guy thinks she wants to suck his dick cause he's stupid because this is how</v>

6345
02:39:19.311 --> 02:39:19.910
<v Speaker 4>we're programmed.</v>

6346
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:22.370
<v Speaker 4>We're programmed to think that women who are nice to us,</v>

6347
02:39:22.430 --> 02:39:23.780
<v Speaker 4>if that woman is attractive,</v>

6348
02:39:24.020 --> 02:39:25.190
<v Speaker 4>she must be sending a signal.</v>

6349
02:39:25.191 --> 02:39:26.330
<v Speaker 4>She wants sexual attention.</v>

6350
02:39:26.510 --> 02:39:30.200
<v Speaker 4>It can't just be some completely platonic workplace situation.</v>

6351
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:33.590
<v Speaker 4>That's not possible because eight hours a day when you're working with someone,</v>

6352
02:39:33.770 --> 02:39:37.070
<v Speaker 4>you develop feelings and thoughts and ideas about that person.</v>

6353
02:39:37.130 --> 02:39:38.190
<v Speaker 4>I realized that we're not,</v>

6354
02:39:38.191 --> 02:39:39.440
<v Speaker 4>we're doing the nastiest show,</v>

6355
02:39:39.630 --> 02:39:41.340
<v Speaker 4>the Montreal and a,</v>

6356
02:39:41.341 --> 02:39:42.980
<v Speaker 4>there's all these young interns,</v>

6357
02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:46.490
<v Speaker 4>some of them women and young people are cuter than old people.</v>

6358
02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:48.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't know to tell you,</v>

6359
02:39:49.010 --> 02:39:53.570
<v Speaker 4>I'll stand by all your wants to fucking talk to every magazine</v>

6360
02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:59.340
<v Speaker 4>and you get this idea and you're there a week early from everybody else in</v>

6361
02:39:59.341 --> 02:39:59.571
<v Speaker 4>Nancy.</v>

6362
02:39:59.571 --> 02:40:00.470
<v Speaker 4>She'll start to weight earlier,</v>

6363
02:40:00.471 --> 02:40:03.110
<v Speaker 4>so you're pretty much the only English speaking show while the French stuff is</v>

6364
02:40:03.111 --> 02:40:06.410
<v Speaker 4>going on and these interns come out and you're like,</v>

6365
02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:06.771
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

6366
02:40:06.771 --> 02:40:08.030
<v Speaker 4>I think I can fuck one of them.</v>

6367
02:40:08.090 --> 02:40:09.080
<v Speaker 4>And then it hit me like,</v>

6368
02:40:09.140 --> 02:40:09.441
<v Speaker 4>oh wait,</v>

6369
02:40:09.441 --> 02:40:13.100
<v Speaker 4>there's also male interns who also showing up to the shows and you're like,</v>

6370
02:40:13.410 --> 02:40:13.531
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

6371
02:40:13.531 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 4>they're all just</v>

6372
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:18.980
<v Speaker 1>comedy fans and I'm reading in these wind maci flirting.</v>

6373
02:40:19.570 --> 02:40:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Whereas they're coming when they're exhibiting the literally the exact same</v>

6374
02:40:23.011 --> 02:40:25.260
<v Speaker 1>behavior as the men who are coming,</v>

6375
02:40:26.050 --> 02:40:26.760
<v Speaker 1>coming to like,</v>

6376
02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I want to hang out with the comedian and they might want hook,</v>

6377
02:40:30.670 --> 02:40:31.500
<v Speaker 1>they might not,</v>

6378
02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:35.430
<v Speaker 1>but I'm putting something on them only because of their gender and then it's</v>

6379
02:40:35.431 --> 02:40:35.610
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

6380
02:40:35.610 --> 02:40:35.821
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

6381
02:40:35.821 --> 02:40:36.451
<v Speaker 1>step back.</v>

6382
02:40:36.451 --> 02:40:37.560
<v Speaker 1>You can't fuck any of these people.</v>

6383
02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6384
02:40:38.780 --> 02:40:43.170
<v Speaker 1>That's must be what it's like if you're the manager of an office and there's a</v>

6385
02:40:43.171 --> 02:40:48.060
<v Speaker 1>cute woman who works for you and a guy who's fat and gross and they're both</v>

6386
02:40:48.061 --> 02:40:50.700
<v Speaker 1>exhibiting the exact same friendly behavior towards you.</v>

6387
02:40:50.850 --> 02:40:51.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't assume the fact,</v>

6388
02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to suck your Dick.</v>

6389
02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6390
02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:53.760
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

6391
02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:56.220
<v Speaker 1>and then also it's like if you can still hook up,</v>

6392
02:40:56.340 --> 02:40:57.570
<v Speaker 1>but they have to do all the work.</v>

6393
02:40:57.571 --> 02:40:59.290
<v Speaker 1>The underling has to do all the pushing you,</v>

6394
02:40:59.291 --> 02:41:01.650
<v Speaker 1>even though I don't think you can in an office environment,</v>

6395
02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I think of the underling keeps pushing there.</v>

6396
02:41:04.100 --> 02:41:04.801
<v Speaker 1>They have good push,</v>

6397
02:41:04.801 --> 02:41:05.700
<v Speaker 1>hard to push on.</v>

6398
02:41:05.730 --> 02:41:05.991
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

6399
02:41:05.991 --> 02:41:06.601
<v Speaker 1>you can be like,</v>

02:41:11.101 --> 02:41:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else want to cut?</v>

6406
02:41:11.910 --> 02:41:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to like really not push and put them in a position.</v>

6407
02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:16.260

6409
02:41:16.681 --> 02:41:19.020
<v Speaker 1>And there's people going to take advantage of that on both sides.</v>

6410
02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6411
02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:21.180

02:41:21.250 --> 02:41:21.510

02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:40.580
<v Speaker 1>he contacted one of the other guys that he works with that is also there and</v>

6419

<v Speaker 1>do not fuck her.</v>

6421
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Like she is upwardly mobile.</v>

6422
02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:46.661
<v Speaker 1>Like what she was doing,</v>

6423
02:41:46.661 --> 02:41:48.300
<v Speaker 1>she tried to fuck her way up to the top.</v>

6424
02:41:48.420 --> 02:41:52.110
<v Speaker 1>She did it to this guy and then she called sexual harassment on him after she</v>

6425
02:41:52.111 --> 02:41:56.700
<v Speaker 1>flirted with him and he's got some fucking,</v>

6426
02:41:56.790 --> 02:41:59.990

6427
02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:01.710
<v Speaker 1>some nonsense when people are political.</v>

6428
02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Some people are very calculated and some people are sociopaths and they exist</v>

6429
02:42:05.341 --> 02:42:06.180
<v Speaker 1>with vaginas.</v>

6430
02:42:06.181 --> 02:42:07.260
<v Speaker 1>They exist with penises.</v>

6431
02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:09.120
<v Speaker 1>It's just this is part of being a person.</v>

6432
02:42:09.121 --> 02:42:10.590
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that are just bad people,</v>

6433
02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:13.710
<v Speaker 1>but there's also some women who were like power and that's not wrong.</v>

6434
02:42:14.670 --> 02:42:14.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6437
02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:17.150
<v Speaker 1>It's justifiably,</v>

6438
02:42:17.170 --> 02:42:18.690
<v Speaker 1>makes me want to fuck you a little more.</v>

6439
02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:20.040
<v Speaker 1>And so that's okay too.</v>

6440
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6441
02:42:20.610 --> 02:42:23.520
<v Speaker 1>And well there's some women also that like being in power and we hate those</v>

6442
02:42:23.521 --> 02:42:23.910
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

6443
02:42:23.910 --> 02:42:26.050
<v Speaker 1>but we don't hate the men who like to be empowered.</v>

6444
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:28.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing to like a woman wants to run shit.</v>

6445
02:42:28.681 --> 02:42:28.891
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

6446
02:42:28.891 --> 02:42:30.660
<v Speaker 1>look at this crazy bitch wanting to run everything.</v>

6447
02:42:30.870 --> 02:42:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a guy who wants to run shit seems totally normal.</v>

6448
02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I will say it's a bigger wrong,</v>

6449
02:42:38.250 --> 02:42:40.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like what are you most likely want to avoid?</v>

6450
02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:41.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6451
02:42:41.370 --> 02:42:45.150
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like a bigger wrong for someone to have to like worry about getting</v>

6452
02:42:45.151 --> 02:42:45.720
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

6453
02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:49.770
<v Speaker 1>not just being able to do their job versus Oh,</v>

6454
02:42:49.771 --> 02:42:51.480
<v Speaker 1>this chick wants to sleep with me because she wants to get ahead.</v>

6455
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6456
02:42:51.961 --> 02:42:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Well that's easy to avoid is for the guidance.</v>

6457
02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:55.620
<v Speaker 1>There's no physical threat,</v>

6458
02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:56.833
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

6459
02:42:57.060 --> 02:42:58.590
<v Speaker 1>there's never a physical threat from that guy.</v>

6460
02:42:58.860 --> 02:42:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Feel like,</v>

6461
02:42:59.270 --> 02:43:00.450
<v Speaker 1>well I got my ass grabs like,</v>

6462
02:43:00.510 --> 02:43:03.120
<v Speaker 1>and you could end it anytime he wants to not come on.</v>

6463
02:43:03.210 --> 02:43:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>

6464
02:43:03.900 --> 02:43:08.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean in last year to like really a mess and you know,</v>

6465
02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you've just vulnerable psychologically,</v>

6466
02:43:11.050 --> 02:43:11.960
<v Speaker 1>physically all the time.</v>

6467
02:43:12.030 --> 02:43:12.340
<v Speaker 5>Bubs,</v>

6468
02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:14.780
<v Speaker 5>you're an aberration or an operation.</v>

6469
02:43:14.781 --> 02:43:15.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6470
02:43:15.460 --> 02:43:16.293
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6471
02:43:16.940 --> 02:43:18.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to correct it.</v>

6472
02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:21.610
<v Speaker 6>We're lucky we don't have to work with people all day man.</v>

6473
02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:24.310
<v Speaker 6>Beat people in a fucking office environment.</v>

6474
02:43:24.610 --> 02:43:28.990
<v Speaker 6>They're working around people all day and people have some weird shit.</v>

6475
02:43:28.991 --> 02:43:33.070
<v Speaker 6>And then you go to the company Christmas party and some guy who works with your</v>

6476
02:43:33.071 --> 02:43:36.730
<v Speaker 6>wife's had some creepy shit to you cause you know he's been like,</v>

6477
02:43:36.850 --> 02:43:41.590
<v Speaker 6>he's been coveting your wife behind your back and you know he wants her and you</v>

6478
02:43:41.591 --> 02:43:42.100
<v Speaker 6>know he's,</v>

6479
02:43:42.100 --> 02:43:46.960
<v Speaker 6>he talks shit about you to her and she tells you and that kind of shit is so</v>

6480
02:43:46.961 --> 02:43:47.794
<v Speaker 6>normal man.</v>

6481
02:43:47.890 --> 02:43:50.260
<v Speaker 6>Because you think about how many hours are in a day,</v>

6482
02:43:50.310 --> 02:43:51.790
<v Speaker 6>you have 24 hours in a day.</v>

6483
02:43:51.791 --> 02:43:52.720
<v Speaker 6>Eight of them you're sleeping.</v>

6484
02:43:52.750 --> 02:43:53.230
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

6485
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:55.180
<v Speaker 6>So how much time is commuting?</v>

6486
02:43:55.270 --> 02:43:56.290
<v Speaker 6>How much time is work?</v>

6487
02:43:56.410 --> 02:43:58.150
<v Speaker 6>Most of your day is at work,</v>

6488
02:43:58.210 --> 02:44:00.550
<v Speaker 6>so your life is not what your spouse,</v>

6489
02:44:00.820 --> 02:44:01.900
<v Speaker 6>you might not hook up with them,</v>

6490
02:44:01.901 --> 02:44:05.500
<v Speaker 6>but you were interacting with them and then the disproportionate way,</v>

6491
02:44:05.570 --> 02:44:06.403
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

6492
02:44:06.850 --> 02:44:09.860
<v Speaker 5>Do you think with people sometimes talk about me to going too far,</v>

6493
02:44:09.861 --> 02:44:13.220
<v Speaker 5>but let's talk about for a second like me to going the right level.</v>

6494
02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:14.030
<v Speaker 5>Do you think,</v>

6495
02:44:14.030 --> 02:44:15.080
<v Speaker 5>and we don't work in an office job,</v>

6496
02:44:15.081 --> 02:44:16.010
<v Speaker 5>so we're just guessing,</v>

6497
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.903
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6498
02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:19.670
<v Speaker 5>You think sexual harassments or down now and last year,</v>

6499
02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:23.630
<v Speaker 5>men who are creeps are probably a little more cautious.</v>

6500
02:44:23.631 --> 02:44:25.280
<v Speaker 5>I remember after them and see a video,</v>

6501
02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:28.070
<v Speaker 5>people all over open Mikes,</v>

6502
02:44:28.071 --> 02:44:29.270
<v Speaker 5>we're calling each other out on it.</v>

6503
02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:30.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6504
02:44:30.170 --> 02:44:33.470
<v Speaker 5>And then occasionally it was a question of it went too far.</v>

6505
02:44:33.471 --> 02:44:33.801
<v Speaker 5>We were like,</v>

6506
02:44:33.801 --> 02:44:34.610
<v Speaker 5>you stole that joke from,</v>

6507
02:44:34.610 --> 02:44:34.821
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

6508
02:44:34.821 --> 02:44:38.060
<v Speaker 5>do we both talked about the same movie and you're trying to write me off my</v>

6509
02:44:38.061 --> 02:44:39.740
<v Speaker 5>whole career off because I talked about,</v>

6510
02:44:40.050 --> 02:44:40.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6511
02:44:40.610 --> 02:44:41.443
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6512
02:44:41.810 --> 02:44:43.880
<v Speaker 5>whatever gets with wolves and so are you.</v>

6513
02:44:43.881 --> 02:44:45.580
<v Speaker 5>But your thing was about the native Americans do,</v>

6514
02:44:45.581 --> 02:44:47.950
<v Speaker 5>your thing was about the fucking co,</v>

6515
02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:48.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6516
02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:49.460
<v Speaker 5>the dog they had.</v>

6517
02:44:49.940 --> 02:44:51.530
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm sure it went too far here or there,</v>

6518
02:44:51.531 --> 02:44:55.580
<v Speaker 5>but it was nice where it like it was no longer acceptable to steal jokes.</v>

6519
02:44:55.581 --> 02:44:56.414
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

6520
02:44:56.450 --> 02:44:58.700
<v Speaker 5>And it wasn't just something we're going to tolerate.</v>

6521
02:44:58.730 --> 02:44:59.120
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6522
02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:00.260
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be like that too.</v>

6523
02:45:00.261 --> 02:45:01.100
<v Speaker 5>With this meat to stuff.</v>

6524
02:45:01.130 --> 02:45:03.380
<v Speaker 5>It's no longer acceptable that fucking patent ass.</v>

6525
02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:03.891
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

6526
02:45:03.891 --> 02:45:06.200
<v Speaker 5>When you can be like wood or I just wanted to an everyone else.</v>

6527
02:45:06.410 --> 02:45:07.071
<v Speaker 5>Even the guys like,</v>

6528
02:45:07.071 --> 02:45:07.341
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

6529
02:45:07.341 --> 02:45:07.971
<v Speaker 5>no dude,</v>

6530
02:45:07.971 --> 02:45:11.630
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't imagine being a man where rather than reality,</v>

6531
02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:16.800
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't imagine being a woman working for a man who wanted to fuck me and me</v>

6532
02:45:17.081 --> 02:45:18.940
<v Speaker 6>getting a raise,</v>

6533
02:45:18.941 --> 02:45:23.941
<v Speaker 6>me getting some sort of a upward movement in my career is dependent upon this</v>

6534
02:45:24.131 --> 02:45:27.310
<v Speaker 6>person making a decision and this person is always trying to fuck me.</v>

6535
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:28.750
<v Speaker 6>That'd be disgusting.</v>

6536
02:45:28.870 --> 02:45:32.320
<v Speaker 6>And that's what a lot of women have to deal with all day long and that's only</v>

6537
02:45:32.321 --> 02:45:33.310
<v Speaker 6>one step of it.</v>

6538
02:45:33.430 --> 02:45:35.350
<v Speaker 6>How about the fucking Bill Cosby step?</v>

6539
02:45:35.530 --> 02:45:38.950
<v Speaker 6>How about you can't leave your fucking drink alone.</v>

6540
02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:40.450
<v Speaker 6>You can't leave your drink.</v>

6541
02:45:40.451 --> 02:45:42.040
<v Speaker 6>That's a reality with a lot of women.</v>

6542
02:45:42.130 --> 02:45:43.690
<v Speaker 6>That's not a reality with you or me.</v>

6543
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:45.490
<v Speaker 6>When I was trying to rape us.</v>

6544
02:45:46.100 --> 02:45:46.933
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

6545
02:45:48.090 --> 02:45:50.880
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's a lot of shit that women have to think about that we don't have</v>

6546
02:45:50.881 --> 02:45:51.990
<v Speaker 6>to think about a lot.</v>

6547
02:45:52.140 --> 02:45:52.531
<v Speaker 6>Many,</v>

6548
02:45:52.531 --> 02:45:52.801
<v Speaker 6>many,</v>

6549
02:45:52.801 --> 02:45:53.101
<v Speaker 6>many,</v>

6550
02:45:53.101 --> 02:45:53.401
<v Speaker 6>many,</v>

6551
02:45:53.401 --> 02:45:53.671
<v Speaker 6>many,</v>

6552
02:45:53.671 --> 02:45:53.971
<v Speaker 6>many,</v>

6553
02:45:53.971 --> 02:45:54.610
<v Speaker 6>many things.</v>

6554
02:45:54.610 --> 02:45:54.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6555
02:45:54.910 --> 02:45:55.550
<v Speaker 5>it is interesting.</v>

6556
02:45:55.550 --> 02:45:56.670
<v Speaker 5>This now is all coming up here.</v>

6557
02:45:56.671 --> 02:45:57.161
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

6558
02:45:57.161 --> 02:45:59.600
<v Speaker 5>How many of you had some damn fuck.</v>

6559
02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:00.490
<v Speaker 5>It's worse than I thought.</v>

6560
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:03.580
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it's too cause like you just want to believe the best in the world and</v>

6561
02:46:03.581 --> 02:46:06.580
<v Speaker 5>people and so when you're like this you're like,</v>

6562
02:46:06.581 --> 02:46:07.090
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

6563
02:46:07.090 --> 02:46:08.080
<v Speaker 5>that can't happen that much.</v>

6564
02:46:08.110 --> 02:46:09.830
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you're problem,</v>

6565
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:10.960
<v Speaker 4>you're not doing it,</v>

6566
02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:13.700
<v Speaker 4>but you just don't want to believe that's so removed.</v>

6567
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:15.890
<v Speaker 4>Probably some kid can get chopped up by some,</v>

6568
02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:16.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:19.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6574
02:46:19.311 --> 02:46:19.791
<v Speaker 4>we're moving.</v>

6575
02:46:19.791 --> 02:46:20.630
<v Speaker 4>We don't see it as much.</v>

6576
02:46:20.631 --> 02:46:21.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not directed us.</v>

6577
02:46:21.771 --> 02:46:23.420
<v Speaker 4>So they've been fucked up worlds,</v>

02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:32.450
<v Speaker 4>Everybody is impossible for them to have a regular job.</v>

6585
02:46:32.690 --> 02:46:35.270
<v Speaker 4>Every single one of us that successful as a comic,</v>

6586
02:46:35.570 --> 02:46:39.890
<v Speaker 4>it's virtually impossible for any of us to have ever existed.</v>

6587
02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:41.840
<v Speaker 4>In an office environment and survived.</v>

6588
02:46:41.930 --> 02:46:42.763
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6589
02:46:42.890 --> 02:46:44.000
<v Speaker 4>we're too fucked up,</v>

6590
02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:45.770
<v Speaker 4>but we're perfect for comedy.</v>

6591
02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:46.671
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

6592
02:46:46.671 --> 02:46:47.504
<v Speaker 4>So like us,</v>

6593
02:46:48.110 --> 02:46:51.110
<v Speaker 4>US talking about office politics and office environments,</v>

6594
02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:52.360
<v Speaker 4>so we a fucking big deal.</v>

6595
02:46:52.361 --> 02:46:53.540
<v Speaker 4>It's really what it is.</v>

6596
02:46:53.541 --> 02:46:53.990
<v Speaker 4>Fools.</v>

6597
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:56.480
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think it's funny when people say like talk about,</v>

6598
02:46:56.481 --> 02:46:56.721
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

6599
02:46:56.721 --> 02:46:57.800
<v Speaker 4>Louie or something where it's like,</v>

6600
02:46:58.490 --> 02:46:59.570
<v Speaker 4>it was a comedy festival,</v>

6601
02:46:59.571 --> 02:46:59.901
<v Speaker 4>so it was,</v>

6608
02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:04.970
<v Speaker 4>Safety issue.</v>

6609
02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:06.220
<v Speaker 4>If it was a workplace then,</v>

6610
02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:06.511
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

6611
02:47:06.511 --> 02:47:07.370

<v Speaker 4>Like they'd beat it.</v>

6648
02:47:54.351 --> 02:47:55.011
<v Speaker 4>This girl is coming in,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Even if it's your wife,</v>

6653
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:03.500
<v Speaker 4>you're not allowed to do that.</v>

6654
02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:04.601
<v Speaker 4>A real work.</v>

02:48:04.601 --> 02:48:06.200
<v Speaker 4>You can't fuck fuck at work.</v>

6656
02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:07.550
<v Speaker 4>When we're Constanza got fired,</v>

6657
02:48:07.551 --> 02:48:07.790
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

6658
02:48:07.790 --> 02:48:09.200
<v Speaker 4>is that not alone?</v>

6659
02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:10.093
<v Speaker 4>What did he do at work?</v>

6660
02:48:11.450 --> 02:48:12.200
<v Speaker 4>And then they were like,</v>

6661
02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:13.310
<v Speaker 4>we caught you on camera goes,</v>

6662
02:48:13.370 --> 02:48:13.520
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

6663
02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:13.970
<v Speaker 4>what I did,</v>

6664
02:48:13.970 --> 02:48:14.661
<v Speaker 4>was that a problem?</v>

6665
02:48:14.661 --> 02:48:16.580
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize trying to lie his way out of it.</v>

6666
02:48:18.110 --> 02:48:18.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6667
02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:19.310
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6668
02:48:19.310 --> 02:48:21.410
<v Speaker 4>I think people listen to more and it's slow.</v>

6669
02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:22.050
<v Speaker 4>And I think at the,</v>

6670
02:48:22.050 --> 02:48:22.291
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

6671
02:48:22.291 --> 02:48:24.030
<v Speaker 4>the conversation gets sidetracked when you,</v>

6672
02:48:24.140 --> 02:48:24.400
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

6673
02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:26.030
<v Speaker 4>you hit on punishment too much.</v>

6674
02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:27.590
<v Speaker 4>When people hit on punishment,</v>

6675
02:48:27.591 --> 02:48:28.610
<v Speaker 4>like this person needs to go away.</v>

6676
02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:28.821
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

6677
02:48:28.821 --> 02:48:29.900
<v Speaker 4>can we get back to the fucking,</v>

6678
02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:30.980
<v Speaker 4>same thing with Michael Vick.</v>

6679
02:48:31.150 --> 02:48:33.850
<v Speaker 4>It's when you're talking about whether he should put that away.</v>

6680
02:48:33.870 --> 02:48:34.341
<v Speaker 4>Football,</v>

6681
02:48:34.341 --> 02:48:34.581
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

6682
02:48:34.581 --> 02:48:36.200
<v Speaker 4>now you've sidetrack me from just saying,</v>

6683
02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:37.910
<v Speaker 4>don't kill dogs.</v>

6684
02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:39.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm on your side.</v>

6685
02:48:39.321 --> 02:48:39.920
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>

6686
02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:40.161
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

6687
02:48:40.161 --> 02:48:41.300
<v Speaker 4>now you've sidetrack me to go.</v>

6688
02:48:41.301 --> 02:48:41.411
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6689
02:48:41.411 --> 02:48:41.570
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

6690
02:48:41.570 --> 02:48:42.560
<v Speaker 4>He should be allowed to like football.</v>

6691
02:48:42.561 --> 02:48:43.580
<v Speaker 4>That has nothing to do with it.</v>

6692
02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:47.420
<v Speaker 4>Let's just get back always to the argument like let's make it safer for chicks</v>

6693
02:48:47.421 --> 02:48:48.254
<v Speaker 4>in the workplace.</v>

6694
02:48:48.470 --> 02:48:51.290
<v Speaker 4>Let's not let a black guy and not get hired when he's deserving.</v>

6695
02:48:52.220 --> 02:48:52.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6696
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:53.720
<v Speaker 4>let's fix that stuff.</v>

6697
02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:56.030
<v Speaker 4>The punishment side tracks as you can still talk about it,</v>

6698
02:48:56.031 --> 02:48:57.260
<v Speaker 4>but not when you're emotional.</v>

6699
02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:01.550
<v Speaker 4>I think one thing that we've come within this conversation as a job suck jobs</v>

6700
02:49:01.551 --> 02:49:01.731
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

6701
02:49:01.731 --> 02:49:04.190
<v Speaker 4>so no one should have them because if you have them,</v>

6702
02:49:04.191 --> 02:49:05.720
<v Speaker 4>people want to fuck you that you work with.</v>

6703
02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:06.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6704
02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:07.441
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

6705
02:49:07.441 --> 02:49:09.420
<v Speaker 4>that's the solution when it's like men need to shut up.</v>

6706
02:49:09.421 --> 02:49:09.721
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

6707
02:49:09.721 --> 02:49:09.961
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

6708
02:49:09.961 --> 02:49:12.250
<v Speaker 4>well then we can't help you or hurt you if in your shout out.</v>

6709
02:49:12.270 --> 02:49:13.440
<v Speaker 4>Those people are just,</v>

6710
02:49:13.530 --> 02:49:14.370
<v Speaker 4>there's French,</v>

6711
02:49:14.371 --> 02:49:15.810
<v Speaker 4>there's loud fringe people.</v>

6712
02:49:15.811 --> 02:49:16.650
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>

6713
02:49:17.210 --> 02:49:18.210
<v Speaker 4>that's just one,</v>

6714
02:49:18.211 --> 02:49:21.390
<v Speaker 4>one of my favorite tweets that I saved from this feminist woman that said,</v>

6715
02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:25.260
<v Speaker 4>all white males are trash unless proven otherwise.</v>

6716
02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:25.710
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

6717
02:49:25.710 --> 02:49:26.440
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

6718
02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:27.520
<v Speaker 4>well we're not going to have them,</v>

6719
02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:29.433
<v Speaker 4>but you want our help,</v>

6720
02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:30.353
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

6721
02:49:30.370 --> 02:49:31.203
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

6722
02:49:31.550 --> 02:49:33.210
<v Speaker 4>good luck with that unless proven otherwise.</v>

6723
02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:34.980
<v Speaker 4>That's a ridiculous way to look at things.</v>

6724
02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:37.920
<v Speaker 4>What if a man said that all women are constantly,</v>

6725
02:49:37.921 --> 02:49:39.600
<v Speaker 4>it's proven otherwise that's a bad person.</v>

6726
02:49:39.630 --> 02:49:39.781
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6727
02:49:39.781 --> 02:49:41.520
<v Speaker 4>it's also like the answer to,</v>

6728
02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:41.970
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

6729
02:49:41.970 --> 02:49:42.281
<v Speaker 4>White Dude,</v>

6730
02:49:42.281 --> 02:49:43.390
<v Speaker 4>he's been in charge forever,</v>

6731
02:49:43.410 --> 02:49:47.280
<v Speaker 4>is not fuck these people over who I wasn't here for forever.</v>

6732
02:49:47.300 --> 02:49:47.460
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6733
02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:48.900
<v Speaker 4>People just need to stop talking.</v>

6734
02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:49.171
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6735
02:49:49.171 --> 02:49:49.710
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

6736
02:49:49.710 --> 02:49:50.070
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

6737
02:49:50.070 --> 02:49:51.030
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

6738
02:49:51.340 --> 02:49:53.640
<v Speaker 4>That's the answer is lack of racism,</v>

6739
02:49:53.641 --> 02:49:54.474
<v Speaker 4>lack of sex,</v>

6740
02:49:54.810 --> 02:49:55.740
<v Speaker 4>complete lack.</v>

6741
02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:58.830
<v Speaker 4>Even in judging white people,</v>

6742
02:49:58.860 --> 02:50:00.330
<v Speaker 4>even in judging white males,</v>

6743
02:50:00.450 --> 02:50:04.080
<v Speaker 4>even in judging white males in a position of power like this should be no</v>

6744
02:50:04.081 --> 02:50:04.591
<v Speaker 4>racism.</v>

6745
02:50:04.591 --> 02:50:08.040
<v Speaker 4>There should be no discrimination and people should be presidential candidate</v>

6746
02:50:08.070 --> 02:50:08.491
<v Speaker 4>early,</v>

6747
02:50:08.491 --> 02:50:09.390
<v Speaker 4>early last time.</v>

6748
02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:10.021
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

6749
02:50:10.021 --> 02:50:11.010
<v Speaker 4>how do you feel that black lives matter?</v>

6750
02:50:11.011 --> 02:50:11.970
<v Speaker 4>And he hadn't heard about it yet.</v>

6751
02:50:12.310 --> 02:50:13.143
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

6752
02:50:13.270 --> 02:50:13.880
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

6753
02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:14.940
<v Speaker 4>And he was super progressive.</v>

6754
02:50:14.941 --> 02:50:15.151
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

6755
02:50:15.151 --> 02:50:16.470
<v Speaker 4>of course black lives matter.</v>

6756
02:50:16.471 --> 02:50:17.120
<v Speaker 4>All lives matter.</v>

6757
02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:17.480
<v Speaker 4>We tie.</v>

6758
02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:18.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6759
02:50:18.130 --> 02:50:20.680
<v Speaker 4>And like you can't see the logo for that.</v>

6760
02:50:20.690 --> 02:50:22.080
<v Speaker 4>That's a slogan for the other side.</v>

6761
02:50:22.081 --> 02:50:22.561
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>

6762
02:50:22.561 --> 02:50:23.460
<v Speaker 4>wrote him off and he's like,</v>

6763
02:50:23.490 --> 02:50:24.060
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6764
02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:24.240
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6765
02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:25.650
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of fucking three words.</v>

6766
02:50:25.651 --> 02:50:27.060
<v Speaker 4>Summation of the whole argument.</v>

6767
02:50:27.550 --> 02:50:27.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6768
02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:29.850
<v Speaker 4>Black lives matter or all lives matter.</v>

6769
02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:30.840
<v Speaker 4>And Bernie Sanders said,</v>

6770
02:50:30.841 --> 02:50:31.710
<v Speaker 4>black lives matter.</v>

6771
02:50:31.710 --> 02:50:32.191
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

6772
02:50:32.191 --> 02:50:33.024
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

6773
02:50:33.030 --> 02:50:33.631
<v Speaker 4>And people like,</v>

6774
02:50:33.631 --> 02:50:33.781
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6775
02:50:33.781 --> 02:50:34.680
<v Speaker 4>you're stupid progressive.</v>

6776
02:50:34.681 --> 02:50:35.131
<v Speaker 4>We love you,</v>

6777
02:50:35.131 --> 02:50:35.521
<v Speaker 4>Bernie.</v>

6778
02:50:35.521 --> 02:50:38.070
<v Speaker 4>You're playing by the rules that we've established and you saying the things</v>

6779
02:50:38.071 --> 02:50:38.461
<v Speaker 4>that we make,</v>

6780
02:50:38.461 --> 02:50:38.910
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>

6781
02:50:38.910 --> 02:50:39.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6782
02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:41.550
<v Speaker 4>well of course all lives matter.</v>

6783
02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:43.230
<v Speaker 4>But black lives matter as well.</v>

6784
02:50:43.231 --> 02:50:44.940
<v Speaker 4>So the yellow lives matter also.</v>

6785
02:50:44.941 --> 02:50:45.390
<v Speaker 4>It's too,</v>

6786
02:50:45.390 --> 02:50:46.670
<v Speaker 4>it's too crazy too.</v>

6787
02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:48.270
<v Speaker 4>It didn't work as a slogan.</v>

6788
02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:49.133
<v Speaker 4>If you go,</v>

6789
02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:49.681
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

6790
02:50:49.681 --> 02:50:52.560
<v Speaker 4>we need to figure out why black people are getting shot at a higher rate and</v>

6791
02:50:52.561 --> 02:50:53.460
<v Speaker 4>their percentages,</v>

6792
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6793
02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:55.290
<v Speaker 4>then white people by cops.</v>

6794
02:50:55.291 --> 02:50:57.150
<v Speaker 4>So we need to like curb that immediately.</v>

6795
02:50:57.151 --> 02:51:00.330
<v Speaker 4>And we didn't make it somewhere where you can actually trust the police to</v>

6796
02:51:00.331 --> 02:51:02.580
<v Speaker 4>represent you all and not have a fear of them.</v>

6797
02:51:02.730 --> 02:51:03.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

6798
02:51:03.150 --> 02:51:04.290
<v Speaker 4>that's not a slogan you can throw out.</v>

6799
02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:04.860
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6800
02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:05.910
<v Speaker 4>But if you said that,</v>

6801
02:51:05.911 --> 02:51:06.744
<v Speaker 4>then nobody's gonna like,</v>

6802
02:51:06.810 --> 02:51:07.180
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6803
02:51:07.180 --> 02:51:08.360
<v Speaker 4>you should have to worry about cups.</v>

6804
02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:10.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like we were just like,</v>

6805
02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:15.210
<v Speaker 4>get behind that super deep and complex conversation about systemic racism in</v>

6806
02:51:15.211 --> 02:51:17.460
<v Speaker 4>communities where like in Baltimore,</v>

6807
02:51:17.461 --> 02:51:20.700
<v Speaker 4>where they literally established zones where black people couldn't buy homes.</v>

6808
02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:22.650
<v Speaker 4>And now you're gonna sum up the three words.</v>

6809
02:51:23.340 --> 02:51:28.340
<v Speaker 4>You've got giant cultural issues that should be addressed on literally a</v>

6810
02:51:29.310 --> 02:51:30.870
<v Speaker 4>nationwide scale.</v>

6811
02:51:31.170 --> 02:51:31.591
<v Speaker 4>Like we're,</v>

6812
02:51:31.591 --> 02:51:36.591
<v Speaker 4>we're interested in building nations and helping people in Afghanistan and the</v>

6813
02:51:36.750 --> 02:51:38.820
<v Speaker 4>giving aid to Saudi Arabia and all these different,</v>

6814
02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:39.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6815
02:51:39.780 --> 02:51:41.370
<v Speaker 4>fill in the blank with whatever country it is.</v>

6816
02:51:41.820 --> 02:51:44.340
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck are they not fixing the south side of Chicago?</v>

6817
02:51:44.420 --> 02:51:44.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6818
02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:45.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6819
02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:46.770
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck are they not fixing Baltimore?</v>

6820
02:51:46.771 --> 02:51:48.300
<v Speaker 4>How do they not going to Compton,</v>

6821
02:51:48.310 --> 02:51:49.320
<v Speaker 4>Flint water,</v>

6822
02:51:49.360 --> 02:51:50.110
<v Speaker 4>still many drinkable,</v>

6823
02:51:50.110 --> 02:51:50.790
<v Speaker 4>goddammit.</v>

6824
02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:54.030
<v Speaker 4>Elon Musk has to step in and say he's going to fix your water.</v>

6825
02:51:54.090 --> 02:51:54.451
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

6826
02:51:54.451 --> 02:51:55.284
<v Speaker 4>you and I,</v>

6827
02:51:56.510 --> 02:51:59.880
<v Speaker 4>we have no idea about the backstory to it and how to fix it.</v>

6828
02:51:59.881 --> 02:52:01.530
<v Speaker 4>We ever know pennies in our opinions are worthless.</v>

6829
02:52:01.531 --> 02:52:02.400
<v Speaker 4>They're just worthless.</v>

6830
02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:03.870
<v Speaker 4>No solutions,</v>

6831
02:52:04.020 --> 02:52:04.590
<v Speaker 4>neither.</v>

6832
02:52:04.590 --> 02:52:06.100
<v Speaker 4>Neither one us have any</v>

6833
02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:07.060
<v Speaker 6>skin in the game.</v>

6834
02:52:07.180 --> 02:52:08.350
<v Speaker 6>We're talking out of our ass,</v>

6835
02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:08.980
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

6836
02:52:08.980 --> 02:52:11.740
<v Speaker 6>but we're going to do anything really wrong to people without hurting anybody.</v>

6837
02:52:11.741 --> 02:52:13.720
<v Speaker 6>But if we look want to look at things objectively,</v>

6838
02:52:13.721 --> 02:52:15.730
<v Speaker 6>that is a real valid</v>

6839
02:52:17.230 --> 02:52:18.063
<v Speaker 6>argument.</v>

6840
02:52:18.110 --> 02:52:19.870
<v Speaker 6>Real valid point of discussion.</v>

6841
02:52:20.110 --> 02:52:20.440
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

6842
02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:20.771
<v Speaker 6>sure,</v>

6843
02:52:20.771 --> 02:52:21.610
<v Speaker 6>black lives matter,</v>

6844
02:52:21.730 --> 02:52:24.460
<v Speaker 6>but you know what else matters really bad.</v>

6845
02:52:24.461 --> 02:52:28.930
<v Speaker 6>Communities that have been bad for decade after decade after decade and they're</v>

6846
02:52:28.931 --> 02:52:30.760
<v Speaker 6>not being addressed by any politicians.</v>

6847
02:52:30.910 --> 02:52:32.710
<v Speaker 6>They're not being addressed by any community leaders.</v>

6848
02:52:32.890 --> 02:52:34.240
<v Speaker 6>No one is stepping in and saying,</v>

6849
02:52:34.241 --> 02:52:34.750
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

6850
02:52:34.750 --> 02:52:37.870
<v Speaker 6>before we do anything involving any other country,</v>

6851
02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:41.410
<v Speaker 6>we've got to fix all the problems we have right here.</v>

6852
02:52:41.411 --> 02:52:42.700
<v Speaker 6>And they can be fixed.</v>

6853
02:52:42.850 --> 02:52:43.720
<v Speaker 6>They can be fixed.</v>

6854
02:52:43.810 --> 02:52:45.010
<v Speaker 6>And it might take decades.</v>

6855
02:52:45.100 --> 02:52:46.030
<v Speaker 6>It might take years.</v>

6856
02:52:46.031 --> 02:52:47.140
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how long it's going to take,</v>

6857
02:52:47.290 --> 02:52:50.440
<v Speaker 6>but it's not going to be fixed at all if we do nothing.</v>

6858
02:52:51.230 --> 02:52:51.740
<v Speaker 6>If we,</v>

6859
02:52:51.740 --> 02:52:52.380
<v Speaker 6>we've we've,</v>

6860
02:52:52.380 --> 02:52:54.180
<v Speaker 6>that's also part of this argument that goes too far.</v>

6861
02:52:54.200 --> 02:52:55.240
<v Speaker 6>The pendulum was here.</v>

6862
02:52:55.290 --> 02:52:56.410
<v Speaker 6>We want it back in the middle.</v>

6863
02:52:56.530 --> 02:52:59.950
<v Speaker 6>It's just going to have to swing a little too far and then come back when we're</v>

6864
02:52:59.980 --> 02:53:04.420
<v Speaker 6>talking about me too and and sexual harassment and rape and all this stuff.</v>

6865
02:53:04.421 --> 02:53:06.910
<v Speaker 6>I think one of the things that we're dealing with is information.</v>

6866
02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:11.380
<v Speaker 6>Does distribution of information is occurring at a rate that's unprecedented.</v>

6867
02:53:11.410 --> 02:53:16.410
<v Speaker 6>It's never been like this before and I think there's a real step that's going to</v>

6868
02:53:16.601 --> 02:53:19.540
<v Speaker 6>happen with human beings where you're not,</v>

6869
02:53:19.780 --> 02:53:24.780
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be able to literally read minds and this is going to happen</v>

6870
02:53:25.841 --> 02:53:28.930
<v Speaker 6>through some sort of a merging with humans and technology.</v>

6871
02:53:28.960 --> 02:53:31.680
<v Speaker 6>Elon Musk believes it's going to be this thing that he's,</v>

6872
02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:35.530
<v Speaker 6>he's releasing something in the next few months called neuro link and this neuro</v>

6873
02:53:35.531 --> 02:53:40.531
<v Speaker 6>link is going to somehow or another increase the bandwidth between people and</v>

6874
02:53:40.751 --> 02:53:41.584
<v Speaker 6>information.</v>

6875
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:44.590
<v Speaker 6>At a rate that's going to literally change what a human being is.</v>

6876
02:53:45.370 --> 02:53:48.340
<v Speaker 6>And the way he was explaining it was very vague.</v>

6877
02:53:48.490 --> 02:53:49.151
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

6878
02:53:49.151 --> 02:53:53.350
<v Speaker 6>when you're talking about a guy like Elon Musk and the insane ideas that he has</v>

6879
02:53:53.351 --> 02:53:55.360
<v Speaker 6>bounced around inside it's fucking robot brain.</v>

6880
02:53:55.840 --> 02:53:56.673
<v Speaker 6>I believe him,</v>

6881
02:53:56.770 --> 02:53:58.240
<v Speaker 6>and I believe this is one step,</v>

6882
02:53:58.241 --> 02:54:03.241
<v Speaker 6>just like no one could have ever predicted the Internet in 1960 no one ever</v>

6883
02:54:04.601 --> 02:54:07.240
<v Speaker 6>would have thought other than I think Malcolm Mcluhan,</v>

6884
02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:08.330
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6885
02:54:08.330 --> 02:54:10.240
<v Speaker 6>had some people had some,</v>

6886
02:54:11.290 --> 02:54:12.123
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

6887
02:54:12.250 --> 02:54:12.861
<v Speaker 6>some people that,</v>

6888
02:54:12.861 --> 02:54:13.750
<v Speaker 6>some ideas of,</v>

6889
02:54:13.751 --> 02:54:14.560
<v Speaker 6>of what,</v>

6890
02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:15.820
<v Speaker 6>what could possibly happen.</v>

6891
02:54:15.821 --> 02:54:16.654
<v Speaker 6>But</v>

6892
02:54:17.650 --> 02:54:18.483
<v Speaker 6>no one,</v>

6893
02:54:18.850 --> 02:54:20.980
<v Speaker 6>no average person saw this comment.</v>

6894
02:54:20.981 --> 02:54:25.981
<v Speaker 6>And I think no average person is going to see these next stages of integration</v>

6895
02:54:26.111 --> 02:54:27.970
<v Speaker 6>between human beings and technology.</v>

6896
02:54:27.971 --> 02:54:32.971
<v Speaker 6>And one of them is going to be some sort of a translation device,</v>

6897
02:54:33.550 --> 02:54:37.180
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a translation device that translates not just languages but</v>

6898
02:54:37.181 --> 02:54:40.930
<v Speaker 6>thoughts and a universal language that is,</v>

6899
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:42.370
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

6900
02:54:42.370 --> 02:54:45.820
<v Speaker 6>it defies economic boundaries,</v>

6901
02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:47.260
<v Speaker 6>political boundaries,</v>

6902
02:54:47.261 --> 02:54:48.340
<v Speaker 6>geographic boundaries,</v>

6903
02:54:48.341 --> 02:54:50.020
<v Speaker 6>something that everyone's going to be able to understand.</v>

6904
02:54:50.021 --> 02:54:51.040
<v Speaker 6>Like the real problem,</v>

6905
02:54:51.041 --> 02:54:53.620
<v Speaker 6>like Tower of Babel argument is that,</v>

6906
02:54:53.740 --> 02:54:54.310
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6907
02:54:54.310 --> 02:54:58.080
<v Speaker 6>if someone's talking in Bangladesh and someone's talking in Japan,</v>

6908
02:54:58.081 --> 02:54:59.350
<v Speaker 6>it's someone's talking in America,</v>

6909
02:54:59.351 --> 02:55:01.930
<v Speaker 6>there's so many different ways of saying things.</v>

6910
02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 6>It's too hard to understand the mall.</v>

6911
02:55:04.041 --> 02:55:06.020
<v Speaker 6>No one knows all the languages,</v>

6912
02:55:06.021 --> 02:55:06.270
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

6913
02:55:06.270 --> 02:55:07.640
<v Speaker 6>Very QP nuance.</v>

6914
02:55:08.330 --> 02:55:10.040
<v Speaker 5>Somebody translated the stranger.</v>

6915
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6916
02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:11.240
<v Speaker 5>Four sentences.</v>

6917
02:55:11.290 --> 02:55:12.123
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6918
02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:13.460
<v Speaker 5>and it's a French I think,</v>

6919
02:55:13.461 --> 02:55:14.150
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

6920
02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:17.450
<v Speaker 5>it's mother died yesterday or was it the day before?</v>

6921
02:55:17.451 --> 02:55:18.284
<v Speaker 5>I can't be sure.</v>

6922
02:55:18.350 --> 02:55:21.020
<v Speaker 5>And they have to have arguments about she used mother,</v>

6923
02:55:21.021 --> 02:55:23.360
<v Speaker 5>she's mom should use Mama.</v>

6924
02:55:23.660 --> 02:55:23.811
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

6925
02:55:23.811 --> 02:55:27.830
<v Speaker 5>which one is the actually meaning in French and not just get like a sterile one,</v>

6926
02:55:27.831 --> 02:55:28.650
<v Speaker 5>but like a,</v>

6927
02:55:28.650 --> 02:55:29.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6928
02:55:29.090 --> 02:55:30.170
<v Speaker 5>a normalized once.</v>

6929
02:55:30.171 --> 02:55:30.501
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

6930
02:55:30.501 --> 02:55:30.701
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

6931
02:55:30.701 --> 02:55:31.000
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

6932
02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:32.430
<v Speaker 5>it's beyond just translation.</v>

6933
02:55:32.431 --> 02:55:32.571
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

6934
02:55:32.571 --> 02:55:32.751
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

6935
02:55:32.751 --> 02:55:33.584
<v Speaker 5>So go ahead.</v>

6936
02:55:33.660 --> 02:55:38.660
<v Speaker 6>And I think this is one of the giant problems with whenever you're dealing with</v>

6937
02:55:40.651 --> 02:55:41.580
<v Speaker 6>nationalism,</v>

6938
02:55:41.730 --> 02:55:43.650
<v Speaker 6>whenever you're dealing with this idea of the other,</v>

6939
02:55:43.710 --> 02:55:46.920
<v Speaker 6>that someone from another place is different than you kids.</v>

6940
02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:49.920
<v Speaker 6>And Yemen's lives don't matter nearly as much as,</v>

6941
02:55:50.010 --> 02:55:50.610
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

6942
02:55:50.610 --> 02:55:51.443
<v Speaker 6>I dunno,</v>

6943
02:55:51.530 --> 02:55:55.890
<v Speaker 6>someone not getting hired for late night TV is a perfect example because they're</v>

6944
02:55:55.891 --> 02:55:59.310
<v Speaker 6>using drones to launch missiles into a country that we're not even supposed to</v>

6945
02:55:59.311 --> 02:55:59.980
<v Speaker 6>be at war with.</v>

6946
02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:00.160
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

6947
02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:02.520
<v Speaker 5>They're going after it's not insurgence.</v>

6948
02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:03.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6949
02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:07.550
<v Speaker 5>A six year old little girl is dead times a thousand.</v>

6950
02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:08.010
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6951
02:56:08.010 --> 02:56:11.060
<v Speaker 5>But if one died because like,</v>

6952
02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:12.093
<v Speaker 6>but it's nice that,</v>

6953
02:56:12.100 --> 02:56:12.671
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

6954
02:56:12.671 --> 02:56:15.070
<v Speaker 6>it's not happening in Chicago or San Francisco,</v>

6955
02:56:15.100 --> 02:56:15.660
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

6956
02:56:15.660 --> 02:56:18.670
<v Speaker 6>We're just not drones launching into the East village.</v>

6957
02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.010
<v Speaker 6>So because that's not happening,</v>

6958
02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:24.700
<v Speaker 6>we don't think of it as a concern of ours and this,</v>

6959
02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:26.440
<v Speaker 6>I think these hurdles,</v>

6960
02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:31.840
<v Speaker 6>these are informational hurdles as much as their geographical hurdles and their</v>

6961
02:56:31.841 --> 02:56:32.860
<v Speaker 6>language hurdles.</v>

6962
02:56:32.890 --> 02:56:34.480
<v Speaker 6>And these are,</v>

6963
02:56:34.660 --> 02:56:36.160
<v Speaker 6>these are hurdles of understanding.</v>

6964
02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:41.290
<v Speaker 6>And I think as our realm of understanding expands and we get a better</v>

6965
02:56:41.291 --> 02:56:45.580
<v Speaker 6>understanding of the idea that we really are just human beings in different</v>

6966
02:56:45.581 --> 02:56:48.490
<v Speaker 6>places and that you are no different than me.</v>

6967
02:56:48.491 --> 02:56:51.610
<v Speaker 6>And I'm no different from some kid who lives in China and that we're all just</v>

6968
02:56:51.611 --> 02:56:52.241
<v Speaker 6>human beings.</v>

6969
02:56:52.241 --> 02:56:56.200
<v Speaker 6>And the what of our differences are they pale in comparison to our similarities</v>

6970
02:56:56.590 --> 02:57:01.590
<v Speaker 6>and also the random chance that you were born in Maryland and I was born in New</v>

6971
02:57:03.070 --> 02:57:03.560
<v Speaker 6>Jersey.</v>

6972
02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:07.390
<v Speaker 6>This randomness and this idea that you take pride in that is so foolhardy and so</v>

6973
02:57:07.391 --> 02:57:08.224
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous.</v>

6974
02:57:08.290 --> 02:57:11.590
<v Speaker 6>And the idea that somehow or another we're on some sort of a tribe and this is</v>

6975
02:57:11.591 --> 02:57:15.580
<v Speaker 6>something that human beings will cling to for security and safety.</v>

6976
02:57:15.910 --> 02:57:16.780
<v Speaker 6>And we go with tribe,</v>

6977
02:57:16.781 --> 02:57:17.650
<v Speaker 6>left and tribe,</v>

6978
02:57:17.651 --> 02:57:18.101
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

6979
02:57:18.101 --> 02:57:22.180
<v Speaker 6>And we go with tribe progressive and tried conservative and we go with tribe,</v>

6980
02:57:22.181 --> 02:57:23.110
<v Speaker 6>American tribe,</v>

6981
02:57:23.111 --> 02:57:24.010
<v Speaker 6>Canada and tribe,</v>

6982
02:57:24.011 --> 02:57:24.521
<v Speaker 6>Mexico.</v>

6983
02:57:24.521 --> 02:57:25.510
<v Speaker 6>It's all foolishness.</v>

6984
02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:28.510
<v Speaker 6>And I think as technology expands,</v>

6985
02:57:28.511 --> 02:57:30.760
<v Speaker 6>that will be more and more preposterous.</v>

6986
02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:31.511
<v Speaker 6>And you're,</v>

6987
02:57:31.511 --> 02:57:35.920
<v Speaker 6>you're starting to see this with even the way people view religion.</v>

6988
02:57:36.550 --> 02:57:38.800
<v Speaker 6>If you look to people from just a few decades ago,</v>

6989
02:57:39.030 --> 02:57:39.370
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

6990
02:57:39.370 --> 02:57:41.110
<v Speaker 6>how many people in this country thought they were,</v>

6991
02:57:41.111 --> 02:57:41.380
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6992
02:57:41.380 --> 02:57:43.060
<v Speaker 6>how many identified as atheist?</v>

6993
02:57:43.061 --> 02:57:44.740
<v Speaker 6>It's quite a bit less than today.</v>

6994
02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:49.420
<v Speaker 6>Quite a bit more identify with today because you start to understand more about</v>

6995
02:57:49.421 --> 02:57:50.230
<v Speaker 6>religion.</v>

6996
02:57:50.230 --> 02:57:52.140
<v Speaker 6>There's Google people can um,</v>

6997
02:57:52.180 --> 02:57:53.860
<v Speaker 6>and Bill Maher and Sam Harris,</v>

6998
02:57:53.861 --> 02:57:56.080
<v Speaker 6>we're actually talking about this on a podcast recently.</v>

6999
02:57:56.590 --> 02:57:56.861
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

7000
02:57:56.861 --> 02:58:00.610
<v Speaker 6>cause they were talking about the 10th anniversary of Religious Bill Maher's</v>

7001
02:58:00.611 --> 02:58:01.230
<v Speaker 6>documentary.</v>

7002
02:58:01.230 --> 02:58:02.040
<v Speaker 6>They made a really good point</v>

7003
02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:05.010
<v Speaker 4>that Google came along and when Google came along,</v>

7004
02:58:05.130 --> 02:58:09.810
<v Speaker 4>people were allowed to then research the history of Mormonism where they never</v>

7005
02:58:09.811 --> 02:58:10.561
<v Speaker 4>really could before.</v>

7006
02:58:10.561 --> 02:58:10.831
<v Speaker 4>And they go,</v>

7007
02:58:10.831 --> 02:58:11.160
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

7008
02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:13.350
<v Speaker 4>he was 14 and 18,</v>

7009
02:58:13.351 --> 02:58:17.490
<v Speaker 4>20 and Joseph Smith was just a kid and he made up a bunch of find me a 14 year</v>

7010
02:58:17.491 --> 02:58:17.611
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>

7011
02:58:17.611 --> 02:58:18.630
<v Speaker 4>It's not full of shit.</v>

7012
02:58:18.940 --> 02:58:20.190
<v Speaker 4>That's way more impressive.</v>

7013
02:58:20.670 --> 02:58:22.900
<v Speaker 4>And then Scientology and,</v>

7014
02:58:22.901 --> 02:58:23.181
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

7015
02:58:23.181 --> 02:58:24.030
<v Speaker 4>and many of the,</v>

7016
02:58:24.060 --> 02:58:24.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

7017
02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:26.310
<v Speaker 4>many of the chapters in the Bible,</v>

7018
02:58:26.311 --> 02:58:28.260
<v Speaker 4>when people look at the difference between the New Testament,</v>

7019
02:58:28.261 --> 02:58:31.070
<v Speaker 4>the old testament who wrote it and why and,</v>

7020
02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:35.710
<v Speaker 4>and how many passages were removed and edited by human beings.</v>

7021
02:58:36.170 --> 02:58:36.710
<v Speaker 4>How we,</v>

7022
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:38.520
<v Speaker 4>you decide the work of God,</v>

7023
02:58:38.521 --> 02:58:40.590
<v Speaker 4>like what gets to be released and what's not.</v>

7024
02:58:41.060 --> 02:58:41.190
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

7025
02:58:41.190 --> 02:58:42.210
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff is,</v>

7026
02:58:42.330 --> 02:58:44.250
<v Speaker 4>it's kindle now.</v>

7027
02:58:44.251 --> 02:58:44.451
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

7028
02:58:44.451 --> 02:58:44.910
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

7029
02:58:44.910 --> 02:58:49.170
<v Speaker 4>it's kindling for the fire of enlightenment and in that fire spreading.</v>

7030
02:58:49.410 --> 02:58:53.280
<v Speaker 4>And I think that it's an informational tool and these,</v>

7031
02:58:53.310 --> 02:58:56.160
<v Speaker 4>this fire enlightenment is,</v>

7032
02:58:56.170 --> 02:58:57.003
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

7033
02:58:57.350 --> 02:58:59.100
<v Speaker 4>it's a bad term fire enlightenment.</v>

7034
02:58:59.100 --> 02:58:59.990
<v Speaker 4>But Fred,</v>

7035
02:59:00.060 --> 02:59:01.370
<v Speaker 4>when you realize too,</v>

7036
02:59:01.380 --> 02:59:02.580
<v Speaker 4>when it really does get out,</v>

7037
02:59:02.581 --> 02:59:03.000
<v Speaker 4>we're like,</v>

7038
02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:03.601
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

7039
02:59:03.601 --> 02:59:04.620

7040
02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:05.000
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

7041
02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:05.990
<v Speaker 4>Got It done.</v>

7042
02:59:06.420 --> 02:59:08.060
<v Speaker 4>And we think about how many women you like,</v>

7043
02:59:08.130 --> 02:59:09.870
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about this a long time ago and you're like,</v>

02:59:13.420 --> 02:59:14.180
<v Speaker 4>exactly like that.</v>

7048
02:59:14.180 --> 02:59:14.551
<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>

7049
02:59:14.551 --> 02:59:15.031
<v Speaker 4>And now you're like,</v>

7050
02:59:15.031 --> 02:59:15.870
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

7051
02:59:15.900 --> 02:59:17.370
<v Speaker 4>I guess it is really bad.</v>

7052
02:59:17.430 --> 02:59:17.611
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

7053
02:59:17.611 --> 02:59:18.444
<v Speaker 4>the Cosby,</v>

7054
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:19.381
<v Speaker 4>the Cosby thing,</v>

7055
02:59:19.381 --> 02:59:21.750
<v Speaker 4>I remember hearing about that when I was at news radio.</v>

7056
02:59:21.900 --> 02:59:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7057
02:59:22.130 --> 02:59:22.940
<v Speaker 4>It was always a thing.</v>

7058
02:59:22.940 --> 02:59:23.773
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

7059
02:59:23.970 --> 02:59:24.331
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

7060
02:59:24.331 --> 02:59:28.650
<v Speaker 4>maybe think about it like in terms of perse actress.</v>

7061
02:59:28.720 --> 02:59:29.553
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7062
02:59:29.640 --> 02:59:31.920
<v Speaker 4>that was my sister who went through or my mom.</v>

7063
02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:34.530
<v Speaker 4>That's another reason too where I'll try to put myself in the place.</v>

7064
02:59:34.531 --> 02:59:35.161
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty good at.</v>

7065
02:59:35.161 --> 02:59:35.820
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

7066
02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:36.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean you've seen me tell stories.</v>

7067
02:59:36.871 --> 02:59:37.704
<v Speaker 4>I got worked up,</v>

7068
02:59:37.770 --> 02:59:37.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

7069
02:59:37.980 --> 02:59:40.020
<v Speaker 4>I could put myself in a place I was or you know,</v>

7070
02:59:40.021 --> 02:59:41.130
<v Speaker 4>imagine something pretty,</v>

7071
02:59:41.190 --> 02:59:42.023
<v Speaker 4>pretty good.</v>

7072
02:59:42.660 --> 02:59:43.560
<v Speaker 4>And so it's like,</v>

7073
02:59:43.770 --> 02:59:44.190
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

7074
02:59:44.190 --> 02:59:45.001
<v Speaker 4>if it was your sister,</v>

7075
02:59:45.001 --> 02:59:45.451
<v Speaker 4>your mom,</v>

7076
02:59:45.451 --> 02:59:46.081
<v Speaker 4>your girlfriend,</v>

7077
02:59:46.081 --> 02:59:46.740
<v Speaker 4>your wife,</v>

7078
02:59:46.740 --> 02:59:47.460
<v Speaker 4>daughter.</v>

7079
02:59:47.460 --> 02:59:48.100
<v Speaker 4>Going through it,</v>

7080
02:59:48.100 --> 02:59:48.421
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>

7081
02:59:48.421 --> 02:59:49.560
<v Speaker 4>I'll fucking kill that guy.</v>

7082
02:59:49.561 --> 02:59:49.861
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

7083
02:59:49.861 --> 02:59:50.161
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

7084
02:59:50.161 --> 02:59:50.994
<v Speaker 4>you're so mad.</v>

7085
02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:53.700
<v Speaker 4>But then the same thing when I hear about like,</v>

7086
02:59:54.360 --> 02:59:57.990
<v Speaker 4>I dunno like Louie and if my sister is like told me that,</v>

7087
02:59:57.991 --> 02:59:58.320
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

7088
02:59:58.320 --> 03:00:00.350
<v Speaker 4>well he did what he often funny</v>

7089
03:00:03.110 --> 03:00:05.400
<v Speaker 4>red pubes how many of them were gray?</v>

7090
03:00:05.730 --> 03:00:06.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7091
03:00:06.090 --> 03:00:06.960
<v Speaker 4>like right.</v>

7092
03:00:07.170 --> 03:00:07.291
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7093
03:00:07.291 --> 03:00:08.640
<v Speaker 4>I try to put in them as a position,</v>

7094
03:00:08.641 --> 03:00:09.181
<v Speaker 4>as best as I can.</v>

7095
03:00:09.181 --> 03:00:10.950
<v Speaker 4>I still don't have to go through it if it's wrong,</v>

7096
03:00:10.951 --> 03:00:13.350
<v Speaker 4>but like there's levels,</v>

7097
03:00:13.530 --> 03:00:14.101
<v Speaker 4>there's level.</v>

7098
03:00:14.101 --> 03:00:15.990
<v Speaker 4>But also it's like getting back to what it's like.</v>

7099
03:00:16.020 --> 03:00:17.850
<v Speaker 4>You really hear about little stuff now and you're like,</v>

7100
03:00:17.851 --> 03:00:18.780
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

7101
03:00:18.810 --> 03:00:19.680
<v Speaker 4>But there's also,</v>

7102
03:00:20.010 --> 03:00:21.540
<v Speaker 4>in terms of someone like Louie,</v>

7103
03:00:21.570 --> 03:00:23.550
<v Speaker 4>there's gotta be a road to redemption.</v>

7104
03:00:23.580 --> 03:00:27.420
<v Speaker 4>And this is one of the problems with people that are so fucking angry is that</v>

7105
03:00:27.421 --> 03:00:29.370
<v Speaker 4>they don't think there's any road to redemption.</v>

7106
03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:32.460
<v Speaker 4>They want career to be taken away and never play again.</v>

7107
03:00:32.640 --> 03:00:34.440
<v Speaker 4>But the Michael Vick thing is different.</v>

7108
03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:36.690
<v Speaker 4>Cause Michael Vick tortured and murdered,</v>

7109
03:00:37.200 --> 03:00:38.300
<v Speaker 4>he didn't murder murder,</v>

7110
03:00:38.680 --> 03:00:38.880
<v Speaker 4>murder.</v>

7111
03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:43.880
<v Speaker 4>But he also went to jail at the time that the state said you would need to do</v>

7112
03:00:44.281 --> 03:00:45.180
<v Speaker 4>this for what he did,</v>

7113
03:00:45.181 --> 03:00:46.170
<v Speaker 4>he'd served his time.</v>

7114
03:00:46.171 --> 03:00:48.150
<v Speaker 4>He lost his freedom for four years.</v>

7115
03:00:48.151 --> 03:00:48.984
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

7116
03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:49.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7117
03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:52.410
<v Speaker 4>so his job that he had before has nothing to do with it,</v>

7118
03:00:52.411 --> 03:00:54.690
<v Speaker 4>but it does come down to people going,</v>

7119
03:00:55.080 --> 03:00:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

7120
03:00:55.540 --> 03:00:57.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm not through with you suffering yet.</v>

7121
03:00:58.110 --> 03:00:58.530
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

7122
03:00:58.530 --> 03:00:59.320
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with Louis.</v>

7123
03:00:59.320 --> 03:01:00.420
<v Speaker 4>Still think it's a different,</v>

7124
03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:01.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm not through with you suffered,</v>

7125
03:01:01.510 --> 03:01:04.600
<v Speaker 4>you represent killing about two women torturing versus different.</v>

7126
03:01:04.601 --> 03:01:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Do you represent evil to women?</v>

7127
03:01:05.861 --> 03:01:06.670
<v Speaker 4>Just cause he beat off.</v>

7128
03:01:06.670 --> 03:01:08.050
<v Speaker 4>He's a representative of that.</v>

7129
03:01:08.770 --> 03:01:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Of course you're just a creeper but like not even that I don't think but like</v>

7130
03:01:12.580 --> 03:01:14.920

7153
03:01:34.721 --> 03:01:35.650
<v Speaker 4>I know all about them.</v>

7154
03:01:35.651 --> 03:01:36.550
<v Speaker 4>Up to my hotel room.</v>

7155
03:01:36.790 --> 03:01:39.060
<v Speaker 4>That's usually pretty universal sign and they're coming there.</v>

7156
03:01:39.061 --> 03:01:40.000
<v Speaker 4>Came to my hotel room.</v>

7157
03:01:40.150 --> 03:01:40.451
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

7158
03:01:40.451 --> 03:01:41.081
<v Speaker 4>that's not enough.</v>

7159
03:01:41.081 --> 03:01:41.441
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

7160
03:01:41.441 --> 03:01:41.771
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

7161
03:01:41.771 --> 03:01:42.041
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

7162
03:01:42.041 --> 03:01:43.930
<v Speaker 4>All these signs is not enough to tell you what,</v>

7163
03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I'll just ask outright,</v>

7164
03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:46.630
<v Speaker 4>can I fucking jerk off in front of you?</v>

7165
03:01:46.690 --> 03:01:47.141
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>

7166
03:01:47.141 --> 03:01:47.974
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

7167
03:01:48.340 --> 03:01:48.701
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

7168
03:01:48.701 --> 03:01:49.900
<v Speaker 4>that's still not enough.</v>

7169
03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:51.700
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about?</v>

7170
03:01:52.750 --> 03:01:52.901
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

7171
03:01:52.901 --> 03:01:53.321
<v Speaker 4>here's the,</v>

7172
03:01:53.321 --> 03:01:53.771
<v Speaker 4>so no,</v>

7173
03:01:53.771 --> 03:01:54.610
<v Speaker 4>not creeper,</v>

7174
03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:56.500
<v Speaker 4>but he represents things to people.</v>

7175
03:01:56.710 --> 03:02:00.520
<v Speaker 4>Just like Roseanne represented Trump when she said she has a character of voted</v>

7176
03:02:00.521 --> 03:02:01.900
<v Speaker 4>for Trump and Nixon the show.</v>

7177
03:02:02.290 --> 03:02:04.600
<v Speaker 4>So because the representative evil gets women,</v>

7178
03:02:04.601 --> 03:02:05.170
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

7179
03:02:05.170 --> 03:02:09.670
<v Speaker 4>just get rid of that representative and they're not seeing them as a human being</v>

7180
03:02:09.671 --> 03:02:13.270
<v Speaker 4>that people actually know that is a human as a person.</v>

7181
03:02:13.570 --> 03:02:14.403
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

7182
03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:16.270
<v Speaker 4>if someone says yes,</v>

7183
03:02:16.900 --> 03:02:17.860
<v Speaker 4>if you ask,</v>

7184
03:02:17.861 --> 03:02:19.090
<v Speaker 4>can I beat off in front of you?</v>

7185
03:02:19.091 --> 03:02:20.820
<v Speaker 4>And they say yes and then never side.</v>

7186
03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:20.961
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

7187
03:02:20.961 --> 03:02:21.041
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

7188
03:02:21.041 --> 03:02:21.571
<v Speaker 4>I was just kidding.</v>

7189
03:02:21.571 --> 03:02:22.260
<v Speaker 4>Just kidding.</v>

7190
03:02:22.260 --> 03:02:23.380
<v Speaker 4>Does leave the yes out there.</v>

7191
03:02:24.790 --> 03:02:25.330
<v Speaker 4>We're done here.</v>

7192
03:02:25.330 --> 03:02:25.990
<v Speaker 4>We're done.</v>

7193
03:02:25.990 --> 03:02:26.411

03:02:26.411 --> 03:02:27.240
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:28.930
<v Speaker 4>So like if a girl says,</v>

03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:55.990
<v Speaker 4>I took until you show me the connection to what he did versus this job.</v>

7269
03:03:56.230 --> 03:03:56.800
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

7270
03:03:56.800 --> 03:03:58.460
<v Speaker 4>If you Pete rose bed on baseball,</v>

7272
03:04:01.821 --> 03:04:04.550
<v Speaker 4>you can't be in baseball anymore cause you fucked over baseball.</v>

7273
03:04:05.570 --> 03:04:07.580
<v Speaker 4>But did he fuck over baseball by betting on it?</v>

7274
03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:08.601
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7275
03:04:08.601 --> 03:04:08.760

03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:13.160
<v Speaker 4>they show he liked probably through some games or he like use his relievers in</v>

7277
03:04:13.161 --> 03:04:13.590
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>

7278
03:04:13.590 --> 03:04:14.391
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't have that.</v>

7279
03:04:14.391 --> 03:04:17.310
<v Speaker 4>He can't use them tomorrow because you fucked over baseball that fuck.</v>

7280
03:04:17.390 --> 03:04:22.310
<v Speaker 4>So you basically shut its doors to you if you steal jokes.</v>

7281
03:04:22.580 --> 03:04:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

7282
03:04:23.350 --> 03:04:26.150
<v Speaker 4>You maybe there is a path to redemption maybe,</v>

7283
03:04:26.210 --> 03:04:27.620
<v Speaker 4>but you fucked over jokes.</v>

7284
03:04:27.890 --> 03:04:31.130
<v Speaker 4>Well you fucked over other comments so you fucked over the experience.</v>

7285
03:04:31.131 --> 03:04:32.360
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about getting back into it.</v>

7286
03:04:32.390 --> 03:04:34.700
<v Speaker 4>But that guy can go to the supermarket.</v>

7287
03:04:34.850 --> 03:04:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

7288
03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:37.970
<v Speaker 4>he can work at another job because that has nothing.</v>

7289
03:04:37.980 --> 03:04:40.310
<v Speaker 4>You haven't shown me a connection to another job.</v>

7290
03:04:40.550 --> 03:04:43.040
<v Speaker 4>See the thing about the jokes dealing thing,</v>

7291
03:04:43.100 --> 03:04:44.540
<v Speaker 4>and this is where it gets really,</v>

7292
03:04:44.600 --> 03:04:45.440
<v Speaker 4>really weird,</v>

7293
03:04:45.740 --> 03:04:50.740
<v Speaker 4>is there's no real punishment other than people deciding they don't like you</v>

7294
03:04:50.991 --> 03:04:53.510
<v Speaker 4>because you're a joke thief and that is the real punishment.</v>

7295
03:04:53.570 --> 03:04:54.830
<v Speaker 4>Like you're talking like a Twitter take you down.</v>

7296
03:04:54.831 --> 03:04:55.041
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

7297
03:04:55.041 --> 03:04:55.191
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

7298
03:04:55.191 --> 03:04:55.281
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

7299
03:04:55.281 --> 03:04:55.401
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

7300
03:04:55.401 --> 03:04:57.740
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is it's different than someone who steals cars,</v>

7301
03:04:57.770 --> 03:04:58.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

7302
03:04:58.220 --> 03:04:59.250
<v Speaker 4>Someone steals cars.</v>

7303
03:04:59.251 --> 03:04:59.990
<v Speaker 4>The punishment setup.</v>

7304
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.171
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7305
03:05:00.171 --> 03:05:00.801
<v Speaker 4>you go to jail.</v>

7306
03:05:00.801 --> 03:05:01.380
<v Speaker 4>It's illegal.</v>

7307
03:05:01.380 --> 03:05:04.520
<v Speaker 4>If someone steals jokes like you basically done the same thing,</v>

7308
03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:07.590
<v Speaker 4>you've stolen a thing and you know that thing is a,</v>

7309
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:08.743
<v Speaker 4>the thing is,</v>

7310
03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:09.080
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

7311
03:05:09.080 --> 03:05:12.050
<v Speaker 4>you also a little different because you can still do your jokes.</v>

7312
03:05:12.620 --> 03:05:13.041
<v Speaker 4>If I stay there,</v>

7313
03:05:13.041 --> 03:05:13.371
<v Speaker 4>a car,</v>

7314
03:05:13.371 --> 03:05:14.710
<v Speaker 4>you can't have her caught on the one on.</v>

7315
03:05:14.730 --> 03:05:18.170
<v Speaker 4>If somebody goes on in front of you like we know him and see it did and does</v>

7316
03:05:18.171 --> 03:05:18.860
<v Speaker 4>your headline.</v>

7317
03:05:18.860 --> 03:05:21.470
<v Speaker 4>Europe is closing bit on purpose,</v>

7318
03:05:21.471 --> 03:05:23.090
<v Speaker 4>on purpose to fuck with you.</v>

7319
03:05:23.360 --> 03:05:25.310
<v Speaker 4>He would do closing bits.</v>

7320
03:05:25.400 --> 03:05:29.030
<v Speaker 4>That was Freddie fucking with Bobby once and he was like,</v>

7321
03:05:29.090 --> 03:05:29.271
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

7322
03:05:29.271 --> 03:05:29.900
<v Speaker 4>you're going to love it.</v>

7323
03:05:29.900 --> 03:05:31.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean he would fuck with Bobby populate,</v>

7324
03:05:32.210 --> 03:05:33.043
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't.</v>

7325
03:05:33.060 --> 03:05:33.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7326
03:05:33.770 --> 03:05:34.800
<v Speaker 4>it was to fuck with Bobby.</v>

7327
03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:35.590
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

7328
03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:36.800
<v Speaker 4>you've got to love this nice guy.</v>

7329
03:05:36.801 --> 03:05:38.180
<v Speaker 4>He's so funny and Bobby,</v>

7330
03:05:38.181 --> 03:05:39.710
<v Speaker 4>all the wanted was Freddy support.</v>

7331
03:05:40.010 --> 03:05:42.530
<v Speaker 4>He looked up to him so hard and he could never get it.</v>

7332
03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:44.120
<v Speaker 4>You're going to love this next guy.</v>

7333
03:05:44.121 --> 03:05:46.580
<v Speaker 4>Does this joke about selling corn on the side of the road and he's like,</v>

7334
03:05:46.581 --> 03:05:49.460
<v Speaker 4>y'all and Coney corn corner yells so good.</v>

7335
03:05:49.461 --> 03:05:51.050
<v Speaker 4>He has this other bit about,</v>

7336
03:05:51.230 --> 03:05:52.730
<v Speaker 4>about his Dallas bits.</v>

7337
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:53.623
<v Speaker 4>He would just tell the,</v>

7338
03:05:53.730 --> 03:05:58.160
<v Speaker 4>the ending punchlines that this bit to pull his legs out from under him.</v>

7339
03:05:58.560 --> 03:05:59.393
<v Speaker 4>That's a terrible thing.</v>

7340
03:05:59.920 --> 03:06:00.830
<v Speaker 4>He was fucking with him,</v>

7341
03:06:00.980 --> 03:06:02.810
<v Speaker 4>but he wasn't doing to gain himself.</v>

7342
03:06:02.840 --> 03:06:05.560
<v Speaker 4>Only to hurt Bobby and only in one moment that I ever saw,</v>

7343
03:06:05.580 --> 03:06:06.413
<v Speaker 4>but it was like,</v>

7344
03:06:06.530 --> 03:06:08.960
<v Speaker 4>fuck you got me bad.</v>

7345
03:06:10.850 --> 03:06:11.683
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7346
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:13.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean they were bitter enemies.</v>

7347
03:06:13.280 --> 03:06:15.830
<v Speaker 4>It was like something about routing,</v>

7348
03:06:16.970 --> 03:06:21.310
<v Speaker 4>routing them out to somebody a long time before those arguments.</v>

7349
03:06:21.330 --> 03:06:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Waco,</v>

7350
03:06:22.010 --> 03:06:22.550
<v Speaker 4>it's done.</v>

7351
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:24.920
<v Speaker 4>But like they hated each other back then.</v>

7352
03:06:25.730 --> 03:06:26.810
<v Speaker 4>Freddie hated Bobby.</v>

7353
03:06:26.811 --> 03:06:27.360
<v Speaker 4>Bobby.</v>

7354
03:06:27.360 --> 03:06:30.890
<v Speaker 4>They hated them back only because the thing about people getting caught,</v>

7355
03:06:31.010 --> 03:06:33.500
<v Speaker 4>it's like the punishments real though.</v>

7356
03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:36.320
<v Speaker 4>It's almost better than going to jail like we don't.</v>

7357
03:06:36.520 --> 03:06:37.610
<v Speaker 4>We know about you now.</v>

7358
03:06:37.640 --> 03:06:39.230
<v Speaker 4>Not only do we know about you now,</v>

7359
03:06:39.231 --> 03:06:43.250
<v Speaker 4>but the public knows about you now and the disdain is palpable.</v>

7360
03:06:43.520 --> 03:06:44.241
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>

7361
03:06:44.241 --> 03:06:45.740
<v Speaker 4>And you see it not just with him,</v>

7362
03:06:45.741 --> 03:06:46.270
<v Speaker 4>not just hope.</v>

7363
03:06:46.270 --> 03:06:46.701
<v Speaker 4>You can see it,</v>

7364
03:06:46.701 --> 03:06:47.990
<v Speaker 4>but here's a few of them.</v>

7365
03:06:48.080 --> 03:06:50.720
<v Speaker 4>And you can tell a difference too between somebody going back,</v>

7366
03:06:50.721 --> 03:06:54.440
<v Speaker 4>I took that guys joke versus that guy takes jokes.</v>

7367
03:06:55.050 --> 03:06:55.500
<v Speaker 4>Know what I mean?</v>

7368
03:06:55.500 --> 03:06:55.861
<v Speaker 4>The back.</v>

7369
03:06:55.861 --> 03:06:56.070
<v Speaker 4>I took</v>

7370
03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:57.570
<v Speaker 2>that guy that's out there and that's real.</v>

7371
03:06:57.600 --> 03:06:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7372
03:06:58.020 --> 03:07:02.520
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't quite stick as much as like we all just know that guy steals</v>

7373
03:07:02.521 --> 03:07:02.911
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>

7374
03:07:02.911 --> 03:07:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7375
03:07:03.530 --> 03:07:04.363
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

7376
03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:06.180
<v Speaker 2>not a possible parallel.</v>

7377
03:07:06.181 --> 03:07:07.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like over and over again,</v>

7378
03:07:07.501 --> 03:07:10.560
<v Speaker 2>like such a clarity to in the difference between the jokes,</v>

7379
03:07:10.561 --> 03:07:13.290
<v Speaker 2>they come up with it on their own and the jokes that they steal.</v>

7380
03:07:13.680 --> 03:07:14.520
<v Speaker 2>You can keep going up.</v>

7381
03:07:14.521 --> 03:07:15.780
<v Speaker 2>You can still settle theaters.</v>

7382
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:17.160
<v Speaker 2>So your punishment is,</v>

7383
03:07:17.370 --> 03:07:18.510
<v Speaker 2>we know about you.</v>

7384
03:07:18.990 --> 03:07:19.391
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

7385
03:07:19.391 --> 03:07:20.760
<v Speaker 2>you can't saw theater style.</v>

7386
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:22.590
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens to them eventually.</v>

7387
03:07:22.591 --> 03:07:24.870
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of them still do the name one.</v>

7388
03:07:25.490 --> 03:07:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Dan Cook continue to sell it theater as well.</v>

7389
03:07:27.331 --> 03:07:27.971
<v Speaker 2>He's does it.</v>

7390
03:07:27.971 --> 03:07:31.260
<v Speaker 2>So things dog died off eventually,</v>

7391
03:07:31.261 --> 03:07:32.690
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people die off too.</v>

7392
03:07:33.090 --> 03:07:34.590
<v Speaker 2>But during while it was happening,</v>

7393
03:07:34.620 --> 03:07:35.520
<v Speaker 2>there was no real,</v>

7394
03:07:35.521 --> 03:07:36.690
<v Speaker 2>he was still doing massive numbers.</v>

7395
03:07:36.691 --> 03:07:40.260
<v Speaker 2>Meant CEO's still doing living better than most a level comics.</v>

7396
03:07:40.650 --> 03:07:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Even after all that,</v>

7397
03:07:41.491 --> 03:07:44.730
<v Speaker 2>you mean even right now actually he's still makes more money than,</v>

7398
03:07:44.760 --> 03:07:46.140
<v Speaker 2>than Mike [inaudible] does.</v>

7399
03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:47.401
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

7400
03:07:47.401 --> 03:07:49.410
<v Speaker 2>then really good comments in big j does,</v>

7401
03:07:49.920 --> 03:07:50.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7402
03:07:50.610 --> 03:07:52.470
<v Speaker 2>he probably still makes more money than I do it to be honest.</v>

7403
03:07:53.070 --> 03:07:53.791
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm doing.</v>

7404
03:07:53.791 --> 03:07:55.050
<v Speaker 2>It's greatest I've ever done,</v>

7405
03:07:55.080 --> 03:07:57.930
<v Speaker 2>but like so it's like it doesn't get taken away from you completely.</v>

7406
03:07:58.520 --> 03:08:00.210
<v Speaker 2>You'll never get the respect of your peers.</v>

7407
03:08:00.420 --> 03:08:01.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a big deal with us.</v>

7408
03:08:02.770 --> 03:08:04.980
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're talking about.</v>

7409
03:08:04.981 --> 03:08:06.740
<v Speaker 2>This in the back of the comedy store,</v>

7410
03:08:06.770 --> 03:08:07.900
<v Speaker 2>when he was talking about a bunch of shit,</v>

7411
03:08:07.901 --> 03:08:11.540
<v Speaker 2>he was calling through and splitting up and all this and that.</v>

7412
03:08:11.570 --> 03:08:11.791
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

7413
03:08:11.791 --> 03:08:12.211
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

7414
03:08:12.211 --> 03:08:13.080
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>

7415
03:08:13.081 --> 03:08:14.700
<v Speaker 2>all I give a fuck about,</v>

7416
03:08:14.820 --> 03:08:17.610
<v Speaker 2>do I have the love and respect of my peers?</v>

7417
03:08:17.840 --> 03:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7418
03:08:18.020 --> 03:08:20.920
<v Speaker 2>And those guys don't have it and it fucking drives them crazy and kind of</v>

7419
03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:22.050
<v Speaker 2>punishment.</v>

7420
03:08:22.050 --> 03:08:23.370
<v Speaker 2>You can take jokes and do whatever,</v>

7421
03:08:23.371 --> 03:08:24.204
<v Speaker 2>but like</v>

7422
03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:27.690
<v Speaker 2>we're never going to look up to you and that's what you want.</v>

7423
03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:29.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7424
03:08:29.490 --> 03:08:29.851
<v Speaker 2>And on that,</v>

7425
03:08:29.851 --> 03:08:30.750
<v Speaker 2>nobody hates Larry.</v>

7426
03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Nobody hates Larry.</v>

7427
03:08:33.090 --> 03:08:33.541
<v Speaker 2>They might,</v>

7428
03:08:33.541 --> 03:08:35.160
<v Speaker 2>they might think he's like lame,</v>

7429
03:08:35.161 --> 03:08:36.180
<v Speaker 2>but nobody hates him.</v>

7430
03:08:36.240 --> 03:08:36.931
<v Speaker 2>Larry the cable guy.</v>

7431
03:08:36.931 --> 03:08:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7432
03:08:37.140 --> 03:08:37.800
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy.</v>

7433
03:08:37.800 --> 03:08:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Great Guy.</v>

7434
03:08:38.610 --> 03:08:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I want one more story before I go about this.</v>

7435
03:08:42.221 --> 03:08:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Had really an MMA podcast.</v>

7436
03:08:43.501 --> 03:08:44.334
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of not,</v>

7437
03:08:44.370 --> 03:08:46.590
<v Speaker 2>but it is release it over.</v>

7438
03:08:46.600 --> 03:08:48.930
<v Speaker 2>He was always like that though.</v>

7439
03:08:50.610 --> 03:08:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I did this thing,</v>

7440
03:08:51.600 --> 03:08:56.280
<v Speaker 2>you helped me like organize a little bit or or arrange it in my head where I was</v>

7441
03:08:56.580 --> 03:09:01.580
<v Speaker 2>really stoked on the experience La people have with medical marijuana and I said</v>

7442
03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:05.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not fair that other people don't get to have this experience of taking</v>

7443
03:09:05.491 --> 03:09:07.710
<v Speaker 2>these breast trips at a UFC.</v>

7444
03:09:07.740 --> 03:09:08.670
<v Speaker 2>How great it is.</v>

7445
03:09:08.730 --> 03:09:09.570
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

7446
03:09:10.110 --> 03:09:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have an event called hunt for the edible.</v>

7447
03:09:12.660 --> 03:09:13.493
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

7448
03:09:13.890 --> 03:09:15.900
<v Speaker 2>And I am going to hide marijuana,</v>

7449
03:09:15.901 --> 03:09:17.100
<v Speaker 2>have a scavenger hunt.</v>

7450
03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:19.410
<v Speaker 2>At first I thought like have some clues and they'll come to me.</v>

7451
03:09:19.411 --> 03:09:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it to them.</v>

7452
03:09:19.990 --> 03:09:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Like a cop will do that and come to you.</v>

7453
03:09:21.610 --> 03:09:22.381
<v Speaker 2>You're like the point.</v>

7454
03:09:22.381 --> 03:09:22.711
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

7455
03:09:22.711 --> 03:09:23.544
<v Speaker 2>I gotta hide this.</v>

7456
03:09:25.650 --> 03:09:28.350
<v Speaker 2>So I would hide drugs.</v>

7457
03:09:28.380 --> 03:09:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean drugs but only marijuana.</v>

7458
03:09:30.870 --> 03:09:31.710
<v Speaker 2>A onetime mushrooms.</v>

7459
03:09:31.711 --> 03:09:32.350
<v Speaker 2>But like a,</v>

7460
03:09:32.350 --> 03:09:36.540
<v Speaker 2>at UFC I would have access to it beforehand.</v>

7461
03:09:36.541 --> 03:09:37.650
<v Speaker 2>When we went to the MGM,</v>

7462
03:09:37.710 --> 03:09:38.550
<v Speaker 2>if for the weigh ins,</v>

7463
03:09:38.551 --> 03:09:39.660
<v Speaker 2>half of it was shut down.</v>

7464
03:09:39.661 --> 03:09:42.960
<v Speaker 2>So the other half I could just walk through freely and I would hide.</v>

7465
03:09:42.961 --> 03:09:46.260
<v Speaker 2>I would tape these breaths trips to somewhere.</v>

7466
03:09:46.290 --> 03:09:48.120
<v Speaker 2>The first one's underneath the bathroom,</v>

7467
03:09:48.121 --> 03:09:52.890
<v Speaker 2>sink in a fucking in one of the bathrooms and draw clues on Twitter.</v>

7468
03:09:52.900 --> 03:09:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Released them every five minutes,</v>

7469
03:09:54.220 --> 03:09:55.180
<v Speaker 5>plan it out ahead of time.</v>

7470
03:09:55.330 --> 03:09:56.080
<v Speaker 5>But one was like,</v>

7471
03:09:56.080 --> 03:09:56.850
<v Speaker 5>if you want to get high,</v>

7472
03:09:56.850 --> 03:09:57.611
<v Speaker 5>go up a level.</v>

7473
03:09:57.611 --> 03:09:57.940
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

7474
03:09:57.940 --> 03:09:58.151
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

7475
03:09:58.151 --> 03:09:58.661
<v Speaker 5>People were like,</v>

7476
03:09:58.661 --> 03:09:59.494
<v Speaker 5>run up.</v>

7477
03:09:59.500 --> 03:10:00.580
<v Speaker 5>People got into it,</v>

7478
03:10:00.910 --> 03:10:02.480
<v Speaker 5>they run up levels and then they,</v>

7479
03:10:02.560 --> 03:10:03.281
<v Speaker 5>until this guy was like,</v>

7480
03:10:03.281 --> 03:10:04.180
<v Speaker 5>I think it's right here,</v>

7481
03:10:04.210 --> 03:10:04.881
<v Speaker 5>this bathroom sink.</v>

7482
03:10:04.881 --> 03:10:06.820
<v Speaker 5>Then he looked under it on did it,</v>

7483
03:10:07.450 --> 03:10:09.130
<v Speaker 5>had a note in there with the proper dosage,</v>

7484
03:10:10.250 --> 03:10:10.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

7485
03:10:10.980 --> 03:10:11.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

7486
03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:12.910
<v Speaker 5>I want to fuck anybody over.</v>

7487
03:10:13.600 --> 03:10:14.320
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

7488
03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:15.730
<v Speaker 5>it became such a fun,</v>

7489
03:10:15.731 --> 03:10:16.564
<v Speaker 5>fun time.</v>

7490
03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:20.080
<v Speaker 5>I got to assume the powers that be knew about it and said nothing.</v>

7491
03:10:20.110 --> 03:10:21.220
<v Speaker 5>Is it plausible that I ability,</v>

7492
03:10:21.221 --> 03:10:21.581
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

7493
03:10:21.581 --> 03:10:22.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>

7494
03:10:22.330 --> 03:10:23.440
<v Speaker 5>Did I promote it?</v>

7495
03:10:23.920 --> 03:10:24.753
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

7496
03:10:24.820 --> 03:10:26.530
<v Speaker 5>I tell people and I don't think so.</v>

7497
03:10:26.670 --> 03:10:26.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7498
03:10:26.920 --> 03:10:27.521
<v Speaker 5>So how did they,</v>

7499
03:10:27.521 --> 03:10:28.660
<v Speaker 5>how do you think they knew about it?</v>

7500
03:10:28.690 --> 03:10:29.021
<v Speaker 5>Twitter,</v>

7501
03:10:29.021 --> 03:10:31.540
<v Speaker 5>I might've mentioned it on the podcast or something,</v>

7502
03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:32.433
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

7503
03:10:32.470 --> 03:10:34.030
<v Speaker 5>it was so fun for me.</v>

7504
03:10:34.690 --> 03:10:35.290
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

7505
03:10:35.290 --> 03:10:37.540
<v Speaker 5>and I would do it over and over again and then I would go back.</v>

7506
03:10:37.541 --> 03:10:39.040
<v Speaker 5>I remember looking times where I would go,</v>

7507
03:10:39.220 --> 03:10:40.090
<v Speaker 5>I would tape it to like a,</v>

7508
03:10:40.091 --> 03:10:41.350
<v Speaker 5>a pillar somewhere.</v>

7509
03:10:41.351 --> 03:10:44.130
<v Speaker 5>I like the Pearl and I would go to see if it's found under his feet.</v>

7510
03:10:44.290 --> 03:10:46.810
<v Speaker 5>Usher go like as I was looking at,</v>

7511
03:10:46.811 --> 03:10:47.231
<v Speaker 5>he didn't know.</v>

7512
03:10:47.231 --> 03:10:48.280
<v Speaker 5>I was wondering who hit it,</v>

7513
03:10:48.281 --> 03:10:48.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

7514
03:10:48.790 --> 03:10:48.971
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

7515
03:10:48.971 --> 03:10:49.720
<v Speaker 5>he would just go,</v>

7516
03:10:49.720 --> 03:10:53.830
<v Speaker 5>what's you're looking for is no longer here because I guess a bunch of people</v>

7517
03:10:53.831 --> 03:10:55.990
<v Speaker 5>kept coming to this pillar and they would follow the clues.</v>

7518
03:10:55.991 --> 03:10:57.520
<v Speaker 5>No one said it.</v>

7519
03:10:57.530 --> 03:11:00.490
<v Speaker 5>Someone once said it's found now cut the game later.</v>

7520
03:11:00.491 --> 03:11:01.870
<v Speaker 5>I would go in and delete all the clues.</v>

7521
03:11:01.871 --> 03:11:04.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm not looking to fuck over the cops or anything like that,</v>

7522
03:11:04.570 --> 03:11:07.210
<v Speaker 5>but it was so fun.</v>

7523
03:11:07.360 --> 03:11:09.160
<v Speaker 5>One time nobody found one.</v>

7524
03:11:09.250 --> 03:11:10.480
<v Speaker 5>I was always living like still here.</v>

7525
03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:12.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking taken it off using it myself.</v>

7526
03:11:13.570 --> 03:11:17.250
<v Speaker 5>But it usually had high two of them underneath the fucking fire extinguisher,</v>

7527
03:11:17.440 --> 03:11:18.273
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

7528
03:11:18.670 --> 03:11:19.630
<v Speaker 5>Now one time,</v>

7529
03:11:20.150 --> 03:11:20.983
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

7530
03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:26.710
<v Speaker 5>somebody found it and then came down and sat like right behind me and Shandra</v>

7531
03:11:27.490 --> 03:11:27.971
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

03:11:27.971 --> 03:11:28.780

03:11:29.141 --> 03:11:32.650
<v Speaker 5>these usher slash security guards came and found the guy and said,</v>

03:12:33.520 --> 03:12:34.450
<v Speaker 5>It really was fun.</v>

7582
03:12:34.451 --> 03:12:36.730
<v Speaker 5>It was one of my favorite memories of this UFC one.</v>

7583
03:12:36.731 --> 03:12:37.810
<v Speaker 5>If you could do that again,</v>

7584
03:12:37.811 --> 03:12:39.220
<v Speaker 5>now that it's totally legal.</v>

7585
03:12:40.030 --> 03:12:40.211
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

7586
03:12:40.211 --> 03:12:41.021
<v Speaker 5>maybe you're right.</v>

7587
03:12:41.021 --> 03:12:42.370
<v Speaker 5>California and Nevada,</v>

7588
03:12:42.400 --> 03:12:44.560
<v Speaker 5>they're both legally legal,</v>

7589
03:12:44.620 --> 03:12:45.011
<v Speaker 5>legal,</v>

7590
03:12:45.011 --> 03:12:45.844
<v Speaker 5>legal,</v>

7591
03:12:45.930 --> 03:12:46.810

03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:47.261
<v Speaker 5>legal,</v>

7593
03:12:47.261 --> 03:12:47.800
<v Speaker 5>legal.</v>

7594
03:12:47.800 --> 03:12:48.400
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

7595
03:12:48.400 --> 03:12:49.510
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of states now,</v>

7596
03:12:49.900 --> 03:12:50.261
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

7597
03:12:50.261 --> 03:12:51.920
<v Speaker 5>and now all of Canada,</v>

7598
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:53.023
<v Speaker 2>all of candidates,</v>

7599
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:56.120
<v Speaker 2>October 17th Canada fucking went whole hog.</v>

7600
03:12:56.180 --> 03:12:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Now what if it could do it again?</v>

7601
03:12:57.740 --> 03:12:59.300
<v Speaker 2>Canada salute you.</v>

7602
03:12:59.301 --> 03:13:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Bad mother fuckers.</v>

7603
03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Finally constellations.</v>

7604
03:13:02.960 --> 03:13:04.490
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful thing they did.</v>

7605
03:13:04.520 --> 03:13:07.850
<v Speaker 2>They made it legal ash nationwide hour before the first guy got pulled over for</v>

7606
03:13:07.851 --> 03:13:08.750
<v Speaker 2>smoking weed in this car.</v>

7607
03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Probably right now.</v>

7608
03:13:12.090 --> 03:13:12.711
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

7609
03:13:12.711 --> 03:13:14.240
<v Speaker 2>It was an hour after it was fully legalize.</v>

7610
03:13:14.250 --> 03:13:16.160
<v Speaker 2>The guy busted for smoking weed in the car.</v>

7611
03:13:16.180 --> 03:13:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

7612
03:13:16.800 --> 03:13:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Well we before you get in the car,</v>

7613
03:13:18.081 --> 03:13:19.190
<v Speaker 2>you idiot on stupid.</v>

7614
03:13:19.790 --> 03:13:20.623
<v Speaker 2>Don't be ridiculous.</v>

7615
03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:21.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7616
03:13:21.291 --> 03:13:24.170
<v Speaker 2>but that was when my favorite memories of UFC is having that thing.</v>

7617
03:13:24.260 --> 03:13:27.950
<v Speaker 2>We had some good God damn times and it was funny that it took me a long time to</v>

7618
03:13:27.951 --> 03:13:30.620
<v Speaker 2>figure out that I could combine the UFC and comedy.</v>

7619
03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:30.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7620
03:13:30.861 --> 03:13:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I remember you taking this with us a few times and then I was like,</v>

7621
03:13:33.321 --> 03:13:33.471
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

7622
03:13:33.471 --> 03:13:35.090
<v Speaker 2>why are we doing nothing on Friday nights?</v>

7623
03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:35.600
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

7624
03:13:35.600 --> 03:13:35.931
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

7625
03:13:35.931 --> 03:13:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't schedule a show.</v>

7626
03:13:37.371 --> 03:13:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Can you schedule a show?</v>

7627
03:13:38.510 --> 03:13:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7628
03:13:39.020 --> 03:13:40.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're going to do guest spot somewhere.</v>

7629
03:13:40.490 --> 03:13:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7630
03:13:40.910 --> 03:13:42.140
<v Speaker 2>let's just make a couple of bucks.</v>

7631
03:13:42.170 --> 03:13:42.620
<v Speaker 2>What did we,</v>

7632
03:13:42.620 --> 03:13:43.820
<v Speaker 2>how did we start doing it?</v>

7633
03:13:43.970 --> 03:13:44.803
<v Speaker 2>I think we would,</v>

7634
03:13:45.050 --> 03:13:49.220
<v Speaker 2>I think honestly when we did like the Pearl or something court Macau and we'd be</v>

7635
03:13:49.221 --> 03:13:49.431
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

7636
03:13:49.431 --> 03:13:49.731
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

7637
03:13:49.731 --> 03:13:51.230
<v Speaker 2>if you want to come in and do a set,</v>

7638
03:13:51.231 --> 03:13:52.064
<v Speaker 2>you can like,</v>

7639
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:53.030
<v Speaker 2>like dom Irrera.</v>

7640
03:13:54.010 --> 03:13:54.350
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

7641
03:13:54.350 --> 03:13:54.940
<v Speaker 2>he'll come to a site.</v>

7642
03:13:54.940 --> 03:13:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I remember smoking cigars with me,</v>

7643
03:13:56.211 --> 03:13:56.451
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

7644
03:13:56.451 --> 03:13:57.320
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

7645
03:13:57.500 --> 03:13:58.251
<v Speaker 2>Kevin James,</v>

7646
03:13:58.251 --> 03:13:59.630
<v Speaker 2>and just like the common bar.</v>

7647
03:14:00.470 --> 03:14:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I hated those clubs,</v>

7648
03:14:01.461 --> 03:14:04.110
<v Speaker 2>but there's common bars were the best and we were,</v>

7649
03:14:04.240 --> 03:14:05.470
<v Speaker 2>we could sneak around back then</v>

7650
03:14:07.130 --> 03:14:08.120
<v Speaker 2>we didn't get mobbed.</v>

7651
03:14:09.020 --> 03:14:10.250
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually it was like,</v>

7652
03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:10.401
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

7653
03:14:10.401 --> 03:14:12.200
<v Speaker 2>instead of just doing an occasional guest spots,</v>

7654
03:14:12.230 --> 03:14:13.160
<v Speaker 2>why don't we do clubs?</v>

7655
03:14:13.161 --> 03:14:14.210
<v Speaker 2>And the clubs would get full.</v>

7656
03:14:14.210 --> 03:14:17.680
<v Speaker 2>I remember guide toward doing something maybe in Omaha and it was like,</v>

7657
03:14:17.681 --> 03:14:17.771
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

7658
03:14:17.771 --> 03:14:19.130
<v Speaker 2>how about a midnight Friday show?</v>

7659
03:14:19.190 --> 03:14:19.821
<v Speaker 2>Can we do that?</v>

7660
03:14:19.821 --> 03:14:21.020
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to bump anybody.</v>

7661
03:14:21.050 --> 03:14:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7662
03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:23.690
<v Speaker 2>But then you would schedule it months and months out.</v>

7663
03:14:23.691 --> 03:14:24.800
<v Speaker 2>So nobody was scheduled.</v>

7664
03:14:25.610 --> 03:14:26.460
<v Speaker 2>And then theaters,</v>

7665
03:14:26.461 --> 03:14:27.620
<v Speaker 2>it was just one night anyway.</v>

7666
03:14:28.250 --> 03:14:29.083
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7667
03:14:29.420 --> 03:14:30.500
<v Speaker 2>and it was just became like,</v>

7668
03:14:30.501 --> 03:14:33.500
<v Speaker 2>we're not wasting time doing these fun UFC stuff.</v>

7669
03:14:33.501 --> 03:14:34.730
<v Speaker 2>We're actually working.</v>

7670
03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:36.080
<v Speaker 2>If you ever want to do those again,</v>

7671
03:14:36.081 --> 03:14:36.560
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

7672
03:14:36.560 --> 03:14:37.400
<v Speaker 2>we could do some.</v>

7673
03:14:37.490 --> 03:14:39.580
<v Speaker 2>It became harder as I started headlining to be like,</v>

7674
03:14:39.730 --> 03:14:40.940
<v Speaker 2>I got to give up time</v>

7675
03:14:42.440 --> 03:14:43.490
<v Speaker 2>to go do that.</v>

7676
03:14:43.820 --> 03:14:45.260
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time it was a,</v>

7680
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:51.200

7681
03:14:51.201 --> 03:14:52.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's important to you.</v>

7725
03:15:46.790 --> 03:15:50.160
<v Speaker 2>we've had some fucking fun man last</v>

7726
03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:51.830
<v Speaker 4>and when I talked to people about the road,</v>

7727
03:15:51.831 --> 03:15:52.380
<v Speaker 4>the gall,</v>

7728
03:15:52.380 --> 03:15:53.550
<v Speaker 4>the road is lonely.</v>

7729
03:15:53.551 --> 03:15:53.950
<v Speaker 4>The roads.</v>

7730
03:15:53.950 --> 03:15:54.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

7731
03:15:54.570 --> 03:15:55.650
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it wrong.</v>

7732
03:15:55.910 --> 03:15:57.540
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to do with your best friends.</v>

7733
03:15:57.630 --> 03:15:58.890
<v Speaker 4>Do some fun shit with it.</v>

7734
03:15:58.891 --> 03:16:02.010
<v Speaker 4>I try to stay later on Sunday and go hiking if it's like,</v>

7735
03:16:02.011 --> 03:16:02.460
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

7736
03:16:02.460 --> 03:16:04.200
<v Speaker 4>if it's cold in New York and I'm an Austin,</v>

7737
03:16:04.201 --> 03:16:06.930
<v Speaker 4>fucking stay in the warmth a little bit and do something fun.</v>

7738
03:16:06.960 --> 03:16:07.710
<v Speaker 4>That's a good move,</v>

7739
03:16:07.710 --> 03:16:08.041
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

7740
03:16:08.041 --> 03:16:08.341
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

7741
03:16:08.341 --> 03:16:10.860
<v Speaker 4>but you and your friends is the number one way to turn that thing,</v>

7742
03:16:10.861 --> 03:16:11.490
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

7743
03:16:11.490 --> 03:16:11.671
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

7744
03:16:11.671 --> 03:16:12.570
<v Speaker 4>the entourage thing,</v>

7745
03:16:12.571 --> 03:16:13.231
<v Speaker 4>when we did that,</v>

7746
03:16:13.231 --> 03:16:13.930
<v Speaker 4>it was too big.</v>

7747
03:16:13.930 --> 03:16:14.960
<v Speaker 4>It's too much trouble.</v>

7748
03:16:15.030 --> 03:16:15.870
<v Speaker 4>It's too much work.</v>

7749
03:16:15.960 --> 03:16:17.880
<v Speaker 4>It's too hard to organize and get everybody together.</v>

7750
03:16:17.910 --> 03:16:19.500
<v Speaker 4>And it was too much pressure on me.</v>

7751
03:16:19.950 --> 03:16:20.191
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

7752
03:16:20.191 --> 03:16:20.941
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to deal with this.</v>

7753
03:16:20.941 --> 03:16:23.610
<v Speaker 4>I just want you gotta be an administrator too with all those people.</v>

7754
03:16:24.120 --> 03:16:26.430
<v Speaker 4>Two openers or two acts with me.</v>

7755
03:16:26.431 --> 03:16:27.264
<v Speaker 4>It's too much work.</v>

7756
03:16:27.270 --> 03:16:28.680
<v Speaker 4>One person is fine.</v>

7757
03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:32.240
<v Speaker 4>The only reason you brought a second opener because the one open,</v>

7758
03:16:32.250 --> 03:16:33.800
<v Speaker 4>it was so irresponsible.</v>

7759
03:16:33.820 --> 03:16:35.160
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't trust that he'd be there.</v>

7760
03:16:35.310 --> 03:16:39.300
<v Speaker 4>But he was so brilliant that I refused to not hire him whenever I could work</v>

7761
03:16:39.301 --> 03:16:39.440
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

7762
03:16:39.440 --> 03:16:41.730
<v Speaker 4>The obvious answer is get someone else.</v>

7763
03:16:42.210 --> 03:16:42.721
<v Speaker 4>But you were like,</v>

7764
03:16:42.721 --> 03:16:43.320
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

7765
03:16:43.320 --> 03:16:44.760
<v Speaker 4>I'll get a buffer in case.</v>

7766
03:16:45.300 --> 03:16:45.571
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

7767
03:16:45.571 --> 03:16:48.870
<v Speaker 4>my feeling on Diaz Zoe's like I have a special,</v>

7768
03:16:48.871 --> 03:16:51.400
<v Speaker 4>I've always had a special place in my heart for him because I,</v>

7769
03:16:51.420 --> 03:16:55.540
<v Speaker 4>he reminded me so much at my friend Johnny Johnny be from New York who taught at</v>

7770
03:16:55.541 --> 03:16:56.340
<v Speaker 4>the pool player.</v>

7771
03:16:56.340 --> 03:16:56.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7772
03:16:56.820 --> 03:16:58.830
<v Speaker 4>And like I knew what Joey was,</v>

7773
03:16:58.831 --> 03:17:02.190
<v Speaker 4>he's just brilliant guy who had a really hard time with reality,</v>

7774
03:17:02.460 --> 03:17:02.781
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

7775
03:17:02.781 --> 03:17:03.420
<v Speaker 4>with re,</v>

7776
03:17:03.420 --> 03:17:04.080
<v Speaker 4>with life,</v>

7777
03:17:04.080 --> 03:17:05.160
<v Speaker 4>with civilization.</v>

7778
03:17:05.161 --> 03:17:05.820
<v Speaker 4>He was just,</v>

7779
03:17:05.820 --> 03:17:08.550
<v Speaker 4>but in those moments of brilliance,</v>

7780
03:17:08.700 --> 03:17:10.020
<v Speaker 4>he was worth everything to me.</v>

7781
03:17:10.260 --> 03:17:10.861
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

7782
03:17:10.861 --> 03:17:11.580
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

7783
03:17:11.580 --> 03:17:16.200
<v Speaker 4>what I'm going to try to do with this guy is I'm going to try to somehow or</v>

7784
03:17:16.201 --> 03:17:17.010
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

7785
03:17:17.010 --> 03:17:18.210
<v Speaker 4>because I had,</v>

7786
03:17:19.140 --> 03:17:20.520
<v Speaker 4>I was in main stream,</v>

7787
03:17:20.880 --> 03:17:22.380
<v Speaker 4>I had a television show,</v>

7788
03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:25.440
<v Speaker 4>pull them in clubs that I could headline.</v>

7789
03:17:25.620 --> 03:17:25.981
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

7790
03:17:25.981 --> 03:17:29.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to bring this guy into the world and I'm going to show them how I do</v>

7791
03:17:29.851 --> 03:17:32.310
<v Speaker 4>it and I'm going to like indoctrinate him.</v>

7792
03:17:32.311 --> 03:17:32.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna,</v>

7793
03:17:32.940 --> 03:17:33.773
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

7794
03:17:33.810 --> 03:17:34.531
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

7795
03:17:34.531 --> 03:17:37.980
<v Speaker 4>He's older than me and I respect him and I'm not like a mentor to him,</v>

7796
03:17:37.981 --> 03:17:42.981
<v Speaker 4>but I am someone who was more advanced in comedy and but was a giant fan of Joey</v>

7797
03:17:45.890 --> 03:17:45.900
<v Speaker 4>Dhea.</v>

7798
03:17:45.900 --> 03:17:46.470
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>

7799
03:17:46.470 --> 03:17:50.190
<v Speaker 4>I just want to figure out a way where the it can work for this guy because I</v>

7800
03:17:50.191 --> 03:17:55.191
<v Speaker 4>know if this guys is out there hustling and being crazy and doing coke,</v>

7801
03:17:55.230 --> 03:17:55.880
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

7802
03:17:55.880 --> 03:17:59.540
<v Speaker 4>it's going to go off the rails like whatever I can do to,</v>

7803
03:17:59.840 --> 03:18:04.840
<v Speaker 4>and I think it helped him that someone who was established who,</v>

7804
03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:05.753
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

7805
03:18:05.770 --> 03:18:07.710
<v Speaker 4>a guy who legitimately me.</v>

7806
03:18:07.750 --> 03:18:09.270
<v Speaker 4>It didn't give a fuck what he did.</v>

7807
03:18:09.271 --> 03:18:10.890
<v Speaker 4>I wanted him to be myself.</v>

7808
03:18:11.100 --> 03:18:12.030
<v Speaker 4>I want to be at south.</v>

7809
03:18:12.100 --> 03:18:13.860
<v Speaker 4>We would love to wild with the owner,</v>

7810
03:18:13.870 --> 03:18:14.490
<v Speaker 4>be fun.</v>

7811
03:18:14.490 --> 03:18:15.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

7812
03:18:15.240 --> 03:18:17.460
<v Speaker 4>I never cared about what went on.</v>

7813
03:18:17.490 --> 03:18:17.970
<v Speaker 4>I wanted,</v>

7814
03:18:17.970 --> 03:18:19.500
<v Speaker 4>I wanted fun for everybody.</v>

7815
03:18:19.680 --> 03:18:20.220
<v Speaker 4>Like that was,</v>

7816
03:18:20.220 --> 03:18:22.240
<v Speaker 4>it was important for me that I'd be the only one.</v>

7817
03:18:22.390 --> 03:18:24.720
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the biggest poisons ever with comics.</v>

03:18:24.990 --> 03:18:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Be the only funny one or on the headliner.</v>

7819
03:18:27.481 --> 03:18:28.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm the only one who kills.</v>

7820
03:18:28.681 --> 03:18:29.051
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>

03:19:10.810 --> 03:19:14.680
<v Speaker 4>So you haven't made a connection to me where it does actually matter.</v>

7868
03:19:14.850 --> 03:19:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Does we both killed?</v>

7869
03:19:16.290 --> 03:19:20.080
<v Speaker 4>Why is it an issue if it goes off the rails one time and you go long,</v>

7870
03:19:20.081 --> 03:19:20.970
<v Speaker 4>like who gives a shit?</v>

7871
03:19:20.970 --> 03:19:21.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7872
03:19:21.110 --> 03:19:22.060
<v Speaker 4>that's not a consistent thing.</v>

7873
03:19:23.230 --> 03:19:24.410
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing to,</v>

7874
03:19:24.670 --> 03:19:25.900
<v Speaker 4>to all of us,</v>

7875
03:19:25.901 --> 03:19:26.590
<v Speaker 4>she'd be,</v>

7876
03:19:26.590 --> 03:19:27.730
<v Speaker 4>we know the process chart,</v>

7877
03:19:27.740 --> 03:19:30.940
<v Speaker 4>some shit have fun and the audience has a great time.</v>

7878
03:19:30.970 --> 03:19:31.803
<v Speaker 4>That's what I all,</v>

7879
03:19:31.840 --> 03:19:36.840
<v Speaker 4>that's all I wanted and like to have also that stand up wasn't something that I</v>

7880
03:19:37.811 --> 03:19:39.670
<v Speaker 4>had to do for money.</v>

7881
03:19:40.090 --> 03:19:43.870
<v Speaker 4>Like stand up was almost like supplementing,</v>

7882
03:19:44.260 --> 03:19:44.861
<v Speaker 4>whether it was news,</v>

7883
03:19:44.861 --> 03:19:46.930
<v Speaker 4>radio money or fear factor money.</v>

7884
03:19:46.931 --> 03:19:48.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like a had all this money that I,</v>

7885
03:19:48.760 --> 03:19:49.593
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>

7886
03:19:49.600 --> 03:19:50.520
<v Speaker 4>my bills were okay.</v>

7887
03:19:50.560 --> 03:19:51.400
<v Speaker 4>I was okay.</v>

7888
03:19:51.520 --> 03:19:52.660
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have to think about it.</v>

7889
03:19:52.870 --> 03:19:55.900
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't worry about getting kicked out of clubs.</v>

7890
03:19:56.050 --> 03:19:58.270
<v Speaker 4>I didn't worry about not getting booked.</v>

7891
03:19:58.271 --> 03:19:58.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

7892
03:19:58.630 --> 03:19:59.470
<v Speaker 4>so what?</v>

7893
03:19:59.850 --> 03:20:04.030
<v Speaker 4>Like we're here to have fun and we rolled through the entire country like that</v>

7894
03:20:04.240 --> 03:20:05.140
<v Speaker 4>and it worked out.</v>

7895
03:20:05.170 --> 03:20:05.890
<v Speaker 4>It was fun.</v>

7896
03:20:05.890 --> 03:20:06.671
<v Speaker 4>God Damn Dude,</v>

7897
03:20:06.671 --> 03:20:08.230
<v Speaker 4>we had the time of our lives.</v>

7898
03:20:08.380 --> 03:20:09.490
<v Speaker 4>When you look back,</v>

7899
03:20:09.491 --> 03:20:11.650
<v Speaker 4>if we look back as you know,</v>

7900
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:14.230
<v Speaker 4>senior citizens at the fucking,</v>

7901
03:20:14.530 --> 03:20:19.530
<v Speaker 4>the rare great times that we had consistently all across the country,</v>

7902
03:20:20.200 --> 03:20:21.820
<v Speaker 4>the offstage stuff was stuff great.</v>

7903
03:20:21.870 --> 03:20:21.990
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

7904
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:26.350
<v Speaker 4>for me onstage it was getting more stage time that I would get in La and I was</v>

7905
03:20:26.351 --> 03:20:29.110
<v Speaker 4>getting this weird exposure to an actual good crowd where I could like</v>

7906
03:20:29.350 --> 03:20:30.580
<v Speaker 4>experiment with pausing.</v>

7907
03:20:30.820 --> 03:20:34.210
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be afraid of losing a crowd if I shows you do and a half hour</v>

7908
03:20:34.211 --> 03:20:35.044
<v Speaker 4>consistently,</v>

7909
03:20:35.140 --> 03:20:36.130
<v Speaker 4>two shows a night.</v>

7910
03:20:36.210 --> 03:20:36.941
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to Michelle,</v>

7911
03:20:36.941 --> 03:20:37.780
<v Speaker 4>she just went to what will,</v>

7912
03:20:37.790 --> 03:20:38.770
<v Speaker 4>if she just went to a,</v>

7913
03:20:38.830 --> 03:20:40.330
<v Speaker 4>I think commerce for the first time and I was like,</v>

7914
03:20:40.331 --> 03:20:40.841
<v Speaker 4>oh how was it?</v>

7915
03:20:40.841 --> 03:20:41.140
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>

7916
03:20:41.140 --> 03:20:41.921
<v Speaker 4>it's not fair.</v>

7917
03:20:41.921 --> 03:20:43.030
<v Speaker 4>They're laughing at setups.</v>

7918
03:20:43.060 --> 03:20:44.710
<v Speaker 4>It's just too good at it doesn't make sense.</v>

7919
03:20:44.711 --> 03:20:45.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm like it's a victory lap.</v>

7920
03:20:45.941 --> 03:20:46.774
<v Speaker 4>You should enjoy it.</v>

7921
03:20:46.780 --> 03:20:49.780
<v Speaker 4>And then I remember like I think that might've been the first time I went with</v>

7922
03:20:49.781 --> 03:20:53.410
<v Speaker 4>Brogan was and I was doing so well but he's like,</v>

7923
03:20:53.470 --> 03:20:54.670
<v Speaker 4>oh you're coming with me again.</v>

7924
03:20:54.850 --> 03:20:55.760
<v Speaker 4>It was almost like,</v>

7925
03:20:56.440 --> 03:20:58.510
<v Speaker 4>like it was unfair showcase.</v>

7926
03:20:58.710 --> 03:21:01.060
<v Speaker 4>You know why I already knew you were funny.</v>

7927
03:21:01.260 --> 03:21:01.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7928
03:21:01.500 --> 03:21:01.650
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

7929
03:21:01.650 --> 03:21:03.160
<v Speaker 4>that's why you asked me to go with one with first place,</v>

7930
03:21:03.161 --> 03:21:03.660
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

7931
03:21:03.660 --> 03:21:04.481
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>

7932
03:21:04.481 --> 03:21:06.760
<v Speaker 4>this is the perfect club for anybody to try out in.</v>

7933
03:21:06.761 --> 03:21:07.850
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's so sad.</v>

7934
03:21:07.851 --> 03:21:10.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like a wind assisted a hundred yard dash,</v>

7935
03:21:10.300 --> 03:21:10.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

7936
03:21:10.630 --> 03:21:12.040
<v Speaker 4>with heavy gusts of wind.</v>

7937
03:21:12.070 --> 03:21:12.491
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

7938
03:21:12.491 --> 03:21:13.840
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like you have a sale.</v>

7939
03:21:13.900 --> 03:21:14.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7940
03:21:14.480 --> 03:21:15.100

03:21:15.100 --> 03:21:15.880
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

7942
03:21:15.880 --> 03:21:16.091
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

7944
03:21:16.810 --> 03:21:16.931
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7945
03:21:16.931 --> 03:21:18.220
<v Speaker 4>We had a great fucking time dude.</v>

7946
03:21:18.400 --> 03:21:18.631
<v Speaker 4>But at,</v>

7947
03:21:18.631 --> 03:21:19.181
<v Speaker 4>and it works.</v>

7948
03:21:19.181 --> 03:21:19.451
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

7949

7951
03:21:22.181 --> 03:21:26.260
<v Speaker 4>whether it's Diaz or Dunkin or you or Segura,</v>

7952
03:21:26.500 --> 03:21:28.690
<v Speaker 4>they're murdering now all over the country,</v>

7953
03:21:28.780 --> 03:21:29.560
<v Speaker 4>murdering,</v>

7954
03:21:29.560 --> 03:21:30.520
<v Speaker 4>doing quite well.</v>

7955
03:21:30.640 --> 03:21:32.020
<v Speaker 4>If I was a talent scout dude,</v>

7956
03:21:32.021 --> 03:21:33.520
<v Speaker 4>I'd be 100% no,</v>

7957
03:21:33.521 --> 03:21:35.320
<v Speaker 4>you would not think harder.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

7959
03:21:37.090 --> 03:21:38.560
<v Speaker 4>It's not because I was going to write down a name,</v>

7960
03:21:38.561 --> 03:21:38.941
<v Speaker 4>but you're not.</v>

7964
03:21:43.780 --> 03:21:44.710
<v Speaker 4>they failed themselves.</v>

7965
03:21:44.810 --> 03:21:46.200
<v Speaker 4>They had the potential of the bay</v>

7966
03:21:46.290 --> 03:21:47.123
<v Speaker 2>and then it's on them.</v>

7971
03:21:51.021 --> 03:21:51.920
<v Speaker 2>very unfortunate.</v>

7972

<v Speaker 2>And we're seeing it right now.</v>
