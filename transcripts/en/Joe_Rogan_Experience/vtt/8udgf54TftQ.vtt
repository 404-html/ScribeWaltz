1
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

2
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're live.</v>

3
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 2>We've done it faster this time than </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

4
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 2>We're getting better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less fuckups,</v>

5
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 2>less hiccups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Live from the compound.</v>

6
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started a little bit late today.</v>

7
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 2>That was all my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian was rocked and locked and loaded.</v>

8
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:25.221
<v Speaker 2>This time I just fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was tired because I had to do the </v>

9
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 2>feminine being show this morning and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to get up early because I have to </v>

10
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.361
<v Speaker 2>leave my house is kind of far from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck people that's gone down,</v>

11
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 2>but just happy new year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

12
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Brian is all in a tizzy about the God </v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn Ipad and me.</v>

13
00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:46.831
<v Speaker 2>I twittered that I don't need an ipad </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm a fucking man and I can </v>

14
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.081
<v Speaker 2>carry a goddamn backpack with a laptop </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't complain like a little </v>

15
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.891
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this seems like it's got less shit </v>

16
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:54.891
<v Speaker 2>than a laptop.</v>

17
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:56.050
<v Speaker 2>And if you're going to go like on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>airplane or something,</v>

18
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.210
<v Speaker 2>go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to fucking laptop.</v>

19
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 2>We want to be able to get on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

20
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:05.061
<v Speaker 2>You want to be able to send someone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>real goddamn email or attach something </v>

21
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 2>to it and send a real link.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easy copy and paste old school.</v>

22
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't want some nutty fucking finger</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

23
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:15.561
<v Speaker 2>You have to shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to fucking laptop and it's not </v>

24
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 2>heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can take this goddamn thing anywhere.</v>

25
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 2>They're so small now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the sin and the light.</v>

26
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to hit.</v>

27
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 2>This is the 17 inch Mac book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing is,</v>

28
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 2>it's not heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put it in a backpack.</v>

29
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 2>You're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need an IPAD,</v>

30
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well see,</v>

31
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:35.481
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the problem with a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>can everyone hear us okay before we </v>

32
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 2>start getting really into it as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>microphone back where we are.</v>

33
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Not a well polished machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some gentleman.</v>

34
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 2>Now where's the time here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll see if,</v>

35
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 2>if we can hear ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

36
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 2>If this was like real tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be fun.</v>

37
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.520
<v Speaker 2>We'll see if we can hear ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who we are.</v>

38
00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.720
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

39
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.060
<v Speaker 2>we're</v>

40
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.580
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

41
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.320
<v Speaker 3>so here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about that,</v>

42
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.330
<v Speaker 3>the whole that tablet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the problem with the whole thing is </v>

43
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.491
<v Speaker 3>that Steve Jobs pretty much just bashed </v>
<v Speaker 3>net books at the beginning of the the </v>

44
00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:16.050
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it really set a nerve with a lot of </v>

45
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.050
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning people are like,</v>

46
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.530
<v Speaker 3>what nipples vendor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he knows in his speech and his speech</v>

47
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 3>that much</v>

48
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.020
<v Speaker 2>fan boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to sit and watch you strut</v>

49
00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:24.480
<v Speaker 2>around and talk about your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

50
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.690
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think your iphone is a goddamn work </v>

51
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.130
<v Speaker 2>with are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If verizon had it,</v>

52
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:33.840
<v Speaker 2>it would be the greatest school in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of the universe,</v>

53
00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:36.300
<v Speaker 2>but I can't use it as a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use it to me.</v>

54
00:03:36.301 --> 00:03:37.710
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry two phones.</v>

55
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I carry a blackberry and verizon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking phone I can call </v>

56
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.950
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sucks.</v>

57
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a drunk iphone.</v>

58
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Like when you compare the two of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

59
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 2>there's no comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes,</v>

60
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:54.261
<v Speaker 2>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I call you and I have a little </v>

61
00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:54.390
<v Speaker 2>picture for your face when I call you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go to call somebody else,</v>

62
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 2>when I start calling somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your picture will show up and then it'll</v>

63
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.680
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the things like,</v>

64
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go on.</v>

65
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a dumb phone.</v>

66
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like it does what you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it takes like a couple extra seconds</v>

67
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:12.090
<v Speaker 2>and it stumbles this storm to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

68
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.280
<v Speaker 2>the strong to the screen is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice big ass screen and I,</v>

69
00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the touchscreen's not too bad.</v>

70
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty easy to type the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even this way in landscape mode,</v>

71
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.420
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

72
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.280
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you a little feedback,</v>

73
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:28.440
<v Speaker 2>which really isn't necessary but it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not bad.</v>

74
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.080
<v Speaker 2>And as a phone it's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but compared to the iphone was just </v>

75
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.080
<v Speaker 2>getting on the web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

76
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.270
<v Speaker 2>like you're doing it in an old wooden </v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

77
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:39.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just so clunky and stupid and zoom,</v>

78
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.240
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scroll this way and Oh,</v>

79
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:43.520
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really what</v>

80
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 3>you're saying is the best part about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone is probably Internet and the </v>

81
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.571
<v Speaker 3>worst part is the worst part is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind making calls on calls on </v>

82
00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:54.510
<v Speaker 3>his bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that,</v>

83
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.590
<v Speaker 3>but I just don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tea is just terrible.</v>

84
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.860
<v Speaker 3>It might be better in somebody's town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

85
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.450
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got more towers,</v>

86
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 3>more GSM towers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they took the,</v>

87
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best part of the iphone and made it </v>

88
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Speaker 3>a little bit bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 3>And they got rid of like no camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

90
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.650
<v Speaker 3>Well here's the whole thing about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm thinking now is I'm thinking,</v>

91
00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:16.610
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like my iphone,</v>

92
00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:21.611
<v Speaker 3>but I only use it once in awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want something small to surf the net </v>

93
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:21.611
<v Speaker 3>and do basic shit with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

94
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:26.501
<v Speaker 3>I listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say you're in a starbucks and some dude </v>

95
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:26.501

96
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you want to be taking video,</v>

101
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.260
<v Speaker 3>blackberry because he's not sold on </v>
<v Speaker 3>apple online.</v>

102
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 3>He's online right there and he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get online with his ipad and take video </v>

<v Speaker 3>and streaming to stream of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening and he can't do it because the</v>

109
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.991
<v Speaker 3>port that is going to have accessories </v>
<v Speaker 3>to open it up to the universe.</v>

110
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Imagine having an hd camera hooked up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom and you just happened to be </v>

111
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.770

<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think they're trying to keep it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Price,</v>

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 3>supply zone under $500 because here's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing.</v>

127
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to buy a book reader </v>

128
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 3>you're on Amazon.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at the kindle,</v>

129
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 3>the kindle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's $10 cheaper than this thing.</v>

130
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 3>That makes a lot of sense actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's backlit.</v>

131
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 3>I have a sony reader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

132
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I read in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when my girlfriend's sleeping I want </v>

133
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 3>to read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

134
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 3>I have to have a light on and it can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even just be a dim light.</v>

135
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 3>It has to be a bright light for me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>read it.</v>

136
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 3>So now I got a little lip on soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get to sleep right next to you,</v>

137
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 3>especially if you've got a kindle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the cover.</v>

138
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 3>He put the light here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

139
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.090
<v Speaker 3>You can read right next to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this thing will be great for the </v>

140
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 3>married dudes talking right next to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was single.</v>

141
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

142
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:37.470
<v Speaker 3>I guess you can't sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

143
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I can't sleep while you're reading a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

144
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe the couch would be a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>place for you to sleep.</v>

145
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>

146
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like $10 more.</v>

147
00:07:46.381 --> 00:07:48.150
<v Speaker 3>What did you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you didn't have one already,</v>

148
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.250
<v Speaker 3>if you are getting a book reader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you get $10 more?</v>

149
00:07:50.251 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Would you pay for the tablets?</v>

150
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the best argument I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard.</v>

151
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:56.200
<v Speaker 2>If I had to choose between the kindle </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the IPAD,</v>

152
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.420
<v Speaker 2>would for sure take the time.</v>

153
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.240
<v Speaker 3>And now the argument on the other side </v>
<v Speaker 3>yard man on the other side,</v>

154
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.320
<v Speaker 3>e ink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

155
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.020
<v Speaker 3>is less stressful on the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's what I'm thinking.</v>

156
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.050
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be something to sell that </v>

157
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.050
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

158
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.160
<v Speaker 3>And here's what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the computer 11 hours a day,</v>

159
00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:17.161
<v Speaker 3>10 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing 99 percent reading and I've </v>

160
00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:19.480
<v Speaker 3>never gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my foods once in a while.</v>

161
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Notice that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

162
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.380
<v Speaker 2>it could be also because I'm getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>older,</v>

163
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 2>but my eyesight is not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning like say if I have to read a </v>

164
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.490
<v Speaker 2>vitamin bottle or it tells me how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to take.</v>

165
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I struggled with that Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

166
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to try to focus.</v>

167
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not what it used to be,</v>

168
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.960
<v Speaker 3>so I don't read more than like an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two hours.</v>

169
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:42.961
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to eat book anyways a day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm thinking if I'm on the computer </v>

170
00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:44.470
<v Speaker 3>12 hours already a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you use two hours of that.</v>

171
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flaco says everything.</v>

172
00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:52.981
<v Speaker 3>Apple makes us perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve Jobs is God and Bill Gates is a </v>

173
00:08:52.981 --> 00:08:55.140
<v Speaker 3>Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was obviously no,</v>

174
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 2>those are strong words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's the real flop on the</v>

175
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:05.331
<v Speaker 2>real flap or is a craziest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't only as well the craziest </v>

<v Speaker 2>money so he doesn't have to work.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So the dude just gets online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just trolls.</v>

199
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 2>of it and put it online because then </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody will have evidence.</v>

200
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.150
<v Speaker 2>They'll have weapons and ammunition to </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's vicious.</v>

205
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Speaker 2>And who the hell knows?</v>

206
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a guy.</v>

207
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.650
<v Speaker 2>No idea about the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fastest meeting people that are </v>

208
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.790
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have so many friends.</v>

209
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 2>You are one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met on the Internet,</v>

210
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 2>but there's so many people that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>met from your message board and in other</v>

211
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a crazy thing to say.</v>

212
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 2>It seems like you're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

213
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Fucking people from your message board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know when you're either.</v>

214
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Bottom line is for real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're meeting people all over</v>

215
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:54.620

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

218
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.960
<v Speaker 2>the only way to interact with people is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Internet is the greatest for </v>

219
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.881
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's people that could never </v>

220
00:11:10.881 --> 00:11:12.921
<v Speaker 2>have relationships that didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends that are nothing going on in </v>

221
00:11:12.921 --> 00:11:17.211
<v Speaker 2>their real life,</v>

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:10.130
<v Speaker 2>that could be just some weird side </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect or speech that when you reverse </v>

267
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.821
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says the opposite of what the person </v>

285
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:06.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think they're probably </v>

286
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.080
<v Speaker 2>negotiate that shit when he was on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show and he's making good money,</v>

<v Speaker 2>then they're going to sue him and he was</v>

<v Speaker 2>the whole world.</v>

290
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:18.670
<v Speaker 2>First he fell apart in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole world because he was married to </v>

291
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.690
<v Speaker 2>that chick who was just treating him </v>

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk.</v>

351
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Remember Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his joke about chuck it off for the cat </v>

352
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.920

<v Speaker 3>move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Move.</v>

354
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird how like a cats used to be </v>

355
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.360
<v Speaker 3>worshiped back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

356
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:13.980
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

357
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean what if there is something to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cat that we just don't know and it was </v>

358
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.120
<v Speaker 3>lost in transition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

359
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.590
<v Speaker 3>like no one ever wrote it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

360
00:17:19.591 --> 00:17:24.591
<v Speaker 3>oh by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the cat's eyes every day </v>

361
00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:24.810
<v Speaker 3>at midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can talk to we know what just</v>

362
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.960
<v Speaker 2>about like Egypt worshiping cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they were so good at making </v>

363
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Speaker 2>things like how I wonder what they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>really like because we don't really have</v>

364
00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:37.811
<v Speaker 2>any idea about their cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Translating their language over the </v>

365
00:17:37.811 --> 00:17:39.650
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also tricky and the hieroglyphs and</v>

366
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.400
<v Speaker 2>they don't really know how far back </v>
<v Speaker 2>there their history goes because there's</v>

367
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:48.740
<v Speaker 2>like John Anthony West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy thinks that their history goes </v>

368
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.311
<v Speaker 2>back like 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and he even has hieroglyphs that </v>

369
00:17:51.311 --> 00:17:54.711
<v Speaker 2>prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were so smart when it came to </v>

370
00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:54.780
<v Speaker 2>constructing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what they would like,</v>

371
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially,</v>

372
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

373
00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

374
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.750
<v Speaker 2>just sitting around talking to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 2>it's really kind of crazy when you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what those,</v>

376
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:08.810
<v Speaker 2>those people pulled off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was like supposedly a 22,000,</v>

377
00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:13.260
<v Speaker 2>500 years before Christ before zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

378
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 2>And they were working with seven cats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe they,</v>

379
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.220
<v Speaker 2>maybe they know.</v>

380
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something with fucking smart </v>

381
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.471
<v Speaker 2>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would like to know how smart </v>

382
00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:24.471
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they were just completely retarded</v>

383
00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:28.580
<v Speaker 2>and just didn't really know how to build</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and they will just write and </v>

384
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:28.580
<v Speaker 2>that's why they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Culture to suck.</v>

385
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.070
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think so because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

386
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

387
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.470
<v Speaker 2>I think socrates and no Hurghada this </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurghada just went over from um,</v>

388
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.190
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>

389
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:45.370
<v Speaker 2>there's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the charge for this cat is very </v>

390
00:18:46.101 --> 00:18:48.800
<v Speaker 2>emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes can manage.</v>

391
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.340
<v Speaker 2>She would get mad because we've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>another cat to.</v>

392
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.310
<v Speaker 2>She started peeing on Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of the other cat just walks in.</v>

393
00:18:55.311 --> 00:18:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you said that Oliver,</v>

394

<v Speaker 2>He's a cool little dude.</v>

396
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I like cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

397
00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.430
<v Speaker 2>when I like cats because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>starving to death.</v>

398
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.670
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't understand like when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you people are living in Egypt,</v>

399
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean how fucking smart were they?</v>

400
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:15.890
<v Speaker 2>They must've had a pretty sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture because they were really into </v>

401
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.680
<v Speaker 2>keep animals as pets and feeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dogs are going to protect your </v>

402
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:24.141
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna do the campaigns doing </v>

403
00:19:24.141 --> 00:19:24.141
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You rubbed them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's all you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get ipr and I like,</v>

405
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:25.980

<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>

406
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.660
<v Speaker 2>So they were smart enough to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>pyramids,</v>

407
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:30.010
<v Speaker 2>but yet they worshiped cats because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

408
00:19:30.011 --> 00:19:32.190
<v Speaker 2>There's something to the captain we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know about spazz.</v>

409
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Is there something to cats?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever see a cat when the light hits </v>

410
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.970
<v Speaker 2>their eyes in a certain way and it looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Hologram or something going on in</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their eyesight is insane there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I started some insane amount better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>ours.</v>

414
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.110

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

415
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:51.111
<v Speaker 2>Their eyesight is incredible and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dark and darkens vision is incredible </v>

416
00:19:51.111 --> 00:19:52.590
<v Speaker 2>and their hearing is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That cat hears everything.</v>

417
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.530
<v Speaker 2>She'll hear shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her.</v>

418
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.940
<v Speaker 2>She'll be sleeping and then you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 2>her all curled up and then I'll move </v>

419
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:00.390
<v Speaker 2>something in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see her little ears just go.</v>

420
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're,</v>

421
00:20:03.191 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 2>they're tuning in to like specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>locations where mice are trying to sneak</v>

422
00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:08.490
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

423
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 2>that they got this killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

424
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:15.351
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird to see because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom line is she only respects me and </v>

425
00:20:15.351 --> 00:20:16.920
<v Speaker 2>loves me and everything first of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I feed her and pet her,</v>

426
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.040
<v Speaker 2>but also because I'm so much bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 2>in her because if that was smaller than </v>

427
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:22.040
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would fuck me up.</v>

428
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Cats don't give a fuck about little </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

429
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 2>You can't keep a pet journal around your</v>
<v Speaker 2>cat.</v>

430
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.760
<v Speaker 2>They don't have that agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can train a dog to not kill a </v>

431
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.100
<v Speaker 2>durable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot train a cat.</v>

432
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do it.</v>

433
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.380
<v Speaker 2>You leave that job around that cat is </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna.</v>

434
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

435
00:20:37.441 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 2>They cannot avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>

436
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.020
<v Speaker 2>They love killing things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

437
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

438
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.350
<v Speaker 2>When I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>

439
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:48.351
<v Speaker 2>we had a big ass black tomcat and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to kill and he used to kill </v>

440
00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:53.401
<v Speaker 2>squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We lived right across the street from </v>

441
00:20:53.401 --> 00:20:53.401
<v Speaker 2>this river and there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

442
00:20:53.401 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 2>a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of wooded areas.</v>

443
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Like many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many acres.</v>

444
00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:00.540
<v Speaker 2>As soon as a lot of animals around there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these fucking girls would be all </v>

445
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 2>over this tree and this cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is creep through the grass,</v>

446
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.530

00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:32.731
<v Speaker 2>like half the size of his body and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragging it in between his legs and </v>

461
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:46.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

462
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm like rubbing his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's up?</v>

463
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:53.611
<v Speaker 3>Little Buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you gotta sell you gotta you gotTa </v>

464
00:21:53.611 --> 00:21:53.611
<v Speaker 3>score.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't.</v>

465
00:21:53.611 --> 00:21:57.780
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He murdered this poor little animal </v>

466
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.220
<v Speaker 3>because his girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably a little squirrel family was </v>

467
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:01.220
<v Speaker 3>scrub mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not even hungry.</v>

468
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 3>I feed his fat ass everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would come and I'd give him a fucking</v>

469
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Kenneth Dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cat,</v>

470
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.830
<v Speaker 3>little cat food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would be fine.</v>

471
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that square was trying to help you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like ricky ticky.</v>

472
00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:11.140
<v Speaker 3>Timbo remember that old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that old story where he's trying to save</v>

473
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:12.430
<v Speaker 3>the family from the snake.</v>

474
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the square was trying to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Squirrels.</v>

475
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Little animals I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a.</v>

476
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.740
<v Speaker 3>I discriminate when it comes to rodents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like squirrels,</v>

477
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:23.020
<v Speaker 3>they make the grade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never feel bad when I see them,</v>

478
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.800
<v Speaker 3>but if I see a rat that's close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

479
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Iran is that close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you're sitting with your kid</v>

480
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:33.181
<v Speaker 3>at the park and there's a tree and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree is literally right there and the </v>

481
00:22:33.181 --> 00:22:33.181
<v Speaker 3>trees go scrub.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

482
00:22:33.181 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 3>oh look at this girl and this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's right there.</v>

483
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.220
<v Speaker 3>But if that was a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

484
00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck back.</v>

485
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:38.370
<v Speaker 3>The rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so rad.</v>

486
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 3>Fucking stick gonna wrap it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just start freaking out and yelling.</v>

487
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Shit the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking rat.</v>

488
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.350
<v Speaker 3>But I'm scared of rats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

489
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what that big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm scared of him in Jersey.</v>

490
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Devil come at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you've got to be careful.</v>

491
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.860
<v Speaker 3>Like don't bite your ass man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a came after by a skunk last week </v>

492
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.540
<v Speaker 3>and they charged me and the dog and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>

493
00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:02.560
<v Speaker 3>my dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like kill,</v>

494
00:23:02.561 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 3>kill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill.</v>

495
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Well listen to me but doesn't know it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to spray him.</v>

496
00:23:05.621 --> 00:23:10.621
<v Speaker 3>And then that's going to be like five </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours of my time of trying to use </v>

497
00:23:10.621 --> 00:23:13.420
<v Speaker 3>vinegar and imagine to a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dogs have these insane.</v>

498
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.190
<v Speaker 3>They like it or not.</v>

499
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you don't like it would be </v>

500
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.000
<v Speaker 2>funny if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

501
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.340
<v Speaker 2>That would be like an animal that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to commit suicide.</v>

502
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:28.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that was the evolutionary thing with </v>

503
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.130
<v Speaker 2>met the dogs loved it and you spray your</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

504
00:23:29.131 --> 00:23:34.131
<v Speaker 2>The dog liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did want you to spray so they'd want to </v>

505
00:23:34.131 --> 00:23:34.131
<v Speaker 2>kill you all the time.</v>

506
00:23:34.131 --> 00:23:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Psychiatric catnip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does catnip not working on any other</v>

507
00:23:36.021 --> 00:23:36.380
<v Speaker 3>animal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

508
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.370
<v Speaker 2>these guys are weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this guy.</v>

509
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your favorite way to smoke?</v>

510
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Like some people get nutty about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just smoke your weed.</v>

511
00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:47.120
<v Speaker 2>People did because there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of people that follow you that are</v>

512
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:49.460
<v Speaker 2>so burned out that they just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

513
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.930
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's young to the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a lot of young health was </v>

514
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:55.700
<v Speaker 2>the vaporizer is certainly your best </v>
<v Speaker 2>bet.</v>

515
00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Bonds are nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a bond,</v>

516
00:23:59.131 --> 00:23:59.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Glass.</v>

517
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian doesn't give a fuck.</v>

518
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.640
<v Speaker 2>It goes right to the Dick joints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joints because you only have to light at</v>

519
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:08.390
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

520
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.170
<v Speaker 2>but really if you want to do it the </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthiest way of vaporizers,</v>

521
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.000
<v Speaker 2>way to go and don't think that eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just as healthy.</v>

522
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 2>People think that eating pot is just as </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy.</v>

523
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not going to kill you,</v>

524
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 2>but it will freak you out.</v>

525
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:25.300
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why it freaks you</v>
<v Speaker 2>out because it produces this thing </v>

526
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.911
<v Speaker 2>called 11 hydroxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a metabolite that your liver </v>

527
00:24:27.911 --> 00:24:30.941
<v Speaker 2>produces when you eat marijuana and </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently it's not psychoactive when </v>

528
00:24:30.941 --> 00:24:35.831
<v Speaker 2>you smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's so you don't get the same </v>

529
00:24:35.831 --> 00:24:37.691
<v Speaker 2>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you eat marijuana it becomes </v>

530
00:24:37.691 --> 00:24:38.870
<v Speaker 2>like four times more psychoactive than </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you smoke it.</v>

531
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.420
<v Speaker 2>So if you have like a lot of weed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you make brownies with them,</v>

532
00:24:41.421 --> 00:24:43.120
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem with these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

533
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.730
<v Speaker 2>you eat a Brownie and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are.</v>

534
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 2>You can't believe how much weed is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

535
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.570
<v Speaker 2>You have to sit down and it's because as</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going through your system,</v>

536
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:52.880
<v Speaker 2>it's creating this 11 hydroxy </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolite,</v>

537
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:58.120
<v Speaker 2>which I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why I like it is </v>

538
00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.240
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes me very self critical.</v>

539
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.210
<v Speaker 2>It makes me examine all sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about myself.</v>

540
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Like there's anything about myself that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like.</v>

541
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.950
<v Speaker 2>If I'm being lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm being a douchebag,</v>

542
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.120
<v Speaker 2>if I'm being short with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not,</v>

543
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:16.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not focused on what I really </v>

544
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:16.490
<v Speaker 2>should be focused on in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that might be bugging me,</v>

545
00:25:16.491 --> 00:25:20.660
<v Speaker 2>my subconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This 11 hydroxy makes you think about it</v>

546
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:25.661
<v Speaker 2>like in depth and they can really freak </v>
<v Speaker 2>people out if you've got some shit that </v>

547
00:25:25.661 --> 00:25:26.920
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing in the back of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

548
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:28.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like what people call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was paranoid.</v>

549
00:25:28.641 --> 00:25:33.641
<v Speaker 2>I was paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what paranoia is is people that </v>

550
00:25:33.641 --> 00:25:36.581
<v Speaker 2>when you get high on marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're paranoid is people who </v>

551
00:25:36.581 --> 00:25:37.400
<v Speaker 2>just are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting too much information for</v>

552
00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:42.401
<v Speaker 2>them to manage and they haven't done </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a good job of managing their </v>

553
00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:44.240
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in the first place and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>when this stuff is hitting them,</v>

554
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.560
<v Speaker 2>what's happening is they're just.</v>

555
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.650
<v Speaker 2>It's overload and they can't control it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they freak out and they say,</v>

556
00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:51.080
<v Speaker 2>I can't smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets me paranoid,</v>

557
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.820
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's more indicative of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

558
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't really know how you feel about</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

559
00:25:57.261 --> 00:25:59.090
<v Speaker 2>You don't really know how you feel about</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

560
00:25:59.091 --> 00:26:04.091
<v Speaker 2>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at life through barriers </v>

561
00:26:04.091 --> 00:26:07.091
<v Speaker 2>because you're trying to not see </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything because you're trying to </v>

562
00:26:07.091 --> 00:26:11.381
<v Speaker 2>focus on one particular thing with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life or try and get your shit together </v>

563
00:26:11.381 --> 00:26:15.131
<v Speaker 2>and you don't realize how many things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your life really are freaking you </v>

564
00:26:15.131 --> 00:26:17.390
<v Speaker 2>out and bothering you until you smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pot and pot just makes you examine them.</v>

565
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we as,</v>

566
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.360
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as people,</v>

567
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:25.361
<v Speaker 2>we like to avoid shit that bugs us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I like when people like overeat </v>

568
00:26:25.361 --> 00:26:29.981
<v Speaker 2>to get over some childhood molestation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even fucking realize what </v>

569
00:26:29.981 --> 00:26:30.200
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just distracting themselves with</v>

570
00:26:30.201 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

571
00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:36.491
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we do shit like that all the </v>

572
00:26:36.491 --> 00:26:36.920
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything I kind of lost in near halfway.</v>

573
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be careful with your weed.</v>

574
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 2>That's all I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being paranoid is a good thing.</v>

575

576
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:47.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience of being paranoid.</v>

577
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 2>When you smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to get you to look at yourself.</v>

578
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.170
<v Speaker 2>It's to get you to look at life.</v>

<v Speaker 2>as you could and those jolts of </v>

581
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:04.250
<v Speaker 2>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You misinterpret as paranoia like what </v>

582
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:07.620
<v Speaker 2>you're doing is just dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that's already been there.</v>

583
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Just the fact that you're this fleshy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>temporary,</v>

<v Speaker 2>connected with nothing above your head </v>
<v Speaker 2>except gases and air and then fucking </v>

<v Speaker 2>kind of going along with the flow of </v>

589
00:27:33.321 --> 00:27:36.660
<v Speaker 2>everybody else and sit in traffic like </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

647
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also you have to reprogram the way </v>

648
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:08.340
<v Speaker 2>you look at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

649
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.100
<v Speaker 2>you look at the world a certain way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you think,</v>

650
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:14.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you were taught by your </v>

651
00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:14.130
<v Speaker 2>parents and you know when you're like in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your teen years,</v>

652
00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.420
<v Speaker 2>you start having to restructure things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your teen years,</v>

653
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:21.421
<v Speaker 2>you start looking at things like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even know what the fuck they're </v>

654
00:30:21.421 --> 00:30:23.701
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're talking crazy shit and you </v>

655
00:30:23.701 --> 00:30:23.701
<v Speaker 2>realize God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents are just some fucking people.</v>

656
00:30:23.701 --> 00:30:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Just like all the other idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all day they just fucked.</v>

657
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no different than my idiot </v>

658
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.181
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're no different than my idiot </v>

659
00:30:33.181 --> 00:30:33.181
<v Speaker 2>teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just fucked,</v>

660
00:30:33.181 --> 00:30:33.880
<v Speaker 2>they fucked and they made me and sell </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

661
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:39.120
<v Speaker 2>And so when those teenage years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to like reformulate </v>

662
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.021
<v Speaker 2>the view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when it starts and it continues </v>

663
00:30:43.021 --> 00:30:43.021
<v Speaker 2>through your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

664
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that you would be the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude though?</v>

665
00:30:45.161 --> 00:30:46.360
<v Speaker 2>If you had like A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

666
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:51.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to watch that stuff sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you would be the same dude </v>

667
00:30:51.671 --> 00:30:53.300
<v Speaker 2>if you had a perfect childhood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

668
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just like that</v>

669
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.720
<v Speaker 3>you're a whole theory about like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

670
00:30:57.721 --> 00:30:58.980
<v Speaker 3>How you lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

671
00:30:58.981 --> 00:31:03.981
<v Speaker 3>everyone starts off at the same person </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much and just every single little</v>

672
00:31:04.261 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Speaker 3>thing you've got to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

673
00:31:06.511 --> 00:31:09.120
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you wrote down the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to in a mud,</v>

674
00:31:09.121 --> 00:31:09.990
<v Speaker 3>you're going to look different than </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

675
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:10.800
<v Speaker 2>person next to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

676
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.120
<v Speaker 2>That's why people really have to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion because,</v>

677
00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

678
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.500
<v Speaker 2>if we really are all the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my theory,</v>

679
00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:22.190
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't heard it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had this when I was eight some pot</v>

680
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.740
<v Speaker 2>and it was on a boat in Hawaii and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was um,</v>

681
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:31.210
<v Speaker 2>on this boat and we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were fishing and there was dolphins </v>

682
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.600
<v Speaker 2>that were next to the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dolphins were playing with us.</v>

683
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:37.630
<v Speaker 2>They would get by the boat and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would jump up in the air and we would </v>

684
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:37.630
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

685
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.160
<v Speaker 2>And every time they jump up there and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

686
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:40.000
<v Speaker 2>what's up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up,</v>

687
00:31:40.001 --> 00:31:43.240
<v Speaker 2>what's up top?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we would do that,</v>

688
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 2>they would get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they were like showing off.</v>

689
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.220
<v Speaker 2>They were like communicating with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

690
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.140
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so conscious.</v>

691
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.810
<v Speaker 2>And I started thinking about it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're responding to us.</v>

692
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:55.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what life must be like,</v>

693
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.030
<v Speaker 2>what consciousness wants to be like for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dolphin.</v>

694
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.120
<v Speaker 2>And I wonder if it's similar to humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wonder if it's the same.</v>

695
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they have the exact same </v>

696
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.371
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just filtered through an entirely </v>

697
00:32:08.371 --> 00:32:08.620
<v Speaker 2>different environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It totally different skin.</v>

698
00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:13.621
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a fish's body and a totally </v>

699
00:32:13.621 --> 00:32:13.810
<v Speaker 2>different way of communicating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally different language that's almost</v>

700
00:32:13.811 --> 00:32:16.660
<v Speaker 2>indecipherable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what if it's exactly the same thing,</v>

701
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.470
<v Speaker 2>the inside the consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought about it,</v>

702
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

703
00:32:20.361 --> 00:32:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Like what if that's the case with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

704
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.030
<v Speaker 2>What if we are all exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>

705
00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.140
<v Speaker 2>We just are transmitted through </v>
<v Speaker 2>different biological filters,</v>

706
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:31.780
<v Speaker 2>different life experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different childhoods,</v>

707
00:32:31.781 --> 00:32:35.020
<v Speaker 2>different everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different bad genetic rolls of the dice.</v>

708
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean people are born with different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ailments and diseases and people are </v>

709
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:40.140
<v Speaker 2>born crippled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

710
00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:45.150
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I supposed to have </v>

711
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:45.150
<v Speaker 2>compassionate is that easily could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been you.</v>

712
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a like a filter that the </v>

713
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.870
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is going through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the consciousness is one thing,</v>

714
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.020
<v Speaker 2>it's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are just like me.</v>

715
00:32:54.021 --> 00:32:59.021
<v Speaker 2>It's just like any of your uniqueness </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to do with your biology and your </v>

716
00:32:59.021 --> 00:33:00.830
<v Speaker 2>interpretations of your experiences as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're growing up.</v>

717
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your unique personality,</v>

718
00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.920
<v Speaker 2>your unique personality that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>talks about when were a child could </v>

719
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 2>easily be attributed to what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine you're running.</v>

720
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only take something.</v>

721
00:33:10.881 --> 00:33:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's biology is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that if you watch porn,</v>

722
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:19.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that we're blessed with </v>

723
00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 2>gigantic decks and there's poor dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>with little tiny decks and there's girls</v>

724
00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:23.270
<v Speaker 2>with incredible bodies and there's other</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls that like whatever,</v>

725
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.570
<v Speaker 2>no matter what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't lose that last 20 pounds.</v>

726
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.810
<v Speaker 2>That's just fact that that is what it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're born with.</v>

727
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.900
<v Speaker 2>There's variables like this variables </v>
<v Speaker 2>with oranges,</v>

728
00:33:32.901 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 2>you'll see one orange as big and another</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that's not so big.</v>

729
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.720
<v Speaker 2>They're not all the same and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>various chemicals and then on top of </v>

730
00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:43.670
<v Speaker 2>these various chemicals that are all in </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance,</v>

731
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:46.310
<v Speaker 2>all these different hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When a top of that,</v>

732
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:51.340
<v Speaker 2>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does this particular model interact </v>

733
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.160
<v Speaker 2>with its environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own unique experiences?</v>

734
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:57.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times have you seen something </v>

735
00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:57.280
<v Speaker 2>that your friends didn't and it fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>you up for the rest of the day.</v>

736
00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:57.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

737
00:33:57.921 --> 00:34:02.921
<v Speaker 2>like you see somebody get hit by a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see something and then you have the </v>

738
00:34:02.921 --> 00:34:06.071
<v Speaker 2>same friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to the same and all of a sudden </v>

739
00:34:06.071 --> 00:34:06.071
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to hang out with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

740
00:34:06.071 --> 00:34:06.071
<v Speaker 2>You think that things are frivolous.</v>

741
00:34:06.071 --> 00:34:07.390
<v Speaker 2>You think they're being retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

742
00:34:07.391 --> 00:34:12.391
<v Speaker 2>you hear about a girl getting raped and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the one who freaks out and it's </v>

743
00:34:12.391 --> 00:34:15.550
<v Speaker 2>what you see one thing and it will set </v>
<v Speaker 2>you off in a certain direction and it's </v>

744
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:19.831
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so who the fuck knows what your </v>

745
00:34:19.831 --> 00:34:21.701
<v Speaker 2>personality is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know who the fuck knows how much of </v>

746
00:34:21.701 --> 00:34:22.350
<v Speaker 2>it is your body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of it is your experiences?</v>

747
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:27.370
<v Speaker 2>How much of it is what you learned from </v>
<v Speaker 2>your parents and how much of theirs is </v>

748
00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:28.160
<v Speaker 2>the same shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of your personalities is really</v>

749
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:33.161
<v Speaker 2>just you reacting and saying what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to say and doing what you have to </v>

750
00:34:33.161 --> 00:34:37.451
<v Speaker 2>do to get by in your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the core of everybody from </v>

751
00:34:37.451 --> 00:34:39.920
<v Speaker 2>fucking serial killers to to the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassionate people on Earth,</v>

752
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.040
<v Speaker 2>it's very likely that the consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the same male,</v>

753
00:34:43.041 --> 00:34:44.870
<v Speaker 2>female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all biological.</v>

754
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:48.490
<v Speaker 2>It's very logical that the thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible that the,</v>

755
00:34:48.491 --> 00:34:51.020
<v Speaker 2>the root of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about yourself as you,</v>

756
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:53.750
<v Speaker 2>that it's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>

757
00:34:55.190 --> 00:35:00.190
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow cats involved with that shit.</v>

758
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really interesting because then</v>

759
00:35:05.331 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Speaker 2>when there's like personality test on </v>
<v Speaker 2>websites,</v>

760
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:08.990
<v Speaker 2>like there's dating websites we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

761
00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.380
<v Speaker 2>So like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take personality tests so you're all</v>

762
00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:14.640
<v Speaker 2>trying to take a test that's based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

763
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.170
<v Speaker 2>you know the person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

764
00:35:16.171 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

765
00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:19.870
<v Speaker 2>how did they know it's personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests or stupid as fuck.</v>

766
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I just like same people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>glitter tags on their mind space,</v>

767
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:24.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you taking it?</v>

768
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:29.790
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what you're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities like once you go sit down </v>

769
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.790
<v Speaker 2>in the grass by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And think about shit,</v>

770
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:34.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a goddamn meditation class at a </v>

771
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.061
<v Speaker 2>certain point in time as a human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being to become responsible for </v>

772
00:35:37.061 --> 00:35:37.061
<v Speaker 2>your own biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:35:37.061 --> 00:35:38.340
<v Speaker 2>and that's what we don't teach people </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

774
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:39.780
<v Speaker 2>we need to teach kids in school.</v>

775
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:40.890
<v Speaker 2>There needs to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

776
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Speaker 2>you have math and you have English and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these are all very important subjects,</v>

777
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:46.350
<v Speaker 2>but we also need is how to manage your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

778
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 2>how to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to think correctly,</v>

779
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.180
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when something comes up in your life,</v>

780
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:53.670
<v Speaker 2>how to deal with it and turn it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

781
00:35:53.671 --> 00:35:56.970
<v Speaker 2>to your advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How not to go into a negative spiral and</v>

782
00:35:56.971 --> 00:36:00.000
<v Speaker 2>have your whole fucking life fall apart </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of one thing and that that's.</v>

783
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 2>These are very important that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn how to think,</v>

784
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 2>how to control your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

785
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:08.460
<v Speaker 2>and how many people actually do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that many,</v>

786
00:36:08.461 --> 00:36:13.461
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's not that many people </v>

787
00:36:13.461 --> 00:36:13.461
<v Speaker 2>really know how to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

788
00:36:13.461 --> 00:36:16.970
<v Speaker 2>how to think positively,</v>

<v Speaker 2>How to move your life into the way you </v>

790
00:36:19.881 --> 00:36:20.550
<v Speaker 2>move your life into a healthy place.</v>

791
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Very hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because we're all starting from </v>

792
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:25.580
<v Speaker 2>scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

793
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.190
<v Speaker 2>we're all starting from scratch where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to read books.</v>

794
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:27.750
<v Speaker 2>We were never taught that shit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

795
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.930
<v Speaker 2>They'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they really want to teach you how to </v>

796
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.930
<v Speaker 2>be a good employee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>

797
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:33.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a good living.</v>

798
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 2>That's you being a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being better at being a person,</v>

799
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:39.900
<v Speaker 2>being better at managing your life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very important.</v>

800
00:36:39.901 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 2>They should be teaching kids how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think correctly,</v>

801
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:47.121
<v Speaker 2>like early in school and they should </v>
<v Speaker 2>have discipline and I don't mean </v>

802
00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:47.121
<v Speaker 2>discipline by like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

803
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:52.190
<v Speaker 2>do what everybody tells you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not discipline with discipline </v>

804
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.860
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you have to do a certain amount.</v>

805
00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 2>You have to do something like do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

806
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whether it's swimming or archery or</v>

807
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.180
<v Speaker 2>playing chess or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing Jujitsu for kids,</v>

808
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.300
<v Speaker 2>having something that's difficult to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is very important.</v>

809
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.130
<v Speaker 2>They need to be pushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

810
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:09.330
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important.</v>

811
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:14.331
<v Speaker 2>You could develop so much more of who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are if you've already pushed your </v>

812
00:37:14.331 --> 00:37:15.000
<v Speaker 2>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're been lazy,</v>

813
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:17.760
<v Speaker 2>your whole life is so hard to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being lazy anymore,</v>

814
00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:20.310
<v Speaker 2>and this is all shit that they should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching in school,</v>

815
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:25.311
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should totally be teaching that shit </v>

816
00:37:25.311 --> 00:37:25.311
<v Speaker 2>in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:37:25.311 --> 00:37:25.440
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

818
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.000
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fucking taught us.</v>

819
00:37:27.001 --> 00:37:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Columbus discovered America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.610
<v Speaker 2>that was still being taught and now we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know for a fact he didn't it.</v>

821
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it still is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

822
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:35.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

823
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still,</v>

824
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:41.630
<v Speaker 2>we celebrate Columbus Day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think now they say he landed in </v>

825
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.630
<v Speaker 2>the West indies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what your question was.</v>

826
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Was the gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we serious about our dolphin stuff?</v>

827
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

828
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Dolphins rape other dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

829
00:37:49.231 --> 00:37:50.640
<v Speaker 2>I know they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

830
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.460
<v Speaker 2>They rape other dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat dolphin babies.</v>

831
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:54.660
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

832
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:59.990
<v Speaker 2>infanticide and dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it's called is what </v>

833
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:04.071
<v Speaker 2>they do is the female dolphins try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck as many male dolphins as they can </v>

834
00:38:04.071 --> 00:38:08.240
<v Speaker 2>because if they run across a male </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphin that they haven't fucked and </v>

835
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.901
<v Speaker 2>they have babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the male might kill the babies to get </v>

836
00:38:11.901 --> 00:38:14.070
<v Speaker 2>the female to breed because the females </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't breed while they're taking care of</v>

837
00:38:14.071 --> 00:38:19.071
<v Speaker 2>the young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have to fuck as many male </v>

838
00:38:19.071 --> 00:38:21.420
<v Speaker 2>dolphins as they can so that when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do come across a male dolphin and he's,</v>

839
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.670
<v Speaker 2>he sees him with the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she fucked him,</v>

840
00:38:23.671 --> 00:38:25.750
<v Speaker 2>he won't kill the babies because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know if they're his.</v>

841
00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.290
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:31.820
<v Speaker 2>rape and kill babies too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

843
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

844
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean we don't do it in such large </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers as dolphins though I dolphins do</v>

845
00:38:35.801 --> 00:38:37.870
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kind of like as a matter of,</v>

846
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more board they're need in the </v>

847
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:43.200
<v Speaker 2>water on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

848
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:43.840
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's that the board.</v>

849
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:46.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it's that they can affect their </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

850
00:38:46.751 --> 00:38:49.870
<v Speaker 2>We see evolution in dolphins and it's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very strange scale.</v>

851
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.690
<v Speaker 2>It's very much different than ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're,</v>

852
00:38:51.691 --> 00:38:54.280
<v Speaker 2>they're super intelligent and cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:38:54.281 --> 00:38:59.281
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these amazing abilities to </v>

854
00:38:59.281 --> 00:39:00.901
<v Speaker 2>communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet they can't move anything with </v>

855
00:39:00.901 --> 00:39:00.901
<v Speaker 2>their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't create anything.</v>

856
00:39:00.901 --> 00:39:01.530
<v Speaker 2>So they're out in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So their,</v>

857
00:39:01.531 --> 00:39:03.880
<v Speaker 2>their world is just way harsher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're basically,</v>

858
00:39:03.881 --> 00:39:07.060
<v Speaker 2>dolphins are like the fucking blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in Avatar,</v>

859
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:12.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blue people and advertiser like </v>

860
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:12.420
<v Speaker 2>super intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

861
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:12.420
<v Speaker 2>these motherfuckers live in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be hard,</v>

862
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:17.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some soft dude behind a computer </v>

863
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:17.250
<v Speaker 2>keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

864
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:17.250
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be like that crazy.</v>

865
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.940
<v Speaker 2>But shooting arrows at those crazy black</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog things,</v>

866
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's.</v>

867
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:20.770
<v Speaker 2>The dolphins are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

868
00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:22.780
<v Speaker 2>they're in the fucking woods there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>

869
00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:24.410
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's sharks out there.</v>

870
00:39:24.411 --> 00:39:27.820
<v Speaker 2>And men show killer whales eat dolphins </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

871
00:39:27.821 --> 00:39:29.740
<v Speaker 2>They're cousins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison's your cousin eight.</v>

872
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:33.040
<v Speaker 2>You killer whales will fuck up some </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolphins.</v>

873
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:36.400
<v Speaker 2>They fuck up sharks to kill the whales </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the pimps have the ocean.</v>

874
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.380
<v Speaker 2>They're just running shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

875
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.600
<v Speaker 2>they don't take shit from nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

876
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:45.601
<v Speaker 2>the only people they do is people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing that they take </v>

877
00:39:45.601 --> 00:39:45.690
<v Speaker 2>shit from because people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

878
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.670
<v Speaker 2>a store that I read on the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this I would like to add,</v>

879
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.670
<v Speaker 2>ask you twitter people and people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching on ustream.</v>

880
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.680
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>

881
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:57.400
<v Speaker 2>if it's possible that this is a true </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

882
00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:02.640
<v Speaker 2>What I heard was that the orcas or </v>
<v Speaker 2>killer whales used to attack people and </v>

883
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:04.390
<v Speaker 2>been attacking people for a long time.</v>

884
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.360
<v Speaker 2>But then after World War Two they </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped.</v>

885
00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:12.660
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why it's this </v>
<v Speaker 2>American soldiers were apparently I'm </v>

886
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.280
<v Speaker 2>targeting killer whales in the ocean for</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

887
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they would work on their.</v>

888
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:21.490
<v Speaker 2>They're shooting out of the planes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would drop bombs on them and shit.</v>

889
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 2>The whales just completely stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating people.</v>

890
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>

891
00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:27.520
<v Speaker 2>that seems like something somebody made </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

892
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it?</v>

893
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.750
<v Speaker 2>But what if it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be pretty fucking crazy,</v>

894
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know culture is,</v>

895
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:36.190
<v Speaker 2>do have like images,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like old eskimo images,</v>

896
00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:37.990
<v Speaker 2>just like a killer whale attacking </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

897
00:40:37.991 --> 00:40:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Like really ancient stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>

898
00:40:40.241 --> 00:40:42.010
<v Speaker 2>A hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

899
00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.230
<v Speaker 2>And they knew what was up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

900
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:49.231
<v Speaker 2>if like other goal of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers can fly now and trap </v>

901
00:40:49.231 --> 00:40:49.231
<v Speaker 2>shifts when was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

902
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:50.890
<v Speaker 2>We're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just we tap.</v>

903
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if they eat everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would they eat?</v>

904
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.800
<v Speaker 2>People?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They save people all the time.</v>

905
00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Like that's really nutty when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about an animal that's that </v>

906
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:02.010
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like murders,</v>

907
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people fall in the ocean,</v>

908
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.920
<v Speaker 2>killer whales have been known and many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times to nudge people towards boats and </v>

909
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:07.920
<v Speaker 2>help them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

910
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

911
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:14.650
<v Speaker 2>Same as dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then none of them fuck with people </v>

912
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:14.650
<v Speaker 2>because we have the ability to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>our environment.</v>

913
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.490
<v Speaker 2>They're just as ruthless just as smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're fucked with their bodies.</v>

914
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.060
<v Speaker 2>A little fucking flippers and shit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you up if you're in their world,</v>

915
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.950
<v Speaker 2>but that's what you need to get by in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their world.</v>

916
00:41:23.951 --> 00:41:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Our world requires much more finer </v>
<v Speaker 2>moves,</v>

917
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our ability to manipulate shit.</v>

918
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Like had things gone just a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>different in evolution.</v>

919
00:41:32.501 --> 00:41:37.501
<v Speaker 2>If you believe in evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the dolphins and easily they </v>

920
00:41:37.501 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 2>can easily be and shit the killer whales</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dolphins.</v>

921
00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if there was something like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>with us,</v>

922
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.250
<v Speaker 2>if those were all the same intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine there's something like that with</v>

923
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some giant trolls that were just as</v>

924
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 2>smart as us and would come in and kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

925
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Show up at your village and start eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

926
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Jack in us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's us and monkeys.</v>

928
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Beowulf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

929
00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:59.951
<v Speaker 2>that's us in monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at like African countries </v>

930
00:41:59.951 --> 00:42:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Bushmeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the cell chimpanzee hands his </v>

931
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.881
<v Speaker 2>ass trays and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just go into the forest and fuck </v>

932
00:42:05.881 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 2>those things up and eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

933
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.570
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty crazy when you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

934
00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:10.130
<v Speaker 2>what other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that with us.</v>

935
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.110
<v Speaker 2>That could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

936
00:42:12.111 --> 00:42:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Nothing can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

937
00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:15.980
<v Speaker 2>we didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you fucking imagine?</v>

938
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are predators,</v>

939
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.560
<v Speaker 2>humans if you're around them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

940
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.070
<v Speaker 2>for the most part they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent.</v>

941
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 2>These fucking things are intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>killer whales or just the smartest.</v>

942
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Often their genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like the smartest human </v>

943
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:33.220
<v Speaker 2>supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

944
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:33.220
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

945
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.860
<v Speaker 2>you imagine subject as smart as people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but giant and likes to eat us.</v>

946
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

947
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.330
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go,</v>

948
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build our enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our Predator,</v>

949
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:48.971
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build our predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some some new months are going to come </v>

950
00:42:48.971 --> 00:42:52.001
<v Speaker 2>from the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would never be able to get to this </v>

951
00:42:52.001 --> 00:42:54.101
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why we've got to this point </v>

952
00:42:54.101 --> 00:42:56.060
<v Speaker 2>culture or with technology and with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>inventions and all the shit,</v>

953
00:42:56.061 --> 00:42:57.740
<v Speaker 2>the reason why it's because no one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been eating us.</v>

954
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:03.040
<v Speaker 2>We've had all this downtime with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this downtime to come up with things </v>

955
00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.620
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise we would've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten to this point.</v>

956
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.420
<v Speaker 2>He never be comfortable enough to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

957
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:10.540
<v Speaker 2>crunching algorithms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how to make a </v>

958
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:10.540
<v Speaker 2>pentium processor.</v>

959
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.660
<v Speaker 2>You would never get to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be constantly running from the </v>

960
00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:13.760
<v Speaker 2>giant troll people that want to eat your</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

961
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:19.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just kill people and the way </v>

962
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.230
<v Speaker 2>chimps eat monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever watched the which Mc?</v>

963
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Hammer parties and while they're alive </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't tell them.</v>

964
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:27.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing about predators </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to kill people and then eat them </v>

965
00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.170
<v Speaker 2>like big cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

966
00:43:30.171 --> 00:43:31.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

967
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.350
<v Speaker 2>animals that like kill things for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>

968
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:34.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like big cats,</v>

969
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:39.490
<v Speaker 2>big cats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only eat grass so they can throw </v>

970
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:39.490
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all they do.</v>

971
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 2>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

972
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:40.940
<v Speaker 2>these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>

973
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.860
<v Speaker 2>when they catch something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very important that they kill it.</v>

974
00:43:42.861 --> 00:43:44.450
<v Speaker 2>So they just grabbed him by the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jack,</v>

975
00:43:44.451 --> 00:43:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

976
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 2>chimps don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chimps eat berries,</v>

977
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 2>they eat all kinds of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're omnivores.</v>

978
00:43:50.481 --> 00:43:53.240
<v Speaker 2>They can eat meat or vegetables and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruits.</v>

979
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.560
<v Speaker 2>So when they kill monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like their favorite shit to do,</v>

980
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.170
<v Speaker 2>they love monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love to eat them.</v>

981
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.990
<v Speaker 2>And they have all these elaborate traps </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they,</v>

982
00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:03.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

988
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They eat them alive,</v>

989
00:44:19.581 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 2>they rip them apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't kill him.</v>

990
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:22.730
<v Speaker 2>First it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing with bears.</v>

998
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:44.640

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the one.</v>

1034
00:46:11.341 --> 00:46:12.770
<v Speaker 2>It's ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

1035
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:18.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll take this link and I'll throw it up</v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter right now from a peoples when</v>

1036
00:46:22.221 --> 00:46:27.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm really high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't type that good if I think about </v>

1037
00:46:27.221 --> 00:46:27.221
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1038
00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.020
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me</v>

1039
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:32.150
<v Speaker 2>into the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Los Angeles Zoo.</v>

1040
00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to go to the zoo after the </v>

1041
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.881
<v Speaker 2>last time I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote that piece about the zoo animal </v>

1042
00:46:39.881 --> 00:46:39.881
<v Speaker 2>prison on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the blog.</v>

1043
00:46:39.881 --> 00:46:42.110
<v Speaker 2>But I realized because I was super baked</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when,</v>

1044
00:46:42.111 --> 00:46:42.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1045
00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:47.700
<v Speaker 2>like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about earlier when </v>

1046
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.511
<v Speaker 2>you super bait dealing much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive than I was watching these </v>

1047
00:46:49.511 --> 00:46:49.511
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1048
00:46:49.511 --> 00:46:53.441
<v Speaker 2>this is a horrendous life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because they can move doesn't mean </v>

1049
00:46:53.441 --> 00:46:56.171
<v Speaker 2>they're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't allow the predators to kill </v>

1050
00:46:56.171 --> 00:46:56.171
<v Speaker 2>and eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the,</v>

1051
00:46:56.171 --> 00:46:57.840
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take you away and eat,</v>

1052
00:46:57.841 --> 00:46:59.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't talk to people ever again.</v>

1053
00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:00.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

1054
00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.560
<v Speaker 2>you get locked up in a room by yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1055
00:47:02.561 --> 00:47:05.090
<v Speaker 2>and something else other than you has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stare at you.</v>

1056
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you don't even get a,</v>

1057
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:08.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1058
00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.660
<v Speaker 2>the one pleasure that animals that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators get.</v>

1059
00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:15.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean the reason why they go after the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kill,</v>

1060
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:19.310
<v Speaker 2>it must be orgasmic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's what they need to stay alive</v>

1061
00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:24.580
<v Speaker 2>and they're doing it with their mouth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're feeling the life leave the </v>

1062
00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:25.340
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it's,</v>

1063
00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:29.030
<v Speaker 2>it's imperative for them to be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome at killing things in,</v>

1064
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.680
<v Speaker 2>for them to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what must that feel like to them?</v>

1065
00:47:32.681 --> 00:47:35.500
<v Speaker 2>It must be incredible when it feels good</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us to fuck.</v>

1066
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:37.300
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1067
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:39.790
<v Speaker 2>it's not even important that we fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1068
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:44.470
<v Speaker 2>But it's your body is so programmed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the years of evolution to think that</v>

1069
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:46.720
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important to make new human being.</v>

1070
00:47:46.721 --> 00:47:49.240
<v Speaker 2>So you get this fantastic reward when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you fuck.</v>

1071
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.830
<v Speaker 2>It just feels so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what it really is,</v>

1072
00:47:51.831 --> 00:47:53.650
<v Speaker 2>it's just nature trying to trick you </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

1073
00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:58.651
<v Speaker 2>making sure that you're rewarded for </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing what you have to do to stay alive </v>

1074
00:47:58.651 --> 00:48:00.460
<v Speaker 2>and to continue to race well with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jaguar every day.</v>

1075
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.190
<v Speaker 2>You have to kill some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking,</v>

1076
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:08.191
<v Speaker 2>the physical rush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sensation of chasing something down </v>

1077
00:48:08.191 --> 00:48:11.940
<v Speaker 2>as it's running through the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not sure if you're going to get it and </v>

1078
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they get away and Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got that motherfucker right by the </v>

1079
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.841
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He feel a heartbeat and it's legs are </v>

1080
00:48:18.841 --> 00:48:18.841
<v Speaker 2>kicking and just put that little </v>
<v Speaker 2>antelope down.</v>

1081
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:24.780
<v Speaker 2>That must be fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be fantastic and you don't even </v>

1082
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.141
<v Speaker 2>give him that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just put them in this cage and you </v>

1083
00:48:28.141 --> 00:48:28.630
<v Speaker 2>slide cold meat in a tray and he eats it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was like,</v>

1084
00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:33.631
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck did I do to deserve this </v>

1085
00:48:33.631 --> 00:48:34.870
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got to keep them around,</v>

1086
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I could see the argument much more to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill all the predators than I could to </v>

1087
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:42.380
<v Speaker 2>keep any of them around in cages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1088
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.080
<v Speaker 2>because I could see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1089
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:47.560
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get some video of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these animals that can eat us.</v>

1090
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:52.830
<v Speaker 2>We'll get some nice video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>documented a bunch of different formats </v>

1091
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.590
<v Speaker 2>and peg mov put an iphone and then we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to kill them.</v>

1092
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.340
<v Speaker 2>We're going to kill all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that kills us,</v>

1093
00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.010
<v Speaker 3>but why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if they were to do it?</v>

1094
00:48:59.011 --> 00:49:04.011
<v Speaker 3>Like they had a huge open crazy space </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they made it kind of like fun and </v>

1095
00:49:04.011 --> 00:49:05.970
<v Speaker 3>everything that they would want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they would like throw on like,</v>

00:49:05.971 --> 00:49:07.830
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a cow onto the situation.</v>

1097
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1098
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you want them.</v>

1099
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.370
<v Speaker 2>The problem is people don't want to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>

1100
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:18.250
<v Speaker 2>How about in the day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1101
00:49:18.251 --> 00:49:20.830
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to do instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really want to teach children,</v>

1102
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:26.030
<v Speaker 2>why is it okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of funny because why is it </v>

1103
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:28.351
<v Speaker 2>okay to watch something like that on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Geographic show on discovery </v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1106
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:38.310

<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it's called relentless </v>

1107
00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:38.310
<v Speaker 2>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking amazing documentary about</v>

1108
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 2>these lions in Africa that are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look like cartoon lines.</v>

1109
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:43.480
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1110
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:48.690
<v Speaker 2>like giant Mike Tyson lines that it's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous and the females are bigger </v>

1111
00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.260
<v Speaker 2>than normal African male lions or as </v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

1112
00:49:53.261 --> 00:49:55.960
<v Speaker 2>if not bigger than normal African male </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>

1113
00:49:55.961 --> 00:49:58.960
<v Speaker 2>which is an unprecedented mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never exists.</v>

1114
00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:04.140
<v Speaker 2>These fucking lions are gigantic and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why they're gigantic is because </v>

1115
00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:08.851
<v Speaker 2>they the river where they live changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>course about a hundred years ago and </v>

1116
00:50:08.851 --> 00:50:08.851
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1117
00:50:08.851 --> 00:50:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I may not even be 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might have been more recent than now.</v>

1118
00:50:12.281 --> 00:50:17.281
<v Speaker 2>I have to look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they got stuck on this one island </v>

1119
00:50:17.281 --> 00:50:20.860
<v Speaker 2>with water buffalo only water buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in order to survive,</v>

1120
00:50:20.861 --> 00:50:23.410
<v Speaker 2>they had an only killed the toughest </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to kill.</v>

1121
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.440
<v Speaker 2>So these giant fucking water buffaloes </v>
<v Speaker 2>are dangerous as fuck.</v>

1122
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:32.710
<v Speaker 2>They're super powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got these giant horns and </v>

1123
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:35.261
<v Speaker 2>they'll come at you and stomp your ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they get broken legs and they can't </v>

1124
00:50:35.261 --> 00:50:36.110
<v Speaker 2>hunt again and then the fucking they </v>
<v Speaker 2>starve to death.</v>

1125
00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:39.170

<v Speaker 2>everything gets cooked and they happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time throughout the galaxy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we'd be cooked instantly.</v>

1153
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Like it just blows everything apart all </v>
<v Speaker 2>around it.</v>

1154
00:51:58.611 --> 00:52:03.611
<v Speaker 2>Like this insane event where these </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirals of energy blast out from the </v>

<v Speaker 2>None of the Amazon.</v>

1204
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:15.651
<v Speaker 2>It rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Congo has only existed in that form </v>

1205
00:54:15.651 --> 00:54:19.200
<v Speaker 2>for like a few thousand years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years before that it was </v>

1206
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.831
<v Speaker 2>like grasslands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's animals that are trapped </v>

1207
00:54:22.831 --> 00:54:25.210
<v Speaker 2>inside the Congo that are animals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>live on the grass plains,</v>

1208

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:33.810
<v Speaker 2>And there's one little antelope that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed the ability to swim underwater</v>

1210
00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:39.360
<v Speaker 2>because the Congo was filled with water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop the ability to swim underwater </v>

1211
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.781
<v Speaker 2>up to a hundred yards and it eats fish </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a fucking antelope.</v>

<v Speaker 2>evolution dictated that this animal </v>

1214
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:48.970
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

00:54:48.971 --> 00:54:53.971
<v Speaker 2>and that happened over 2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fish in the Amazon that comes </v>

<v Speaker 2>anything that's affects your </v>

1314
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.580
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can buy stuff that's poisonous,</v>

1315
00:59:15.581 --> 00:59:19.960
<v Speaker 2>like you can legally have a bunch of </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1317
00:59:23.361 --> 00:59:28.361
<v Speaker 2>it's like you just having marijuana in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your backyard is not proof that you're </v>

1318
00:59:28.361 --> 00:59:31.991
<v Speaker 2>eating marijuana or using it and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all these poisonous plants in your </v>

1319
00:59:31.991 --> 00:59:32.960
<v Speaker 2>backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody would even bat an eye.</v>

1322
00:59:36.881 --> 00:59:41.881
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really so weird that people allow </v>

1323
00:59:41.881 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 2>in this day and age with all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that we have,</v>

1324
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 2>allow plants to be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1327
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:55.990
<v Speaker 2>We enforce it so strictly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a strong ethic in our culture </v>

1328
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:59.501
<v Speaker 2>that if we catch you using certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>plants that have nothing to do with me,</v>

1329
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.520
<v Speaker 2>they're not effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

1330
01:00:01.521 --> 01:00:06.521

<v Speaker 2>compare something you use for personal </v>

1373
01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:53.520
<v Speaker 2>use to al Qaeda is ridiculous.</v>

1374
01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is like it's very </v>

1375
01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:58.320
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana doesn't do that.</v>

1376
01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Even alcoholism killed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many people think about how fucked up </v>

1377
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:05.200
<v Speaker 2>alcohol gets you and alcohol poisoning </v>
<v Speaker 2>or alcohol deaths.</v>

1378
01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:09.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not nearly as high as cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cigarettes is a motherfucker and it's so</v>

1379
01:02:09.491 --> 01:02:10.860
<v Speaker 2>hard to kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1380
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:12.400
<v Speaker 2>You went back on him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1383
01:02:16.751 --> 01:02:19.380
<v Speaker 2>One little thing will set that trigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>off in the back of head.</v>

1384
01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly stress stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible,</v>

1385
01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:27.411

<v Speaker 2>they're sneaking up on Eskimo villages </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that they can't see the black.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everything is white.</v>

1434
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000

1435
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.310
<v Speaker 2>black nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how fucking evil they are,</v>

<v Speaker 3>say like an apple product,</v>

1602
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:23.850
<v Speaker 3>then the next time apple has a product </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1603
01:12:23.851 --> 01:12:25.990
<v Speaker 3>they'll give them like an exclusive.</v>

1604
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:28.440
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these websites don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bash her,</v>

1605
01:12:28.441 --> 01:12:33.441
<v Speaker 3>tell the truth because they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to ruin future products and stuff like </v>

1606
01:12:33.441 --> 01:12:33.441

1616
01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:03.921
<v Speaker 6>sensory deprivation tank.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that would be a fucking cool thing</v>

1617
01:13:04.471 --> 01:13:05.380
<v Speaker 6>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

1618
01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 6>Actually it sounds like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would it be?</v>

1619
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:09.660
<v Speaker 6>Would it sound like that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>

1620
01:13:09.661 --> 01:13:12.690
<v Speaker 6>Is there a way that I could have </v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody recording sound in there?</v>

1621
01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1622
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:19.490
<v Speaker 3>he can't get away and then we can hook </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1623
01:13:19.491 --> 01:13:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Might put a microphone right at two next</v>
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>

1624
01:13:21.511 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 3>But I mean there was some more both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know and all that stuff because it's</v>

1625
01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:26.780
<v Speaker 3>echoing in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:27.810
<v Speaker 3>But who wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1627
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:28.260
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1628
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.250
<v Speaker 3>you mean just lay there and talk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:33.280
<v Speaker 3>Well we could just turn off the lights </v>
<v Speaker 3>here and you can talk and.</v>

1630
01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:36.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1631
01:13:36.231 --> 01:13:37.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to totally do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Winning,</v>

1632
01:13:37.761 --> 01:13:41.060
<v Speaker 3>that defeat the purpose of being in </v>
<v Speaker 3>isolation tank.</v>

1633
01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:41.810
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1634
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:43.700
<v Speaker 3>You will be too focused on talking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1635
01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:44.470
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1636
01:13:44.471 --> 01:13:47.770
<v Speaker 6>because it would be talking to people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your mind would work so much better than</v>

1637
01:13:47.771 --> 01:13:52.771
<v Speaker 6>it works with sitting in a normal </v>
<v Speaker 6>environment like here talking to you and</v>

1638
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.010
<v Speaker 6>sitting on a couch and lights and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>laptop and all this input coming in.</v>

1639
01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:02.250
<v Speaker 6>You don't realize how much this has an </v>
<v Speaker 6>effect on your ability to see things </v>

1640
01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:06.031
<v Speaker 6>clearly and you see things very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very clear in that tank and I think if </v>

1641
01:14:06.031 --> 01:14:06.640
<v Speaker 6>you're in that tank and you just start </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking,</v>

1642
01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 6>it's going to fuck up a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the experience because you're going to </v>

1643
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.040
<v Speaker 6>hear things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You hear yourself in both in your ears,</v>

1644
01:14:13.041 --> 01:14:14.140
<v Speaker 6>so hear to your ears.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you hear it?</v>

1645
01:14:14.141 --> 01:14:14.250
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

1646
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:18.480
<v Speaker 3>Had you've lost your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it'd be kind of cool.</v>

1647
01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:24.090
<v Speaker 3>I will do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to figure out a way where I </v>

1648
01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:24.090
<v Speaker 3>can do a podcast</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's not necessary.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm not trying to shy away</v>

1684
01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:54.300
<v Speaker 3>looking at my cuff links,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at diamonds,</v>

<v Speaker 6>trying to look good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just try to just do my job.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's not me.</v>

1689
01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 2>What kind of we did we smoke before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

1691
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:14.200
<v Speaker 2>federal agent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the funniest things that I</v>

1692
01:16:14.201 --> 01:16:17.380
<v Speaker 2>like when someone will ask a stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>question and someone will go like,</v>

1693
01:16:17.381 --> 01:16:22.381
<v Speaker 2>laziest homo ever laziest pedo ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>lasers.</v>

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Dea Age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

1695
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.170
<v Speaker 2>And it's become like a standard was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1696
01:16:26.171 --> 01:16:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who was the first one to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1697
01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:31.360
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen it many forums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where it started from,</v>

1698
01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:36.780
<v Speaker 2>but so many people do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone will ask a dumb question and </v>

1699
01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:36.780
<v Speaker 2>someone will China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1700
01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.860
<v Speaker 2>China with that.</v>

1701
01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:41.140
<v Speaker 2>like whenever people ask like drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>

1702
01:16:41.141 --> 01:16:42.690
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Would you say that's the lexicon?</v>

1706
01:16:50.081 --> 01:16:51.590

1739
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 2>well they've passed one step of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>multistep process to making it illegal </v>

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably be over 18 or 21.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it should be over 18 I think.</v>

1742
01:18:21.601 --> 01:18:24.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know like alcohol I think.</v>

1743
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.840
<v Speaker 2>I think alcohol should be 18 with </v>
<v Speaker 2>supervision,</v>

1744
01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:29.760
<v Speaker 2>meaning like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1745
01:18:29.761 --> 01:18:34.761
<v Speaker 2>it should be okay for like your dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you a beer when you're 18 years </v>

1746
01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:34.761
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1747
01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:37.160
<v Speaker 2>or you come with your dad to a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>where his buddy has a bar and you know,</v>

1748
01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:39.560
<v Speaker 2>just going to call him a boy beers </v>
<v Speaker 2>number that'll be here before,</v>

1749
01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly introduce them into the world and</v>

1750
01:18:41.491 --> 01:18:46.491
<v Speaker 2>make it like it's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to learn how to hold your </v>

1751
01:18:46.491 --> 01:18:46.491
<v Speaker 2>liquor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1752
01:18:46.491 --> 01:18:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from your fucking father,</v>

1753
01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:49.530
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as a young man,</v>

1754
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:53.280
<v Speaker 2>I let him take away all of the mystique </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what alcohol really is.</v>

1755
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:58.430
<v Speaker 2>And that should be the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real problem with any thing that </v>

1756
01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:01.941
<v Speaker 2>affects your mind is that we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough people out there that are </v>

1757
01:19:01.941 --> 01:19:02.940
<v Speaker 2>explaining to people how to manage that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1758
01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:08.240
<v Speaker 2>And with alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least they have alcoholics anonymous </v>

1759
01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.611
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can help guide you back on the </v>

1760
01:19:10.611 --> 01:19:10.611
<v Speaker 2>right track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1761
01:19:10.611 --> 01:19:13.881
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no people out there that are telling </v>

1762
01:19:13.881 --> 01:19:13.881
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1763
01:19:13.881 --> 01:19:13.881
<v Speaker 2>like explaining to you how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporate.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean shit,</v>

1766
01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.960
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should write a book about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a fucking good idea because</v>

1767
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.830
<v Speaker 2>what really we need in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it sounds like all spiritual,</v>

1768
01:19:25.831 --> 01:19:30.831
<v Speaker 2>crazy Voodoo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need Sharmane and what a shaman </v>

1769
01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:33.330
<v Speaker 2>is in like in the Amazon rainforest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys would make the IOWASCA.</v>

1770
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:35.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a dude who's been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>done that.</v>

1771
01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.270
<v Speaker 2>He's done it a thousand times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knows what to expect.</v>

1772
01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.890
<v Speaker 2>He knows what's gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not scared of it.</v>

1773
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:44.190
<v Speaker 2>He enjoys and welcomes the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could talk you through it.</v>

1774
01:19:44.191 --> 01:19:46.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to freak the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy is going to help you,</v>

1775
01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.140
<v Speaker 2>he's going to sing songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to comfort you,</v>

1776
01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:54.230
<v Speaker 2>they're going to play the drums and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get to talk to dead </v>

1777
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:54.230
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1778
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:58.340
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a showman and we need a shaman for </v>

1779
01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.670
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and we really could use a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shotgun for alcohol to this.</v>

1780
01:19:59.671 --> 01:20:02.490
<v Speaker 2>She would be someone who culturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>explained to the group.</v>

1781
01:20:02.491 --> 01:20:07.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be like expressed as an </v>

1782
01:20:07.491 --> 01:20:09.771
<v Speaker 2>ethic through the entire human community</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's wrong to be drunk and </v>

1783
01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:14.751
<v Speaker 2>obnoxious and be a fucking douche bag </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ruined other people's good time and </v>

1784
01:20:14.751 --> 01:20:14.751
<v Speaker 2>that should be something we all agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon.</v>

1785
01:20:14.751 --> 01:20:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be something funny like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1786
01:20:16.371 --> 01:20:18.810
<v Speaker 2>maybe I told him he got drunk and rip </v>
<v Speaker 2>the girl shirt.</v>

1787
01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.770
<v Speaker 2>That should be horrifying to everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

1788
01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:27.980
<v Speaker 2>We should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that is is the reason why we don't </v>

1789
01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 2>address that is we have this crazy way </v>
<v Speaker 2>of looking at drugs.</v>

1790
01:20:28.981 --> 01:20:30.970
<v Speaker 2>We look at drugs like [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all bad.</v>

1791
01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:36.130
<v Speaker 2>They're all under this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same is one gigantic carpet of </v>

1792
01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:37.950
<v Speaker 2>everything's bad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not necessarily bad for you.</v>

1793
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.130
<v Speaker 2>It's only bad for some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good for some people.</v>

1794
01:20:41.131 --> 01:20:43.920
<v Speaker 2>The experience is benefit you then make </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life more interesting.</v>

1795
01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Should Sharman be driving while giving </v>
<v Speaker 3>advice?</v>

1796
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to promise me if you get 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>year old and then that person just got </v>

1797
01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:53.600
<v Speaker 3>their license two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>

1798
01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Not to fucking drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1799
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:55.960
<v Speaker 3>drive reckless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1800
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:58.450
<v Speaker 2>It drive too fast and then they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at it.</v>

1801
01:20:58.451 --> 01:20:59.940
<v Speaker 2>That was me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was terrible driver.</v>

1802
01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:02.710
<v Speaker 2>So lucky and I have a dwi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1803
01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:03.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1804
01:21:03.670 --> 01:21:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever get one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1805
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Never got one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1806
01:21:07.810 --> 01:21:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I never drove that drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I probably could have like,</v>

1807
01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:12.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the legal limit is like</v>

1808
01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:15.600
<v Speaker 3>I try to do one day or an hour pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

1809
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:16.550
<v Speaker 3>It's one bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1810
01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:19.080
<v Speaker 3>Have you had one beer and you get pulled</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 20 minutes later?</v>

1811
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.520
<v Speaker 3>I bet you could probably get nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if you say borderline</v>

1812
01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.250
<v Speaker 2>for a half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second beer.</v>

1813
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1814
01:21:26.170 --> 01:21:28.240
<v Speaker 2>But with a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good man.</v>

1815
01:21:28.241 --> 01:21:30.310
<v Speaker 2>You really should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really shouldn't be driving anthony</v>

1816
01:21:30.311 --> 01:21:32.600
<v Speaker 2>from opie and Anthony has a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting point.</v>

1817
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:34.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I'm good but I drive drunk,</v>

1818
01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.090
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you kill a kid,</v>

1819
01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:39.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slammed into a family.</v>

1820
01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Well I would say I'm better than average</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving drunk,</v>

1821
01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.890
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no test for that.</v>

1822
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:49.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately they came to sit you down </v>

1823
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:49.950
<v Speaker 3>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1824
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:51.260
<v Speaker 3>you got to play fucking pole position </v>
<v Speaker 3>for an hour and skills.</v>

1825
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:52.880
<v Speaker 3>That's thing about marijuana.</v>

1826
01:21:53.210 --> 01:21:54.940
<v Speaker 2>If people are just more cautious when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're it,</v>

1827
01:21:55.130 --> 01:22:00.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think that marijuana affects </v>

1828
01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:00.130
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your reaction.</v>

1829
01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:00.130
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really doesn't.</v>

1830
01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:02.630
<v Speaker 2>I smoked marijuana and I do Jujitsu all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

1831
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:05.720
<v Speaker 2>So does Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like a bunch of different,</v>

1832
01:22:05.721 --> 01:22:08.210
<v Speaker 2>like really high level Brazilian Jiu </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jitsu guys,</v>

1833

<v Speaker 2>black belts that love to get high and </v>

1835
01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:19.391
<v Speaker 2>then go do Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it makes them connected to the </v>

1836
01:22:19.391 --> 01:22:19.391
<v Speaker 2>movements better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's makes you,</v>

1837
01:22:19.391 --> 01:22:20.840
<v Speaker 2>it's your very coordinated when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>

1838
01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's more like we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier with like being paranoid.</v>

1839
01:22:23.931 --> 01:22:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Paranoia is like too much information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to manage it.</v>

1840
01:22:26.961 --> 01:22:29.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not that it's a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1841
01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:32.150
<v Speaker 2>you're just getting too much info.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not keeping up with it.</v>

1842
01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.230
<v Speaker 2>That's where it all comes from.</v>

1843
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check this out.</v>

1844
01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:39.910

<v Speaker 3>but after having the t,</v>

1845
01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:43.620
<v Speaker 3>two Duis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the policeman that arrested him died</v>

1846
01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:48.040
<v Speaker 3>and so now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no proof or whatever.</v>

1847
01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:51.370
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy luck</v>

1848
01:22:53.530 --> 01:22:54.610
<v Speaker 2>for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the cop.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

01:22:57.231 --> 01:22:59.660
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be on celebrity rehab </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next few years.</v>

1851
01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

1852
01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Have you watched that show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1853
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I watched one episode because Stan hope </v>
<v Speaker 2>was mocking.</v>

1854
01:23:04.431 --> 01:23:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Dr Drew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1855
01:23:05.331 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I let me check this</v>

1856
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:06.720
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1857
01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:07.720
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what a train wreck.</v>

1858
01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.130
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy.</v>

1859
01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.680
<v Speaker 6>It's fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not addicted.</v>

1860
01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.800
<v Speaker 6>Is there anything that I could stop?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't have a problem with anything </v>

1861
01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:15.800
<v Speaker 6>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to have,</v>

1862
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:18.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my real problem has never been drugs.</v>

1863
01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:23.600
<v Speaker 6>My real problem is games.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a serious addiction to video </v>

1864
01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.621
<v Speaker 6>games and to pool pool I think is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit more meditation because it's </v>

1865
01:23:27.621 --> 01:23:32.601
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of handoff coordination and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to steady your nerves and it's </v>

1866
01:23:32.601 --> 01:23:32.601
<v Speaker 6>all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1867
01:23:32.601 --> 01:23:34.920
<v Speaker 6>controlling the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I get obsessed with games.</v>

1868
01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:40.060
<v Speaker 6>I got what I get when I play.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to play quake and I used to play </v>

1869
01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.790
<v Speaker 6>no bullshit eight hours a day at least </v>
<v Speaker 6>every day I was online.</v>

1870
01:23:41.791 --> 01:23:44.850
<v Speaker 6>I loved it and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm avoiding that on purpose.</v>

1871
01:23:44.851 --> 01:23:48.390
<v Speaker 6>So if I had like a PR thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>needed to kick at any point in my life,</v>

1872
01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:50.760
<v Speaker 6>it was never drugs and drugs weren't </v>
<v Speaker 6>ruining my life,</v>

1873
01:23:50.761 --> 01:23:52.560
<v Speaker 6>but video games were kind of running my </v>
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

1874
01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.170
<v Speaker 6>Not ruining it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they were.</v>

1875
01:23:54.210 --> 01:23:55.740
<v Speaker 6>It was becoming an,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an obsession.</v>

1876
01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.110
<v Speaker 6>The problem is I enjoy the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1877
01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:01.250
<v Speaker 6>Quake is so goddamn fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1878
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:03.260
<v Speaker 6>we're gonna try to create a capsule.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You never.</v>

1879
01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:04.930
<v Speaker 6>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're trying to quit caffeine.</v>

1880
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:05.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've quit.</v>

1881
01:24:05.461 --> 01:24:06.780
<v Speaker 6>Caffeine should.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard.</v>

1882
01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:07.710
<v Speaker 6>It is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or,</v>

1883
01:24:07.711 --> 01:24:09.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I realized that I needed to quit,</v>

1884
01:24:09.301 --> 01:24:11.760
<v Speaker 6>I was writing a blog a day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1885
01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:14.580
<v Speaker 6>that one time before a film my special,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wrote a blog every day.</v>

1886
01:24:14.670 --> 01:24:19.670

<v Speaker 6>because that's when I write my best </v>

1887

<v Speaker 6>I use a French press,</v>

1891
01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like I grind my own coffee,</v>

1892
01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:34.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get a bird grinder and I give these </v>

1893

<v Speaker 6>Hawaii and my favorite.</v>

<v Speaker 6>This shit is strong and I will take it </v>

<v Speaker 6>felt like shit the next day and I did it</v>

<v Speaker 6>could fix him.</v>

01:24:59.490 --> 01:25:00.390
<v Speaker 6>It felt like I just</v>

<v Speaker 4>like a short circuit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's not short for something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I own you motherfucker.</v>

1946
01:26:57.430 --> 01:27:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Have you been playing quake live at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked that up all the time.</v>

1947
01:27:01.471 --> 01:27:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Now everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were your mistake.</v>

1948
01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:10.220
<v Speaker 3>You're writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you can type fairly </v>

1949
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:10.220
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just things come on.</v>

1950
01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was thinking about getting a </v>

1951
01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.301
<v Speaker 3>regular phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a skinny like razor phone on verizon </v>

1952
01:27:15.301 --> 01:27:18.961
<v Speaker 3>network and then getting the IPAD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if I'm like out my car,</v>

1953
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:25.510
<v Speaker 3>pull up my ipad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a better internet but have a solid </v>

1954
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.510
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

1955
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.510
<v Speaker 5>Hm,</v>

1956
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:27.440
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to go back.</v>

1957
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think just as well.</v>

1958
01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:31.730
<v Speaker 2>But what if someone sends you a picture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A video on your phone?</v>

1959
01:27:31.731 --> 01:27:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Some asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this.</v>

1960
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Check this out.</v>

1961
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:35.700
<v Speaker 3>Did that now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1962
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:38.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did they go with 18 and t?</v>

1963
01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Well you don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1964
01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:42.820
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's thinking of this.</v>

1965
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.200
<v Speaker 3>They have those modifiers now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just have your mind,</v>

1966
01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.810
<v Speaker 3>a verizon network and now you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>horizon anywhere you go,</v>

1967
01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.970
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1968
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have these boxes that connect and </v>

1969
01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:55.450
<v Speaker 3>then broadcast wireless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called,</v>

1970
01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:57.080

<v Speaker 3>they're about this big.</v>

1971
01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:02.140
<v Speaker 3>So if you have a little case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a statue that you have your ipad </v>

1972
01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:02.140

<v Speaker 3>just have that,</v>

1973
01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:04.070
<v Speaker 3>throw that in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn it on and you have verizon.</v>

<v Speaker 3>be big man.</v>

1976
01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Persons are going to have to come back </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of this thing.</v>

1977
01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.620
<v Speaker 3>You know you're a big advocate of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage.</v>

1978
01:28:16.030 --> 01:28:19.190
<v Speaker 3>I actually bought a domain name and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>told her I was addicted to domain names.</v>

1979
01:28:19.191 --> 01:28:23.410
<v Speaker 3>I bought IPAD sling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you know anyone that's like,</v>

1991
01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:59.580
<v Speaker 3>So it looks like a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Satua base will fit the IPAD so it </v>

1992
01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:01.470
<v Speaker 3>doesn't look natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like it was for jewelry.</v>

1993
01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.760
<v Speaker 3>No makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't reviewed that.</v>

1998
01:29:23.841 --> 01:29:24.360
<v Speaker 3>can also sell ice or ipad slang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to sell them Ipad,</v>

1999
01:29:24.370 --> 01:29:27.090
<v Speaker 3>sling and not buying the I pad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2000
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:30.780
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't have a kindle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would see what you're saying and.</v>

2001
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:33.330
<v Speaker 3>But wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to buy a portable DVD player</v>

<v Speaker 3>for the car or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

2003
01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:36.430
<v Speaker 3>you want a good one though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>could download the movies while you're </v>

2005
01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:41.500
<v Speaker 3>in the car?</v>

2006
01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2007
01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.910
<v Speaker 3>how dope would it be if you had a screen</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your car and stopped?</v>

2008
01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:44.940
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do that.</v>

2009
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.400
<v Speaker 3>You could make that screen in your car </v>
<v Speaker 3>and install it as a screen.</v>

2010
01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could totally do.</v>

2011
01:29:48.271 --> 01:29:50.870
<v Speaker 3>That was thing that on the way over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that gps.</v>

2012
01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:56.360
<v Speaker 3>That might be the greatest thing ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's got to see how many inches is </v>

2013
01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:56.990
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nine point seven inches across.</v>

2014
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.280
<v Speaker 3>So thin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could just sit,</v>

2015
01:29:58.330 --> 01:30:01.200
<v Speaker 3>fit it right in your car and you feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>your dashboard fitted for it.</v>

2016
01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.480
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's really funny is a lot of</v>

2017
01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:05.770
<v Speaker 3>people are bashing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not widescreen.</v>

2018
01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:08.730
<v Speaker 3>Well alright there's going to be the bar</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the top and the bottom.</v>

2019
01:30:08.850 --> 01:30:10.980
<v Speaker 3>So they wanted a white skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you mean?</v>

2020
01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:14.430
<v Speaker 3>They wanted us to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted them to chop off the top and</v>

2021
01:30:14.431 --> 01:30:19.431
<v Speaker 3>bottom or make it bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you make it bigger than that thing </v>

2022
01:30:19.431 --> 01:30:20.430
<v Speaker 3>would be this big but widescreen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a letterbox thing.</v>

2023
01:30:20.431 --> 01:30:22.350
<v Speaker 3>When you watch a video you see a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>black stripe</v>

2024
01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:28.160
<v Speaker 6>but that's what they had to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what did to people don't get </v>

2025
01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.280
<v Speaker 6>widescreen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'll kill it.</v>

2026
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:34.550
<v Speaker 6>It definitely is better to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that you can read books and </v>

2027
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.550
<v Speaker 6>watch movies on if you look at it that </v>
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

2028
01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:40.100
<v Speaker 6>But the way I am video games still's not</v>
<v Speaker 6>that appealing to me because I already </v>

2029
01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:42.450
<v Speaker 6>have a laptop and if I'm going to spend </v>
<v Speaker 6>time like what is it going to give me?</v>

2030
01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:43.740
<v Speaker 6>The.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The laptop's not going to.</v>

2031
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:45.670
<v Speaker 6>I can watch movies on the laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

2032
01:30:45.671 --> 01:30:46.470
<v Speaker 6>which will be done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That.</v>

2033
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:48.780
<v Speaker 6>What else can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get online on that.</v>

2034
01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:52.140
<v Speaker 6>I get on my laptop better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what am I doing with it?</v>

2035
01:30:52.650 --> 01:30:54.750
<v Speaker 6>The applications really and why?</v>

2036
01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:55.430
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

2037
01:30:55.431 --> 01:31:00.431
<v Speaker 3>It's the size of a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what they're saying is that what if </v>

2038
01:31:00.431 --> 01:31:00.530
<v Speaker 3>you use it like you have a razor phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your pocket,</v>

2039
01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:05.680
<v Speaker 3>you go into the comedy club and you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little thing the size of a little </v>

2040
01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:05.680
<v Speaker 3>notepad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in a little leather pouch.</v>

2041
01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:09.991
<v Speaker 3>Him keep that bitch in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to pretend that you going </v>

2042
01:31:09.991 --> 01:31:09.991
<v Speaker 3>to carry this thing around with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

2043
01:31:09.991 --> 01:31:09.991
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2044
01:31:09.991 --> 01:31:10.490
<v Speaker 3>you throw it in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>

2045
01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.560
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a little book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little book,</v>

2046
01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:17.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you throw it in the car so that you </v>

2047
01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:17.620
<v Speaker 3>could use it when you're out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're out.</v>

2048
01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:19.580
<v Speaker 3>You if you have it in the like Steve </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jobs,</v>

2049
01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:24.840
<v Speaker 3>people are going to bring interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants and instead of texting </v>

2050
01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:25.700
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be sitting there moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>

2051
01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.390
<v Speaker 3>doing little g emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>checking their calendars.</v>

2052
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Steve Jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bashed.</v>

2053
01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.710
<v Speaker 3>I think people are Basset and freaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>out about it because there's a couple of</v>

2054
01:31:33.711 --> 01:31:37.130
<v Speaker 3>things that it doesn't do or doesn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>flash and stuff,</v>

2055
01:31:37.190 --> 01:31:39.480
<v Speaker 3>but that's another reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have jobs just fucking this up.</v>

2056
01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.830
<v Speaker 3>I think on the market people are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go crazy for it.</v>

2057
01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.360
<v Speaker 6>Analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Alright,</v>

2058
01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:48.740
<v Speaker 6>let's read some questions from these </v>
<v Speaker 6>people gears of war.</v>

2059
01:31:48.741 --> 01:31:50.900
<v Speaker 6>Fuck you have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That game was awesome.</v>

2060
01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:53.360
<v Speaker 6>That's another game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm scared of that game.</v>

2061
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:59.290
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to get locked in that world</v>
<v Speaker 6>of playing that Shit online everyday to </v>

2062
01:31:59.290 --> 01:31:59.770
<v Speaker 6>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2063
01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:03.820
<v Speaker 6>We got a chance to see that early on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We got a chance.</v>

2064
01:32:03.821 --> 01:32:07.180
<v Speaker 6>We were in North Carolina and I met </v>
<v Speaker 6>cliff.</v>

2065
01:32:07.181 --> 01:32:11.470
<v Speaker 6>He be from epic games and he got us in </v>
<v Speaker 6>and we gotta look at the models of.</v>

2066
01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:14.710
<v Speaker 6>Gives a war way before it was released.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was fucking crazy.</v>

2067
01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.510
<v Speaker 6>The new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're working on these new entities to</v>

2068
01:32:17.511 --> 01:32:20.040
<v Speaker 6>do so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he,</v>

2069
01:32:20.050 --> 01:32:25.050
<v Speaker 6>he showed us a demo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some of the stuff and the guys at ID </v>

2070
01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:27.541
<v Speaker 6>software did to Tim Wilson and Todd </v>
<v Speaker 6>Hollingshead and John Carmack and those </v>

2071
01:32:27.971 --> 01:32:29.320
<v Speaker 6>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those guys are super cool.</v>

2072
01:32:29.321 --> 01:32:34.321
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they let us come and check out all the </v>

2073
01:32:34.321 --> 01:32:34.321
<v Speaker 6>new stuff they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's my favorite all time games quick.</v>

2074
01:32:34.321 --> 01:32:34.870
<v Speaker 6>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm scared.</v>

2075
01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2076
01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:41.740
<v Speaker 3>they did a report on a browser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crashes on computers and I think it was </v>

2077
01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:47.650
<v Speaker 3>85 percent of all browser crashes were </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of Flash.</v>

2078
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.410
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big number.</v>

2079
01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>80 five.</v>

2080
01:32:52.941 --> 01:32:55.230
<v Speaker 3>Because other than flashed you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>javascript.</v>

2081
01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.580
<v Speaker 3>He got a couple of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but 85 percent of that's crazy.</v>

2082
01:32:58.581 --> 01:33:02.870
<v Speaker 3>Like how has that allowed people to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are freaking out about something.</v>

2083
01:33:02.871 --> 01:33:04.340
<v Speaker 3>It's a plugin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2084
01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:05.660
<v Speaker 3>html five point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2085
01:33:05.670 --> 01:33:08.960
<v Speaker 3>is about to come out which will make </v>
<v Speaker 3>flash pretty much unnecessary.</v>

2086
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:14.950
<v Speaker 3>How's it make less on this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well see the problem is they started </v>

2087
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:16.280
<v Speaker 3>using flash back in the day because that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was an easy way to take video,</v>

2088
01:33:16.281 --> 01:33:21.281
<v Speaker 3>put it on the Internet so anyone can </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it because people's Internet </v>

2089
01:33:21.281 --> 01:33:23.360
<v Speaker 3>connections kind of sucked and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was in one format.</v>

2090
01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:24.640
<v Speaker 3>What html?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five point.</v>

2091
01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:25.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty much make,</v>

2092
01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.970
<v Speaker 3>I think it's h,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two point six for like the video.</v>

2093
01:33:28.971 --> 01:33:32.040
<v Speaker 3>We'll just play in the browser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like our gift works,</v>

2094
01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:37.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like animated Gif will work no matter </v>

2095
01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:37.250
<v Speaker 3>what because it's made in the coating of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the browser.</v>

2096
01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:39.530
<v Speaker 3>So this will make videos and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2097
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Just be in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the coding and just work right now.</v>

2098
01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.990
<v Speaker 3>So guess who's who gets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's making our editing,</v>

2099
01:33:47.991 --> 01:33:51.660
<v Speaker 3>the html l point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five point zero coding.</v>

2100
01:33:51.770 --> 01:33:56.770
<v Speaker 3>This is kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy that works at Google and the guy </v>

2101
01:33:56.770 --> 01:33:56.770
<v Speaker 3>that works at Apple,</v>

2102
01:33:58.270 --> 01:34:01.520
<v Speaker 6>so you have long had this theory that </v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2103
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.770
<v Speaker 6>that there's a battle going on between a</v>
<v Speaker 6>apple and flash.</v>

2104
01:34:05.771 --> 01:34:10.771
<v Speaker 6>And you think that one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 6>why apple has such a hard time working </v>

2105
01:34:10.771 --> 01:34:12.730
<v Speaker 6>with flash and make it shitty on purpose</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that people move away from flash.</v>

2106
01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good good theory </v>

2107
01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:17.840
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the big thing is,</v>

2108
01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:21.951
<v Speaker 3>is that like no one in silicon valley </v>
<v Speaker 3>works together like Amazon and apple and</v>

2109
01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:25.320
<v Speaker 3>they're all not working together as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>team.</v>

2110
01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.280
<v Speaker 3>They're all like having to fight and do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2111
01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:31.020
<v Speaker 3>like the opposite of what this person's </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

2112
01:34:31.021 --> 01:34:36.021
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if a flash releases a new plugin </v>

2113
01:34:36.021 --> 01:34:38.220
<v Speaker 3>that works with firefox and or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>it but doesn't work for safari,</v>

2114
01:34:38.370 --> 01:34:43.370
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to work for safari.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Safari changes something and then it </v>

2115
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:43.370
<v Speaker 3>fucks all their shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2116
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:47.620
<v Speaker 3>it's constantly like that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in silicon valley because </v>

2117
01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:47.620
<v Speaker 3>they don't work together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They work together.</v>

2118
01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Just thing is going to go understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing conspiracy behind.</v>

2119
01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:54.110
<v Speaker 3>If I'm sensing flashes getting pushed </v>
<v Speaker 3>out for some reason.</v>

2120
01:34:54.111 --> 01:34:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Mostly because of the security reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very open a,</v>

2121
01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:02.090
<v Speaker 3>you can get hacked and security with </v>
<v Speaker 3>flash and stuff like that.</v>

2122
01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:04.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's getting pushed out,</v>

2123
01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:06.260
<v Speaker 3>especially when html five point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2124
01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:08.480
<v Speaker 3>comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is probably coming soon.</v>

2125
01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:09.790
<v Speaker 6>Hey she.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Five point.</v>

2126
01:35:09.791 --> 01:35:11.420
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can't do with flash does buddy.</v>

2127
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:14.720
<v Speaker 6>And it's proprietary CODEC.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's what?</v>

2128
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:17.060

2131
01:35:21.731 --> 01:35:24.580

2132
01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:26.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even explain it in there.</v>

2133
01:35:26.291 --> 01:35:28.900
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty much known that once html </v>
<v Speaker 3>five point,</v>

2134
01:35:28.901 --> 01:35:29.530
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes out.</v>

2135
01:35:29.531 --> 01:35:31.790

<v Speaker 3>it's going to</v>

2136
01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.220
<v Speaker 6>be hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2137
01:35:34.221 --> 01:35:36.230
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the gauntlet has been thrown down.</v>

2138
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:38.360
<v Speaker 6>A challenge has been made.</v>

2139
01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:41.970
<v Speaker 3>Youtube has already switched over to all</v>
<v Speaker 3>their videos to five point.</v>

2140
01:35:41.971 --> 01:35:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this guy's asking?</v>

2141
01:35:43.191 --> 01:35:44.310
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as Vimeo,</v>

2142
01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:45.780
<v Speaker 3>vimeo.com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

2143
01:35:45.781 --> 01:35:48.990
<v Speaker 3>just switched over to a to five point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2144
01:35:48.991 --> 01:35:53.991
<v Speaker 3>ready?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meaning that's why Youtube now works on </v>

2145
01:35:53.991 --> 01:35:53.991
<v Speaker 3>your iphone.</v>

2146
01:35:53.991 --> 01:35:53.991
<v Speaker 6>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy's asking the question.</v>

2147
01:35:53.991 --> 01:35:56.120
<v Speaker 6>What's with the sensoring on this social</v>
<v Speaker 6>message board?</v>

2148
01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:57.950
<v Speaker 6>Does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does the sensor is like?</v>

2149
01:35:57.951 --> 01:36:00.800
<v Speaker 6>If you try to twitter or something and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you swear or on this,</v>

2150
01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:05.801
<v Speaker 6>would it change it a maybe?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that why that guy wrote that fucking </v>

2151
01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:06.330
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2152
01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:07.130
<v Speaker 6>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2153
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:09.440
<v Speaker 6>Is that true folks?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't swear on this.</v>

2154
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:12.580
<v Speaker 3>It's probably a setting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there is.</v>

2155
01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.440
<v Speaker 6>Oh it has to be a setting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Please tell him that setting</v>

2156
01:36:18.090 --> 01:36:19.230
<v Speaker 6>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2157
01:36:19.290 --> 01:36:21.870
<v Speaker 6>people don't think that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I always make a big deal out of the</v>

2158
01:36:21.871 --> 01:36:22.550
<v Speaker 6>fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2159
01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.940
<v Speaker 6>censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 6>certain words,</v>

2160
01:36:24.210 --> 01:36:24.960
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and people say,</v>

2161
01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.280
<v Speaker 6>what's the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2162
01:36:26.281 --> 01:36:27.300
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why do you have to be rude?</v>

2163
01:36:27.301 --> 01:36:32.301
<v Speaker 6>Why can't you just not say those </v>
<v Speaker 6>particular words or in your own certain </v>

2164
01:36:32.301 --> 01:36:33.690
<v Speaker 6>people or in certain situations like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a way of controlling us.</v>

2165
01:36:33.691 --> 01:36:35.910
<v Speaker 6>It's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It makes no sense whatsoever,</v>

2166
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:38.820
<v Speaker 6>and words don't mean anything other than</v>
<v Speaker 6>intention.</v>

2167
01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.910
<v Speaker 6>What's important is that you are </v>
<v Speaker 6>expressing your intention.</v>

2168
01:36:41.911 --> 01:36:43.650
<v Speaker 6>You're expressing what you're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you're thinking,</v>

2169
01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:48.060
<v Speaker 6>that the idea of magic words is it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>poison to the language.</v>

2170
01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:53.240
<v Speaker 6>It's terrible to have words that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>can't use around certain people and you </v>

2171
01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.750
<v Speaker 6>can't use.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you broadcast them,</v>

2172

<v Speaker 6>First of all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2316
01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:24.340

<v Speaker 6>ways of looking at things.</v>

2317
01:43:24.341 --> 01:43:28.170
<v Speaker 6>That's what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whether a president's a yoga master does</v>

<v Speaker 6>stoner or whether our presidents.</v>

2320
01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:36.710
<v Speaker 6>A guy likes to go into the jungle and </v>
<v Speaker 6>take Iowasca with the Shaman.</v>

2321
01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:40.780
<v Speaker 6>We need someone who has a leader's way </v>
<v Speaker 6>of seeing the world,</v>

2322
01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:43.540
<v Speaker 6>someone who sees it outside of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy,</v>

2323
01:43:43.541 --> 01:43:45.550
<v Speaker 6>predetermined pattern that we're on </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now.</v>

2324
01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:46.540
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2325
01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:50.920
<v Speaker 6>I wrote this article about it's on my </v>
<v Speaker 6>blog about the large hadron collider and</v>

2326
01:43:50.921 --> 01:43:53.480
<v Speaker 6>how crazy it is that like at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>point in time,</v>

2327
01:43:53.481 --> 01:43:58.481
<v Speaker 6>science got to this weird point and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>not trashing it in any way because I'm </v>

2328
01:43:58.481 --> 01:44:00.560
<v Speaker 6>fascinated by technology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just making an observation that when</v>

2329
01:44:00.561 --> 01:44:05.561
<v Speaker 6>we first started inventing things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was to improve the quality of our </v>

2330
01:44:05.561 --> 01:44:05.561
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2331
01:44:05.561 --> 01:44:09.550
<v Speaker 6>we invented spheres so that we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>have to chase after the animals and </v>

2332
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:09.920
<v Speaker 6>vitamin with our teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We invented things.</v>

2333
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:12.320
<v Speaker 6>We never rented houses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so we're surviving to the rank,</v>

2334
01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:15.080
<v Speaker 6>but at a certain point in time it got </v>
<v Speaker 6>completely</v>

2335
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:19.070
<v Speaker 6>past that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And now even though we have all sorts of</v>

2336
01:44:19.071 --> 01:44:24.071
<v Speaker 6>things to deal with with the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like poverty and what's going on in </v>

2337
01:44:24.071 --> 01:44:25.670
<v Speaker 6>Haiti and Liberia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the vice guide to Liberia,</v>

2340
01:44:34.811 --> 01:44:37.661
<v Speaker 6>that has like rampant cannibalism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like people are constantly killing each </v>

2341
01:44:37.661 --> 01:44:42.491
<v Speaker 6>other and eat each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're selling human meet on the </v>

2349
01:45:00.281 --> 01:45:02.260
<v Speaker 6>eat the heart and would strengthen them </v>
<v Speaker 6>for battle and make them vulnerable to </v>

2350
01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:02.260

<v Speaker 3>February third,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that comes out of the Palm </v>

2547
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:27.030
<v Speaker 3>Prius because I liked the way the palm </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing slides on the screen is way nicer.</v>

2548
01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I've always been a fan of palm and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like they got their shit together </v>

2549
01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:32.060
<v Speaker 3>on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you get your shit together?</v>

2550
01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:32.800
<v Speaker 3>I hated the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had,</v>

2551
01:54:32.801 --> 01:54:35.430
<v Speaker 3>remember we all had a trio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>several hundreds or whatever,</v>

2552
01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:37.400
<v Speaker 3>but we thought it was the shit when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

2553
01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Then it started freezing up all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and we were like,</v>

2554
01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:43.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I might get that.</v>

2555
01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:49.100
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can we see in your book when it comes </v>

2556
01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:50.761
<v Speaker 6>out?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately I don't have any fucking </v>

2557
01:54:50.761 --> 01:54:50.761
<v Speaker 6>pictures of when I was younger.</v>

<v Speaker 6>very few,</v>

2559
01:54:51.630 --> 01:54:53.420
<v Speaker 6>but it was all about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2560
01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:56.140
<v Speaker 6>the road by doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I first started out,</v>

2561
01:54:56.141 --> 01:55:01.141
<v Speaker 6>I just got a bunch of crazy stories that</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought would be a good first book to </v>

2562
01:55:01.141 --> 01:55:01.141
<v Speaker 6>write.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2563
01:55:01.141 --> 01:55:03.070
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's basically just crazy road gigs,</v>

2564
01:55:03.071 --> 01:55:04.990
<v Speaker 6>like trying to make it as a standup </v>
<v Speaker 6>comedian.</v>

2565
01:55:04.991 --> 01:55:09.880
<v Speaker 6>You don't realize how strange it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's such a crazy life and it's,</v>

2566
01:55:10.210 --> 01:55:12.940
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't know what's going to happen.</v>

2567
01:55:12.941 --> 01:55:14.470
<v Speaker 6>You don't know where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the most,</v>

2568
01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:18.340
<v Speaker 6>it's the most unsure way to make a </v>
<v Speaker 6>living,</v>

2569
01:55:18.670 --> 01:55:20.530
<v Speaker 6>to try to be a professional stand up </v>
<v Speaker 6>comedian.</v>

2570
01:55:21.490 --> 01:55:22.870

<v Speaker 2>We have real mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the enemy,</v>

2629
01:57:48.170 --> 01:57:53.170
<v Speaker 2>you look at attacks on America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's this big giant distraction </v>

2630
01:57:53.170 --> 01:57:54.540
<v Speaker 2>that the big fear it seems we have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about,</v>

2631
01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:56.990
<v Speaker 2>worry about from other nations from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the place.</v>

2632
01:57:57.170 --> 01:58:02.170
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of crime and violence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America that America that we got to </v>

2633
01:58:02.170 --> 01:58:05.591
<v Speaker 2>worry about before we worry about crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A giant group called the Taliban acting </v>

2634
01:58:06.831 --> 01:58:11.831
<v Speaker 2>to kill Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about the thousands of people </v>

2635
01:58:11.831 --> 01:58:12.830
<v Speaker 2>that we kill every day and how the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>do we put a stop to that shit?</v>

2636
01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:16.100
<v Speaker 2>How do we put a stop to senseless </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent crime in America?</v>

2637
01:58:16.101 --> 01:58:20.150
<v Speaker 2>And then we got to deal with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're right next door to Mexico and</v>

2638
01:58:20.151 --> 01:58:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Mexico is way crazier than Iraq and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan combined.</v>

2639
01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:27.260
<v Speaker 2>More people get murdered in Mexico than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in the world.</v>

2640
01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:32.380
<v Speaker 2>The war on drugs in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's five times more casualties this </v>

2641
01:58:32.450 --> 01:58:33.650
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some something like that.</v>

2642
01:58:33.651 --> 01:58:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Victor Dobela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who does the,</v>

2643
01:58:35.181 --> 01:58:36.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2644
01:58:36.250 --> 01:58:37.050
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2645
01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:40.190
<v Speaker 2>the Spanish version of my job for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>

2646
01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was living in Juarez and he told me </v>

2647
01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:45.700
<v Speaker 2>it was some crazy statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have to google it,</v>

2648
01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:50.640
<v Speaker 2>but it was like five times more people </v>
<v Speaker 2>died in the war as in one year then died</v>

2649
01:58:51.341 --> 01:58:52.250
<v Speaker 2>in the record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

2650
01:58:52.251 --> 01:58:54.230
<v Speaker 2>it's not man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2651
01:58:54.250 --> 01:58:57.040
<v Speaker 2>they're just killing people left and </v>
<v Speaker 2>right down there.</v>

2652
01:58:57.041 --> 01:59:02.041
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why they're doing it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's so much money and </v>

2653
01:59:02.041 --> 01:59:04.030
<v Speaker 2>selling illegal drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States from Mexico.</v>

2654
01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

2655
01:59:05.231 --> 01:59:10.231
<v Speaker 2>These guys get so God to enrich and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting over so much that the </v>

2656
01:59:10.231 --> 01:59:13.240
<v Speaker 2>violence is insane and they're killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>police officers and politicians and they</v>

2657
01:59:13.241 --> 01:59:18.241
<v Speaker 2>brought over fucking tanks and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they got tanks running through the </v>

2658
01:59:18.241 --> 01:59:18.241
<v Speaker 2>streets in Juarez.</v>

2659
01:59:18.241 --> 01:59:22.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit is happening literally into a </v>

2660
01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:24.340
<v Speaker 2>country that's connected to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can fucking drive there.</v>

2661
01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:27.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to fly halfway across the</v>

2662
01:59:27.611 --> 01:59:30.510
<v Speaker 2>world to deal with some conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the enemy is there.</v>

2663
01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:33.820
<v Speaker 2>The enemy is anybody who's murdering </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2664
01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who's so fucking crazy,</v>

2665
01:59:36.161 --> 01:59:38.560
<v Speaker 2>they're killing five times more people </v>
<v Speaker 2>than die in a war.</v>

2666
01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:39.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right there.</v>

2667
01:59:39.551 --> 01:59:44.551
<v Speaker 2>That's a war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a war that were not even </v>

2668
01:59:44.551 --> 01:59:44.551
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's connected to us.</v>

2669
01:59:44.551 --> 01:59:47.910
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting rich and shit and they </v>

2670
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:48.970
<v Speaker 2>have tanks and who knows what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get.</v>

2671
01:59:48.971 --> 01:59:50.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Mexico you'd probably buy jets.</v>

2672
01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:55.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could probably bicycling fucking US </v>

2673
01:59:55.740 --> 01:59:55.740
<v Speaker 2>army jets from Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows?</v>

<v Speaker 2>They have billions and billions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's scary shit,</v>

2676
02:00:00.841 --> 02:00:02.280
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very scary shit.</v>

2677
02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Are worried about what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan,</v>

2678
02:00:05.770 --> 02:00:07.600
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is there's money in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan,</v>

2679
02:00:07.601 --> 02:00:10.060
<v Speaker 2>there's natural gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's money in oil in Iraq,</v>

2680
02:00:10.061 --> 02:00:12.460
<v Speaker 2>there's oil controlling the natural gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>pipeline.</v>

2681
02:00:12.461 --> 02:00:17.461
<v Speaker 2>The reason why people have been trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get to Afghanistan over and over </v>

2682
02:00:17.461 --> 02:00:17.461

<v Speaker 2>They're trying to get the resources.</v>

2684
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:23.110

<v Speaker 2>we're trying to get their resources.</v>

2685
02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:25.660
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the future of the electric cars,</v>

2686

<v Speaker 2>You can't hit them with a rock and </v>

<v Speaker 2>nutty man.</v>

2720
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Just because you're on the other side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fence.</v>

2721
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:08.810
<v Speaker 2>It's such an uncompassionate thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2722
02:02:08.811 --> 02:02:09.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea of this,</v>

2723
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:11.390
<v Speaker 2>these team rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2724
02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:13.850
<v Speaker 2>and not allow and everybody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you let them over,</v>

2725
02:02:13.851 --> 02:02:18.851
<v Speaker 2>they would just come over and a swarm </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would fuck up the whole </v>

2726
02:02:18.851 --> 02:02:18.851
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

2727
02:02:18.851 --> 02:02:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Really within our theory here in La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2728
02:02:22.401 --> 02:02:27.401
<v Speaker 2>how many illegals are there in la?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much more would it be if it was </v>

2729
02:02:27.401 --> 02:02:27.830
<v Speaker 2>legal here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some white people.</v>

2730
02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you think everybody would just come </v>
<v Speaker 2>over if they said,</v>

2731
02:02:30.081 --> 02:02:31.730
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now there's no immigration.</v>

2732
02:02:31.731 --> 02:02:33.500
<v Speaker 2>That's just one country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States,</v>

2733
02:02:33.501 --> 02:02:38.501
<v Speaker 2>Canada and Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that's attached is one </v>

2734
02:02:38.501 --> 02:02:38.501
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what happened,</v>

2735
02:02:38.501 --> 02:02:39.950
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just all come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There would be nobody in Mexico.</v>

2736
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get some bad ass deals on houses</v>

2737
02:02:42.651 --> 02:02:47.651
<v Speaker 2>in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it will settle out over a few </v>

2738
02:02:47.651 --> 02:02:47.651
<v Speaker 2>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

2739
02:02:47.651 --> 02:02:51.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would realize like Baja </v>

2740
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.430
<v Speaker 2>California is pretty fucking the cost of</v>
<v Speaker 2>living here.</v>

2741
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:55.151
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been looking at loss lately now </v>

2742
02:02:55.151 --> 02:02:55.610
<v Speaker 2>because I was at this party in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>studio in a lock and it was amazing.</v>

2743
02:02:55.611 --> 02:02:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>last.</v>

2746
02:03:01.090 --> 02:03:01.490
<v Speaker 2>It's just a big room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2747
02:03:01.491 --> 02:03:02.960
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be cheaper,</v>

2748
02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:06.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last start like going to $3,000</v>

2749
02:03:06.771 --> 02:03:09.920
<v Speaker 2>out here for just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how expensive laughs are.</v>

2750
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2751
02:03:11.870 --> 02:03:14.090
<v Speaker 2>it is weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are really expensive.</v>

2752
02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in cities like New York City apartments </v>

2753
02:03:19.150 --> 02:03:21.101
<v Speaker 2>are the nuttiest things ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York City apartments are assets </v>

2754
02:03:21.101 --> 02:03:24.180
<v Speaker 2>retire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be like 3000 bucks for a </v>

2755
02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:26.201
<v Speaker 2>little tiny place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's lot of people for that mean that </v>

2756
02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:29.960
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to be like a significant</v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage and people go,</v>

2757
02:03:29.961 --> 02:03:30.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2758
02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to have a car because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>take the subway everywhere.</v>

2759
02:03:33.110 --> 02:03:35.330
<v Speaker 2>That's all well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you don't feel trapped.</v>

2760
02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:37.430
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel tethered to this machine.</v>

2761
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:39.950
<v Speaker 2>You really want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

2762
02:03:40.650 --> 02:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The North American Union,</v>

2763
02:03:42.821 --> 02:03:45.200
<v Speaker 2>this gentleman says Pentair 33.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2764
02:03:45.201 --> 02:03:50.201
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be a North American </v>

2765
02:03:50.201 --> 02:03:51.020
<v Speaker 2>union is supposed to be this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

2766
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:56.350
<v Speaker 2>How would just describe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>New World Order conspiracy that we're </v>

2767
02:03:56.350 --> 02:04:00.160
<v Speaker 2>moving towards one world government and </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how like in Europe they have the euro</v>

2768
02:04:01.230 --> 02:04:06.230
<v Speaker 2>that goes through one one money source </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to do that with the </v>

2769
02:04:06.230 --> 02:04:10.181
<v Speaker 2>America and America and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lou Dobbs actually talked about it on </v>

2770
02:04:10.181 --> 02:04:12.020
<v Speaker 2>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Lou Dobbs might be crazy.</v>

2771
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Obama was really interesting when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressed it.</v>

2772
02:04:14.181 --> 02:04:19.181
<v Speaker 2>He addressed it during his campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he sees no evidence for that and it </v>

2773
02:04:19.181 --> 02:04:23.531
<v Speaker 2>makes you wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much do you think they really know </v>

2774
02:04:23.531 --> 02:04:23.531
<v Speaker 2>how much you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2775
02:04:23.531 --> 02:04:27.491
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck does Obama answer to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens when you actually get an </v>

2776
02:04:27.491 --> 02:04:27.491
<v Speaker 2>office?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A cat.</v>

2777
02:04:28.590 --> 02:04:33.590
<v Speaker 3>That's the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this really smart cat golden </v>

2778
02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:35.090
<v Speaker 3>head dress and it just sits there.</v>

2779
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must don't make me turn you into </v>

2780
02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:40.510
<v Speaker 2>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

2781
02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:43.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think happens when they get </v>

2782
02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:43.780
<v Speaker 2>in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2783
02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:48.291
<v Speaker 2>do they meet with the heads of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic corporation that spends </v>

2784
02:04:48.291 --> 02:04:49.200
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars on their campaign?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must,</v>

2785
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:50.460
<v Speaker 2>they must,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2786
02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:55.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they said about Bush that Bush met with </v>

2787
02:04:55.580 --> 02:04:56.940
<v Speaker 2>the heads of all these different energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>

2788
02:04:56.970 --> 02:05:00.390
<v Speaker 2>oil companies and it's like common </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice that like,</v>

2789
02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:05.910
<v Speaker 2>or it's common knowledge rather that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy was dictated after he had these </v>

2790
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:06.960
<v Speaker 2>meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they had worked it out,</v>

2791
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:09.810
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does anybody not expect that?</v>

2792
02:05:09.811 --> 02:05:12.860
<v Speaker 2>If you pay people millions of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd give them millions of dollars,</v>

2793
02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:17.880
<v Speaker 2>your money to get them into office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once they're in office mean you bribe </v>

2794
02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:18.400
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean you ride them.</v>

2795
02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Why would you spend millions of dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're an oil company,</v>

2796
02:05:24.121 --> 02:05:24.310
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2797
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you giving politicians all this </v>

2798
02:05:29.310 --> 02:05:31.221
<v Speaker 2>money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you want them to like take it </v>

2799
02:05:31.221 --> 02:05:31.221
<v Speaker 2>easy on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to.</v>

2800
02:05:31.221 --> 02:05:31.221
<v Speaker 2>You bribing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>

2801
02:05:31.221 --> 02:05:32.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy that that's legal.</v>

2802
02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:38.520
<v Speaker 2>It's great and the Supreme Court </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently just stopped the cap on </v>

2803
02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:39.930
<v Speaker 2>spending on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said that they're like,</v>

2804
02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:45.080
<v Speaker 2>they treated them as an individual that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are corporations like an individual so </v>

2805
02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:45.870
<v Speaker 2>they could spend as much money on </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaigns they want.</v>

2806
02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:48.720
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have all kinds of nutty</v>

2807
02:05:48.721 --> 02:05:51.720
<v Speaker 2>as commercials like that talking dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial that they came up with.</v>

2808
02:05:52.210 --> 02:05:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Obama has a spending freeze though on on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the money last week.</v>

2809
02:05:59.110 --> 02:06:00.360
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2810
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:04.800
<v Speaker 2>He probably talked about it last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was horrified by it.</v>

2811
02:06:04.801 --> 02:06:09.801
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he was talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's also just because </v>

2812
02:06:09.801 --> 02:06:09.801
<v Speaker 2>people were horrified by it.</v>

2813
02:06:09.801 --> 02:06:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I think they just got so greedy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific that they needed to take a step</v>

2814
02:06:12.151 --> 02:06:13.080
<v Speaker 2>back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2815
02:06:13.110 --> 02:06:14.790
<v Speaker 2>we fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>

2816
02:06:14.791 --> 02:06:15.840
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2817
02:06:15.841 --> 02:06:17.670
<v Speaker 2>people might store in the White House </v>
<v Speaker 2>with guns.</v>

2818
02:06:17.671 --> 02:06:19.140
<v Speaker 2>This is getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like now,</v>

2819
02:06:19.141 --> 02:06:24.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even people that run the corporations </v>

2820
02:06:24.141 --> 02:06:24.141
<v Speaker 2>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

2821
02:06:24.141 --> 02:06:24.141
<v Speaker 2>If they're gonna let us do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

2822
02:06:24.141 --> 02:06:28.470
<v Speaker 2>is this democracy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this really with the United States </v>

2823
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:30.471
<v Speaker 2>was founded on Ustream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This week doesn't seem like it's been </v>

2824
02:06:30.471 --> 02:06:30.471
<v Speaker 2>fucking up as I've been fucking up at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2825
02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:32.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stream looks fine this week.</v>

2826
02:06:32.630 --> 02:06:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Has Anybody have a problem with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2827
02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.180
<v Speaker 2>we were ready to jump ship you dirty </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

2828
02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:39.650
<v Speaker 2>And it could have been the storm last </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

2829
02:06:39.651 --> 02:06:42.150
<v Speaker 2>He could have been this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2830
02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Obama Obama did right after the budget's</v>
<v Speaker 2>got increased by 35 percent.</v>

2831
02:06:47.701 --> 02:06:49.380
<v Speaker 2>That's what this guy says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama did.</v>

2832
02:06:49.381 --> 02:06:50.550
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the question?</v>

2833
02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Was saying that Obama put a cap on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spending.</v>

2834
02:06:54.930 --> 02:06:57.060
<v Speaker 2>He did after the budget increased by 35 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

2835
02:06:57.061 --> 02:07:02.061
<v Speaker 2>So they increased it so they changed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but 35 percent and then he put a cap on </v>

2836
02:07:02.061 --> 02:07:06.051
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it made it look like he was doing </v>

2837
02:07:06.051 --> 02:07:06.051
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something to stop it.</v>

2838
02:07:06.051 --> 02:07:06.051
<v Speaker 2>But really they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2839
02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like the spending freeze is in </v>

2840
02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:15.630
<v Speaker 2>2011.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it's all fucking nuts and that's</v>

2841
02:07:15.631 --> 02:07:17.280
<v Speaker 2>why I don't follow this stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2842
02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:18.270
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2843
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:23.470
<v Speaker 2>it's so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics are so complex that a certain </v>

2844
02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:25.050
<v Speaker 2>point in time you have to like look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>your resources.</v>

2845
02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:30.320
<v Speaker 2>You have to look at your life and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time do I have to deal with </v>

2846
02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:33.051
<v Speaker 2>this shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much time do I have to take care of </v>

2847
02:07:33.051 --> 02:07:33.660
<v Speaker 2>my children to pay my bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to manage my career,</v>

2848
02:07:33.661 --> 02:07:35.920
<v Speaker 2>to go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hang out with my friends,</v>

2849
02:07:35.921 --> 02:07:37.570
<v Speaker 2>to play a couple games of pool?</v>

2850
02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:40.210
<v Speaker 2>How much fucking time do you have in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day?</v>

2851
02:07:40.330 --> 02:07:43.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they can just fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and keep fucking you.</v>

2852
02:07:44.110 --> 02:07:49.110
<v Speaker 2>That's why these cigarette and alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies get away with contributing </v>

2853
02:07:49.110 --> 02:07:51.400
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars to a partnership for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a drug free America.</v>

2854
02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:54.100
<v Speaker 2>And then they make commercials like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one with the talking dog that,</v>

2855
02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:56.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tells the girl stopped smoking weed.</v>

2856
02:07:56.890 --> 02:08:00.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just corruption and it's blatant </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's right in front of our eyes.</v>

2857
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2858
02:08:01.691 --> 02:08:06.691
<v Speaker 2>the system is so fucked up that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like someone else has to come in </v>

2859
02:08:06.791 --> 02:08:11.791
<v Speaker 2>and fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we're like lord of the </v>

2860
02:08:11.791 --> 02:08:11.791
<v Speaker 2>flies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a giant,</v>

2861
02:08:11.791 --> 02:08:14.380
<v Speaker 2>large scale version of it and we're just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking going crazy.</v>

2862
02:08:14.710 --> 02:08:15.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2863
02:08:15.491 --> 02:08:20.491
<v Speaker 2>we're allowing corporations and these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these dudes to make millions and </v>

2864
02:08:20.491 --> 02:08:21.760
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars just by fucking us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2865
02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:25.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stimulus money that went to all</v>

2866
02:08:25.301 --> 02:08:27.400
<v Speaker 2>these banks and they don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>account for.</v>

2867
02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:29.730
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2868
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:33.340
<v Speaker 2>that is a mad grab for cash where dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>are saying,</v>

2869
02:08:33.341 --> 02:08:34.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to give them their bonuses.</v>

2870
02:08:34.601 --> 02:08:36.070
<v Speaker 2>We don't give them their bonuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna leave.</v>

2871
02:08:36.130 --> 02:08:41.130
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why they should get millions </v>

2872
02:08:41.130 --> 02:08:44.130
<v Speaker 2>of dollars of taxpayers money while the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole economy melt in front of </v>

2873
02:08:44.130 --> 02:08:44.130
<v Speaker 2>everybody's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2874
02:08:44.130 --> 02:08:47.170
<v Speaker 2>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so bold that they're wanting,</v>

2875
02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:52.200
<v Speaker 2>they want bonuses while everything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>falling apart and going under because </v>

2876
02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:52.200
<v Speaker 2>they have contracts and then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2877
02:08:52.210 --> 02:08:57.210
<v Speaker 2>we were going to lose them to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations like know what you're </v>

2878
02:08:57.210 --> 02:08:59.110
<v Speaker 2>supposed to lose them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking bank failed stupid.</v>

2879
02:08:59.770 --> 02:09:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2880
02:09:00.971 --> 02:09:05.971
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how just blatant they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like it's so corrupt that </v>

2881
02:09:06.341 --> 02:09:11.341
<v Speaker 2>nothing's going to fix it and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I think about investing my </v>

2882
02:09:11.341 --> 02:09:15.031
<v Speaker 2>time and trying to pay attention to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or God for fucking been trying to do </v>

2883
02:09:15.031 --> 02:09:17.680
<v Speaker 2>something to fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's so fucked up.</v>

2884
02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:23.040
<v Speaker 2>It would take 100 lives of 100 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in 100 lives just to bring it </v>

2885
02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:25.750
<v Speaker 2>back to baseline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to bring it back to no corruption.</v>

2886
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:29.320
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics in America are so fucked up and</v>

2887
02:09:29.321 --> 02:09:32.740
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and when I talked to people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>really know about it,</v>

2888
02:09:32.741 --> 02:09:36.790
<v Speaker 2>like I know some dudes who run some big </v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses and I've talked to them about</v>

2889
02:09:36.791 --> 02:09:41.791
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what real campaigns and what </v>

2890
02:09:41.791 --> 02:09:43.630
<v Speaker 2>contributing is really all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking horrifying.</v>

2891
02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:45.160
<v Speaker 2>It's horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2892
02:09:45.370 --> 02:09:50.370
<v Speaker 2>it should be all illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be illegal for politicians to </v>

2893
02:09:50.370 --> 02:09:52.240
<v Speaker 2>talk while someone else writes their </v>
<v Speaker 2>speeches totally illegal.</v>

2894
02:09:52.450 --> 02:09:57.450
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you should be a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading a God damn script written by 20 </v>

2895
02:09:57.450 --> 02:09:57.450
<v Speaker 2>experts in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2896
02:09:57.450 --> 02:09:58.530
<v Speaker 2>in English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in,</v>

2897
02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:03.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the right way to phrase things and </v>

2898
02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:05.941
<v Speaker 2>great writers who know how to mimic some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the responses that people got to </v>

2899
02:10:05.941 --> 02:10:07.250
<v Speaker 2>historical speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2900
02:10:07.251 --> 02:10:07.930
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2901
02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Teddy Roosevelt was in a similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

2902
02:10:09.761 --> 02:10:12.760
<v Speaker 2>This is what he said and I think we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to address that and the founding fathers</v>

2903
02:10:12.761 --> 02:10:14.740
<v Speaker 2>of this country really new passed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to address that.</v>

2904
02:10:14.741 --> 02:10:18.610
<v Speaker 2>And they calculated so perfectly to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>you interesting.</v>

2905
02:10:18.730 --> 02:10:20.560
<v Speaker 2>We don't even know who the fuck Obama </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2906
02:10:20.710 --> 02:10:23.290
<v Speaker 2>We know that he's pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm and collected,</v>

2907
02:10:23.291 --> 02:10:26.230
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until you see a dude,</v>

2908
02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:30.380
<v Speaker 2>you know that until we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama does,</v>

2909
02:10:30.381 --> 02:10:31.450
<v Speaker 2>where a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on shit though.</v>

2910
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:33.070
<v Speaker 2>You got to give them that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all.</v>

2911
02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If</v>

2912
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.200
<v Speaker 3>he was talking like that in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think he's crazy.</v>

2913
02:10:36.710 --> 02:10:41.600
<v Speaker 3>What we need to do as a nation and as </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals,</v>

2914
02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:43.880
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't you just talk to us?</v>

2915
02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:45.830
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do they have to talk like that?</v>

2916
02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Why can't they get onstage and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2917
02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:51.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain age group that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost dead,</v>

2918
02:10:51.590 --> 02:10:53.550
<v Speaker 3>but once they die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to be like,</v>

2919
02:10:53.670 --> 02:10:56.680
<v Speaker 3>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just an age group that,</v>

2920
02:10:56.910 --> 02:10:59.150
<v Speaker 3>that if we didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then people would be like,</v>

2921
02:10:59.151 --> 02:10:59.930
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2922
02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:02.300
<v Speaker 3>Maybe in 30 years the president's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be like you are,</v>

2923
02:11:02.301 --> 02:11:04.620
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2924
02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:07.250
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's real possible in that age</v>

2925
02:11:07.251 --> 02:11:08.930
<v Speaker 3>group just got to go and once they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone,</v>

2926
02:11:08.931 --> 02:11:11.840
<v Speaker 3>weed's going to be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody before the Internet,</v>

2927
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:13.670
<v Speaker 3>Pre Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2928
02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:15.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't embrace the Internet,</v>

2929
02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:17.120
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>

2930
02:11:17.150 --> 02:11:19.220
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're riding on a buggy man.</v>

2931
02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:22.600
<v Speaker 3>You're riding on an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know all that.</v>

2932
02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:23.660
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2933
02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:28.980
<v Speaker 3>can't we have a president that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets on stage and talks like a </v>

2934
02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:28.980
<v Speaker 3>normal human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wraps.</v>

2935
02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:32.180
<v Speaker 3>This is the guy who gets on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2936
02:11:32.181 --> 02:11:33.020
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's our situation.</v>

2937
02:11:33.290 --> 02:11:38.290
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen that guy ray kerr rate </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kurt's will explain a technological </v>

2938
02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:41.170
<v Speaker 3>singularity and the exponential increase</v>
<v Speaker 3>in technology.</v>

2939
02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:43.340
<v Speaker 3>The way he explains it as like a regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

2940
02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:47.660
<v Speaker 3>He's not talking about it like it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

2941
02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:52.720
<v Speaker 3>God bless America and he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not getting all crazy and dramatic </v>

2942
02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:54.770
<v Speaker 3>and theatrical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just giving you information,</v>

2943
02:11:54.771 --> 02:11:59.771
<v Speaker 3>but you could get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people feel like they just have to </v>

2944
02:11:59.771 --> 02:11:59.771
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Alex Jones even,</v>

2945
02:11:59.771 --> 02:12:00.260
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fake drama.</v>

2946
02:12:00.261 --> 02:12:05.261
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind real drama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind if the guys talking and if </v>

2947
02:12:05.261 --> 02:12:05.261
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>

2948
02:12:05.261 --> 02:12:08.510
<v Speaker 3>If I feel like he should have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could tell that sincerity and </v>

2949
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:10.280
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the reasons why they put </v>
<v Speaker 3>on that so obvious fake voice because it</v>

2950
02:12:10.281 --> 02:12:15.281
<v Speaker 3>masks insincerity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's the most offensive about </v>

2951
02:12:15.281 --> 02:12:16.580
<v Speaker 3>politician speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When if they had a talk,</v>

2952
02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:18.230
<v Speaker 3>if they had to go up there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2953
02:12:18.231 --> 02:12:20.900
<v Speaker 3>what I want to do is I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2954
02:12:20.901 --> 02:12:25.901
<v Speaker 3>I want to end this war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to figure out how we've got </v>

2955
02:12:25.901 --> 02:12:25.901
<v Speaker 3>to get out of Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First thing we're going to do.</v>

2956
02:12:25.901 --> 02:12:30.851
<v Speaker 3>It was going to set up Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get out of there and if </v>

2957
02:12:30.851 --> 02:12:31.490
<v Speaker 3>he said it like a guy who was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to you,</v>

2958
02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:33.980
<v Speaker 3>you will be able to see where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit is,</v>

2959
02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:38.570
<v Speaker 3>but by masking it in political speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that speech,</v>

2960
02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:43.130
<v Speaker 3>that mode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that space against predetermined pairs,</v>

2961
02:12:43.131 --> 02:12:47.330
<v Speaker 3>broadcasters and everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we stand at a crossroads,</v>

2962
02:12:47.450 --> 02:12:47.750
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2963
02:12:47.751 --> 02:12:48.080
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2964
02:12:48.170 --> 02:12:53.170
<v Speaker 3>and when they talk like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's agreed that it's going to sound </v>

2965
02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:54.200
<v Speaker 3>like bullshit and it masks bullshit.</v>

2966
02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:59.450
<v Speaker 3>I just thought that up to newscasters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally sweet that.</v>

2967
02:12:59.451 --> 02:13:02.510
<v Speaker 3>So I remember because that's a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bit in there somewhere,</v>

2968
02:13:02.630 --> 02:13:03.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2969
02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:06.350
<v Speaker 3>That's why they speak speeches like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2970
02:13:06.351 --> 02:13:11.351
<v Speaker 3>Because you would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they were speaking like a regular </v>

2971
02:13:11.351 --> 02:13:11.351
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you another fellowship.</v>

2972
02:13:11.351 --> 02:13:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Why did the news people on radio </v>
<v Speaker 3>stations have to do it because they're </v>

2973
02:13:15.110 --> 02:13:16.820
<v Speaker 3>trying to get that paper pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever you did,</v>

2974
02:13:16.850 --> 02:13:18.800
<v Speaker 3>there was a fire today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Check this shit out.</v>

2975
02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:21.140
<v Speaker 3>We fill in this on main street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this building.</v>

2976
02:13:21.170 --> 02:13:26.170
<v Speaker 3>That's how fucked up check festival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard for people to be </v>

2977
02:13:26.170 --> 02:13:26.180
<v Speaker 3>themselves on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a long time.</v>

2978
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they train them to be that way.</v>

2979
02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:32.740
<v Speaker 3>They trained them to have that voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why the weather person and a </v>

2980
02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:32.740
<v Speaker 3>traffic person in every city all sound </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same.</v>

2981
02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:36.260
<v Speaker 6>In radio,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have to have the certain data on main</v>

2982
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:41.270
<v Speaker 6>street.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looks like you got clear sailing on </v>

2983
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.270
<v Speaker 6>the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2984
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.270
<v Speaker 6>five.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2985
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:42.840
<v Speaker 6>They have a certain way of doing it </v>
<v Speaker 6>because that's,</v>

2986
02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:44.760
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's sort of like strip club djs too.</v>

2987
02:13:44.761 --> 02:13:45.400
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2988
02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:50.480
<v Speaker 6>they're nervous so they fall into this </v>
<v Speaker 6>pattern because it makes them more </v>

2989
02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:53.781
<v Speaker 6>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some standup comedian sound like that </v>

2990
02:13:53.781 --> 02:13:53.781
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2991
02:13:53.781 --> 02:13:56.880
<v Speaker 6>Some comedians like you can tell like </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to sound like a comic.</v>

2992
02:13:57.020 --> 02:14:02.020
<v Speaker 6>That was a big thing in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a bunch of guys who weren't </v>

2993
02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:04.641
<v Speaker 6>saying Jack Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they were saying it like comics and </v>

2994
02:14:04.641 --> 02:14:07.851
<v Speaker 6>they would get laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a few guys I want to mention </v>

2995
02:14:07.851 --> 02:14:07.851
<v Speaker 6>names,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a,</v>

2996
02:14:07.851 --> 02:14:09.570
<v Speaker 6>the eighties was real easy for shitty </v>
<v Speaker 6>comedy.</v>

2997
02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:14.820
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of guys like slipped </v>
<v Speaker 6>through because it was so much comedy </v>

2998
02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:17.211
<v Speaker 6>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They never learned how to talk as </v>

2999
02:14:17.211 --> 02:14:19.671
<v Speaker 6>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're always like the wacky comedy </v>

3000
02:14:19.671 --> 02:14:21.531
<v Speaker 6>voice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's your duty for 20.</v>

3001
02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:23.680
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's already going on.</v>

3002
02:14:23.681 --> 02:14:26.530
<v Speaker 6>For what time?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it a third time?</v>

3003
02:14:28.370 --> 02:14:32.770
<v Speaker 6>You guys ever talk about Michael </v>
<v Speaker 6>Leonhard appointed the head of the dea?</v>

3004
02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:34.360
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3005
02:14:34.390 --> 02:14:39.390
<v Speaker 6>You know what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the same thing as like open up the </v>

3006
02:14:39.390 --> 02:14:39.390
<v Speaker 6>doors to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I,</v>

3007
02:14:39.390 --> 02:14:40.690
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know the solution.</v>

3008
02:14:40.780 --> 02:14:43.630
<v Speaker 6>And the problem with the dea is really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3009
02:14:43.631 --> 02:14:45.550
<v Speaker 6>they shouldn't be busting people for </v>
<v Speaker 6>pot.</v>

3010
02:14:45.551 --> 02:14:50.551
<v Speaker 6>Pot should be legal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there are some drugs that are </v>

3011
02:14:50.551 --> 02:14:50.551
<v Speaker 6>fucking tab before you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3012
02:14:50.551 --> 02:14:54.061
<v Speaker 6>there's real drugs are terrible for you </v>
<v Speaker 6>and a lot of our salt by fucking </v>

3013
02:14:54.061 --> 02:14:54.340
<v Speaker 6>pharmacies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

3014
02:14:54.341 --> 02:14:56.380
<v Speaker 6>How about Oxycontin?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got real problems.</v>

3015
02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:58.180
<v Speaker 6>What's that thing we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>earlier?</v>

3016
02:14:58.181 --> 02:15:01.510
<v Speaker 6>The oxycontin express,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but these dea guys and all this,</v>

3017
02:15:01.511 --> 02:15:03.070
<v Speaker 6>they have families,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have jobs,</v>

3018
02:15:03.071 --> 02:15:05.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is what they're doing and a lot</v>

3019
02:15:05.231 --> 02:15:10.231
<v Speaker 6>of them signed up to do the right thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>to try to protect communities and then </v>

3020
02:15:10.231 --> 02:15:10.231
<v Speaker 6>they get involved in it.</v>

3021
02:15:10.231 --> 02:15:11.530
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's when things get </v>
<v Speaker 6>squirrely and you know,</v>

3022
02:15:11.531 --> 02:15:12.850

<v Speaker 6>you do realize that yeah,</v>

3023
02:15:12.851 --> 02:15:15.500

<v Speaker 6>tell a guy can't do this,</v>

<v Speaker 6>He's a good man.</v>

3316
02:28:24.430 --> 02:28:29.430
<v Speaker 6>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's one of the cool things about </v>

3317
02:28:29.430 --> 02:28:29.430
<v Speaker 6>doing the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was.</v>

3318
02:28:29.430 --> 02:28:30.580
<v Speaker 6>Mike Goldberg was telling me that he had</v>
<v Speaker 6>a Gig once upon a time,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Gig,</v>

02:28:35.051 --> 02:28:38.680
<v Speaker 6>so the guy was a deck and then gold is </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the nicest guys I've ever met.</v>

3322
02:28:38.681 --> 02:28:41.740
<v Speaker 6>He's such a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mike Goldberg is.</v>

3323
02:28:41.741 --> 02:28:42.250
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>people say fucks up a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the fucking guys done a hundred and</v>

<v Speaker 6>You're going to be able to like go back </v>

<v Speaker 6>Fuck it up for sure.</v>

3328
02:28:56.311 --> 02:28:58.540
<v Speaker 6>But who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a nice fucking guy.</v>

3329
02:28:58.541 --> 02:29:00.280
<v Speaker 6>He does the job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He gets in there,</v>

3330
02:29:00.281 --> 02:29:02.500
<v Speaker 6>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He knows what the fuck is going on.</v>

3331
02:29:02.501 --> 02:29:05.440
<v Speaker 6>He makes it happen and he's a cool dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like him.</v>

<v Speaker 6>working with a nice car like that.</v>

3333
02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:11.830
<v Speaker 6>It's like I look forward to seeing them</v>

3334
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:17.270
<v Speaker 6>on cast is the new radio.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it is,</v>

3335
02:29:17.271 --> 02:29:18.410
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really do.</v>

3336
02:29:18.411 --> 02:29:20.150
<v Speaker 6>I think that this is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3337
02:29:20.900 --> 02:29:23.310
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that what the role,</v>

3338
02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:28.360
<v Speaker 6>the only thing that's separate from from</v>
<v Speaker 6>regular radio is you don't have this in </v>

3339
02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:32.321
<v Speaker 6>your car yet and that's common.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They've already come up with Internet </v>

3340
02:29:32.321 --> 02:29:32.321
<v Speaker 6>capable,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a car,</v>

3341
02:29:32.321 --> 02:29:37.000
<v Speaker 6>a car stereos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're going to be able to download </v>

3342
02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:37.040
<v Speaker 6>podcasts directly to it and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

3343
02:29:37.041 --> 02:29:41.440
<v Speaker 6>they have setups in their car where they</v>
<v Speaker 6>have an ipod and the just.</v>

3344
02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:45.170
<v Speaker 6>They download people's podcasts on their</v>
<v Speaker 6>ipod than they set up where they,</v>

3345
02:29:45.220 --> 02:29:50.220
<v Speaker 6>the blog broadcast a ipod through their </v>
<v Speaker 6>car stereo speaker of you have that </v>

3346
02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:51.260
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I sit in my car and it</v>

3347
02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:56.480
<v Speaker 8>romantically connects to my iphone and </v>
<v Speaker 8>then I had my whole itunes on my iphone </v>

3348
02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:57.020
<v Speaker 8>play through my sink on Ford.</v>

3349
02:29:57.440 --> 02:29:58.910
<v Speaker 6>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

3350
02:29:58.911 --> 02:30:01.790
<v Speaker 6>That's the God damn future and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be just like a dvr.</v>

3351
02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:04.220
<v Speaker 6>So you know how you get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know your TV shows.</v>

3352
02:30:04.221 --> 02:30:06.130
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how often do you watch tv shows when the</v>

3353
02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:11.160
<v Speaker 6>air only if you're home and you look at </v>
<v Speaker 6>forward to it like lost or something </v>

3354
02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:11.160
<v Speaker 6>like that and they sit through the </v>
<v Speaker 6>commercials,</v>

3355
02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:16.090
<v Speaker 6>but it's way better to not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's way better to do it whenever you </v>

3356
02:30:16.090 --> 02:30:16.490
<v Speaker 6>want it and to be able to control it and</v>
<v Speaker 6>fast forward it.</v>

3357
02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.620
<v Speaker 6>And if you can download this as an MP </v>
<v Speaker 6>three,</v>

3358
02:30:18.621 --> 02:30:20.540
<v Speaker 6>that's the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're in the car and you're like,</v>

3359
02:30:20.570 --> 02:30:22.670
<v Speaker 6>all these dumb motherfuckers were </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about mma again.</v>

3360
02:30:22.671 --> 02:30:24.740
<v Speaker 6>Leads fast forward five minutes what </v>
<v Speaker 6>he's talking about.</v>

3361
02:30:24.890 --> 02:30:26.390
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can do whatever you want with it.</v>

3362
02:30:26.391 --> 02:30:29.240
<v Speaker 6>It's yours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got it and you control what you want</v>

3363
02:30:29.241 --> 02:30:30.530
<v Speaker 6>to pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can do that.</v>

3364
02:30:30.531 --> 02:30:32.120
<v Speaker 6>You don't miss anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You want to rewind it.</v>

3365
02:30:32.121 --> 02:30:37.121
<v Speaker 6>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many times have you been listening </v>

3366
02:30:37.121 --> 02:30:37.121
<v Speaker 6>to someone talk on the radio and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>say some,</v>

3367
02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:38.600
<v Speaker 6>but you don't know what the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 6>said.</v>

3368
02:30:38.601 --> 02:30:40.550
<v Speaker 6>You tried to write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't have anything in your car.</v>

3369
02:30:40.551 --> 02:30:42.620
<v Speaker 6>You're in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How cool would it be?</v>

3370
02:30:42.621 --> 02:30:45.140
<v Speaker 6>The rewind the radio while you can with </v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

3371
02:30:45.141 --> 02:30:47.930
<v Speaker 6>this is way superior than just </v>
<v Speaker 6>broadcasting shit.</v>

3372
02:30:48.050 --> 02:30:50.690
<v Speaker 6>Plus there's not signals in the air that</v>
<v Speaker 6>killed the bees</v>

3373
02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:54.260
<v Speaker 8>cassette tapes for life.</v>

3374
02:30:54.620 --> 02:30:55.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because that's.</v>

3375
02:30:55.371 --> 02:30:56.330
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

3376
02:30:56.331 --> 02:30:57.360
<v Speaker 6>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3377
02:30:57.770 --> 02:30:58.710
<v Speaker 6>I think that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3378
02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:01.760
<v Speaker 6>I think we're gonna end this because </v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian is tired and it's already 4:40.</v>

3379
02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:04.700
<v Speaker 6>So this is two hours and 40 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 6>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

3380
02:31:05.350 --> 02:31:10.350
<v Speaker 6>So we gave you an extra 10 minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 6>actual fake radio silence with bubbles </v>

3381
02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:14.660
<v Speaker 6>and the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3382
02:31:16.540 --> 02:31:18.710
<v Speaker 6>Do I get any inspiration?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me answer this stuff.</v>

3383
02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:23.780
<v Speaker 6>Did you a lot of inspiration from this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from your interactions with Tom Green </v>

3384
02:31:23.780 --> 02:31:24.060
<v Speaker 6>yet?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That word,</v>

3385
02:31:24.150 --> 02:31:28.620
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if this thing's moving so </v>
<v Speaker 6>fastly and his stuff.</v>

3386
02:31:28.621 --> 02:31:33.621
<v Speaker 6>This is food foods and spork shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's moving so fast.</v>

3387
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:39.420
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to fall a chat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3388
02:31:39.840 --> 02:31:40.920
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>definitely.</v>

3389
02:31:41.390 --> 02:31:46.390
<v Speaker 6>We did a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did Tom Green show once and it's </v>

3390
02:31:46.390 --> 02:31:48.891
<v Speaker 6>fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got this cool ass house where his </v>

3391
02:31:48.891 --> 02:31:49.430
<v Speaker 6>whole house is basically like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a.</v>

3392
02:31:49.480 --> 02:31:54.480
<v Speaker 6>He turned into a studio.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got this killer setup where he's </v>

3393
02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:58.110
<v Speaker 6>got like servers in his house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean his house is really like the </v>

3394
02:31:58.110 --> 02:31:59.400
<v Speaker 6>center of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like we're using ustream.</v>

3395
02:31:59.401 --> 02:32:01.400
<v Speaker 6>Ustream obviously has,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3396
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:06.750
<v Speaker 6>some servers set up somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we're just kinda connected to them </v>

3397
02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:07.770
<v Speaker 6>and broadcasting to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tom Green's got that shit all out of his</v>

3398
02:32:07.771 --> 02:32:08.160
<v Speaker 6>house.</v>

3399
02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:10.770
<v Speaker 6>Just really kind of a crazy expensive </v>
<v Speaker 6>way to do it.</v>

3400
02:32:11.430 --> 02:32:14.520
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it made sense before all these websites,</v>

3401
02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:16.680
<v Speaker 6>like ustream came around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now it's kind of like,</v>

3402
02:32:16.681 --> 02:32:19.970
<v Speaker 6>well you didn't have to do it and how's </v>
<v Speaker 6>Tom Ratio doing?</v>

3403
02:32:19.971 --> 02:32:21.230
<v Speaker 6>And people still watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3404
02:32:21.231 --> 02:32:23.310
<v Speaker 6>I think it's paid for via now or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

3405
02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:25.110
<v Speaker 6>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the paper view is the,</v>

3406
02:32:25.111 --> 02:32:26.100
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the footage,</v>

3407
02:32:26.101 --> 02:32:31.101
<v Speaker 6>the archives,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think it's hard to figure out how </v>

3408
02:32:31.101 --> 02:32:31.240
<v Speaker 6>to make money with this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3409
02:32:31.350 --> 02:32:36.350
<v Speaker 6>that's what it is with these guys like </v>
<v Speaker 6>Tom Green trying to figure out how to </v>

3410
02:32:36.350 --> 02:32:36.350
<v Speaker 6>make money with it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3411
02:32:36.350 --> 02:32:37.020
<v Speaker 6>I think it's kind of tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's doing comedy now.</v>

3412
02:32:37.410 --> 02:32:41.460
<v Speaker 6>He's doing standup comedy tours,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so yeah,</v>

3413
02:32:41.461 --> 02:32:42.900
<v Speaker 6>we got a lot of inspiration from all </v>
<v Speaker 6>this stuff.</v>

3414
02:32:42.901 --> 02:32:44.640
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of cool shit on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Internet,</v>

3415
02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:49.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Internet is where I spend a lot of </v>

3416
02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:49.880
<v Speaker 6>my time.</v>

3417
02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:49.880
<v Speaker 6>It's what Brian spends a lot of his </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

3418
02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:50.250
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

3419
02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:52.140
<v Speaker 6>we think that this is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3420
02:32:52.141 --> 02:32:54.870
<v Speaker 6>I just got a thing for my car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3421
02:32:54.930 --> 02:32:58.110
<v Speaker 6>yesterday I got a new car yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got an m three BMW,</v>
