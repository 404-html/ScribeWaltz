00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.170
getting on a plane,
if you're commuting every day,

21
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.090
it turns all that nonsense of being in your car or being stuck in a plane seat

22
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.810
to actually an entertaining experience.
Um,

23
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.310
I guess much like podcast,

24
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.520
I'm sort of like competing against myself with these things,
but whatever.
Um,

25
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.370
I ain't scared nocturnal.

48
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.040
We have a with references studies,

49
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.100
including our own study one which we recently completed,

50
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:19.300
an Alpha Brain Alpha brain.
I can't even talk.
Alpha brain clinical trial result,

51
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.640
a double blind placebo.

The standard method of scientific inquiry,

53
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.520
the way you're supposed to do these things.
Uh,
we did one,

54
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:30.550
got some positive results and when they're middle of doing a second one right

55
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:31.180
now,

56
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.900
all of it is much better explained at [inaudible] dot com than you'd get from a

57
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:39.030
stuttering comedian.
So go there,
enjoy a checkout.

58
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.990
The different foods and the different supplements like hemp force,
uh,
we have,

59
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.360
uh,
two different flavors.
Hemp force,
Vanilla Asai and hemp force,
uh,

60
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.410
Co Choco,
Maca,
uh,

61
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.640
both of them are really healthy protein supplement,
um,

62
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.990
alternatives when you're thinking about like taking a protein supplement,

63
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.420
one of the best protein supplements you can take as hamp.

64
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:05.470
It's super easily digestible by your body.
And ours is very,
very high in protein,

65
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.980
the most expensive,
finest protein powder that we can get.

66
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.280
And we sweetened with Stevia.
So there's very,
very little sugar,

67
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.010
less than one gram or one gram per serving.

68
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.720
And that's just completely naturally occurring sugar that,
uh,
is in,

69
00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:20.470
in the plan itself.
Uh,

Jamie Logan

74
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.960
<v 0>Experience Day,
Joe Rogan podcast all day.</v>

75
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.833
Right.

76
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.170
<v 1>Mark Kendall,
ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you sir.
Thanks for doing this man.</v>

77
00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:51.020
I really appreciate it.
Thanks for having me man.

78
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.600
It's awesome when I hear that there's a guy out there that's a celebrity,

79
00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:57.830
the plays pool better than me.
I get very excited and uh,

80
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.360
according to our mutual friend Jay hell for it.

81
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:02.910
He says you're the best celebrity pool player there is.

82
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.710
<v 2>That's I compliment.
Yeah,</v>

83
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.380
that's a high compliment coming from Jay because he knows a lot about pool.

84
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:12.640
But I mean,
I don't have to be the best all the time.
I mean,
I,
you know,

85
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.920
I'm definitely,
I'm,
I'm capable of playing like,
you know,

86
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.330
a d player or whatever.
I can just go,
just dog my brains out.

87
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.210
But when I get going with my arm,
you know,

88
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:29.820
loosened up and I'm hitting balls for a few days,
I,
I can get in into,
uh,

89
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.570
my play,
my speed.
Yeah.

90
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.280
<v 1>She don't know like pool player Lingo speed is how a guy will say he plays a</v>

91
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:43.110
speed,
you know,
he,
he's got a great speed.
That means it's,

92
00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:48.040
and it doesn't even mean going fast.
It just means your,
your,
your game.

93
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.300
<v 2>There's a,
you know,
it's funny,
uh,
in pool there's,</v>

94
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.650
there's so many different levels though.
It,

95
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.690
I think it goes way beyond like a player B player,
c player.

96
00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.570
But I see guys that,
I can't imagine playing better than this guy or private.

97
00:06:01.571 --> 00:06:02.480
We've got this level,

98
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:07.481
I'd like the bucket list would be totally happening and he has to get weight

99
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:10.780
from this dude and all this stuff and it's,

100
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.400
it's almost confusing how many different

101
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.100
<v 1>and what wait means is for folks who don't know the pooling handicap handicap</v>

102
00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:19.660
meaning like say if a,

103
00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:23.140
if mark and I played in marks and a player and I'm a B player,

104
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.670
mark would maybe like if we played nine ball marker,

105
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.040
maybe like give me the eight ball.

106
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.950
And what that means is like he would have to make the nine ball to win,

107
00:06:29.951 --> 00:06:32.770
but I could win making the eight ball or the nine ball.

108
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.180
And oftentimes when you're,

109
00:06:34.181 --> 00:06:37.240
you're seeing like really even big named guys match up.

110
00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:41.980
Like I saw rob sy as match up with Mika Immonen that they play in rob sizes of

111
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:46.120
the top pro,
but Amica eminent had to give rob Waite and you know,
he gave him,

112
00:06:46.121 --> 00:06:48.410
I think he gave him the eight ball.
Sure.
And,
uh,

113
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.710
people might not show up very much,
ran that low.
It might not,
you know,

114
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.850
when,
for folks who don't know 'em but 10 ball or nine ball,
either one of them,

115
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.050
their rotation games,

116
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.920
which means he played the one ball first and then you'd go to the two to the

117
00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:07.420
three and then to when you get the 10 ball in.
But when with a handicap,

118
00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:09.520
you could give a guy another game.
Like you could give a guy,

119
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.870
I've seen a guy like Shane van Bonin.
Uh,
he gives people like crazy games.

120
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:15.550
Like he said,
he'll give some live out.

121
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.520
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.
Too loud even,
right.
Yeah,
I mean,
if the guy can't play at all,
I mean,</v>

122
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.330
you know,
he'll give you every ball on the table.
Yeah.
Not yet.

123
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.760
<v 1>That means all you'd have to do is make the two ball and you win.</v>

124
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.890
Whereas he mass to make the two,
three,
four,
five.

125
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.590
<v 2>Imagine this,
how good this guy is.
You know Cory dual,</v>

126
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.230
one of the best in the world.

127
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.340
Shane gave him the five and six ball playing 10 ball just now up in up north and

128
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.560
you know,
it was laughable.
Like even Cory left guy,
I can't believe it.
He goes,

129
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:49.640
I guess I need the foreign five.
He beat him with the five and six he beat him.

130
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.500
Yeah.
What doesn't giving,
giving him the five and six in 10 volt like,
you know,

131
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:54.981
it's crazy,

132
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:59.981
but it really is not going to show up if he's breaking the way he does it,

133
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.450
you know,
all he's going,
oh there it goes my money and there goes my money.

134
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:08.420
But like every game,
you know from the chair,
you know what I mean?
So,

135
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.840
even though it sounds like,
oh,
Shane's really giving something up here,
you know,

136
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.500
if he breaks,
because that's the whole thing with him.
Um,

137
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.950
well people,
you know,
some say he just breaks,
you know good or whatever,
but that,

138
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.450
you know,
you know,
that's crappy.
This guy plays behind the brake like crazy good.

139
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:31.210
But um,
but that break is big when you get on that level of,
you know,

140
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.240
these parole level.

141
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.780
If some guy is breaking like God and get in shape on the one and all this stuff,

142
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.670
you know,
and another guy is a dry breaker,
but he plays like God to,

143
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.650
you can guarantee the guy that's the breaker is going to,
this is awesome.

144
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.400
<v 1>Or is it got side lingo,
try breaker breaking like God,</v>

145
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.790
what it's all about is the shot on pools,
the break shot,

146
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:59.850
you smash them balls hard and the balls go flying into the pockets.

147
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:01.440
Ideally if they don't,

148
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.620
he spread the whole table out and then you leave a lot of shots for your

149
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:05.280
opponent.

150
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.230
The problem with a guy like Shane van Boeing as he breaks so good that you know,

151
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:15.060
almost almost every break he's making one if not two.

152
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:17.710
I've seen him make five balls on the break,
right?
10 balls

153
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.160
<v 2>and he gets shaped on the one.
That's the whole thing.
And,</v>

154
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:24.010
and players complain about that and then I don't understand it.
I'm like,

155
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.200
why are you complaining?
Because this guy breaks good.
You know,

156
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.630
the answer to me would be work on your brick.

157
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.600
Don't complain because some other guy's great.
You know,

158
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.900
when you make it too much sense there mark,
anyway,
yeah,

159
00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:38.950
you make it too much sense.

160
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.800
You got to give people the opportunity to just complain about shit.

161
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:46.080
That's what they like.
Well,
you know,
I complain about stuff.
I know this guy,

162
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.100
he's a fag.
Well,

163
00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:50.920
one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about it because uh,
you know,

164
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:51.470
cause you're

165
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.800
<v 1>such a really good pool player is there's,</v>

166
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.830
there's something involved in like trying to get like really good at pool are

167
00:09:59.261 --> 00:10:02.830
really good in anything that requires an incredible amount of time where it's

168
00:10:02.831 --> 00:10:07.831
like the level of commitment that you have to have to get really good at that.

169
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.410
I guess it's gotta be Kinda similar to guitar playing in a way,

170
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.310
like the amount of practice that you have to put in the level and that there's

171
00:10:15.311 --> 00:10:17.650
just levels and levels and levels to this stuff.

172
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.110
<v 2>I've had different loves in my life.
I mean I've,</v>

173
00:10:20.111 --> 00:10:24.600
I've always gone back to the guitar because like my family was,

174
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:29.250
there's just so much music in my family.
My grandpa was a touring piano player.

175
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:31.820
My Dad is a jazz trumpet player.

176
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.250
My mom saying music in the house all the time,

177
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.570
but at the same time I still played baseball from the time I was eight until I

178
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:44.460
was 18 you know,
and my dad's dream for me was to not be the big,

179
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.120
you know,

180
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.460
star musician because he just thought there was no chance that that but,

181
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.590
but to be the La dodger you'd edit.

182
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.120
I mean there's a chance that that more than there was,

183
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:58.140
you must have played really good.
I can tell you no,
I really didn't.
I mean I,

184
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:58.801
you know,

185
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:03.050
I was a really good pitcher probably when I was like in Pony League I was kind

186
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.500
of known as one of the top pitchers.

187
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.610
My arm started hurting when I was around 17 like after three innings I would

188
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.730
have my dad come out and take me out.
You know,

189
00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:13.740
usually that guy comes out and says,
oh,

190
00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:17.070
how you're feeling and all that kind of stuff.
No,
I didn't wait for all that.

191
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:20.190
I told them,
you know,
put me on first and my arms hurt.
And again,

192
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.570
I throw curve balls when I was like 11 years old.
And everybody said,
Oh God,

193
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:27.390
he's going to throw his elbow out.
That never happened.

194
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:32.010
What happened was from fastballs,
my arm got kind of jacked,
you know.

195
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.690
So after three innings it was hurting.

196
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.260
Not to mention you have to be such a standout player to get scouted by some,

197
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.950
you know,
by pro,
you know scouts,

198
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.730
your numbers have to stand above the entire league.

199
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.860
I had two guys on my own team when I was in,
you know,
this is 16 1718 year olds,

200
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.610
two guys on my own team hit more home runs in me,
ran faster through harder.

201
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:00.760
Tiki know what I mean?
So my chances,

202
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.580
and I even told my dad this when I made the decision,

203
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:05.800
I'm going fulltime music and you know,

204
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.670
kind of say love you to baseball is I have zero chance to make it and baseball,

205
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:12.820
Nissan.

206
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.050
<v 1>What's the true?</v>

207
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:17.680
Did you really have zero chance or would it have to be something that you

208
00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:22.681
completely abandoned everything else and just through your life at baseball it

209
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:24.124
seems like it.

210
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.760
<v 2>I did.
I mean,
I really,
I could have played maybe a different position,</v>

211
00:12:28.761 --> 00:12:30.530
but I really wasn't.
Um,

212
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.070
I didn't have enough power to,

213
00:12:34.071 --> 00:12:38.300
I think who's going to skip over the two guys that are better than me on my team

214
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.380
to go to men number three and let's sign him because he's just cool or something

215
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.840
to get better though,
isn't it possible that kitty dedicated myself and I,
and I,

216
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.270
and I do look back and say,

217
00:12:50.271 --> 00:12:53.220
I wish I would have worked out with maybe some light weights,

218
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.260
maybe gained some strength and money.
Not really.

219
00:12:57.261 --> 00:13:01.880
I learned this pull up.
So you know,
stuff.
It's,
you know,
PE,
stuff like that.

220
00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:06.650
But I didn't do any,
I didn't really train.
And actually we didn't have all the,

221
00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:06.981
you know,

222
00:13:06.981 --> 00:13:11.390
the video and the instruction and the pros coming camps and all that stuff.

223
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.890
We just like go play and you know,
whoever had the natural ability,
you know,

224
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.650
he rose above everybody,
you know.
So,
um,

225
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.300
<v 1>it's a such a different game today with all the strength and conditioning leak</v>

226
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.420
everywhere.

227
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.640
<v 2>Even little league,
I'm watching these 12 year olds,</v>

228
00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:29.760
they look like small professionals.
They all,

229
00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:32.960
their mechanics are perfect,
you know,
um,

230
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.770
fundamentals at the plate.
They s they look like little tiny Perot's,
you know?

231
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.260
<v 1>Well,
I'm fascinated by strength and conditioning programs now.
I mean,</v>

232
00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:44.680
it's one of the things being a mixed martial arts commentator and getting to see

233
00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:48.130
the improvement that some fighters have had by incorporating strength and

234
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:52.330
conditioning programs and getting to see like how scientific they've become and

235
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:55.120
how,
I mean the,
the,
the different things that they work on.

236
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:59.260
Like I watched a video last night,
uh,
with Phil Davis,
who's one of the top,
uh,

237
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:04.030
UFC light heavyweight,
right?
And he was doing this weird,

238
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.410
uh,
exercise.
It was this balance exercise where they're like,

239
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.700
he's bouncing on one foot that's on a roller and they're throwing a ball at him

240
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:16.660
and he's catching it with one hand and throwing it back while he's balancing.

241
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.780
It's like,
you would think like,
what,
what,
what is this?
Like,
what are they doing?

242
00:14:19.781 --> 00:14:24.680
But they're working on foot strength and stability and balance and it's just,

243
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:29.940
there's so much science involved in strength and conditioning and getting better

244
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:31.210
at athletics.
Now

245
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.960
<v 2>those are there.
Maybe,
you know,
when,
when I hear you speak,</v>

246
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:39.670
I maybe there would be a chance for me to improve it if I really got into,
uh,

247
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.250
you know,
working out and stuff.
My,
my,
you know,

248
00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:44.380
the singer that's been in my band for like four years now.

249
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:47.200
His name's Terry a loose and uh,
he used to,

250
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.440
he's been in martial arts for like 27 years or something.
You know,

251
00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:52.010
he did Jiu Jitsu,

252
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.640
<v 3>judo kickboxing.
He's worked with,
uh,
Baas Rutan Ah,</v>

253
00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.900
he,
you know,
he trained with him.
He,
he's an instructor and um,

254
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.760
so he's got to get me going here.
Well,

255
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.290
a great thing to do just for,
just to make you God mental body feel good.

256
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.610
I bet it really helps.

257
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.570
My nerves kind of get rattled sometimes and I think I,

258
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:16.490
it's because I don't work out enough.

259
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:21.350
I don't have a strict routine and I'm not taking supplements and all this stuff.

260
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:26.300
You know,
I hear your commercials about the different supplements and,

261
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.190
well,
I don't know if we have anything that would really help nerves,

262
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:32.590
but I definitely think that exercise exercise helps your nerves.
I know it does.

263
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.710
I have been a dead kidding myself to working out,

264
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.360
kind at home,
but I'm not like running,
I'm not doing it enough cardio.

265
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:46.010
I'm doing tons of sit ups and you know,
arm stuff and pushups.
It's just,

266
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:46.581
you know what man,

267
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:49.850
get an elliptical machine and just put on a television show that you enjoy.

268
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.410
It's a great way to do it.
You know,
just get it.

269
00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:53.450
Unless I have an elliptical machine,

270
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:57.260
I put it on and I put fights on and I watched the fights while I'll just do the

271
00:15:57.261 --> 00:16:01.540
lifting.
I just,
I didn't think about it.
It's just automatic.
I just,
I can't do it.

272
00:16:01.541 --> 00:16:03.830
I'm gonna start getting into some courses series.
We just,

273
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:05.960
you force yourself to do it and then,
you know,

274
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:09.080
write it on a schedule that you have to do at x amount of days and then when

275
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:12.440
those days are over,
you'll feel the improvement and then that becomes addictive,

276
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:17.060
you know,
feeling like I need to be addicted to that.
Yeah.

277
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:19.420
It's easy to be addicted to bad things.
But,
uh,

278
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.160
being addicted to something good is,
it's something,

279
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:26.960
it's really difficult to force your,
just force your discipline,
you know,

280
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:28.330
force your body to go.
And like,

281
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.220
I'm going to be addicted to drinking fresh squeezed juices,

282
00:16:31.221 --> 00:16:34.430
vegetable juices every morning,
and then taking a yoga class every day.

283
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.220
But if you did do that,
God,
the,
it'd be incredible.

284
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:39.920
Cause I'm very compulsive when I get into things.

285
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:44.220
I have to become the greatest on earth with it.
You know what I just like,
Eh,

286
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.220
I've always kind of been like that.
So,

287
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.810
and I actually had an alcohol problem.
I,
you know,
um,

288
00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.180
I was a beer drinker and you know,

289
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.350
go ahead and throw it low on the food chain,

290
00:16:57.351 --> 00:17:01.100
but I got just as much pain as some other people from the abuse,
you know,

291
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.960
oh listen,
alcohol's alcohol,

292
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:05.420
whether you get it in the form of whiskey or what are you getting form of 12

293
00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:09.470
beers a night.
Yeah,
it's alcohol.
You still wake up shaky and you're all scared.

294
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.770
And,
and I,
and I was able to get away from that.
That and you know,

295
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.800
kind of do other things and you know,
help people that are struggling and just,

296
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:23.000
you know,
channeling my energy in,
in,
in more positive areas.

297
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:27.530
But do you find that like I've met a lot of people that are really great at

298
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:30.110
things and really impulsive and really,
you know,

299
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:32.840
just the type of people that throw themselves into the way that you described.

300
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:37.090
I'm sure you must have had to do that to get so good at guitar and I'm sure you,

301
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.840
you did that to get really good at pool,

302
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.820
but do you find it that's sort of like a part of your mind that can kind of get

303
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.360
sidetracked and fucked with a drug?
Like,

304
00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:50.280
and then that becomes like the thing that you become impulsive

305
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.360
<v 2>about that becomes the thing that you get addicted to that it,
well,</v>

306
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:55.890
that's why they say,
uh,

307
00:17:55.891 --> 00:18:00.891
they call it somebody that gets really addicted to a drug wasted talent because

308
00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:06.111
they're so good at something and they're letting this drug of choice or whatever

309
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:13.550
ruin this blessing that they've received that makes them great at something.

310
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.380
And I was lucky to be able to get away from it.
Um,

311
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.850
but as far as the guitar goes,
you know,
I played since I was nine years old.

312
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:28.260
It's just,
I did other things too,
but when I became,

313
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:32.430
when I was about 15,
I was pretty obsessed with it.

314
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.810
Like I would go to the liquor store literally with it strapped around me.

315
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:42.330
Really?
Yeah.
I been playing the Acoustic Guitar,
you know,
playing Santana.
I was,

316
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.650
when I was 14 years old,

317
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:47.850
I was literally in a band and we only played Santana.

318
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:53.060
Wow.
And not even realize that that would be considered a tribute man.

319
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.790
I just go,
no,
Carlson and Dan is the greatest soul.
It's just play his stuff.

320
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.800
And uh,
but yeah,
I guess,
you know,

321
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.850
I've kind of always been that way compulsive.

322
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:05.670
But the difference with the guitars,
I loved it.
You know,

323
00:19:05.671 --> 00:19:09.570
it wasn't just compulsive,
uh,
energy.
It was,
he,

324
00:19:09.571 --> 00:19:12.420
it was because I loved music.
I've always,

325
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.500
even when I was a little kid and sitting by the high flyer,
whatever,

326
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.310
singing along to girl from Ipanema,
my mom and dad don't,

327
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.150
he sings in key.
He's like,
he hears it,
you know,

328
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:27.870
is like the melodies are the notes that are coming out,
you know,

329
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:33.120
which I've had this ear from my parents.
I mean they,
my dad had perfect pitch.

330
00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:37.560
He can hit piano notes and could tell you what they are and,
and stuff like that.

331
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.610
So I have this ear,
I could hear it.
And when I first got records,
I actually,

332
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.470
that was one of my first albums right there,
the Andrea Hendricks experience.

333
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:49.390
And I got creamed,
destroy the gears and um,

334
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.120
the doors is that strange days.
And when I listened to that music,

335
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.890
I only heard the singer.

336
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:59.430
I literally wasn't even listening to the guitar was just singing the melody,

337
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.353
you know what I mean?

338
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:05.550
But then I started being able to pick up the chords on my guitar and I was very

339
00:20:05.551 --> 00:20:09.000
young,
like 10,
you know?
No,
no.
A training.

340
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.060
You just learned how to do it on your own.
I took a lesson from a guy,

341
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:17.170
but if you only had one lesson,
I've learned from a lot of people,
just um,

342
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.660
friends of mine,
hey man,
show me that,
you know,
or whatever.
Right.
Uh,

343
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.810
as far as a true sit down,
pay the guy,
you know,
okay,

344
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.100
show me how to play or whatever.

345
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:31.350
It was this guy who was in this like surf band when I was like probably 10 or
11,

346
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.600
and he was teaching me like Tom Dooley and you know,

347
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.500
the stuff I didn't want to really be Tom Dooley hang down your head.

348
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:43.570
Tom Dooley hang down your head and cry.

349
00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.400
He never heard it that way.
It's just an old song,
you know?
Um,

350
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.050
you know,
kind of like Jimmy cracked corn and stuff,
you know what I mean?

351
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.740
But I guess,
you know,
he had to learn that kind of stuff.
But I,
I just,

352
00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:01.870
I was just an interested,
I wa I probably,
you know,

353
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:04.780
when I tell kids that are coming up now,
I say,
you know,

354
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:08.470
it's great if you've got a good ear,
cause you,
you're like halfway there.

355
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.890
If you learn how to read.
And you and you know,
you know,

356
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.700
all the theory and everything.
Plus you have the grade year,

357
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.690
you're going to have it up on just about everybody.
You know,
those are,

358
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:23.490
those are the guys.
Um,
but to have that natural,
um,

359
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.320
I don't know.
I have a natural feel for music,
like,
um,

360
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.210
and those are the people that inspired me to play or you know,

361
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.670
guitar players that just play from the heart.
They,

362
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.660
they play notes because it's how they breathe.

363
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.960
It's how they feel.
It's,
you know,

364
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.070
it's coming out of the pores of their skin.
It's,
it's from the heart,

365
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:46.360
the soul or whatever you want to call it.

366
00:21:46.361 --> 00:21:50.050
But those are the guys that made me want to play.
I mean,

367
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.440
Billy Gibbons doesn't bend,

368
00:21:52.441 --> 00:21:56.020
knows the way he does because it said it on a piece of paper somewhere.

369
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:59.860
You know what I mean?
So it's something you feel and,

370
00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:04.660
and I've been fairly good at that,
um,
feeling,

371
00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:07.120
you know,
notes and stuff and people have,
you know,

372
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:12.460
made comments about the way I play and stuff,
but it's just,
um,
you know,

373
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.160
just the,
it's kind of the gifts from the,
like I said,

374
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.150
from my parents and my grandpa and everybody sort of genetics.
It's a,
yeah,

375
00:22:19.151 --> 00:22:23.320
it is it because I don't think you just,
you know,

376
00:22:23.321 --> 00:22:24.190
it's not me.

377
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:29.191
I just don't believe that I can just be born hearing music that well,

378
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:30.390
unless it would

379
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.390
<v 3>bled into me somewhere.
You know?</v>

380
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:37.990
I think there's definitely some in just born talent that some people have.

381
00:22:38.671 --> 00:22:40.710
It's just whether or not they pursue it.

382
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.980
And there's also that thing that we were,

383
00:22:42.981 --> 00:22:47.520
we were saying the negative aspect of it is that same sort of the personality

384
00:22:47.521 --> 00:22:52.350
trait that gets you to be able to sit down and really explore music for hours

385
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.780
and hours at a time,
which is what it takes to be a great guitarist.

386
00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:00.080
Can many times manifest itself in addiction and manifest that same sort of just,

387
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:08.300
just throwing yourself at something and being completely engulfed in it for

388
00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:13.170
whatever reason a lot of times manifests itself in either alcoholism or drug

389
00:23:13.171 --> 00:23:17.850
addiction or,
or what have you.
It's so common.
It is.
Yeah.

390
00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:19.240
I always kind of wondered.
I mean,

391
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.490
I just think an addict is just an addict.

392
00:23:23.491 --> 00:23:27.000
I really don't think that music has that much to do with it.

393
00:23:27.001 --> 00:23:31.270
But I think a trigger for,
uh,
you know,

394
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.750
like say a recovering addict or whatever,

395
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.140
<v 2>he's out on the road,
he's in this band,</v>

396
00:23:36.141 --> 00:23:40.070
he has all this pressure from everybody telling him how great he is and

397
00:23:40.071 --> 00:23:43.460
everything because that can become pressure when people are telling you you're

398
00:23:43.461 --> 00:23:46.400
the greatest man on earth and you're the best player in the world and all this

399
00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:51.350
stuff,
you kinda just don't want to take it serious and,
um,

400
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.450
it can drive you crazy.

401
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:57.590
And I think that causes some people to numb themselves,

402
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.740
really to reality.
So I found that,
I found that

403
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.770
in a few instances.
Uh,
this,
this friend of mine,

404
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.170
he was totally,

405
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:13.070
every time he would get close to being signed,

406
00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:15.140
having a great opportunity,

407
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:20.540
he would just sabotage it with alcohol and he,
you know what I mean?
But,

408
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.380
but what he tell you,
I mean,
I could see it from afar.

409
00:24:24.381 --> 00:24:26.310
I knew what he was doing.
He,

410
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.210
he was trying to sabotage it and because he was afraid,

411
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.230
kind of have the pressure of being out there in the limelight.

412
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:38.270
So the people are afraid of success.
Yes,
absolutely.
Absolutely.

413
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.530
But I just think,
you know,
it,
it Kinda,
it's mindblowing,

414
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.753
um,

415
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.590
that somebody fights their whole life to get somewhere and they get there and

416
00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:51.220
die out over a heroin overdose.
You know,

417
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.300
I don't know what the analogy would be,
but I,

418
00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:01.090
that was just one of my thoughts is that it could be that the pressure of just

419
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.800
being in the,
in the,

420
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.650
in the music world and stuff and having all this going on,
you know,

421
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.690
because it does seem to,
it seems as if it,
it happened like that.

422
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:15.590
You know,

423
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.250
even though you've been grinding in the clubs and the for years and years,

424
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.030
it's like all of a sudden you're in an arena,
an arena setting.

425
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.800
You got cameras all around microphones,
you know,
people coming up to you.

426
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:31.640
I do.
I'm just making a guess at this.
I don't know.

427
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:35.540
When you think why people kill themselves,
you know,
with drugs,

428
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.380
maybe it has nothing at all to do with that.
Maybe they're just addicts.

429
00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:42.320
You could strip away all the music and they're going to die of a heroin
overdose.

430
00:25:42.321 --> 00:25:43.680
Anyways,
I've done a lot of,

431
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
<v 1>and I personally think that the environment of celebrity on that level to be in</v>

432
00:25:50.381 --> 00:25:53.440
a band like great white fucking gigantic,

433
00:25:53.441 --> 00:25:57.880
huge arena band and you're fucking on every magazine and you're on the radio

434
00:25:57.881 --> 00:26:01.540
every day and that pressure,
the kind of pressure and recognition,

435
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.000
he's totally alien for a human being.

436
00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.270
I mean the only people that ever got that kind of attention in the past where

437
00:26:07.271 --> 00:26:10.940
kings and even a leaders of tribes of the,

438
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.030
they just never got that kind of attention.

439
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:18.070
I just think it's completely alien to the human race and didn't exist until mass

440
00:26:18.071 --> 00:26:22.330
media was invented until the beginning of the 20th century when they figured out

441
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:25.450
how to broadcast things and movies and then you know,

442
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.770
in songs and records and then music videos and what have you.

443
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:34.270
That that is not a part of human history.
It's not normal.
It's,

444
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.080
it may be normal to be the center of attention in a small group or even a large

445
00:26:38.081 --> 00:26:41.830
group,
but those people know you and you're talking in front of them.

446
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.980
If you're speaking in front of a,
a

447
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.610
<v 3>group of people that want to hear your opinion on things or if you're a leader</v>

448
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:48.840
does,
those are all normal things.

449
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:53.841
But to be on a fucking stage playing guitar and 20,000 people are going,

450
00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:59.400
wow,
that's alien,
alien,

451
00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:04.540
<v 2>you know,
a very shy person.</v>

452
00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:07.930
I kind of worked on that over the years.
But uh,
you know,

453
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:12.280
to actually to go out in front of 300,000 which has happened a few times,

454
00:27:12.281 --> 00:27:16.090
100,000.
Yeah,
we played in front of 300,000 people with a lot of bands.
Like,

455
00:27:16.091 --> 00:27:17.520
I mean,
you know,
like iron maiden,

456
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.240
<v 3>who cares how many other people were there and you can play it in front of</v>

457
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.240
300,000 people.
Actually believe it or not,

458
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:27.080
<v 2>I was not even remotely scared about it.</v>

459
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.820
I just went out until the handled it.

460
00:27:28.821 --> 00:27:33.821
But if you put me in a setting like this,

461
00:27:34.071 --> 00:27:37.790
like with maybe 10 people around the room,
then I,
that makes me nervous.

462
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.760
<v 3>No,
I'm serious.
And I don't know why this is sort of the same way with comedy.</v>

463
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:44.040
I mean,
I've never done anything with 300,000 people,

464
00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:46.920
but one of the things that will make you nervous more than anything is going on

465
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:50.940
stage in front of two folks.
Two people in the audience is like,
Whoa,

466
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.050
no,

467
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.990
<v 2>because you don't really feel,</v>

468
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.300
it's just a sea of people.
I mean,
you're just playing,
you know,
it's,

469
00:27:59.301 --> 00:28:02.390
you don't feel like all eyes are on me or whatever,

470
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.580
but when you're playing like in at a wedding or you know,
it's like,

471
00:28:07.581 --> 00:28:10.870
Whoa,
man,
you know,
they're focusing in on my fingernails here.
And

472
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:17.510
<v 3>it's like,
whoa.
You know?</v>

473
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.880
I think that that's what a lot of the,

474
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.470
dealing with the pressure of the reason why so many rock stars can't handle it,

475
00:28:23.471 --> 00:28:26.810
or actors or,
I mean,
I think actors,
it's,

476
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.160
it's slightly different because it's not a live performance thing,

477
00:28:30.161 --> 00:28:32.500
but just the accolades that they're getting,
it's all the same.

478
00:28:32.501 --> 00:28:35.470
It's completely alien.
It's just you.
It's very,

479
00:28:35.471 --> 00:28:38.950
very difficult to ask a person to be able to manage something like that.

480
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.360
That mean,
who are you going to?

481
00:28:40.361 --> 00:28:42.890
We're going to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist data.

482
00:28:42.891 --> 00:28:46.570
I've never fucking experience being on stage in front of 300,000 people.

483
00:28:46.571 --> 00:28:48.910
And I actually thought about that when you were speaking earlier.
I go,

484
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:53.480
maybe they should have like,
you know,
rock and roll psychiatry have Ozzie go.

485
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.553
Yeah,

486
00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.790
go see [inaudible] wife's running everything and just sit in the back round

487
00:28:58.791 --> 00:28:59.624
night.
Yeah.

488
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.310
<v 2>And you know,
my manager Jay was actually English and,
and he told me one time,</v>

489
00:29:03.311 --> 00:29:07.990
he goes,
Kendall,
don't even read your own press.
Don't believe it for sure.

490
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.950
Do not believe your own press.
And it's better just to not even read it.

491
00:29:11.951 --> 00:29:16.951
Don't sit there and read stuff about people talking about a much feel you have

492
00:29:17.381 --> 00:29:19.030
and you know,
or whatever.

493
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.420
And if you don't take yourself too seriously,

494
00:29:22.421 --> 00:29:27.030
that's probably the best way to kind of cruise through your,
you know,

495
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.690
stuff.
Obviously you celebrate with your family and friends and,
and dig it,
man,

496
00:29:31.691 --> 00:29:34.240
we just got this cool thing and you want to share it with them.

497
00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:38.510
But as far as like,
you know,
taking yourself too serious.
I mean,

498
00:29:38.511 --> 00:29:42.130
it was probably best to stay away from all that brutal worst thing is talking

499
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.430
<v 1>to someone who,
uh,</v>

500
00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:48.460
it has moderate or good success in show business and all they want to talk about

501
00:29:48.881 --> 00:29:51.700
is their success in show business and all the great things they're doing.

502
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.400
It's like,
oh my God,
dude,
you're fucking killing me right now.

503
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.670
You're killing me with this stupid fucking stroke.

504
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:01.500
You're doing yourself ego stroke.
Yeah,
it's a,

505
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:05.500
it's also think about that.
Think about the idea of reading your own press.

506
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.680
That's another fucking the alien thing.
The,

507
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:12.400
the alien thing of reading perhaps hundreds of other people's opinions about you

508
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.850
or something bad.
Oh fuck,
I'm going to choke this guy.

509
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.360
I have a theory about that too.
I,
uh,
I've,

510
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.510
I think that that is like snake venom and that if you're not exposed to snake

511
00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:29.470
venom and you get it,
it can really fuck you up because snake venom is,
you know,

512
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:32.770
it's toxic.
But if you get a little bit of it all the time,

513
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.330
then it becomes something you're immune to.
And then you go,
oh look,
a shithead

514
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.100
negative asshole.
The thing about negative people,

515
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:43.990
and this is this is a really important point,

516
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.590
is sometimes they have a point and you can learn from them,

517
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.620
and sometimes negative people say things that you don't want to hear.

518
00:30:50.621 --> 00:30:54.190
You don't like it,
but then you read it and go,
Ooh,
there's something there.

519
00:30:54.191 --> 00:30:57.970
There's something there.
This is a point there.
You could use them,

520
00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.320
but for them,

521
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.560
God being that person is so damaging to you to shoot them to the person who's

522
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:06.610
being negative.
Oh,
absolutely.
They don't even realize it.

523
00:31:06.611 --> 00:31:11.611
They think they're hurting you like talk shit about a person me or talk shit

524
00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:13.030
about you all day long,

525
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.880
but it doesn't change the fact that you're still mark Kendall.

526
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.120
You know you're still who you are.
You're still this bad ass fucking guitars.

527
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.450
They can't change who you are by saying something mean.

528
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.560
But what they do do is they change their very essence.

529
00:31:26.561 --> 00:31:29.560
They're very energy that they're spreading out to drivers,

530
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.470
that what they're putting out to all the people around them to,

531
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:36.550
they're the people that come in contact with what they're projecting.

532
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:41.050
It's they're just putting out shit.
And that's a good percentage of people.

533
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.530
If you read their blogs,
if you go to their Twitter pages,
if you listen to their,

534
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.820
you know,
if someone has a negative radio show or a podcast or whatever,

535
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:54.040
what you're hearing is just all this fucking horrible stuff.
Nothing good,

536
00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:57.730
nothing positive,
nothing encouraging.
And that's who they are.

537
00:31:57.731 --> 00:31:59.130
That's the world they live there.

538
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.200
It's not like they do that and then they go take yoga classes and then they're,

539
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.540
they're kissing puppies and hugging people all day.

540
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:08.320
Then you don't pump out negative shit and then go out and be in beautiful,

541
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:11.050
wonderful person and go,
hey,
that's all just show businessman.

542
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.310
The real me is loving and kind and super cool to be around.

543
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.660
I just act like an asshole on Twitter.
No,
you're an asshole.
You know,

544
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.720
and you can learn from assholes.
You can get something from them.

545
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.840
But points and things.
Yeah,
little bit.
I look,
I've,

546
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:30.860
I have read things that are very negative about me that PR maybe totally unjust,

547
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:36.490
but I could say is it possible that someone else could think like this and could

548
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:40.310
it be like,
does it make sense that they could think like,
and if that's the case,

549
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.630
<v 3>if it's defensible then I should probably work on whatever aspect of my own</v>

550
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:47.330
personality that's causing this opening to be there.

551
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.400
Sort of like in a martial arts standpoint,
if,

552
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.130
if like if you're a bad motherfucker in Jujitsu,

553
00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:55.430
like say if you're really good at Jujitsu and you've got a great arm drag and

554
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:58.280
you graded taking people's back and you'd choke people on a regular basis,

555
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.500
but if someone gets your back,

556
00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:04.370
you've got no defense and you tap out really quick,
you need to work on that.

557
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.080
Like that's something that you need to figure out.

558
00:33:06.081 --> 00:33:10.160
Like why do I tap when someone gets my back?
That's real.
That's a real thing.

559
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:15.460
And that analogy I think presents itself in the martial arts analogy presents

560
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:19.670
itself when you're dealing with a lot of different people that are critiquing

561
00:33:19.671 --> 00:33:22.790
your work or a lot of different people that are putting things out there and

562
00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:25.280
they can fuck with you.
I have a friend,
I'm not going to name names,

563
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:29.960
but he's a fighter.
And um,
he and his wife,

564
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:34.910
they had a huge problem because he was like,
there was negative,

565
00:33:34.911 --> 00:33:35.280
uh,

566
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:40.010
someone's saying negative things about him and her on Twitter or on Facebook or

567
00:33:40.011 --> 00:33:44.090
I forget where it was,
but they were just,
just,
you know,
just being an asshole,

568
00:33:44.091 --> 00:33:46.700
just saying really mean nasty stuff about him and his wife.

569
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.400
But the way they look and about her weight,
she looks,

570
00:33:49.401 --> 00:33:52.310
and it was devastating to them,
to the bolt of them.
And he would take like,

571
00:33:52.311 --> 00:33:55.790
here's a guy,
he's a fucking cage fighter and he's fighting professionally.

572
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.530
You know,
it's really a bad motherfucker,

573
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:02.710
but this the words of some 13 year old kid word waking them up in the middle of

574
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.500
night fucking shithead.
Like,
that's crazy.
I,
I've,

575
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.630
I've been down this road,
you know,

576
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:12.440
with haters and not people that are just slightly negative or whatever,

577
00:34:12.441 --> 00:34:14.390
but just people that just,

578
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.950
alls they do is go say you suck and you know,
you're,
you know,

579
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:23.810
or whatever.
That's what they do.
Those people,
and I've even,
you know,

580
00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:28.670
as a band,
we've talked about it,
don't give them any energy whatsoever.
Nothing.

581
00:34:28.671 --> 00:34:33.350
Just let them hate away.
Good luck with that feedback with,
you know,

582
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:36.020
I'm not going to feed back with somebody that's saying something that makes no

583
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:39.950
sense whatsoever and it doesn't change who you are.
It doesn't do anything.

584
00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:43.310
I'm still going to be,
exactly,
that's what they don't understand.

585
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.000
They think that they're going to sort of define you in somehow and minimize you.

586
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.150
Not going to come to my shows anyways.
No.

587
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.910
Only my fans come to the shows because not like that.

588
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.190
They probably want to be you.
You know,

589
00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:59.070
they probably had like a failed musical attempt and you know,

590
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:03.320
they look at you in this fucking guy,
simple bullshit music.

591
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.330
I'm tired of his fucking cords.

592
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:09.170
I'm tired of the way shakes his head when he plays fuck that asshole.

593
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:11.220
But what's really driving them nuts?

594
00:35:11.221 --> 00:35:13.160
So it's really driving them nuts as their own personal fail.

595
00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:14.420
When's your next album coming out?

596
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.350
Do you think Michael Jordan goes on youtube videos and talk shit about people,

597
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.060
you know what I mean?
Michael Jordan's busy.
He's busy being Microsoft example.

598
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:27.800
Winners don't have time to be fucking haters on Youtube.
No,
they just don't.

599
00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:32.390
And it really makes you look bad.
It especially a high profile dude,
you know,

600
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:36.530
fighting back with somebody.
Oh you know,
listen,
I've made that mistake before.

601
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:37.860
Just thinking I was being cute.

602
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:42.300
<v 1>Uh,
trying to like get the,
I'll show them,
but then you're like,
what am I doing?</v>

603
00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:45.150
Like why,
why am I showing them what am I,
what do what and where am I,

604
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:49.080
what am I trying to accomplish here?
But it's like what I did it,

605
00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:51.840
I treated people that would like say mean things to me.

606
00:35:51.841 --> 00:35:54.600
Like I would treat a Heckler heckler at a comedy club,

607
00:35:54.601 --> 00:35:56.220
but that's a completely different situation.

608
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.910
And heckler in a comedy club you have to address.
I mean it's,

609
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.500
it's being forced upon you.

610
00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.620
<v 2>Were you ever been involved?
Uh,
really seen that.
I've seen a few comedians.</v>

611
00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:10.690
Have you got a guy going Nissa oh,
have I?
Oh my goodness.

612
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.720
How do you deal with that?
He just stealing people.

613
00:36:13.721 --> 00:36:18.040
Like I know some Comedians,
they'll,
they'll say things to the dude like,

614
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.410
you know,
I don't know how.
Or do you just act like he's,

615
00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.860
<v 1>there are no,
you can't act like they're not there.
Okay.</v>

616
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:28.610
What I came up at the comedy store in Hollywood and the comedy store,
the,

617
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.520
the problem with the comedy store is the benefit of the comedy store.

618
00:36:31.521 --> 00:36:35.030
And that's that the insane people are running the asylum.

619
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:36.630
It's all patients,

620
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.130
but it's all the comedians run the place that doorman are all comedians.

621
00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:41.470
The guy worked in the cover booth is,

622
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.680
I'm not bullshitting everybody know the guys that seat people,
they're comedians.

623
00:36:45.681 --> 00:36:48.830
And then the comics also go on stage.
The only thing,

624
00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:52.130
it's not a comedian as the guy that books the room.
So I mean it's,

625
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.310
there's no crowd control.
Like none.

626
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.180
So when you would go on stage there and you're also dealing with sunset

627
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:00.470
Hollywood,

628
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:05.060
you're dealing with a lot of people also that they have aspirations that are

629
00:37:05.061 --> 00:37:08.480
unrealized.
They want to be famous,
they want to be an actor.

630
00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.130
They want to be a music.
They want to be something.

631
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.280
And then here there are sitting in the audience looking for something wrong with

632
00:37:13.281 --> 00:37:16.310
you or needing attention that they're not getting.

633
00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.670
Like a lot of those people are fucking black holes of attention.

634
00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:24.380
You could stuff them full of trash and meteors and everything and they're never

635
00:37:24.381 --> 00:37:26.750
going to fill that fucking hole.
It's impossible.

636
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.780
And so they sit in the audience and the guys on stage,
they'll just,

637
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.840
they don't even know why.
They're just compelled to interrupt.

638
00:37:32.841 --> 00:37:35.330
They're compelled to yell out.
Sure.
Most clubs,

639
00:37:35.331 --> 00:37:37.760
like say if you work at a real nice club,
like,
um,

640
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.780
say like the Improv on Melrose is a very nice comedy club.

641
00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.510
They fucking kicked people out right away.
When you do that,

642
00:37:44.511 --> 00:37:49.310
if you're one of those black holes that just sucks and just you just want

643
00:37:49.311 --> 00:37:51.530
attention,
they'll touch you on the shoulder.
Sir,

644
00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.960
you're going to have to leave the pick you up and then they boot you out.

645
00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.560
<v 2>Let me tell him,
answer this.</v>

646
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.880
Have you ever been totally just like booed off stage?
I mean just like,

647
00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.250
<v 1>Oh yeah,
yeah,
I've bombed.</v>

648
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.530
<v 2>It's,
I know Jim Carrey is still stories that where he literally,</v>

649
00:38:05.531 --> 00:38:07.930
they would not let him continue his show.
Yeah.

650
00:38:07.931 --> 00:38:11.180
We use most likely it's because you suck,
but yeah,
no,

651
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:12.910
you know what he was doing his,
uh,

652
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:17.410
he got away from the whole impression thing and he was just starting to go out

653
00:38:17.411 --> 00:38:19.360
on stage with no material whatsoever.

654
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.590
<v 1>Oh,
you can't do that.
That's,
yeah.
I mean,
you can,
if you're,</v>

655
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:25.710
some people can do that.
We do a show called Thunderpussy.

656
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.830
We do it sometimes at the ice house and the premise of the show is that the

657
00:38:28.831 --> 00:38:32.940
audience will yell out topics and you will riff on it.

658
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.430
I've talked to like Improv.
Yeah,
yeah.
But it's totally stand up.

659
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:38.200
You're doing standup on these subjects,

660
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.890
but you're going out there with no material and I've done two of them.

661
00:38:41.891 --> 00:38:45.790
They're really fun,
but the audience knows what they're getting into.
Right,
right.

662
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.800
If you're going on and you're doing a show,

663
00:38:47.801 --> 00:38:50.380
and I don't think Jim Carey's that kind of comedian anyway,

664
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:53.770
I think Jim Carey's like a big slap sticky.
I think he's a very funny,

665
00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:55.420
like his old standup was really good,

666
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.200
but he's more like big impressions and slap sticky.

667
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:01.750
And for a guy like that to go on stage with no material,

668
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:05.920
he got beat up because of it.
Uh,
it was actually in his bio,
it was a,

669
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.240
and it was someone else talking about the show where he was going out,

670
00:39:10.241 --> 00:39:14.200
he was a cockroach and he's trying to climb under the piano and do with this

671
00:39:14.201 --> 00:39:18.820
crazy,
crazy,
crazy,
you know,
like body contortions stuff,

672
00:39:18.821 --> 00:39:21.430
you know?
Um,
and uh,

673
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.820
just Kinda kinda winging it because that's where I kind of felt comfortable.

674
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:28.360
He didn't want to become like the rich little guy that was just going to go out

675
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:31.050
and do these.
It's supposedly,
he's pretty good at impressions.

676
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:34.210
It's very good at impressions,
you know,
so he didn't want to do that.

677
00:39:34.211 --> 00:39:37.210
So he tried to do something else.
More of an Improv thing.

678
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:39.070
Well that just means it didn't work.
You know what I mean?

679
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:41.380
He probably deserved getting booed.
Look,

680
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:43.950
I know that every time I bombed it was in mosop night.

681
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.900
Every time I bombed it was my fault.
Sure.

682
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.190
I mean there's been terrible audiences and I forget who had that line.

683
00:39:51.191 --> 00:39:53.590
Like it's a,
it's a common line that comedians use.
Like,

684
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:58.660
cause like there's a saying in comedy,
there's no bad audience,
right.

685
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:03.440
That's bullshit.
There's fucking terrible audiences.
But you know,

686
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.430
if you go on stage and that terrible audience and someone else gets them,

687
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:08.380
someone else figures out how to crack the code.

688
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:11.470
I mean it just could be a really crazy Rubik's cube that you don't know how to

689
00:40:11.471 --> 00:40:14.590
crack.
But,
but when you bomb,

690
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:18.100
it's your bombing because he eats your being unsuccessful.
I mean,

691
00:40:18.101 --> 00:40:22.250
it could be a completely unfair environment.
Like it could be a guy like,
uh,

692
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:27.100
to be tree Martin.
It's like a real slow burn,
sort of a dead pan.

693
00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:28.570
Very funny comedian,

694
00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:33.220
but very low energy and he could maybe go on a show where there's a black guy

695
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:38.110
who was singing and doing back flips and fucking lighten his ass on fire.

696
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:39.580
Could be some craziness.

697
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.700
And then you ask a guy to do like real slow paced dead paper afterwards.

698
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:49.810
They don't get it so wrong vibe.
It's like say if great white,
um,

699
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:54.840
had to go on after like say an opera singer in an opera house.

700
00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.920
It's totally wrong.
Opera fans.
Yes,
totally wrong environment.

701
00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:04.660
And it's the difference in standup comedy then in music is like if someone goes

702
00:41:04.661 --> 00:41:07.240
to a rock club,
you're going to see some rock,
you know,

703
00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:10.870
you're going to see a rock.
You don't go and just see live music.

704
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:15.900
And it could be like a country singer followed by a rapper followed by death

705
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:20.500
metal.
You know,
you don't have that.
It's like,
it's very clearly defined,

706
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.760
but comedy is just comedy.
You don't know what you're going to get.
You could,

707
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.690
you go to a comedy club like the,
the store on sunset strip,

708
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.780
you're going to get 15 different comedians and a night.

709
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:34.160
And all of them with different styles.
Well

710
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.140
<v 2>in Europe,
um,</v>

711
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:40.240
we've done shows over there that are such a wide range of people blow your mind.

712
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:46.460
And I mean,
we've played with black Sabbath,
Bob Dylan,

713
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:50.690
this is on the same stage,
same day you imagine.
It's like,

714
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.800
okay,
let's play war pigs and going to,
you know,
stairway to heaven.

715
00:41:56.390 --> 00:42:01.220
It's like Bob Dylan,
black sabbath,
Iggy pop,

716
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:06.690
um,
buddy guy who's a blues guy,
you know,

717
00:42:06.691 --> 00:42:09.610
and just flow straight,
had a blues.
Um,

718
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.740
and people went,
just is nuts for Daylen as they did anybody else.

719
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:20.210
I mean,
so the people there,
they're just there to,
you know,
hear great music,

720
00:42:20.211 --> 00:42:23.240
all different styles and whatever over here.

721
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:27.590
Promoters would never take chances like that.
It has to be scorpions,

722
00:42:27.591 --> 00:42:32.150
Van Hale and you know,
everything in the same kind of John Dre or whatever.

723
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.750
This was in England that you didn't know it was in Denmark,
Denmark.

724
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.690
Do you find that I'm,
I personally find that there's,

725
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:44.260
they're more patient and more polite in a lot of other countries than in

726
00:42:44.961 --> 00:42:46.770
America.
Yeah.
You know,
um,

727
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:51.830
the other thing is I did things there that I wouldn't normally do,
never do here.

728
00:42:51.831 --> 00:42:55.010
Like go out in the crowd and watch bands and stuff.
I go,

729
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.770
it's not like I'm Eddie Van Hill and nobody's going to know me.
You know me.

730
00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:00.620
You know?
So I went out and I'm watching like,
you know,

731
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.320
buddy guy who's influenced Hendrix and all these great,
you know,

732
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.160
and I wasn't really that familiar with him at that time,

733
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:12.400
but he went through this,
like this segment that was about 10 minutes of,
he goes,

734
00:43:12.401 --> 00:43:14.890
yeah,
here's the stuff that Eric Clapton God,

735
00:43:14.891 --> 00:43:19.760
and here's the stuff Hendrix took from me.
And Oh,
so he's asking for,

736
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.840
it was kind of reddit.
He's kind of,
yeah,
he was kind of milking the credit.

737
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:29.360
I wasn't really that impressed by that part,
but it is fact,

738
00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:33.980
and I guess he kind of wants people to know it's fact that because here he is

739
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.720
kind of not really super known.
And Hendrix is,
you know,

740
00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:42.080
God monster.
I,
you know,
one of the greatest ever,

741
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.990
and he was just amazing.

742
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:50.830
But he wants people to know that Hendrick's borrowed from him and because he

743
00:43:51.981 --> 00:43:55.760
hasn't got his accolades that he thinks he's,
yeah,
he's going,
hey man,

744
00:43:55.761 --> 00:43:59.660
if it wasn't for me,
there'd be no,
you can't use that yourself though.
Right.

745
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.050
I don't like it.
That's what I,
you know,
I was just mentioning it,
you know,

746
00:44:03.051 --> 00:44:07.370
I'm not here to go on your show to best buddy guy,
buddy.

747
00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:09.440
Guy's amazing.
I mean,
there's no doubt about it,

748
00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.550
but it probably doesn't have the perspective,
you know,

749
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:18.020
to know that.
You don't need to say that,
man.
Everybody already knows it.
I mean,

750
00:44:18.021 --> 00:44:20.600
every,
I'm not,
I'm not a musician.

751
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:25.250
I know zero about how to play music,
but I'm a big music fan.
No shirt.

752
00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:28.750
Me Too.
Well,
you know,
younger even play though,
Graham,

753
00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.790
I'm a music fan geek man.
When I mean my heroes,

754
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.910
you know,
uh,
five years ago we did a show is easy top and,
and uh,

755
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.290
their tour manager used to be our tour manager and he goes,

756
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.040
you better hook me up with Billy Gibbons.

757
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:43.200
I want to do like one on one and you know,

758
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.090
lots of hang time with this boy and uh,
and uh,
he hooked it up.

759
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:52.850
And the dude with the most soulful,
you know,
here,

760
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.300
here's an example.
Okay.

761
00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:00.270
I don't feel worthy sometimes of of the response,
you know,
like,

762
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:04.380
here's an example.
I go to Japan or band goes to Japan,

763
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.490
we get off the airplane,
it's like 2000 people screaming and I'm calling,
hey,

764
00:45:08.491 --> 00:45:12.960
we're not Mike Tyson.
I mean,
you know,
we're not like van Halen or you know,

765
00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:15.750
we're just this little band.
Um,

766
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.040
but I understand it because I'm,
I'm such a fan myself,
you know,

767
00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:27.150
I'm,
and that's what I was trying to explain to Billy Gibbons.
I go,
you know,

768
00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:32.151
you've got to understand the memories you have created for me or like so

769
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:37.410
incredibly important.
I,

770
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.310
when I hear some of their songs,
I,
I go the apartments,

771
00:45:41.311 --> 00:45:44.070
15 years old plane waiting for the bus,
you know,
I mean,

772
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.760
I have visuals from music.
I literally,

773
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:53.330
a picture comes in my mind from hearing a song and when a guy's dad that has

774
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:58.110
that much influence on me to meet him in person and have them be soulful,

775
00:45:58.111 --> 00:46:01.200
down to earth,
and you know,
he,
he,
uh,

776
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.740
he emailed me that night and I didn't even get home.

777
00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:08.970
I didn't get the email for two more days is like nice meeting Ya.
You know.

778
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.750
And then when Zz top played in palm desert,

779
00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:16.890
that's where I was living at the time.
Uh,
he,
he goes,
hey,

780
00:46:16.891 --> 00:46:21.180
come on down mark,
bring your crew and all this stuff.
Like the guy knows me,

781
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.150
he remembered me.
I,
I'm just like shocked.
But,

782
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:26.820
but I get fans,
you know,

783
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:30.240
sometimes I don't feel worthy of some,

784
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.520
some of the attention and stuff,
you know,
I'm totally grateful,
but,
um,

785
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:40.350
but I,
like I said,
I understand it,
but because I am,
you know,
you're a fan.

786
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:43.170
I'm a total fan because I have my heroes.

787
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.140
I mean the guys that made me want to play guitar.
Do you find it?

788
00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:48.630
That's something that some guys lose,

789
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:53.580
like as they become professionals and then as they become like better and music

790
00:46:53.581 --> 00:46:57.810
and become like a big time music guy that they kind of stopped being a fan of

791
00:46:57.811 --> 00:47:02.130
music that happens with comedy.
I'm,
you know,

792
00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.850
I'm not really,
I can only kind of speak for myself on that.
I,

793
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.650
I'm still friends with like a lot of guitar players that didn't make it,

794
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.720
you know,
I was just one of the lucky ones.

795
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:18.650
I think part of the reason I was lucky is I tried to put myself in a position to

796
00:47:19.621 --> 00:47:23.670
get lucky,
which is by playing more and believe it or not,

797
00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:26.340
it's van Halen that influenced that on me.

798
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.950
They were playing more than everybody.

799
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:31.920
They played three blocks from my house in the backyard.
Now Mani,

800
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.550
I paid $1 to get in,
you know,

801
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:38.551
the singer Roth was blowing a tube inside of this guy's drums and you know,

802
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:42.520
I'm going,
whoa man,
these guys are,
are,
you know,
I was,

803
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.930
I thought they were great and everything.

804
00:47:43.931 --> 00:47:46.510
And they were playing cover songs and they played a couple of originals I think.

805
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:51.511
But what I was more impressed by at least at that time was how often they

806
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:55.330
played.
They played every single night.
And I go,

807
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:58.180
we got to do that if we're going to have any chance,
you know,

808
00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:03.190
because my thinking was if we play more than everybody might have to play free a

809
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:05.560
lot,
but if our name,
you know,

810
00:48:05.561 --> 00:48:08.410
we might be able to brainwash people into thinking they're supposed to like us.

811
00:48:08.411 --> 00:48:12.510
You know what I mean?
So,

812
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.040
and that's what happened though.
It was that persistence.

813
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:18.610
It was that playing free,
um,
getting our name out.
Um,

814
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:22.960
we just happened to be at the whiskey one night,
uh,
playing,
uh,

815
00:48:22.961 --> 00:48:26.080
during the week,
not even a big night or anything.
And,

816
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.520
and the right guy was in the crowd that lie and he came up,
gave us his card.

817
00:48:30.521 --> 00:48:35.410
And before,
you know what,
we're,
we're recording,
we're,
we got air plague.

818
00:48:35.411 --> 00:48:37.210
We don't even have a record deal.
I mean,
we,

819
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:42.480
our record deal was literally borrowing 15 grand from some guy named Fred.

820
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:47.950
Hey Fred,
you got 15 grand?
Yeah.
Okay.
So,
but we had a distribution deal,

821
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:53.260
so,
but this manager,
we had called El Nivon,

822
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.850
he was from England,
he used to work for virgin records.
He had signed Berlin,

823
00:48:57.851 --> 00:49:02.851
he signed motley crew and a year before this and then they would sell these

824
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:05.950
bands off to big labels.

825
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:11.610
Well he got us on Camy t when we had no deal and no local bands were on Camy

826
00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:19.090
team and west with no deal.
It was just unheard of and,
but that,

827
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.450
I don't know what kind of connection to you had did.

828
00:49:21.451 --> 00:49:24.850
So it was just a matter of you being persistent and pushing it all the time.

829
00:49:24.851 --> 00:49:25.684
And these guys saw,

830
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.380
that's such an important lesson for young people who are thinking about doing

831
00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:30.370
something.
Sure.

832
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.300
Opportunity presents itself when you just fucking buster and dreaming and

833
00:49:34.301 --> 00:49:34.790
dreaming.

834
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:39.580
We literally dreamed things and in used to pretend,

835
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:43.990
I mean we pretended standing in the living room like we were playing the forum,

836
00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:47.740
the forum.
Good Nights.
Yeah.

837
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.580
We used to pretend like we were doing interviews,
me and my singer,
we used to go.

838
00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:56.110
So amongst the band been together,
you know,
we guys naked when you're doing this.

839
00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:01.240
We just made up things,
you know,
we weren't naked,
but we were,

840
00:50:01.241 --> 00:50:04.480
uh,
that would make it extra fun.
You're kidding.
Yeah.

841
00:50:04.481 --> 00:50:08.950
That could have been kind of cool.
But,
uh,
you know,
it's,
it's that pretending,

842
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.900
but when it becomes a reality,
you know,

843
00:50:10.901 --> 00:50:15.901
like I'm six years before I was on the form stage in Los Angeles,

844
00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:21.310
I was watching Ted Nugent swinging through this,
this arena.

845
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:26.720
And it wasn't even a possibility that I would ever be on that stage playing.

846
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.080
Was he on a buffalo or something when he was swinging on swings?

847
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:34.580
I forget where he swing,
like out of the crowd on this big rope,

848
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.473
you know,

849
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:40.200
wearing like leaves and do you know him?
He,

850
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.070
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I don't want to meet that dude.
Ted Nugent is in attendance.

851
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.520
You should have him on your show.
I would love to.
He passed though.

852
00:50:46.521 --> 00:50:50.120
I think he thinks I'm a liberal.
Oh.
Cause I smuggled out of pot.

853
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:55.040
I think he probably thinks some,
uh,
and I'm anti war,
but I hunt.
I,

854
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:59.030
and I also,
I'm into archery.
Yeah.
And there's a lot of things that we agree on.

855
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:02.540
He's,
he's,
I think he's a fascinating character.
He's a deep dude.
And,

856
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.840
and you know,
when he'd go that far,
we,
I just mean he's,
he's kind of a,

857
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:11.300
I mean he is it a lot of ways.
I'm not saying that he's not,

858
00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:14.300
he is a lot of opinions.
Let's just put it that way.
Well,

859
00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:17.360
they're well thought out.
I don't know if I'd necessarily agree with all of them.

860
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:20.090
They're very well thought out on his side.
He's a,

861
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:25.220
he's got a lot of really intense ideas when it comes to hunting and conservation

862
00:51:25.221 --> 00:51:28.700
and preserving the wild.
He knows a lot about that,
that's for sure.

863
00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:32.590
I just think that,
I think he thinks if I had him on that I would attack him.

864
00:51:32.591 --> 00:51:35.030
What I would do would be the complete opposite of that.
Honestly,

865
00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:38.780
I'm a strangle hold one of my all time favorite songs.
It's one of my all time.

866
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:42.620
Like if I'm driving around in my car and I need some,
uh,
good jam,

867
00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.820
I'll throw on stranglehold just out of nowhere.
And just always picks me up.

868
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:50.240
We'll check this out.
Five years ago we did a show with,

869
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:54.470
with the Ted in Canada,
in London,
Ontario.

870
00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.820
And I stuck around to watch his show because I knew one of the crew guys,

871
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.770
I used to work for us and,
and he took me around the stage during the day.

872
00:52:03.771 --> 00:52:06.950
He goes,
you're not going to believe this.
All these cabinets,

873
00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:10.460
all these guitar cabinets on this stage are all live.

874
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:15.320
Like Ted is coming out of these speakers everywhere.
It's like,

875
00:52:15.321 --> 00:52:19.760
it's not normal,
like the amount of guitar,
I mean these ego,
so,

876
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:24.420
so huge,
you know.
But I loved that.
And anyway,

877
00:52:24.421 --> 00:52:27.080
so what does that mean?
What do you mean by that?
I'm not sure what you're saying.

878
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.550
Usually like,
you know,
you,
you have,
you're like,

879
00:52:31.551 --> 00:52:34.700
I have two cabinets working.
I might have 16 cabinets up there,

880
00:52:34.701 --> 00:52:39.701
but on the cabinets are these stacks of speakers and usually a two,

881
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:45.040
you put two and stereo and it's plenty.
How many are on stage total?
Um,

882
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.580
like a bypass up to like 16 cabinets before.

883
00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:52.850
So there's 16 cabinets on stage for the whole band.
No,
just for me.
No,

884
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:57.350
for you sometimes.
I mean,
we played a show the other day.
I had an eight,

885
00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.230
you know what I mean?
It depends on how big the stage,
but you're not used,

886
00:53:00.231 --> 00:53:01.160
they're not all alive.

887
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:06.590
Well Ted has everywhere he goes on the stage,

888
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:09.680
ted,
it will be there coming out of speakers.

889
00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:16.040
So it said
it's,
she has ted Mann,

890
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:19.430
he,
you know,
he wants to be loud and it,
you know,

891
00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:24.620
but it's not really normal to have working cabinets all over the stage,
you know,

892
00:53:24.621 --> 00:53:28.440
you monitors and stuff like that.
But um,

893
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.190
what I was going to get to that I,
it gave me chills almost.
Um,

894
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.390
because I'm like,
you,
I used a stranglehold and you know,

895
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:40.440
fucking being a teenager and when that album came out and everything,
um,

896
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:41.371
but the whole,

897
00:53:41.371 --> 00:53:44.100
Dan went back to the hotel and I'm on the side of the stage and he goes,

898
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:47.910
he's going,
how about that?
Gray,
white,
how about that?
Gray wide.
He's going,

899
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:50.430
could you feel that rock and roll spirit?
He goes,

900
00:53:50.431 --> 00:53:53.490
they got that rock and rose period.
Yeah.
And he goes,

901
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:57.360
and I can feel that we're not going real spirit in the head and not here.
Yeah.

902
00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:00.510
And he literally introduced the song that way.

903
00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:04.470
He's saying that how we had the rock and roll spirit and he goes and you know,

904
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:09.020
and,
and he went into wing Dang sweet pin Tanny was like Bang Gang,

905
00:54:09.021 --> 00:54:13.170
a gang barbecue Dannon and,
and then,
yeah.

906
00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:18.000
And he did say that he did that for way longer than the album.
You know,
Dan,
get,

907
00:54:18.001 --> 00:54:21.060
get,
get,
get,
get,
get a gang,
gang,
gang,
gang gang.
It was just great man.

908
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.150
That dude is so intense lot.

909
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:28.330
<v 1>Yeah.
He's,
he's definitely a trip.
I saw him do the national anthem,
uh,</v>

910
00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:32.670
at a football game.
Uh,
it was on television because was fucking incredible.

911
00:54:32.671 --> 00:54:35.670
I mean,
it was all just guitar,
a guitar version of the national anthem,

912
00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:40.440
but people fucking sleep on how good he is at the guitar need to watch that.

913
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:45.150
Oh,
I mean,
it's a really amazing version of the national anthem.

914
00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:48.210
I mean,
just fucking incredible.
And the,

915
00:54:48.211 --> 00:54:50.910
it just is artistry to it.
You know

916
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:55.220
<v 2>you're talking about is hunting.
When he first hooked up with Jack Blades,</v>

917
00:54:55.221 --> 00:54:57.200
who's a friend of ours because he produced,

918
00:54:57.201 --> 00:54:59.150
he's the Bass player for night ranger,

919
00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:03.530
writes a lot of songs for Aerosmith and Motley Crue and he's done a lot.

920
00:55:03.531 --> 00:55:07.880
He's a big songwriter.
Anyway,
so he made this band called Damn Yankees,

921
00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:12.440
which he had Ted Nugent playing guitar and when Ted Nugent came out to his ranch

922
00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:15.380
and uh,
Santa Santa Rosa,

923
00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:20.450
within 20 minutes he had a,
he was boiling a squirrel in a pot.

924
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:22.940
Then he shot on his property.

925
00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:29.830
I mean,
you know,
he's already out shooting and stuff.
I mean,

926
00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:34.540
it was just crazy squirrel.
Yeah.
I don't know about that.
That happens at ferment

927
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:38.040
<v 1>for comes off or uh,
yeah.
Yeah.
You got to skin in.
I've had squirrel.</v>

928
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:41.610
I had squirrel recently.
My friend Steve Rinella cooked a squirrel that he shot.

929
00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:44.250
It doesn't taste like anything else.

930
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:49.170
It doesn't taste like chicken or like all Gamey or anything.
It wasn't gaming.
Oh,

931
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:51.000
it didn't taste bad.
I mean,
it tasted good.
I mean,

932
00:55:51.001 --> 00:55:54.990
he knows my friend Steve Rinella is the host of this show called meat eater.

933
00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:59.190
He's a professional hunter and an author and he knows how to cook game.

934
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.760
<v 2>What do you get?
A lot of really cool guests on your show,</v>

935
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.420
different walks of life.
That's really cool that you can handle all that.

936
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:12.540
That you're,
you're well versed in different subjects and stuff like fitness and

937
00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.880
<v 1>well,
I'm very fortunate that I can talk to all these different peoples.</v>

938
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:21.890
It would be incredibly rare to be able to sit down and just have long term in a

939
00:56:22.101 --> 00:56:24.010
long form conversations,
two,
three hour

940
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:27.190
<v 3>conversations with a bunch of random people like that,
you know,</v>

941
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.610
whether it's Steve Rinell or I've had David Lee Roth on or all these different

942
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:35.100
characters and musicians and artists and you know,

943
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:39.910
pretty cool man actors and strength and conditioning coaches.
And it's just,

944
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:43.760
it's interesting to have a bunch of different people,
by the way,

945
00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:48.460
tell you something.
I wrote a Joe Rogan Song.
No Way.

946
00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.260
I read a little blues,
uh,
uh,
Joe Rogan Song.
I hear it,

947
00:56:53.261 --> 00:56:57.310
but I leave the room back.
Jill seems weird.
If you play in them in the room.

948
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:02.110
I can handle it though.
Now you can play I please.
I'm honored.
I'm just kidding.

949
00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:06.870
Yeah.
You want to play it now?
No,
I just,
whatever.
I don't care.
Oh,

950
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.790
if you have it now,
he can play it now.
But now that you brought it up,

951
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:14.300
it seems like the best time to do it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't,
don't chicken.
Look.

952
00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:16.390
Come on man.
Play the song about me,
Dude.

953
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:22.150
Don't be announced in something and then say,
well,
I'm not going to play it.
Well,

954
00:57:22.151 --> 00:57:24.970
I'm excited that you brought the guitar because I wasn't sure if you were going

955
00:57:24.971 --> 00:57:25.804
to

956
00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:33.240
<v 0>Josie pissing match</v>

957
00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:36.520
from his head down.

958
00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:45.890
I'm down
in Mexico.

959
00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.760
Yes.
Shower,
pull the Ras.

960
00:57:50.761 --> 00:57:55.400
You leave a little smile on your face.

961
00:57:57.810 --> 00:58:02.550
His timing is impeccable and a time Mick.

962
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:12.190
And that's a guarantee.

963
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:26.460
Where are you going man,

964
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:33.833
with that

965
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.210
little gun in your hand?

966
00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:47.360
I've been charged to get ahold of you for days.

967
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:55.163
You

968
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.830
know Joe's a pleasing man

969
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:05.160
in this busy,
busy land.

970
00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:18.390
<v 3>I am very honored.
Yeah,
but the worst song I've ever heard in my life.
Sorry.</v>

971
00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.740
Okay,
I'll play the faster your mind.
Hey Joe,

972
00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:30.690
<v 2>sorry.
No,
please.
That's awesome.
I'm just getting,
look,</v>

973
00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:34.320
I had to make fun of it.
I don't give him a haters,
any energy anyway.
It's just

974
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:40.430
when you sit down and write music,
do you have like,
um,

975
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:42.880
an idea in your head when you sit down and brighter,

976
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:46.880
you just start to draw ramen and like how does it know?
I have ideas.

977
00:59:46.881 --> 00:59:49.610
I'm actually,
you know,

978
00:59:49.611 --> 00:59:53.420
the past few years when I get a riff in my head,

979
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:55.280
usually when I'm in writing mode,

980
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:57.440
like we're going to do a record soon or something.

981
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:02.570
I used to not really be able to get that close to what was in there.

982
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:07.970
I've been able to kind of get closer knit these days and one thing that I've

983
01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:12.971
learned over the years and that is when you have this energy and this thought

984
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:17.420
and this,
this musical idea,
whatever it is,

985
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.450
make sure when you're vibrating at that,

986
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.750
wherever you're at at that moment to record it.

987
01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:28.070
Because if you don't do it the following day,

988
01:00:28.071 --> 01:00:32.870
you might not forget the riff,
but it won't have the same energy.

989
01:00:32.871 --> 01:00:35.150
That delivery will be way different.

990
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:39.590
It might not be the same rhythmical thing.
So it's best just to,

991
01:00:39.591 --> 01:00:43.070
don't be lazy.
If you have this huge idea like at midnight or something,

992
01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:47.840
just grab your phone or grab something and put it on tape so you don't lose it.

993
01:00:47.841 --> 01:00:49.590
You know?
Cause I'd lost a lot.
That's,

994
01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:54.200
so that's very analogous to comedy and stand up comedy.

995
01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:55.034
It's the same thing.

996
01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:58.340
So I'm sure as you have these ideas and you just have to jump on them.

997
01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:01.070
Like if I have an idea,
sometimes it'd be lying in bed.
I'm like,
Oh,

998
01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:03.910
I'm not going to forget that when I go back to sleep.
Yeah.
I don't know.

999
01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:07.370
Wake up in the morning.
Fuck.
What was that?
I learned that the hard way.

1000
01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.380
I don't know if you've ever watched or heard a Rodney Dangerfield story.

1001
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.320
Do you know what,
is it?
Historic story?
The way his career and stuff?
Well,

1002
01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.310
I know of his career.
I mean,
is it the,

1003
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.600
is it like an actual documentary called Ronnie Edge?

1004
01:01:21.601 --> 01:01:24.600
You feel stories that we were saying?
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's called Rodney danger.

1005
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:31.160
I'm not really sure what it was.
It was one of these a and e biography.

1006
01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.050
Okay.
Kind of Dubai,
but,
but he's just an amazing story because he,
uh,

1007
01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:42.020
he was a comedian and then he pretty much retired when he was 29 and his wife

1008
01:01:42.021 --> 01:01:44.450
was a singer,
so they decided to retire together,

1009
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:49.340
just get out of this stupid music stuff,
you know,
or whatever,
and comedy stuff.

1010
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.520
So he left the business,
but he never quit writing jokes.
He hated this.

1011
01:01:53.521 --> 01:01:55.940
It's straight Gig,
you know,
of beating us,

1012
01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.640
being a siding salesman or whatever,
you know,
uh,

1013
01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:03.580
doing siding for people's homes or whatever.
And,
but he,

1014
01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:08.150
so he never quit writing jokes.
So he literally writes jokes for like 11 years.

1015
01:02:08.151 --> 01:02:11.720
He just has a duffle bag full,
right.
Comes back.

1016
01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:16.970
But when he came back,
they,
they had like bill Cosby,
you know,

1017
01:02:16.971 --> 01:02:21.320
they had,
you know,
this dude was he himself?
Jack Roy,
and,
and,

1018
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:26.160
and they had bill Cosby coming up.
George Carlin,
you know,
um,
you know,

1019
01:02:26.161 --> 01:02:30.240
just,
uh,
you know,
they had Lenny,
Bruce [inaudible] had all these,
these killers,

1020
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.440
and they're going,
Jack,
I mean,
you know,
your material is a little better,

1021
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:39.300
but you're used commodity,
you know,
you're,
you
look,

1022
01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:44.220
we got all these guys now,
you know,
so he goes to this club and he goes,

1023
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:47.220
okay,
I won't be Jack Roy.
He goes,
just pick any name,

1024
01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:50.490
just make something up and let's all this,
go with that.

1025
01:02:50.491 --> 01:02:51.810
I'll be in this other guy.

1026
01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:55.470
So the guy comes up with Rodney Dangerfield for his name,
right.

1027
01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:01.020
So he does this show and kills.
He just destroys the crowd.

1028
01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:02.850
I mean,
they,
they're just,
you know,

1029
01:03:02.851 --> 01:03:07.700
socks and shoes and bodies piled against the back window and,
and,

1030
01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:12.540
you know,
so he goes to this,
maybe this is the name for me,
you know,

1031
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.920
and,
uh,
but,
but it,
it literally,
when he started out,

1032
01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:22.650
he didn't really know what he was doing.
You know,
he,
he had,
uh,
you know,

1033
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.810
doll are,
you know,
um,

1034
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:30.000
just all kinds of different wigs.
He did puppets.
He,
you know,

1035
01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:31.770
he didn't really have any direction.

1036
01:03:31.771 --> 01:03:36.060
He was just doing all kinds of different stuff when he became the one liner

1037
01:03:36.061 --> 01:03:40.170
master.
You know,
like literally all these jokes are constructed perfect.

1038
01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:43.830
He doesn't go one word off.
I mean,
but he does have to write this stuff,

1039
01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:49.200
but it's just an amazing story that the guy makes this huge comeback at 40 and

1040
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:53.540
literally has this monster career and movies and you know,

1041
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:56.550
it's supposedly the story goes when he,

1042
01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.790
when he was asked to do Caddyshack,

1043
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:04.920
they said action and he didn't even know what the action meant.

1044
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:07.500
Like he was so good.
Action.

1045
01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:12.550
<v 1>Oh,
you want me to do the pit?
You want what?
You want me to do the bit?
Wow.
Yeah.</v>

1046
01:04:12.551 --> 01:04:16.380
Rodney do the bit,
you know.
Wow.
Action.
Matt,

1047
01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:20.980
you didn't know an action man.
Well,
Rodney is a really interesting example of,

1048
01:04:20.981 --> 01:04:22.060
of show business.

1049
01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:27.440
I was working at a place called Great Woods is in Mansfield,

1050
01:04:27.491 --> 01:04:31.300
Massachusetts.
It's a center for the performing arts like concert place.
Right.

1051
01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:35.620
And I know,
did you ever,
do you guys sure.
When did you perform?

1052
01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:40.150
They went years shoot.
Oh,
did you perform there in the 80s several times.
Yeah,

1053
01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.220
I bet you guys performing.
And when I worked there,
that could be,
I guaranteed.

1054
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:48.250
<v 2>Yeah,
we did a lot of shit.
We played in 1984 we aren't two words.
Judas priest,</v>

1055
01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.170
I'm pretty sure that hit there.
Yup.

1056
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.960
<v 1>And I was working there in 84 84 it was called.
I wasn't actually,</v>

1057
01:04:54.961 --> 01:04:57.210
because that was before I graduated high school.

1058
01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:02.480
I graduated high school in 85 so I don't think I worked at great woods now that

1059
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:07.480
I think about it until 86 or 87 my,
my keyboard player Michael Lardy.

1060
01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:07.640
Yeah.
He

1061
01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:12.180
<v 2>is a like,
he's like an Almanac.
Like he could tell you the weather,</v>

1062
01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:16.080
the time,
what day we played there,
the dates.
Uh,

1063
01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.740
I can't really,
you know,

1064
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:21.970
<v 1>but um,
so I can't really tell you when it was.
Point is I was,</v>

1065
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.430
I was there backstage and Rodney Dangerfield,
uh,

1066
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.960
was getting ready and he,
all he had on was a bathrobe,

1067
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:30.610
bathrobe and slippers.

1068
01:05:30.611 --> 01:05:33.730
He got to a certain point in his career where he liked to go on stage with a

1069
01:05:33.731 --> 01:05:38.530
bathrobe on you was like,
gave zero fucks.

1070
01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:40.780
He was like in his sixties,
I think at the time.

1071
01:05:40.781 --> 01:05:43.720
I'm not sure how old he was then somewhere around sixties.

1072
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:48.970
But he was just so relaxed and so loose that he felt most comfortable on stage

1073
01:05:48.971 --> 01:05:52.660
with a bathrobe on and no underwear.
He just got like,
they would all laugh,

1074
01:05:52.661 --> 01:05:55.510
like the guys would laugh,
like his fucking balls.
It'd be hanging out of his,
uh,

1075
01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:58.120
out of his,
his bathrobe,

1076
01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:01.900
and he'd just be hanging out backstage or whatever.
Help yourself,

1077
01:06:01.901 --> 01:06:04.550
you want a sandwich come on.
And Kid,
you know,
like,
yeah,

1078
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.070
super friendly and relaxed.

1079
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.600
<v 2>He's a friendly man and a sweet man,
but he really felt that,</v>

1080
01:06:10.601 --> 01:06:14.380
they say he was a really tortured soul from,
from like his childhood.

1081
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:18.100
Like his parents hated him and his mother and you know,

1082
01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:22.330
didn't show them any love and all this stuff.
You make a comedian.
Yeah.
And,

1083
01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:26.020
and what they said was,
is he was trying,

1084
01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.490
he was just fighting against this childhood with his materials.

1085
01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:35.100
He's told people,
all's I have is my act.
You know what I mean?
Like,
wow.

1086
01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:39.970
He just felt he was so wrong in his life that [inaudible] that's where he came.

1087
01:06:39.971 --> 01:06:43.210
All his material comes from that being wrong,
you know,

1088
01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.010
you no respect,

1089
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:49.750
no respect there actually that no respect line didn't quite come at first he was

1090
01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:52.420
saying,
you know,
with me and nothing goes right,

1091
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:58.980
but it was always jokes about how,
you know,
how wrong he was and,

1092
01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:01.960
and that's all this material stemmed from that.

1093
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:07.240
It's actually a brilliant story because it's such a fighting heart story.

1094
01:07:07.241 --> 01:07:11.980
It's,
he,
he had to grind so hard,
harder than you know.

1095
01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:16.620
Then you hear normally,
um,
you know,
even when he got an Ed Solo,

1096
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:21.010
he auditioned for Ed Sullivan.
Ed Sullivan didn't call him for like weeks.

1097
01:07:21.011 --> 01:07:25.110
It just tortured him.
It was like,
am I going to have a life or no,
you know,

1098
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:29.460
it's like if he calls I will.
If he doesn't,
I won't.
That's how it,

1099
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:32.740
that's how crucial it was because he had already kind of burned out in the clubs

1100
01:07:32.741 --> 01:07:35.690
he needed to get here.
And,

1101
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.360
and even all the Comedians were that were interviewed saying,

1102
01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:43.090
if you didn't do Sullivan,
you just say you ain't happening.
You know what I mean?

1103
01:07:43.091 --> 01:07:47.350
Like you literally needed that show to make your name,
to get your name out.

1104
01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:51.930
And then it became Carson and Letterman later.
Now Carson was another problem.
Um,

1105
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.250
he made a mistake.
Um,

1106
01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.600
someone on the staff of Carson stoled some of his material after seeing him,

1107
01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:03.940
like at an Improv kind of place.
Well,

1108
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:09.130
Rodney wrote a letter to Carson and saying,
hey,
you got a thief on your staff.

1109
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.040
He was blackballed.
That was it.

1110
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:15.650
The real arson was so pissed off that he literally black,

1111
01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:18.120
but he didn't want Rodney on the show.
Well,

1112
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:23.320
time elapsed and I guess the producer of the show and Johnny Carson and,

1113
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:28.010
uh,
went to some club or something and they couldn't get in.
We're going to leave.

1114
01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:30.820
And Rodney Dangerfield was there and he goes,
I got you guys a seat.

1115
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:35.810
And they came in and he,
and he apologized to Johnny Carson.
He said,
I'm sorry,

1116
01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:39.560
you know,
I was wrong or whatever.
And,
um,

1117
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:45.350
and so he had him on the show and he destroyed,
he,
he destroyed Johnny Carson.

1118
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:48.230
Johnny Carson was just in stitches,
laughing,

1119
01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:51.690
everything this guy said he was brilliant.
Yeah.
He,

1120
01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.050
he was one of the greats in my,
in my opinion,

1121
01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:57.370
one of the all time greats and a really unique sort of a way his,

1122
01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.480
his style very unique and great and movies too,
like back to school.
Yeah.

1123
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.010
I mean he was amazing man.
And you know,

1124
01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:08.000
he actually wrote the idea for that movie,
uh,
back to school.

1125
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:12.890
But his idea was going back to school,
broke it like a total loser.

1126
01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:18.380
And Harold Ramis said,
you know,
my dream was always to go back to school,

1127
01:09:18.381 --> 01:09:23.180
rich as hell,
have all the money I have now go back like,
hey moe,
fuck,

1128
01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:25.670
you know,
I'm,
it's cool.
Where's the chicks and stuff?

1129
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.380
And so he gave him that idea and then they incorporated the two ideas and you

1130
01:09:30.381 --> 01:09:33.740
know,
back to school,
it was brilliant obviously once he was rich guy.

1131
01:09:34.150 --> 01:09:37.340
It's a great fucking world.
And then how about easy money?
Oh,

1132
01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:41.370
that was a great movie.
It was a really good,
I love kids,
smoke or drink it,

1133
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:44.600
you know,
put a million.
And when,

1134
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:48.610
remember when Kennison played the teacher and back to school.
Yeah,
yeah.

1135
01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:54.770
Oh that was fuck Kennison uh,
he,
he was an amazing did,

1136
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:59.860
he was very big music fan himself.
He really liked to,

1137
01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:03.680
um,
in fact,
our producer of our very first album was Michael Wagner.

1138
01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:08.540
He did wild thing.
They had the video and everything.
Yeah,

1139
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.630
he actually recorded that and uh,
yeah,

1140
01:10:11.631 --> 01:10:16.040
so he was around musicians like those Tennyson is,
he's,
in my opinion,

1141
01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:18.770
he was the greatest of all time for like two years.

1142
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:23.630
But he's a great lesson to forget medians too,
because he,
he went from,

1143
01:10:23.631 --> 01:10:26.060
in my opinion,
being one of the greatest of all time to,

1144
01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:29.990
towards the end of his career.
He was terrible.
He just,
yeah,
it just became,

1145
01:10:29.991 --> 01:10:31.340
do you think,
um,

1146
01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:36.220
do you think that drugs play in that?
I do.

1147
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:40.820
200%.
I think coke.
That's why I think that,
um,
you know,

1148
01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:41.654
the,

1149
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:46.930
that's a perfect metaphor or whatever for wasted talent because if somebody is

1150
01:10:47.841 --> 01:10:52.220
really strong and kicking ass,
I don't think it's a coincidence.

1151
01:10:52.221 --> 01:10:55.520
And the guys doing a lot of blow now in his show is kind of going downhill.

1152
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:59.450
You know what I mean?
I,
you got to put those two together.
Oh,
100%.

1153
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.390
I'm playing the most consistent I've ever played,
especially,
you know,

1154
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:07.550
since I've been sober for,
you know,
going on six years.
But

1155
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.600
you know,
you feel similar from day to day.

1156
01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:16.320
You're not waking up in pain and having to fight to be normal and all that.

1157
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.560
You're not going to do what you do at your,

1158
01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:22.830
you're not going to be at your best when you're doing this stuff to your body.

1159
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:24.210
You're not treating yourself well.

1160
01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:29.040
I play more consistent now than I've ever played in my life from show to show,

1161
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.610
I believe.
I mean,
and,
and I really pump myself up.

1162
01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:36.630
I don't go out to just entertain people.
I want their jaws dropped.

1163
01:11:36.631 --> 01:11:40.110
I want to impress the crap out of him.
You know,
and um,

1164
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:43.230
because I think that if you're,

1165
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:49.070
if you put that much effort into a show going for the pulverize level and you,

1166
01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:57.200
and you maybe have an off night in new,
only entertain him,
not else lost,

1167
01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:58.110
you know what I mean?
Right.

1168
01:11:58.111 --> 01:12:01.140
If you just want to go out there and just entertain people in,
play your songs,

1169
01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.590
you know,
let's rock look,
come on,
let's rock.
You know,

1170
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:06.480
I just doesn't get it from me.

1171
01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:11.610
One of the problems I have is the 22 hours in between,

1172
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.930
you know,
the show,
I mean,
you're waiting,

1173
01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:19.620
you're traveling and you're doing all this stuff just for this two hours.

1174
01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.190
It's like,
I want to get the maximum amount of that two hours,
you know?

1175
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:27.420
I don't want all this traveling to be a waste.
Like I've heard it said that they,

1176
01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.970
they pay me to travel,
but I played for free.

1177
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:36.900
That's a good way.
It's the hardest thing about like if you talk to any boxers,

1178
01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:41.310
they say the easiest thing about the boxing is the fight,
right?
It's like this,

1179
01:12:41.311 --> 01:12:44.160
the training and getting up at four in the morning and you know,

1180
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.270
drinking rye eggs or whatever else.
She,
you guys to do that anymore.

1181
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.920
And that drinking raw egg.
Yeah.
That's just in that movie.
But yeah,
I get that.

1182
01:12:52.921 --> 01:12:54.000
But you know what I'm saying,

1183
01:12:54.001 --> 01:12:57.870
is the preparations the most difficult aspect of reparation to everything?

1184
01:12:57.910 --> 01:13:02.190
It's even in pool.
I think.
Um,
you know,

1185
01:13:02.191 --> 01:13:04.140
Shane van boning,
there's a reason he's number one.

1186
01:13:04.141 --> 01:13:06.660
I think he practices more than everyone.
Oh,

1187
01:13:06.661 --> 01:13:11.290
he practices eight out everything at the break and you know,
shot making.

1188
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.473
Well I was,

1189
01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:16.750
<v 1>I was there for,
I've been there for a couple of his matches live.
Um,</v>

1190
01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:17.830
but one of them,
uh,

1191
01:13:17.831 --> 01:13:22.270
where he played Earl Strickland and after the match we all went to the pool hall

1192
01:13:22.271 --> 01:13:26.830
and chain played by himself for hours.
I mean hours and hours and hours,

1193
01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:31.570
just pocketing ball,
setting up shots,
pocketing balls and just kept doing it,

1194
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:34.000
kept doing it over.
And then after he got done doing that,

1195
01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.720
then he played three cushioned billiards by himself.
I mean he just,

1196
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:42.100
he's just a machine and that's how you become successful.
Yeah.
Your attitude,

1197
01:13:42.101 --> 01:13:44.020
like that attitude about performing,
it's just,

1198
01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.850
it's so important and it's so important because that attitude of gratitude,

1199
01:13:48.851 --> 01:13:52.960
of respecting what you're doing and loving what you're doing and really being

1200
01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:56.590
enthusiastic about the performance,
wanting people to have a great time.

1201
01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.230
<v 2>It's not ego,
it's not about your ego.
I don't really believe that.</v>

1202
01:14:01.231 --> 01:14:05.490
I just want to give people their money's worth and giving my all like really

1203
01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:09.300
feeling like I gave them everything I had available.

1204
01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:14.200
It makes you feel like you got some self worth,
you know,
and,
and uh,

1205
01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:18.530
and plus you get people going,
Whoa,
did you see that?
You know,

1206
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:20.950
and man,
I want to give them their money's worth.

1207
01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:25.540
<v 1>Fuck.
Yeah.
Well you're the only guy that can provide the mark Kendall experience.</v>

1208
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:28.450
You are mark Hindle.
If they want to go see you,

1209
01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:29.890
you're the only guy that can do it.

1210
01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:34.570
Like I said that to my friend Ari wants and it's stuck with me after I said it.

1211
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.680
I'm like,
wow,
it's so true.

1212
01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:39.820
We were talking about comedy and performing and he was just starting to build a

1213
01:14:39.821 --> 01:14:42.160
following.
And I said,
dude,
I go,

1214
01:14:42.161 --> 01:14:45.100
if you're an Ari Shaffir fan and I'm an Ira Irish beer fan,

1215
01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:48.850
you're the only guy that can provide Ari Shaffir.

1216
01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.390
Like there's another guy might be able to steal your jokes and other guy might

1217
01:14:52.391 --> 01:14:54.250
be able to try to mimic your delivery.

1218
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.880
But if I want to go see this crazy motherfucker named Ari Shaffir,

1219
01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.010
you're the only guy that can give that to people.

1220
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.250
You're the only one out there that's already should fear.
And he was like,
wow,

1221
01:15:03.251 --> 01:15:06.000
that's,
that's totally true.
It's totally true.
Like your,

1222
01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:10.990
it's your responsibility as the keeper of the Ari Shaffir Act to the Ari Shaffir

1223
01:15:10.991 --> 01:15:13.510
material.
And,
and you know,
and,
and you as a human,

1224
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.670
you got to go out there and you're the only one that can do it.

1225
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:18.520
And people out there are fans and they want to go see it.

1226
01:15:18.521 --> 01:15:20.290
And you're the only one that can provide that.

1227
01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:24.340
And you gotta kind of an already does.
But there's some comedians who don't like,

1228
01:15:24.341 --> 01:15:28.720
I've seen comedians go on stage and just completely phoned it in and half acid

1229
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.980
trying out new material because they didn't care if the audience got a good show

1230
01:15:32.981 --> 01:15:35.240
because the audience should just be happy that they're there.

1231
01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.690
<v 2>Well,
I can feel that with just about any entertaining,
you know,
uh,</v>

1232
01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.310
whether it be a comedian,
a band,

1233
01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:46.000
I can tell when someone has to go through the motions and I know that fans can

1234
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:48.040
read that too.
I never,

1235
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:53.330
the way that we've as a band have eliminated going through the motions is

1236
01:15:54.311 --> 01:15:59.020
allowing ourselves the freedom to make new music.

1237
01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.550
If it wasn't for,

1238
01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:03.730
if I was just some old these band and we would have probably been over 20 years

1239
01:16:03.731 --> 01:16:06.730
ago because I'm not going to go out and just play once bitten twice shy once a

1240
01:16:06.731 --> 01:16:09.550
year.
I mean I need to be creative.

1241
01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:13.810
That's why it got in to play a guitar is because wow,
you can make up stuff,

1242
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:18.120
you know,
and I want to continue to break makeup stuff,
you know,
and that,

1243
01:16:18.121 --> 01:16:20.350
that's what keeps me going.
Also,

1244
01:16:20.351 --> 01:16:23.680
we do a lot of stretch out jams and stuff that are different from nine to nine.

1245
01:16:23.681 --> 01:16:26.690
So I don't know what's going to happen before it does,
you know.

1246
01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:31.900
So that's the way I eliminate going through the motions.
But um,
you know,
I,

1247
01:16:31.901 --> 01:16:36.010
I think,
uh,
that's even for a comedian,
it's writing new jokes,

1248
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:39.670
trying out new things.
Um,
we keep it fresh for you.

1249
01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.560
<v 1>No doubt.
No doubt.</v>

1250
01:16:41.561 --> 01:16:45.840
And I think that's an important point that I wanted to ask you about.
Um,
with,

1251
01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.370
when it comes to music with some bands,

1252
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.960
they reach a certain point and then all anybody wants to hear is their old

1253
01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:57.470
stuff.
Yeah.
They don't want to hear new music.
Like there's certain bands will,

1254
01:16:57.471 --> 01:17:00.670
they'll go and some of them,
y'all do this,
do that.
And then they're like,
oh,

1255
01:17:00.671 --> 01:17:03.790
we've got a new song.
And people are like,
oh,
I get a new song.

1256
01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.360
<v 2>I don't know if they're going to go up,
but that could be,
but,
um,</v>

1257
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:12.350
one thing we don't do that is bombard people with new music.

1258
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:16.520
We're not going to go out there and play like 10 new songs or anything.

1259
01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:19.010
But why not?
Why do give them all of what they want?

1260
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:22.660
Unless we are just going on a tour to play our new album.
I mean that,

1261
01:17:22.661 --> 01:17:23.600
that's one thing.

1262
01:17:23.601 --> 01:17:27.770
Or maybe just play a few shows like that we're just going to play the elation

1263
01:17:27.771 --> 01:17:28.940
record were,
you know,

1264
01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:34.290
<v 3>or whatever.
Um,
but is that sort of a,
a thing that happens to rock bands?</v>

1265
01:17:34.291 --> 01:17:37.020
They get kind of trapped by their past success?

1266
01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:39.430
That I don't know.

1267
01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:44.250
<v 2>Trap.
No,
but,
um,
you know,
I,</v>

1268
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:49.020
I take it as a total blessing that we have those songs and when we play these

1269
01:17:49.021 --> 01:17:50.610
songs,
I still like playing them.

1270
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:53.180
We're playing for a different audience every night.
Well,

1271
01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:56.490
it's not like we're standing over there playing the song for the same guy over

1272
01:17:56.491 --> 01:18:00.320
and over and over.
They would probably get old,
but we got different,
you know,

1273
01:18:00.330 --> 01:18:04.920
different response.
Um,
it's a different feel that night.
You know,

1274
01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:07.950
we stretch it out,
we bring the crowd into the show.
I mean,

1275
01:18:07.951 --> 01:18:12.930
we do different things,
you know,
but,
um,
I don't mind when I hear a sound,

1276
01:18:12.931 --> 01:18:16.140
the radio,
even today,
I get tingles.
See you know,

1277
01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.920
so I'm going out and playing the stuff that people want to hear.

1278
01:18:19.921 --> 01:18:24.780
It isn't a problem with me.
It's just I don't want to just only do that.

1279
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.790
I want,
I want to incorporate new new things and,

1280
01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:30.120
and a lot of the people like some of our new stuff too.

1281
01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:32.660
<v 3>What,
what is it though about it?</v>

1282
01:18:32.661 --> 01:18:35.480
What I was going to get to is because it's so completely different than a

1283
01:18:35.481 --> 01:18:38.300
comedian.
Comedians have to have new material all the time.

1284
01:18:38.301 --> 01:18:42.560
The last thing anybody wants a year usually for the most part is an old bit.

1285
01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:46.640
Like sometimes people will request,
they like want to hear something again.

1286
01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:47.503
You know,
they that there,

1287
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.600
that's a classic but they want it at least like 70% of it to be new.

1288
01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:55.910
You know,
they want all,
most is as much new,
stiff,

1289
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:57.880
like a few classics thrown in is Great.

1290
01:18:57.881 --> 01:18:59.930
But the last thing you want to hear when you go see a comedian,

1291
01:18:59.931 --> 01:19:04.400
it's the same act in the same order that you saw five years ago.

1292
01:19:04.401 --> 01:19:08.480
That would be horrific.
It?
Well,
yeah,
if it was the same,
I mean,

1293
01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.440
even like majorly probe

1294
01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:15.390
<v 2>bands,
I'm talking like,
you know,
well,
you know,
I mean just any band,</v>

1295
01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:19.200
they go do a similar show every night on a certain tour.

1296
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:21.990
Now maybe they not going to come back and do that,

1297
01:19:21.991 --> 01:19:26.850
give you that same look again next year.
But,
but I,
I've even,

1298
01:19:26.851 --> 01:19:27.031
like,

1299
01:19:27.031 --> 01:19:31.500
we did a tour with kiss and every night they were saying the same thing to the

1300
01:19:31.501 --> 01:19:35.880
audience.
It was like,
you know,
cookie cutter.
Yeah.
Actually,
you know,
it's like,
oh,

1301
01:19:35.881 --> 01:19:38.970
and now he's going to say this,
you know,
so it's a,

1302
01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.540
<v 3>how many of y'all like,</v>

1303
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.390
<v 2>yeah,
word for word man.
He's not going to mess it up.</v>

1304
01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:51.660
<v 3>Somebody made a video or a CD rather have all of Paul Stanley's inbetween banter</v>

1305
01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:55.060
in between songs.
It's fucking brilliant.

1306
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.780
<v 2>I really,
really,
uh,</v>

1307
01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:00.190
powerful in the sense like their live album,

1308
01:20:00.191 --> 01:20:05.191
the one they did years and years and years ago was the most sought after best

1309
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.060
selling,
you know?

1310
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:11.100
And some of those things that he said in between the songs became very famous,

1311
01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:15.300
you know,
like they call Jim thing.
You know,
I mean it,

1312
01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.350
it's pretty cool.

1313
01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:20.030
<v 1>Yeah.
That's awesome.
Apes ace freely is actually going to be on this podcast,</v>

1314
01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:23.030
April 23rd.
Oh good.
Good fucking,

1315
01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.970
<v 2>I'm ready.
I'm happy to hear that because,
um,
one thing in,</v>

1316
01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.850
I'm not going to take sides or do any kind of stuff,

1317
01:20:30.851 --> 01:20:35.370
but I really feel bad.
Um,

1318
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:36.011
you know,

1319
01:20:36.011 --> 01:20:41.011
that they're not being given any credit from their former band mates,

1320
01:20:42.431 --> 01:20:46.990
you know,
to just write them off as hired guns when they were a part of,

1321
01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:51.850
I mean,
that drummer,
Peter Chris wrote their biggest selling,

1322
01:20:51.851 --> 01:20:54.390
biggest hit of the man's career.
Yeah.

1323
01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:59.460
I'm on paper that showed to just call them hired grenades that were in our band

1324
01:21:00.641 --> 01:21:01.474
a long time ago.

1325
01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:04.660
I understand that they're bitter because of addiction problems and stuff like

1326
01:21:04.661 --> 01:21:08.500
that,
but,
um,
you shouldn't,
you know,

1327
01:21:08.501 --> 01:21:12.160
throw your brother's into the bus.
Uh,
you know,
I,

1328
01:21:12.161 --> 01:21:13.930
I'm not gonna sit here and speak for them,

1329
01:21:13.931 --> 01:21:18.910
but I'm just saying that I feel bad because when I was a young teenager,

1330
01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:24.780
just about every one of my friends were playing air guitar to a ace freely,

1331
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:29.710
you know what I mean?
You know what I mean?

1332
01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.940
Just a noodling in the air.
And I,

1333
01:21:32.941 --> 01:21:35.600
I just think he should get some kind of credit.

1334
01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.990
<v 1>I agree.
Uh,
um,
uh,
you know,</v>

1335
01:21:37.991 --> 01:21:41.730
I don't know the ins and the outs of their disputes,
nor do I Chris,

1336
01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:46.000
in order to why.
But I do know that,
um,
ace Frehley was,

1337
01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:47.880
I was a huge fan when I was kid.
I mean,

1338
01:21:47.890 --> 01:21:52.540
I think he was a huge part of the band during,
it's a successful years.

1339
01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.770
I think,
you know,

1340
01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:57.490
some of his songs and some of them is rifts or some of my all time favorites.

1341
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.340
You know,
that if Kristen,

1342
01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:03.130
<v 2>I'll tell you something,
you know,
imagine this Eddie van Halen.</v>

1343
01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:08.131
You know how great he is when they first got their record deal and Rodney

1344
01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:12.610
Bingenheimer actually introduced them at the,
uh,
in Pasadena,

1345
01:22:12.611 --> 01:22:16.600
at the Pasadena Civic.
Um,
they,
they were signed by Warner brothers.

1346
01:22:16.601 --> 01:22:17.470
It was all going on.

1347
01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:22.471
Eddie goes into the solo and the end solo that he did was the ace freely solo

1348
01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:27.570
<v 4>ran their anemia and renamed me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me.</v>

1349
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:31.360
<v 2>He actually did the HV the cells come on.
I mean,
you know,</v>

1350
01:22:31.361 --> 01:22:35.920
let's give this guy some credit that,
yeah,
Bro,
I don't know what it is.

1351
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.050
This is the man,
you know,

1352
01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:41.410
<v 1>I don't know what it is,
what the,
what the dispute was between those guys.</v>

1353
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:42.110
Who knows,

1354
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:46.880
<v 2>who knows none of my business and I,
I just in,
no matter what it is,</v>

1355
01:22:46.881 --> 01:22:50.980
I just think,
you know,
even if he hate each other,

1356
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:55.400
whatever you got to give the guys do,
just give him his due.
I mean,

1357
01:22:55.401 --> 01:22:58.000
still hate him forever whenever you're going to do,
but just,

1358
01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:02.990
you can't just say he was just a hired gun when he was such a,

1359
01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:08.710
you know,
as far as what a young teenagers,
they,
he was a hero to a lot of people,

1360
01:23:08.711 --> 01:23:11.980
you know?
Is that what they're saying now?
Is that like,
oh,

1361
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.310
they're getting inducted into the hall of fame and they're just basically seeing

1362
01:23:15.311 --> 01:23:20.090
that,
you know,
I'm not quoting anybody,
I'm just saying that,
you know,

1363
01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:24.640
they wanted to just have their new guys,
you know,

1364
01:23:24.641 --> 01:23:26.980
the guys that have been in the band for a long time.

1365
01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:28.883
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1366
01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:32.480
<v 2>Be there are,
you know,
they,
in other words,
they didn't want it.</v>

1367
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:36.560
The original guys up there playing with makeup on when these other guys in their

1368
01:23:36.561 --> 01:23:40.730
band had makeup on,
it was just going to be a circus,
you know?
Oh,

1369
01:23:40.731 --> 01:23:42.080
we got two A's for you.
You know,

1370
01:23:42.081 --> 01:23:46.380
we got a two drummers with the same cat thing and you know,

1371
01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:51.660
and I totally get that.
And they tried to do different [inaudible] for a while.

1372
01:23:51.661 --> 01:23:56.120
Remember?
Did they?
Yeah,
I,
I'm not really that hip to kit.

1373
01:23:56.190 --> 01:23:59.720
I don't know much about it.
Didn't try to replace Peter Criss.

1374
01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:03.860
At first they were placed Peter Criss with another dude who had different kind

1375
01:24:03.861 --> 01:24:07.050
of things,
different things that wouldn't make sense,
you know,
to have some,

1376
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.940
now they don't.

1377
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.480
Now they have a guy who plays ace freely and a guy plays Peter Criss,

1378
01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:14.240
which I know who the guy is his name,

1379
01:24:14.241 --> 01:24:17.720
Tommy Thay or he used to be in a band called black and blue like years and years

1380
01:24:17.721 --> 01:24:21.470
ago.
Um,
is there a break to where you can go to the bathroom?

1381
01:24:21.471 --> 01:24:23.640
Go to the bathroom now and just go,
go,
don't worry about

1382
01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:28.030
<v 1>it.
Okay.
There's lots of stuff that I could talk about
the seat.</v>

1383
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:30.970
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the problem with having a podcast like this.

1384
01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:34.630
A lot of people don't have the kind of bladder control that I've developed over

1385
01:24:34.631 --> 01:24:38.380
years and years of podcasting and working the UFC.

1386
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.180
I make a joke out of it cause at the UFC,
uh,
Mike Goldberg,
my cohost,

1387
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:45.430
he hates when I talk about this,
but tough shit,

1388
01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:49.900
that Dude has to pee like six times every podcast,
every a broadcast.
So,
uh,

1389
01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:55.060
I've developed the ability to maintain and to hold my bladder because I'm a big

1390
01:24:55.061 --> 01:24:59.560
boy.
Okay.
And cause I know how to handle my,
my,
my coffee and my,
uh,

1391
01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:00.730
stimulants.

1392
01:25:00.730 --> 01:25:04.120
That's the problem really is when you just start drinking shit like red bull and

1393
01:25:04.121 --> 01:25:06.790
stuff fucks with your bladder.
Um,
I,
uh,

1394
01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:09.650
just announced today that I am going to be,
uh,

1395
01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:13.870
in Philadelphia on October 17th,

1396
01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.190
October 17th,
I met the tower theater and uh,
as of today,

1397
01:25:18.191 --> 01:25:21.360
today is April 10th.
Uh,

1398
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:23.410
the presale is going on right now.

1399
01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:27.670
If you go to my Twitter page that said Joe Rogan.
And um,

1400
01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:32.820
also this Friday night I'm going to be at the Ice House in Pasadena and it's a,

1401
01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.810
one of the shows that Brian has put together and I know there's some,
uh,

1402
01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:40.930
funny people that are going to be on it.
Christina Palicki is going to be on it.

1403
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.320
Um,
Dave Taylor is going to be on it,
uh,

1404
01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.590
don't know the full lineup,
but uh,

1405
01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:51.310
I'm sure it would be awesome that ice house is one of the greatest places in the

1406
01:25:51.311 --> 01:25:54.280
world to do stand up.
And it's also the small room too,

1407
01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:58.210
which is a small room is really a,
a special room.

1408
01:25:58.211 --> 01:26:00.460
It's only about 80 seats total,

1409
01:26:00.461 --> 01:26:04.220
so it sells out every time pretty much.
And,
uh,

1410
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:07.900
just one of the coolest places to perform and do stand up.
Uh,

1411
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:11.960
somebody sent me this on Twitter the other day and I wanted to show it to you,

1412
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.760
mark,
as you've gotten back.

1413
01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:16.250
It's a picture of Jimi Hendrix when he was really young

1414
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:21.380
<v 2>with his guitar.
Oh yeah.
I have actually seen this.
Amazing.
Yeah,</v>

1415
01:26:21.381 --> 01:26:25.540
that's amazing.
Yeah.
Cause he played with like the Isley brothers and,
and uh,

1416
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.851
you know,

1417
01:26:25.851 --> 01:26:29.390
he played when he was up and coming and he was playing with a lot of people.

1418
01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:35.600
That's a little Richard and stuff like that.
And uh,
so yeah,

1419
01:26:35.601 --> 01:26:36.620
he had a different look.

1420
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:39.430
<v 1>Yeah.
No one's going to steal it from that.
It's on my Twitter.</v>

1421
01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.340
Amazing pictures.

1422
01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:46.260
<v 2>You know,
you're around the MMA and UFC.
Uh,</v>

1423
01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:50.410
are you a fighter yourself or you just,
uh,
fascinated by this?

1424
01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:54.520
<v 1>Um,
well,
this point in my life,
I'd have to say I'm just fascinated by the sport,</v>

1425
01:26:54.521 --> 01:26:56.140
but I've done martial arts my whole life.

1426
01:26:56.470 --> 01:27:00.610
I used to compete and I used to be a taekwondo champion and I used to brag on

1427
01:27:00.670 --> 01:27:04.860
teach taekwondo for a living before I became a professional comedian.
And um,

1428
01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:08.620
and I still,
I was still training because it was such a great fan,

1429
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:10.960
<v 2>big fan,
you know,
I had a lot of tapes in the,</v>

1430
01:27:10.961 --> 01:27:13.210
in like the hoists Gracie days and stuff.

1431
01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:17.880
And one thing that blew my mind because I've always been a boxing.
I'm,
I'm,

1432
01:27:17.890 --> 01:27:20.680
I was a boxing fan and you know,

1433
01:27:20.681 --> 01:27:24.910
then I started watching this UFC stuff and I was like,
whoa man,
these guys,

1434
01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:29.710
it's so intense.
And it seemed like,

1435
01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:32.680
well at least back then that the grapplers had,

1436
01:27:33.490 --> 01:27:38.050
I mean that was the nuts.
[inaudible] went to the ground.
You were done with,

1437
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.970
<v 1>you guys know chat was throwing there another pool term.
The nuts,</v>

1438
01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:47.990
the nuts means you're stealing.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Got it down.
You've got no problem.

1439
01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:49.200
You're winning.
No problem.

1440
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:51.790
<v 2>We're going to win every time from the ground.
And that,
that,</v>

1441
01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:57.010
that's what amazed me.
It's like I'm thinking,
you know,
cause Bruce used,

1442
01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:59.360
I used to,
there's no one like this guy.

1443
01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.270
How could anybody beat him at anything.

1444
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:07.220
But then I wonder if an expert grapple or somehow got a hold of them,

1445
01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.100
but I don't think they could.

1446
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:10.460
<v 1>Oh well listen,
listen,
they could,</v>

1447
01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:14.690
Bruce Lee was an actor and Bruce Lee was a tremendous martial artist.

1448
01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:19.720
Bruce Lee was a real innovator and Preuss Lee is responsible for the idea behind

1449
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:21.710
his Jeet Kune Dough,

1450
01:28:21.711 --> 01:28:25.970
which was that you could take all the best aspects of all the different martial

1451
01:28:25.971 --> 01:28:27.740
arts and combine them together.

1452
01:28:27.741 --> 01:28:31.610
So in a lot of sense is Bruce Lee was the original mixed martial arts fighter,

1453
01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:37.180
but he had very little competition experience and very little real fighting

1454
01:28:37.551 --> 01:28:41.450
experience amongst elite fighters.
Like at the UFC level.

1455
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:43.990
I didn't know that he was more of an actor and he was a,

1456
01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:46.940
a great martial artist is not to diminish them in any way.

1457
01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:51.260
Who knows if the UFC had been around when he was,
uh,
uh,

1458
01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.530
I mean if he was born in this era and you know,

1459
01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:58.190
the UFC was around while he was at the age that he would want to compete at,

1460
01:28:58.310 --> 01:29:01.220
who knows,
he might have been in there and he,
he might've been a champion,

1461
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:02.220
but the reality

1462
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.200
<v 3>of the situation is what he was,</v>

1463
01:29:04.201 --> 01:29:08.400
was just a guy who was a great martial artist who was ahead of his time and a

1464
01:29:08.730 --> 01:29:10.050
true,
true innovator.

1465
01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:14.130
But to say that a guy like Hanan Barao who's the UFC bantamweight champion,

1466
01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:17.970
who would be the guy that he would compete against to say that,
you know,

1467
01:29:17.971 --> 01:29:19.380
he wouldn't be able to catch Bruce Lee's.

1468
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:24.780
He would fuck Bruce Lee up if they know things like this.

1469
01:29:24.781 --> 01:29:27.480
This is an interesting me if,
I mean,
if they both were,

1470
01:29:27.481 --> 01:29:30.690
if you took the Bruce Lee from the movies and the hen and morale from the UFC

1471
01:29:30.810 --> 01:29:31.351
from me,
you know,

1472
01:29:31.351 --> 01:29:34.260
like pull them out of a time machine and stuck them into the octagon.

1473
01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:36.630
Hanan Barao would have his way with them.
I mean,
it was just,

1474
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:41.190
he's just a completely evolved,

1475
01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.560
fully trained,

1476
01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:46.710
mixed martial arts fighter at the very highest level of every single aspect of

1477
01:29:46.711 --> 01:29:47.310
the game.

1478
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:51.300
It doesn't mean that Bruce Lee couldn't have reached that level as well.
I mean,

1479
01:29:51.301 --> 01:29:53.850
he was amazing.
He watched some of the fight scenes.

1480
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.080
There was no one in that time that was throwing kicks.

1481
01:29:58.081 --> 01:30:01.980
The Way Bruce Lee was seems credible to me.
Amazing.
His movement,

1482
01:30:01.981 --> 01:30:04.650
his speed and also is insane.
His,

1483
01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:09.330
his understanding of choreography and the drama and excitement of what he was

1484
01:30:09.331 --> 01:30:13.380
doing in those movies.
It was just unprecedented.
There was nobody like him.

1485
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:15.510
I mean,
I'm a huge,
huge Bruce Lee Fan,

1486
01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:19.020
but if Bruce Lee fought Hanan Barao and my money's on the Brazilian,

1487
01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:24.040
I mean without a doubt.
But that's just reality,
you know?
Sure,
sure.
I mean,

1488
01:30:24.041 --> 01:30:26.520
I'm going to,
you're not taking anything away.
Nothing.
You're just saying,

1489
01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:29.790
just stating the fact I'm a huge Chuck Norris Fan.
But if you know,

1490
01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.530
Chuck Norris had to fight the,

1491
01:30:31.531 --> 01:30:34.290
the elite of the elite in mixed martial arts as well.
I mean,

1492
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:38.250
he would have to be in that game.
And train in that game,

1493
01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:43.140
get to that level and then you would see,
but you can't know.

1494
01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:46.320
It's like saying,
man,
if Tom Cruise played professionally,
God,

1495
01:30:46.321 --> 01:30:51.310
he would beat everybody.
I saw him in the color of money.
Imagine,
you know,

1496
01:30:51.311 --> 01:30:54.500
imagine if Tom Cruise had a place.
Shane van Bony can get away,

1497
01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:58.410
get away from me.
He'd get wait from everybody.

1498
01:30:58.710 --> 01:31:01.590
We probably can't even play anymore.
That was the thing.

1499
01:31:01.591 --> 01:31:03.810
Like there's only a few guys that have ever really,

1500
01:31:03.811 --> 01:31:06.780
really pulled off looking like a pool player in a movie.

1501
01:31:06.781 --> 01:31:09.570
Like Tom Cruise sorta did it.
He sorted it.

1502
01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:14.700
But if you see some of the shots where he's setting up his mechanics,

1503
01:31:14.701 --> 01:31:17.490
look a little bit Hokey a couple of times,

1504
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:22.860
but Paul Newman and the hustler was not very good.
I mean it was awkward.
His,

1505
01:31:22.861 --> 01:31:26.730
his,
his acting was fantastic.
Brilliant at the performance.

1506
01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:31.170
But you watch him shoot things like that bank combination combination.

1507
01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:35.730
You would never see,
you know,
it was an accident.
No,

1508
01:31:35.850 --> 01:31:39.030
they told them to just knock some balls around and you know,
we'll just,

1509
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:44.010
who's going to call that shot?
No one in history.
Ever.
It's a stupid shot.
Yeah.

1510
01:31:44.011 --> 01:31:46.950
No one would do it straight pull.
You're going to play say,
Oh,

1511
01:31:46.951 --> 01:31:48.570
you're going to do something else.

1512
01:31:48.571 --> 01:31:52.510
That he tried to make a bank shot and he didn't even realize that he was gonna

1513
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:55.830
make a combination,
made a combination.
And then everybody clapped.

1514
01:31:55.831 --> 01:32:00.230
Like it was real.
But Jackie Gleason could play.
Oh yeah.
You look at Jackie,

1515
01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:02.710
<v 2>you can run a hundred balls.
He was,
uh,</v>

1516
01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:07.360
actually used to hustle pool before he even acted.
I mean,
he was like for real.

1517
01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:10.430
<v 3>Well,
you can see here,
it's got a very gentle stroke.</v>

1518
01:32:10.431 --> 01:32:14.150
Like you could see the way he's holding the cue.
He's a real pool player.

1519
01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:17.750
So there's only a few of those guys that have ever like played in movies and

1520
01:32:17.751 --> 01:32:21.970
looked,
looked legit.
Gleason could really play.
Yeah,
he could really play.

1521
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:24.150
He was a,
he was a actually a hustler.
And,

1522
01:32:24.151 --> 01:32:26.240
and I know for a fact that he was a good player.

1523
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:29.820
Paul Sorvino apparently can really play too.
I don't even know.
I,

1524
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:31.600
I've have heard that.
I don't know how

1525
01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:33.040
<v 2>Goodi was.
Um,</v>

1526
01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:39.040
I haven't heard of anyone that played Gleason speed from like Jay Helford or

1527
01:32:40.371 --> 01:32:44.540
something who kind of would know,
but that that's all I've heard.

1528
01:32:44.541 --> 01:32:47.150
I know I couldn't get there with that guy.

1529
01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:48.960
<v 3>Yeah,
there was a,</v>

1530
01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:53.100
there was a few guys throughout history that have played like pretty good,

1531
01:32:53.670 --> 01:32:58.170
but everybody says that Jackie Gleason was probably the all time best guy.

1532
01:32:58.300 --> 01:32:59.700
<v 2>Yeah.
As far as like,
and,</v>

1533
01:32:59.701 --> 01:33:03.660
and I think a lot of that reason is because he was a pool player before actor.

1534
01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:09.310
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's big.
It's like w with John Schmidt,
you know John,

1535
01:33:09.311 --> 01:33:11.020
right?
Sure.
Yeah.

1536
01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:16.000
He was a golfer before a pool player that really,
yeah.

1537
01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:17.650
I mean he literally golf with tiger,

1538
01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:21.510
Tiger Woods in college and he's played like state events and,

1539
01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:26.470
and all this stuff and he's a scratch golfer.
So he goes,

1540
01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.580
you know,

1541
01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:33.120
any pool player that wants to play me and golf for money can get like strokes

1542
01:33:33.401 --> 01:33:34.030
from me.

1543
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:34.721
<v 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1544
01:33:34.721 --> 01:33:38.200
It's interesting cause he wasn't offered before he was a pool player.

1545
01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:41.620
But it's interesting that he went into pool over golf because there's so much

1546
01:33:41.621 --> 01:33:42.940
more money and call.
Yeah.

1547
01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:47.240
<v 2>Don't really have the answers for that.
When he met Bobby Hunter years ago,</v>

1548
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:50.410
supposedly he was working at a golf course.
Um,

1549
01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:54.860
I really don't know why he wouldn't go pro.
Um,

1550
01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.610
but he even said,
I guess back then when he was like,
I don't know,

1551
01:33:58.611 --> 01:34:01.970
17 or 18 that tiger woods was the best golfer,

1552
01:34:01.971 --> 01:34:06.740
but he said that he could probably never compete on the PGA level.
And He,

1553
01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.110
and he said that he,
he was saying that I'd not make a good,
uh,

1554
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:15.410
John Schmidt.
Yeah.
Could he goes,
yeah,
tiger woods is better than all of us,

1555
01:34:15.411 --> 01:34:18.620
but I don't,
I don't think he could ever make it on the PGA tour.

1556
01:34:18.621 --> 01:34:20.600
And it's thought that about tiger woods.
Yeah.
He goes,

1557
01:34:20.601 --> 01:34:22.130
I wouldn't make a very good tale.

1558
01:34:24.250 --> 01:34:28.030
<v 3>That's hilarious.
So he thought back then,
the tiger had no chance.</v>

1559
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:32.580
<v 2>He just said he,
you know,
because his thinking was a,
you know,
we're college guys.</v>

1560
01:34:32.581 --> 01:34:37.530
I mean,
he's really good,
but I,
you know,
he's not going to go out and be,

1561
01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:40.950
you know,
whoever.
Yeah.
It was just,
you know,
kind of the thinking at that time.

1562
01:34:40.951 --> 01:34:43.060
Obviously he's got tons of respect.
Beck

1563
01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:43.900
<v 3>for tiger woods.</v>

1564
01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:48.610
Tiger Woods is another perfect example of a guy who just completely driven,

1565
01:34:48.611 --> 01:34:53.290
threw himself into this one discipline and just had a dad who was also

1566
01:34:53.291 --> 01:34:57.320
completely obsessed by it.
Sure.
Just put all of his time and yeah,

1567
01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:01.610
<v 2>when you look at guys that do things really great,
you know,
and,</v>

1568
01:35:01.611 --> 01:35:05.560
and guys that are,
you know,
really good or whatever,

1569
01:35:05.561 --> 01:35:09.070
it's usually the really great guy that has worked harder.
You know,

1570
01:35:09.071 --> 01:35:11.380
he might have some natural ability,
which helps,

1571
01:35:11.410 --> 01:35:16.350
but it's with Shane van and almost every walk of life when I see somebody that's

1572
01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.630
just totally blows my mind,
they worked harder.

1573
01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:22.480
<v 3>Yeah.
They put more hours in or whatever.
Yeah.</v>

1574
01:35:22.481 --> 01:35:25.270
The perfect storm is the guy who's gotten natural ability,

1575
01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:29.620
loves what he does and works harder.
That's the perfect style.
That is perfect.

1576
01:35:29.621 --> 01:35:32.230
If you love what you're doing and you work hard at it,

1577
01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:36.860
you really are giving your maximum effort.
I mean,
what,

1578
01:35:36.861 --> 01:35:40.030
what else can you answer them yourself?
Pursuit of excellence.

1579
01:35:40.090 --> 01:35:42.910
That's the man that that is

1580
01:35:42.990 --> 01:35:46.830
<v 2>and it's beautiful.
No matter what walk of life it's in to watch.</v>

1581
01:35:47.010 --> 01:35:51.060
I love to watch somebody do something that's really hard to do,

1582
01:35:51.061 --> 01:35:53.910
but they just do it effortless.
Like in pool.

1583
01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:56.980
I just can't believe how I,

1584
01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.140
that's why I have so much respect for the game because I know how difficult it

1585
01:36:01.141 --> 01:36:02.670
is from my own experience.

1586
01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:07.620
When a guy gets up there and runs 200 it makes it look hard when I'm like,

1587
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:11.490
you know,
killing myself to run 55 you know,

1588
01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:14.130
the other day I ran 55 I'm like calling friends.

1589
01:36:14.131 --> 01:36:16.240
I'm going did I just ran in 55 you know,

1590
01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:20.740
but it's like the get up and just run a hundred you know,

1591
01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:21.990
at will and stuff like that.

1592
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.961
<v 3>Well,</v>

1593
01:36:22.961 --> 01:36:26.750
I haven't been aware that pool is an art form that can only be appreciated by

1594
01:36:26.751 --> 01:36:29.480
people play it.
Like,
if you don't play pool,

1595
01:36:29.481 --> 01:36:31.430
you're really not gonna be able to appreciate what's going on.

1596
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:34.630
<v 2>I,
I kind of have to agree with that because that,</v>

1597
01:36:34.690 --> 01:36:39.500
that's why I was so kind of happy that a guy like you,

1598
01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:44.540
it's really busy in the business or whatever knows about pool,
you know,

1599
01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:47.960
just like somebody away from pool knows about it.

1600
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:50.330
He knows what these guys go through and stuff,
you know?

1601
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:54.110
I just thought that that was really neat.
You know,
Jay kind of,

1602
01:36:54.170 --> 01:36:55.650
I've heard him talk about you and stuff.

1603
01:36:56.130 --> 01:37:00.940
<v 3>No,
I've known Jay since the 90s.
I think I met Jane 94.
Wow.</v>

1604
01:37:00.970 --> 01:37:02.640
Thank I met Jay when he was,
um,

1605
01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.540
when he was doing CJ Wiley's big professional tournaments in [inaudible] 94.

1606
01:37:06.570 --> 01:37:10.060
Oh Wow.
That's heavy.
I didn't know you'd been around that long.
Yeah,

1607
01:37:10.150 --> 01:37:14.160
well that's when I first moved to La.
I mean,
I didn't know,
you know,
pool got,

1608
01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:18.720
you know,
the pool world that long.
Oh,
I was involved in pool before that.
I was,

1609
01:37:18.721 --> 01:37:20.940
I think I started playing in 1990.

1610
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.550
I think that's when I really first started playing and,
uh,

1611
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.710
became completely obsessed.

1612
01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:29.550
That's right around the time that I moved to New York.
Uh,
I had,
uh,

1613
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:32.640
had a knee injury.
I couldn't work out for a while and uh,

1614
01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:37.080
just to kill time with my friends.
I started playing pool and just got obsessed.

1615
01:37:37.110 --> 01:37:40.380
What'd you play it?
It's a place called the executive billiards in white plains,

1616
01:37:40.410 --> 01:37:43.980
New York.
Still there.
Okay.
But now it's like a fucking disc.
I played in a few,

1617
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:47.180
a few of the rooms that they're,
well,
I also played in a,

1618
01:37:47.181 --> 01:37:49.880
a lot of the rooms in the area.
Like A,

1619
01:37:49.890 --> 01:37:53.370
I played a lot of Chelsea billiards west in there.

1620
01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.980
I've been there west end bill years.

1621
01:37:56.030 --> 01:38:00.760
<v 2>Is that where Kinky used to you?
I was funny.
He used to play there.
Me Too.
Me Too.</v>

1622
01:38:00.761 --> 01:38:04.220
In fact,
when I heard that he was,
um,

1623
01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:08.230
kind of experiencing a little bit of a problem with the pills,

1624
01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:11.680
I was going to reach out to him and he died like before.

1625
01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:16.510
But I thought about it because he was doing an interview and I watched it.

1626
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:20.230
I watched an interview with Jose Paprika on just some random side.

1627
01:38:20.231 --> 01:38:24.500
I was just not even looking for anything.
I just happened to see it.
Oh Man,

1628
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:26.570
I want,
I want to see this.
Um,

1629
01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:31.210
and I saw his interview and he,
he'd been sober.
He,

1630
01:38:31.211 --> 01:38:36.211
he had some back stuff and he was taking a narcotics for it and stuff like that.

1631
01:38:36.670 --> 01:38:38.500
You know,
it got kind of caught up in it,

1632
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:42.190
but he said he hadn't been doing it for a long time,
but he was doing,

1633
01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:46.840
doing well and I reach out to struggling addicts.
That's what I kind of do.

1634
01:38:46.841 --> 01:38:49.540
I just,
every once in a while to say,
hey man,

1635
01:38:49.541 --> 01:38:53.050
if anybody out there is struggling and wants to try to get sober,

1636
01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:56.920
I'm available to be your sober friend.
You know?
That's very cool.

1637
01:38:56.921 --> 01:39:01.210
That's what I offer.
I just offered my friendship support,
you know,

1638
01:39:01.211 --> 01:39:04.870
I have my own support groups and stuff like that.
But um,
anyways,

1639
01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:09.370
I was going to do that to him and especially because I knew him anyways,

1640
01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:11.920
not,
we weren't close friends or anything,

1641
01:39:11.921 --> 01:39:14.780
but I steered him around when he was out here.
We,
we,
you know,

1642
01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:18.450
we kind of hung out with a little bit,
you know,
and um,
and,

1643
01:39:18.451 --> 01:39:21.220
and I was really bombed that.
I was a little late on that,

1644
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.560
but I didn't know cause he said he was not using and not,

1645
01:39:26.561 --> 01:39:27.430
not taking the,

1646
01:39:27.690 --> 01:39:28.710
<v 1>he wasn't being honest.</v>

1647
01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:33.750
Georgia maybe I knew George from the 90s.

1648
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:35.250
I mean I knew him way,
way,

1649
01:39:35.251 --> 01:39:38.850
way back in the day when he was a pretty decent player sorta coming up.

1650
01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:43.740
But he was always squeaky clean.
It always drank water,
no cigarettes,
no alcohol,

1651
01:39:43.741 --> 01:39:48.070
no drugs.
But he had that back injury and manned pills are a motherfucker.

1652
01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:51.120
Heck yeah.
He,
he had a,
what was wrong with them?

1653
01:39:51.121 --> 01:39:55.360
Did it come from a car accident of a disc?
A neck.

1654
01:39:55.450 --> 01:39:57.930
But where did it come from?
I don't know.
Was it a car?

1655
01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:01.530
I wonder if it's from pool itself.
I don't know.
It was some kind of,

1656
01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.810
I had a back injury from Jujitsu,
um,

1657
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:06.330
and it would flare up when I would play pool.

1658
01:40:06.331 --> 01:40:08.870
There's something about the position of being over a table,

1659
01:40:08.871 --> 01:40:10.530
like bent over a table.
Like,

1660
01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:13.830
cause you know when you're playing you kind of have your head back and there was

1661
01:40:13.831 --> 01:40:17.610
something about they have a muscle that kind of pokes out a little bit that I

1662
01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.610
have to deal with or you didn't land.

1663
01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.750
You ever tried deep tissue massage for that?

1664
01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:24.740
<v 2>I've tried a lot of different things.
Yeah,</v>

1665
01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.450
but I'm the person I've used the last couple times.

1666
01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:32.810
It doesn't quite go hard enough.
I wish he was just a little bit more power.

1667
01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:33.733
Right?

1668
01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.230
<v 1>She's to go to another person,</v>

1669
01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:40.000
got to find someone who hurts you or offer you ever get rolfing done.

1670
01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.480
Raul Raul thing is like a particularly brutal type of massage that don't feel

1671
01:40:45.761 --> 01:40:48.960
good at all.
Like bruises.
You will,

1672
01:40:49.190 --> 01:40:54.100
they are manipulating.
I shouldn't quote exactly they do because

1673
01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:57.750
<v 3>there's a lot of dispute about what's really going on when they're doing it.</v>

1674
01:40:57.751 --> 01:41:02.320
But what they're doing is essentially is absolutely brutal massage that relaxes

1675
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:04.420
everything in your muscles.

1676
01:41:04.421 --> 01:41:08.670
I mean it's really unbelievably painful while it's happening.
Not Unbelievable.

1677
01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:09.370
You can believe it.

1678
01:41:09.370 --> 01:41:13.240
I mean it's not like they're saw and your leg off of the rusty hatchet,
but it,

1679
01:41:13.450 --> 01:41:16.450
it sucks.
But when it's over,
man,
you feel great.

1680
01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:21.160
I don't know how versed you are as far as the body.
I mean,
um,

1681
01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.260
because I just kind of go,
oh wow,
when I push here it hurts here or something.

1682
01:41:26.261 --> 01:41:29.290
You know,
I'm not a doctor.
I,

1683
01:41:29.291 --> 01:41:33.080
I mean I haven't studied the anatomy of a back or whatever,
but um,

1684
01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:35.980
this one person that I used to go to,

1685
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:41.310
she did things to my neck that caused so much relief in my back and just by

1686
01:41:43.301 --> 01:41:44.710
working my neck,

1687
01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.640
it was like really crazy how the body works sometimes.

1688
01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.710
Like it's all connected.
Yeah.

1689
01:41:50.850 --> 01:41:53.950
Like you're working on one spot and I get a little relief right here.

1690
01:41:55.330 --> 01:41:59.620
Having a person who's really good at deep tissue massage and sports massage and

1691
01:41:59.621 --> 01:42:02.470
someone who really understands the,
the connective tissue,

1692
01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:06.110
you can relieve a lot of tension in your back.
It's,
it's,

1693
01:42:06.111 --> 01:42:10.420
it's such an important thing and huge amongst athletes,

1694
01:42:10.421 --> 01:42:14.560
like athletes go for deep tissue massage on a regular basis for that very
reason.

1695
01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:18.040
Just because it offers relief.
It allows the muscles to heal more properly,

1696
01:42:18.041 --> 01:42:21.700
allows more,
more circulation in the area.

1697
01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.270
A lot of things they're doing now that are just incredible or one of them,

1698
01:42:25.271 --> 01:42:26.980
there's this cryo thing they're doing,

1699
01:42:26.981 --> 01:42:30.850
we're athletes will work out really hard and they step in this thing that uses

1700
01:42:30.851 --> 01:42:35.690
liquid nitrogen to bring the temperature down like 150 below zero.
Why?

1701
01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:40.370
They stand in it for like two minutes and then they get out and the,
the,

1702
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:45.430
the incredible cold causes all your vessels to constrict and when you get out of

1703
01:42:47.831 --> 01:42:48.130
it,

1704
01:42:48.130 --> 01:42:53.130
everything dilates and it's like up this massive release and flowing of the

1705
01:42:56.891 --> 01:43:00.390
blood and removing them.
You know,
I don't take a lot of,
you know,

1706
01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:04.660
I don't think really vitamins even.
No,
no tea hung up.

1707
01:43:04.670 --> 01:43:05.860
Before I go,

1708
01:43:05.861 --> 01:43:09.610
I was wondering if you could like kind of hook me up with some kind of vitamin

1709
01:43:09.611 --> 01:43:13.420
regimen.
Sure,
absolutely.
Now Cardio action,

1710
01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:15.460
most important thing is food.

1711
01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:19.660
That's something number one most important thing is eat healthy food.
Um,

1712
01:43:19.661 --> 01:43:24.020
once you've got the healthy food covered,
then supplementation is,

1713
01:43:24.021 --> 01:43:25.780
is a good second approach.

1714
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:29.920
But the first approach should always be the Diet itself.
The food itself,

1715
01:43:30.250 --> 01:43:33.820
like eating healthy food is one of the best things you could do for herself.

1716
01:43:33.821 --> 01:43:37.420
And one of the things that so many people [inaudible] and things like just

1717
01:43:37.470 --> 01:43:40.540
actionables vegetables,
vegetables are huge.

1718
01:43:40.541 --> 01:43:43.480
It's one of the number one things that people ignore them when it comes to their

1719
01:43:43.481 --> 01:43:47.290
diet is fresh,
healthy vegetables,
clean vegetables,

1720
01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:50.380
eating cooked and uncooked,
raw,
you know,

1721
01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:54.170
blended juices,
just eating salads.

1722
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:58.250
Just some green leafy vegetables are so important for your body.

1723
01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.620
And it's something that we just don't get enough.
I mean,

1724
01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:04.310
when you're talking about Fido nutrients,
you're talking about minerals,

1725
01:44:04.311 --> 01:44:06.500
all the different things that you get from vegetables.

1726
01:44:07.050 --> 01:44:10.430
They're one of the most important things that people are deficient from and

1727
01:44:10.431 --> 01:44:13.940
their diet being minerally deficient,
being nutritionally deficient.

1728
01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.070
A lot of it is because of a lack of green leafy vegetables,
healthy vegetables,

1729
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:23.400
organic vegetables and healthy proteins on top of that once,

1730
01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:26.930
what are you doing over there?
Oh,
sorry.
What is that?
It's a pick.
Oh,

1731
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:31.040
I'm writing and I wrote a whole album while you're talking.

1732
01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:35.030
I'm just kidding.
Um,
but,

1733
01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:40.300
but vitamins are good also to cover all your bases as far as like adding

1734
01:44:40.341 --> 01:44:41.840
additional nutrition to your,

1735
01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:45.650
your diet to make sure that you're optimizing everything.

1736
01:44:45.710 --> 01:44:50.330
It's not like you'll hear like,
oh,
you don't need multivitamins.
You're fine.

1737
01:44:50.331 --> 01:44:53.930
Do without them.
They're not necessary.
Sure.
You can live without them,

1738
01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:55.970
but you're not looking to just live,

1739
01:44:55.971 --> 01:44:59.180
you're looking to be fully optimized to feel good.
Yeah.

1740
01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:03.530
The best way also is to go to someone who can monitor your blood work,

1741
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:06.210
get your blood work done and find out.
You might say,
well,

1742
01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:09.290
the doctor might look at you like,
hey,
you're low in vitamin D.

1743
01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:13.670
You're low in vitamin B 12.
You could use some,
see,
wow.
Yeah.

1744
01:45:13.671 --> 01:45:18.010
Go to someone who's a real,
a real doctor,

1745
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:21.670
an expert in nutrition and expert in vitamins and right.

1746
01:45:21.710 --> 01:45:26.120
And someone who can actually do some blood work on you.
And then from there,

1747
01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:30.440
go to a nutritionist,
get get someone,
you know,
you can get like these,

1748
01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:33.500
there's a bunch of different,
uh,
there's a,
a company that we use,

1749
01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:35.480
I forgot the name of it because we just started using it with her.

1750
01:45:35.690 --> 01:45:37.460
They delivered healthy meals to your house,

1751
01:45:37.461 --> 01:45:40.950
prepackaged to do it two or three times a week and you put them in the

1752
01:45:40.951 --> 01:45:45.620
refrigerator and it's like super healthy organic foods and you premade.

1753
01:45:45.650 --> 01:45:49.750
So you try to eat organic.
I mean,
my wife shops at trader Joe's and you know,

1754
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:54.080
gets tough.
It's,
I guess you know better for me and stuff.

1755
01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:58.890
So it's like you trailed off,
I guess.
Stuff,
whatever.
Well it's,

1756
01:45:58.910 --> 01:46:01.490
you know,
people like food that tastes delicious.

1757
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:05.130
It's that sensation pad for Yummy food.

1758
01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:09.770
Eat a nice fat burger at two o'clock in the morning,
just dripping with oil.

1759
01:46:09.970 --> 01:46:14.120
I'll find out.
Oh,
so glorious though.
Yeah,
it's a problem.

1760
01:46:14.121 --> 01:46:18.590
Is that French fries tastes great now with,
with your diet.
I mean,

1761
01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:22.250
okay.
You know vegetables.
I know,
I know.
You like to eat,
right.

1762
01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:27.260
Do you ever go off that and just go,
I didn't want a burger.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1763
01:46:27.261 --> 01:46:30.830
I believe in cheat days.
I believe in at least cheat meals.

1764
01:46:31.230 --> 01:46:36.130
My friend Mike Dolce calls them reward meals or earned meals.
Yeah.

1765
01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.210
Cause you're taking care of it.
You're treating yourself good.

1766
01:46:38.211 --> 01:46:41.720
For the most part I treat myself good.
And then,
you know,
the thing is though,

1767
01:46:41.721 --> 01:46:45.170
if I do do it and I'll go off and I'll have like some Krispy Kreme donuts,

1768
01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:50.190
I feel,
I feel like such shit.
Oh yeah,
totally

1769
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:52.600
<v 2>worth it.
I've done that before where I,</v>

1770
01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:54.900
I'll have Mcdonald's and just swear it off.

1771
01:46:54.901 --> 01:46:59.070
Like I'll have a big Mac or something and it's like,
I feel so bad.

1772
01:46:59.071 --> 01:47:02.490
It's disgusting and fucking,
I just want to throw up.

1773
01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:04.440
I feel so horrible.

1774
01:47:04.441 --> 01:47:08.550
Like somebody kicked me in the stomach or something and then it's like I make

1775
01:47:08.551 --> 01:47:10.200
myself forget about it and like,
you know,

1776
01:47:10.201 --> 01:47:13.170
four months later I'll have a big Mac again.
It's like,

1777
01:47:13.171 --> 01:47:15.960
why am I eating this every time I say the same thing.

1778
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:19.350
So during the process of eating though,

1779
01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:23.550
that mouth pleasure is pretty undeniable.
Yeah,
definitely.
That's what it is.

1780
01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:27.240
Is the mouth pleasure that,
that you're getting all your yet?

1781
01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:31.410
Let me ask you this.
Um,
one thing I've noticed,
and I don't,

1782
01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:35.430
I think it's because they do some kind of a different oil or something,

1783
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:40.020
but French fries from like Mcdonald's,
Burger King,

1784
01:47:40.030 --> 01:47:45.030
all these type place has this taste and I call it kerosene mixed with dirt or

1785
01:47:46.321 --> 01:47:49.620
something.
This aftertaste is so nasty.

1786
01:47:49.890 --> 01:47:54.420
Amp camp and I don't know why more people aren't speaking about it.
Like,

1787
01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:57.540
do you just eat these fries?
Like they're good or something.

1788
01:47:57.810 --> 01:48:00.900
I'm tasting this taste in my mouth is disgusting.

1789
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:05.970
It's not old school.
Tastes like,
well they can't fuck with in and out,
in and out.

1790
01:48:05.971 --> 01:48:10.520
It's got to go in and out.
It's always perfect.
Those fries are fresh.
They're um,

1791
01:48:10.610 --> 01:48:14.800
uh,
it's privately owned.
You know,
they don't have any freaky oil coming in.

1792
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.480
<v 1>Go off the Diet in and outs.</v>

1793
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:21.360
The best way to do it because you could also get it protein style where you get

1794
01:48:21.361 --> 01:48:23.640
a burger that's just on a lettuce.

1795
01:48:24.130 --> 01:48:25.960
<v 2>Yeah,
I've seen that.
Family,</v>

1796
01:48:25.961 --> 01:48:29.560
God or does stuff that's not on the menu and stuff like that.
Well,

1797
01:48:29.561 --> 01:48:32.080
the protein style is just,
they do let us,

1798
01:48:32.081 --> 01:48:34.630
instead of Bun it put lettuce on the outside.

1799
01:48:34.631 --> 01:48:37.080
They actually have a potato and they put it through.
Now

1800
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.150
<v 1>go watch them do it.
That's bad ass.
Yeah,
it's totally fresh.</v>

1801
01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:43.160
And the fries have a completely different tastes

1802
01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.680
<v 2>because of that.
I've,
I've heard the reason,</v>

1803
01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.550
this thing I'm talking about where the,
the fries have this aftertaste.

1804
01:48:49.551 --> 01:48:54.170
It's nasty is because the FDA or whatever,

1805
01:48:54.171 --> 01:48:55.380
uh,
uh,

1806
01:48:55.390 --> 01:49:00.390
approved some kind of oil they can use and they reuse it and it's okay or

1807
01:49:00.681 --> 01:49:04.220
something.
It causes this aftertaste.

1808
01:49:04.221 --> 01:49:08.930
It's in more than one a franchise.
You,
you know,
so,

1809
01:49:09.230 --> 01:49:12.980
and other people I've spoken with had tasted it as well.

1810
01:49:12.981 --> 01:49:16.340
It's just they don't hate it as much as me.

1811
01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:17.630
<v 1>Well,
I'm sure,</v>

1812
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:22.370
I mean most fast food is cooked in the unhealthiest oil.

1813
01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.610
There was an article,
here's an article that was,
uh,
in,
um,

1814
01:49:26.090 --> 01:49:29.860
on a abc.com and they talking about most French fries served and us the

1815
01:49:29.861 --> 01:49:32.240
restaurants are immersed in corn based oil,

1816
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:37.390
usually considered the worst oil for human health before they're fried corn oil

1817
01:49:37.761 --> 01:49:39.820
contains copious amounts of saturated fat,

1818
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.910
known to contribute to heart disease as type of oil is also low and model

1819
01:49:43.911 --> 01:49:46.790
saturated fat,
which most Americans need more of.

1820
01:49:46.791 --> 01:49:51.760
And in polyunsaturated fat,
which is in two large quantities,

1821
01:49:51.761 --> 01:49:55.660
can lower HDL,
which is your good cholesterol along with Ldl,

1822
01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:57.630
your bad cholesterol.
Oh,

1823
01:49:57.950 --> 01:50:01.730
<v 2>did you hear when that,
um,
uh,
the naked chef or whatever,</v>

1824
01:50:01.731 --> 01:50:05.360
like just tried to boycott Mcdonald's saying he's not,

1825
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:08.330
it's not safe for human consumption.
And the naked chef,

1826
01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:13.850
he's just some one of these chef health shift dude's from England or something.

1827
01:50:13.851 --> 01:50:17.640
He's a pretty young guy.
I thought that was his thing.
It might not make it shot.

1828
01:50:17.690 --> 01:50:19.430
I might have the wrong.
Jamie Oliver,

1829
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:22.770
<v 1>Jamie Oliver's his name.
He calls himself the naked chef.</v>

1830
01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:26.050
<v 2>Yeah.
Okay.
So you know who I'm talking about.
Yeah.
And,
um,</v>

1831
01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:31.410
he was talking about all these ingredients and Mcdonald's that were like really

1832
01:50:31.631 --> 01:50:36.580
bad and not,
not safe for human consumption.
And so they changed a bunch of stuff.

1833
01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.710
<v 1>Well that's great.
He was successful.
Uh,
uh,
that's great.
I mean,
I think that,</v>

1834
01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:45.820
look,
there's a lot of things that people eat that they should be allowed to eat,

1835
01:50:45.821 --> 01:50:47.490
things that are unhealthy.
I mean,

1836
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:50.770
you should be allowed to go to Krispy Kreme donuts when you're going to Krispy

1837
01:50:50.770 --> 01:50:54.520
Kreme donuts.
If you think that it's healthy,
you're a fucking idiot.
All right.

1838
01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:58.930
You know,
I mean,
if you think you're getting one of those cream filled,
delicious,

1839
01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:03.490
sugarcoated monstrosities,
if you think somehow or another that's good for you.

1840
01:51:03.491 --> 01:51:05.230
You're a moron and that's on you.

1841
01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:08.800
You're going there and not go into whole foods and you know,

1842
01:51:08.801 --> 01:51:09.880
getting fresh vegetables.

1843
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.430
But it should be able to exist because you should be able to go and get a donut

1844
01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.180
if you want one.
There's nothing wrong with it.

1845
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:20.440
It's just a matter of managing your health matter of managing the input,

1846
01:51:20.441 --> 01:51:24.100
what's coming in,
what's going out,
what,
what are you doing for exercise?

1847
01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:25.090
What are you doing for health?

1848
01:51:25.091 --> 01:51:28.450
And then if you want on Sunday to throw a fucking ice cream Sundae in the mix,

1849
01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:31.990
why they have over or throw it in there,
I'm going to work it off.

1850
01:51:32.110 --> 01:51:34.180
There's nothing wrong with it.
It's not even working it off.

1851
01:51:34.181 --> 01:51:37.920
It's just a matter of making sure that the balance of your diet is healthy.

1852
01:51:38.170 --> 01:51:41.920
I get that man,
that's cool.
And the clash occasionally throw in some not,

1853
01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:45.280
but you could also make healthy choices as far as like what you throw in.

1854
01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:49.030
You know,
you could throw in some better stuff.
You can throw in some,
you know,

1855
01:51:49.031 --> 01:51:53.350
there's some terrible things for you and then some things might not be the best

1856
01:51:53.351 --> 01:51:56.270
thing in the world for you.
Like pizza with vegetables on it.

1857
01:51:56.300 --> 01:51:57.850
I might not be the worst thing in the world for you,

1858
01:51:58.330 --> 01:52:01.460
but it's not the best thing in the world for you.
Probably because of the,
uh,

1859
01:52:01.570 --> 01:52:04.990
with the oil and the grease.
And so it's a little of that.
But really,

1860
01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:07.450
as long as they use olive oil,
it's actually probably good for you.

1861
01:52:07.451 --> 01:52:10.780
The real thing is the bread.
The dough.
We cook with olive oil.

1862
01:52:10.781 --> 01:52:15.370
So at least it was great for olive oil is fantastic for the body.
You know,

1863
01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:18.460
there's a,
there's a lot of oils that are healthy,
you know,
fish oils.

1864
01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:22.360
Great for you.
There's a lot of oils that are,
coconut oil's very good for you,

1865
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:26.590
you know,
raw coconut oil specialty.
It's fantastic for you.
This just,

1866
01:52:26.591 --> 01:52:31.150
it's just hard to really educate yourself on what's good and what's bad.

1867
01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:34.780
That's why like if you're thinking about doing it and I know you've got some

1868
01:52:34.781 --> 01:52:37.180
money,
go to a nutritionist man,
get somebody.
Yeah,
yeah.

1869
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:39.850
<v 2>Doctor [inaudible] you know,
I mean I've,</v>

1870
01:52:40.450 --> 01:52:44.020
I told myself this year I'm really going to get into in just some fitness and

1871
01:52:44.021 --> 01:52:46.910
I've been doing tons of sit ups everyday.
I've been,
you know,

1872
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:50.770
working with lightweights,
visit.
I'm kind of,
if I was in,

1873
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:54.380
if I was a hardcore addict,
I would be at the point we're at now,

1874
01:52:54.381 --> 01:52:56.880
we're one foot's in the door and when it is out.

1875
01:52:58.370 --> 01:53:01.130
So I got to get serious.
I mean,
I really want to,

1876
01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.430
I don't care if I get in a bootcamp,
do something,

1877
01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.840
but I want to eat right and do all this stuff.
You know what I mean?

1878
01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:08.180
Why don't you try yoga?
I just feel like amazing.
You know,

1879
01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:12.160
I have done a little bit,
I practice some yoga just on that,

1880
01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:15.680
on a video,
like watching this chicken,
just doing stuff you're doing,

1881
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:20.000
it's really makes you feel good.
Uh,
the stretching,
it's like really cool.

1882
01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:24.020
I was doing stuff for my lower back and it was like,
awesome.
I'm going,
whoa.

1883
01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:29.420
It's like it,
it hurts in kind of a,
you know,

1884
01:53:29.421 --> 01:53:32.750
you feel this,
this strain of the stretch,

1885
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:37.100
but after you're done with it,
you'd feel the so much relief in your body.

1886
01:53:37.101 --> 01:53:39.320
I release the release is so,

1887
01:53:39.710 --> 01:53:42.530
it's so worth the pain for that release feeling.
You know,

1888
01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:47.660
<v 3>the world would be a far better place if people just committed to doing yoga a</v>

1889
01:53:48.061 --> 01:53:51.780
certain amount of days per week.
If the majority of people in this country,

1890
01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:54.510
just the majority of people listening,

1891
01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:57.150
does decided I'm going to do yoga three days a week.

1892
01:53:57.390 --> 01:54:00.270
The world would be a better place.
People would be more relaxed,

1893
01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:04.110
they'd have a better perspective.
They'd be more in the moment.
Better balance.

1894
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:05.760
I mean,
there's a reason why he's skinny.

1895
01:54:05.761 --> 01:54:09.370
Indian dudes been doing the same poses for thousands of years.
This,

1896
01:54:09.450 --> 01:54:12.410
there's something to it.
It's,
it's hard stretching.

1897
01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:17.620
I was been told by the guy that done acupuncture from me a couple times.

1898
01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:19.193
He goes,
mark,

1899
01:54:19.330 --> 01:54:24.010
<v 2>you need to move.
You need to stretch.
You need to walk.
You need to do something.</v>

1900
01:54:24.011 --> 01:54:28.870
You're getting older and movement is so important for you.
It's huge.
Yeah,

1901
01:54:28.871 --> 01:54:29.704
you can,

1902
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:33.790
if you're lazy in the sense of just being a couch person that just kind of

1903
01:54:33.791 --> 01:54:38.680
doesn't have a lot of movement to your lives,
that's really bad tension.

1904
01:54:38.681 --> 01:54:41.890
So I like to stretch a lot.
I don't even jump out of bed.

1905
01:54:41.891 --> 01:54:46.140
I don't even take chances like that.
Like this,
take chances with my bat.

1906
01:54:46.150 --> 01:54:49.480
My back's kind of,
it's a,
it's a little bit torch.
I have to like,

1907
01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:50.830
I do a lot of stretches

1908
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:55.390
<v 3>stuff.
And uh,
is it from a,
an injury or just from carrying a guitar?</v>

1909
01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:57.830
Probably a little,
a little of that,
you know,

1910
01:54:57.831 --> 01:55:01.120
jumping around the stage for 30 years,
you know,
I'm sure that's no help.

1911
01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:05.930
When you play,
do you look down like a lot of planning now?

1912
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:09.170
No.
Cause you pay all closing my eyes most of the time.

1913
01:55:09.171 --> 01:55:13.090
Actually finding your posture like maybe not.

1914
01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:18.170
Probably not the greatest.
I'm,
my back's not really horrible.
It's just um,

1915
01:55:18.230 --> 01:55:22.440
sometimes it goes out a little bit or you know,
I just have it.

1916
01:55:22.450 --> 01:55:26.570
I met some really some of the worst pain in my back and neck from reading or

1917
01:55:26.571 --> 01:55:30.020
from a writing from sitting down and this,

1918
01:55:30.021 --> 01:55:33.490
this pose where you're like staring at a keyboard like the,

1919
01:55:33.491 --> 01:55:36.770
the neck forward that the headphone pose is very bad.

1920
01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:42.420
<v 2>Same goes to the whole balancing for me is how things happened in my back.</v>

1921
01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:48.380
I can be making a sandwich and something could go on my back.

1922
01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:53.130
I see never from lifting.
I could lift all day and I'm fine.
You know,

1923
01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:55.410
he's always doing something,
some stupid thing,

1924
01:55:55.411 --> 01:55:58.770
but it's a balance thing or something.
Yoga,

1925
01:55:59.190 --> 01:56:03.870
get into it mark.
Okay,
buddy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tell me where you live.

1926
01:56:03.871 --> 01:56:06.300
Well after the show,
tell me where you live.
Don't say it on the air.
Okay,

1927
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:09.920
well fuck your house.
You know,
I wanted to kind of mention,
um,

1928
01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:13.050
our website because when you go there,

1929
01:56:13.051 --> 01:56:15.240
you can find out if we're playing in your area.

1930
01:56:15.241 --> 01:56:20.200
It's called the official great white.com and we're playing in Hollywood,
man,
Eh,

1931
01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:21.610
this Sunday.
Oh cool.

1932
01:56:21.611 --> 01:56:25.560
We're playing in West Virginia on Saturday and on Sunday we're playing to

1933
01:56:25.561 --> 01:56:30.561
celebrate the rainbow bar and grill 42nd anniversary.

1934
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:34.100
And we're headlining.
This place is legendary.
I mean,
you're,

1935
01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:38.250
the stones have hung out there.
I mean,
you know,
um,
uh,
just,

1936
01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:41.940
just every,
let me kill my sister from Motorhead.

1937
01:56:41.941 --> 01:56:44.250
Is there everyday like playing video games or something,

1938
01:56:44.251 --> 01:56:49.251
but it has so much history behind this place that I'm really happy to be,

1939
01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:55.680
you know,
headlining the event to celebrate it because it's,
uh,

1940
01:56:56.460 --> 01:57:01.440
you know,
for people who don't know,
it really is an icon.
It's a Brock.

1941
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:05.910
It's like every band,
even if they played the forum,
you know,

1942
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:10.910
they would go to the rainbow,
which is such a known legendary place,
you know,
um,

1943
01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:12.420
what,
where are you playing?

1944
01:57:12.421 --> 01:57:15.510
Are you at the rig doing it and the parking lot in the back.

1945
01:57:15.511 --> 01:57:19.710
And you can actually,
they're allowing people to drink alcohol for,
you know,

1946
01:57:19.711 --> 01:57:24.390
you can't do this unless this is happening.
So,
you know,
so they're allowing a,

1947
01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:26.040
it starts at two o'clock.

1948
01:57:26.041 --> 01:57:30.240
They're having a lot of bands that were from back,

1949
01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:33.780
you know,
even some that haven't made it huge or whatever,
you know,

1950
01:57:33.781 --> 01:57:38.550
but just like that played,
you know,
the club scene or whatever.
I mean,

1951
01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:42.970
they have a couple that,
you know,
like the bullet boys and,
and uh,
uh,

1952
01:57:43.050 --> 01:57:47.970
Tracie guns from,
um,
uh,
La guns or whatever.

1953
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:51.900
But,
um,
you know,
there's a lot of local bands playing during the day and stuff.

1954
01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:54.360
And,
um,
you know,

1955
01:57:54.361 --> 01:57:58.020
we're playing West Virginia and the night before in an arena with some band,
but,

1956
01:57:58.050 --> 01:58:00.600
um,
we've got an early flight that day.

1957
01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:04.080
We're just going to jam out and celebrate with these guys.
Wow.

1958
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:07.440
That sounds awesome.
That sounds really cool.
Yeah.
That is a real iconic place.

1959
01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:11.400
And,
uh,
the food's pretty good there.
And 42nd anniversary,
if you go there,

1960
01:58:11.401 --> 01:58:14.580
there's going to be chicks going there.
It's all free.
It's an error.

1961
01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:18.600
It's a 42 years ago.
Oh yeah.
Show up

1962
01:58:20.130 --> 01:58:24.240
free.
That's cool.
Yeah,
it's,
it's three because it,
it's just a celebration,

1963
01:58:24.241 --> 01:58:25.074
you know.
Um,

1964
01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:29.460
Sam Kinison brought up the rainbow bar and grill in his fucking HBO special.

1965
01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:33.870
Every,
everybody's been there.
It's a,
it was just kind of a known,
you know,

1966
01:58:33.871 --> 01:58:37.170
kind of known.
I liked the whole Hollywood history.
I mean,

1967
01:58:37.890 --> 01:58:40.900
when our band was playing Hollywood a,

1968
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:46.230
I have so many good memories from that time because it was the,

1969
01:58:47.590 --> 01:58:52.510
the music and the scene was so electric.
It W it was,
uh,
you know,

1970
01:58:52.511 --> 01:58:52.960
I mean,

1971
01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:57.790
I played [inaudible] once and the guy painted a picture of me playing my guitar

1972
01:58:57.791 --> 01:59:02.791
and the sign the building next to like Youi Lewis and the news and Jim Morrison

1973
01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:05.290
and Eddie van Halen.
I,
I mean,

1974
01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:09.010
I have so many memories of just not even playing.

1975
01:59:09.011 --> 01:59:11.980
They're just going to Hollywood.
I used to go watch bands.

1976
01:59:11.981 --> 01:59:16.690
I used to go watch van Halen play.
I used to go just hang out,
you know,

1977
01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:17.670
and uh,

1978
01:59:17.670 --> 01:59:22.440
<v 3>that's sort of half the fun of the rainbow is just being there and seeing all</v>

1979
01:59:22.441 --> 01:59:26.220
the freaks and all the cool people and all the,
you know,
the people like,
oh,

1980
01:59:26.221 --> 01:59:28.320
there's that guy,
there's Lemmy from Motorhead,

1981
01:59:28.321 --> 01:59:30.500
there's all these strange characters,

1982
01:59:30.890 --> 01:59:34.260
walkers and all these people that had been around Hollywood forever.

1983
01:59:34.290 --> 01:59:39.120
<v 2>I don't really know why,
you know,
uh,
it's just how,
you know,</v>

1984
01:59:39.121 --> 01:59:42.660
it's right next to the Roxy.
It's just,
um,
it's just one of those spots.

1985
01:59:42.661 --> 01:59:45.270
It's one of those spots or people just get a good vibe there or something.

1986
01:59:45.271 --> 01:59:46.680
And you know,
that this trip is just,

1987
01:59:46.681 --> 01:59:50.990
the sunsets trip is just one of the all time classic spots in Americana.
I mean,

1988
01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:55.260
just really is where the comedy story is.
The viper room is,
it's incredible.

1989
01:59:55.261 --> 01:59:59.850
And in Whiskey,
the history of going back to even like days of the doors.
I mean,

1990
01:59:59.890 --> 02:00:01.530
er,
you know,

1991
02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:05.760
just to know that they played the troubadour or even,
uh,

1992
02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:10.500
you know,
uh,
early days with like Linda Ronstadt,

1993
02:00:10.501 --> 02:00:15.050
her backup band was like Don Henley and Glen Fry,

1994
02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:15.933
you know,

1995
02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:19.070
that was her backup pen and they went off and made the eagles or whatever,

1996
02:00:19.071 --> 02:00:23.520
you know.
So yeah,
it's to nuts,
you know,
the,
the history,

1997
02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:29.100
it goes way beyond,
um,
the,
the 70s in the 80s,

1998
02:00:29.101 --> 02:00:33.420
it's like,
goes back in the 60s and you know,
I mean,

1999
02:00:33.421 --> 02:00:37.230
you've got the doors,
look at how big that band did.
You know,
they're,

2000
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:40.320
they're the type down like that.

2001
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:44.370
You don't think of them doing regular guy stuff.

2002
02:00:44.371 --> 02:00:46.800
Like they're there to me,
you know,
you know,

2003
02:00:46.801 --> 02:00:51.440
when you're a kid and you think of a band and
like,

2004
02:00:51.790 --> 02:00:54.170
I know they don't drive through Mcdonald's like we do.

2005
02:00:55.450 --> 02:00:59.050
It's like they're almost alien there so that,
you know what I mean?

2006
02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:03.590
<v 3>Why isn't that the mystique of that been sort of a road by the Internet.</v>

2007
02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:07.670
Like there was a thing the other day were Charlie Sheen was a having a Twitter

2008
02:01:07.671 --> 02:01:11.750
beef with his ex wife and it was,
that's ridiculous.
Ridiculous.

2009
02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:16.100
But it was the,
that's been that,
that,
that sort of thing.

2010
02:01:16.101 --> 02:01:18.740
It's different now.
It's like it is different.
It used to be the one,

2011
02:01:18.741 --> 02:01:23.380
the guy was a big star that they would be sort of living up on a house and

2012
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:26.030
behind these crazy games.

2013
02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:31.960
<v 2>Now you play a show here on the Internet.
You're literally in two minutes.</v>

2014
02:01:32.530 --> 02:01:37.110
People are watching or show a,
you know the show you're playing in France.

2015
02:01:37.111 --> 02:01:40.880
They're watching it in La and just got done with the show like two minutes ago.

2016
02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:43.750
<v 1>Well,
and then they get to read your Twitter page kit,</v>

2017
02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:49.200
<v 2>get a kid.
It would literally be this much of an event.</v>

2018
02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:53.310
It would last all day.
I'd go buy like Robin Trowers record,

2019
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:57.310
go to my friends,
you know,
we'd set up everything,
man.

2020
02:01:57.311 --> 02:02:01.980
I get to speakers outside the window and listened to this album over and over

2021
02:02:01.981 --> 02:02:02.814
and over.

2022
02:02:03.090 --> 02:02:08.090
Now kids download 300 songs in 20 minutes before they go to school or in their

2023
02:02:09.481 --> 02:02:11.730
iPod or whatever.
It's just not,

2024
02:02:11.970 --> 02:02:16.200
it's not as personal as it used to be.
You know,

2025
02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:20.280
like it's more accessible.
It's more accessible.
It's uh,

2026
02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:23.530
you know,
I,
I ran,
I was in Conrad,

2027
02:02:23.550 --> 02:02:28.470
the article with David Girl or whatever from foo fighters.

2028
02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:28.841
Yeah.

2029
02:02:28.841 --> 02:02:33.841
If we fight everybody in Nirvana and he makes so much sense to me because I went

2030
02:02:34.921 --> 02:02:37.950
through all these things that he's talking about what just playing with guys

2031
02:02:37.951 --> 02:02:42.000
that don't really play that good and we're jamming in the garage and you know,

2032
02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:44.670
pissing off of my parents and you know,

2033
02:02:45.090 --> 02:02:48.120
and just going through that and improving from there and just getting better,

2034
02:02:48.121 --> 02:02:49.140
you know,
whatever.

2035
02:02:49.141 --> 02:02:53.880
Instead of people just thrown together with the songs written by somebody else

2036
02:02:53.881 --> 02:02:56.970
and all that,
you know,
it just,
the,

2037
02:02:57.660 --> 02:03:00.780
some of the human element has been,

2038
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:04.860
that's my only complaint and it's not really a complaint.
It's just,

2039
02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:10.800
I just prefer that people play music and not machines.

2040
02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:14.190
<v 1>You know what I mean?
I know what you're saying.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

2041
02:03:14.191 --> 02:03:17.280
there's also the experience of going to the record store and looking at the

2042
02:03:17.281 --> 02:03:20.040
album art and take it home.
And I love that.

2043
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:21.930
There's definitely something missing in my driving

2044
02:03:22.150 --> 02:03:26.680
<v 2>200 miles or 150 miles to do a photo shoot when I'm going to be the size of an</v>

2045
02:03:26.681 --> 02:03:31.330
ant on,
on,
you know,
microchip.
Yeah.

2046
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:34.450
But or whatever.
But you know,
it's not really complaining.

2047
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:39.340
My whole thing is I just want to get our music to the people the best way I can.

2048
02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:43.960
And I,
if you know your way around the Internet,
you can,
you can get that done.

2049
02:03:43.961 --> 02:03:47.640
And we just got done up this big monster cruise and you know,

2050
02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:52.680
30 bands on this big ship and we went and played on an island and you know,

2051
02:03:52.781 --> 02:03:57.130
it was like a,
it was great.
You know,
so I'm,

2052
02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:00.340
you know,
I'm not bitter or anything.
I know things are different.

2053
02:04:00.341 --> 02:04:03.910
It's a really difficult on major labels,
you know,

2054
02:04:03.911 --> 02:04:07.730
because we can go record our next Elmo,

2055
02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:09.130
your house and your computer.

2056
02:04:09.310 --> 02:04:13.330
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
that puts a lot of power in the artist's hands though.</v>

2057
02:04:13.331 --> 02:04:18.250
And it also puts a lot of power in their ability to promote themselves.

2058
02:04:18.490 --> 02:04:20.410
All they need is the Internet now.
Exactly.

2059
02:04:20.411 --> 02:04:22.930
When all of those other closed off avenue was like,

2060
02:04:22.931 --> 02:04:27.280
we were talking about getting on the Ed Sullivan show was everything to a guy

2061
02:04:27.281 --> 02:04:29.800
like Rodney Dangerfield.
He couldn't get on the Ed Sullivan show.

2062
02:04:29.801 --> 02:04:33.730
You were fucked today for a comic,
especially,
boy,

2063
02:04:33.790 --> 02:04:37.740
you don't need that at all.
I mean,
my friends who have become from the Internet,

2064
02:04:37.741 --> 02:04:38.640
like Joey Diaz

2065
02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:41.730
<v 3>and Ari's fear and doc and Trostle,
they've only had the internet.</v>

2066
02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:44.430
The Internet is all they ever need it,
but all they had a neat,

2067
02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:47.540
all they needed was talent and an avenue in my days,

2068
02:04:47.970 --> 02:04:52.560
<v 2>staple gun and the posters and sunset boulevard</v>

2069
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:54.200
<v 3>to get people to come out.</v>

2070
02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:58.660
And then they had to see the poster will be excited by it.
Like,
hmm.

2071
02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:03.500
That comes by and they put it over ours.
Oh yeah,
you gotta go.
It was class.

2072
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:09.170
The wars of posters.
It's still the wars.
Yeah.
Well there's Internet wars now.

2073
02:05:09.230 --> 02:05:11.120
You know,
there's,
there's definitely a lot of that.

2074
02:05:11.121 --> 02:05:13.880
There's still a lot of fucking morons out there when it comes to that kind of

2075
02:05:13.881 --> 02:05:15.440
stuff.
But,
but uh,

2076
02:05:15.441 --> 02:05:18.770
I think it's definitely a better time as far as putting the power in the hands

2077
02:05:18.771 --> 02:05:23.771
of the artists and these people that are the normal cabal that we're controlling

2078
02:05:23.991 --> 02:05:26.920
the music industry.
They've or they've lost a lot of their power,
right?

2079
02:05:27.110 --> 02:05:28.740
<v 2>Oh yeah.
And you know,</v>

2080
02:05:28.741 --> 02:05:33.360
the difference now is we don't need millions of dollars to,

2081
02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:37.800
to record and,
and all that kind of promotion.

2082
02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:42.690
And that's why that they're,
the major labels are suffering a bit.
And yeah,

2083
02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:47.550
where the power comes in is we're no,

2084
02:05:47.850 --> 02:05:52.740
no longer are we just getting our little points,

2085
02:05:52.741 --> 02:05:54.660
you know,
where they're taking,
you know,

2086
02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:58.530
we make $1 million and the record company gets,
you know,

2087
02:05:58.531 --> 02:06:02.580
900 and whatever.
And you know,

2088
02:06:02.581 --> 02:06:06.930
they throw our crumbs enough crumbs to where we don't like go away.
But you know,

2089
02:06:07.110 --> 02:06:10.410
<v 3>but people don't realize that for most folks they thought they'd have no idea.</v>

2090
02:06:10.411 --> 02:06:14.220
Like how bad the deals were at span.
Haylage Dale was

2091
02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:17.980
<v 2>amazingly bad and they even speak about it on the Internet.</v>

2092
02:06:17.981 --> 02:06:21.760
You can go on and they're sit together and they were actually interviewing each

2093
02:06:21.761 --> 02:06:25.690
other about the old days.
You know,
people think we're the bitching rock stars,

2094
02:06:25.691 --> 02:06:29.740
but we are,
we were literally broke there.
They said that their checks per week,

2095
02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:34.950
this is during the first album where $88 and 83 cents or something and they were

2096
02:06:35.531 --> 02:06:39.610
selling millions of,
okay,
here's the funny part.

2097
02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:42.880
They got off this tour and,

2098
02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:46.960
and the record company said you owe us $2 million.
And he goes,
okay,

2099
02:06:46.961 --> 02:06:47.980
let me get this straight.

2100
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:53.050
So if we do 10 tours and sell 20 million records,

2101
02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:56.090
we're going to owe you $20 million.

2102
02:06:58.650 --> 02:07:02.440
It's just from all the loans and the,
you know,
the first coming out of the gate.

2103
02:07:02.441 --> 02:07:07.120
But um,
well it's also just a corrupt system that has too much power.

2104
02:07:07.150 --> 02:07:09.310
It's corrupt and you know,

2105
02:07:09.370 --> 02:07:13.140
the being the artist when you don't have your own representation and,

2106
02:07:13.141 --> 02:07:18.100
and you know,
you just want to do anything to break out of this club scene.

2107
02:07:18.101 --> 02:07:22.290
You know,
you want to be a big band on big tours and so you,

2108
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:25.750
they take bad deals.
You know,
a lot of,
a lot of bands have done that.
You know,

2109
02:07:25.751 --> 02:07:28.720
they've done successful with their album sales,

2110
02:07:28.721 --> 02:07:31.250
but their business side of is really horrid.

2111
02:07:32.110 --> 02:07:36.370
<v 3>Yeah.
That's also the difference between a business person and an artist.</v>

2112
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:39.730
Like a lot of artists are impulsive and they're just not that good at things

2113
02:07:39.731 --> 02:07:43.370
like that.
They're not that good at business.
And I'm one of them,
you know,

2114
02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:44.990
our deal wasn't great either.
Yeah,

2115
02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:46.900
<v 5>no,
but</v>

2116
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:50.210
<v 2>we've kind of made up for,
that was in our whole career,</v>

2117
02:07:50.211 --> 02:07:52.070
but at the beginning it wasn't that great.
But

2118
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:54.430
<v 3>well it Santa,
it always starts off.
Nobody ever says,
oh,</v>

2119
02:07:54.431 --> 02:07:56.260
we've got an awesome deal right out of the gate.

2120
02:07:56.261 --> 02:07:59.890
And we're very fortunate to have an ethical record company right now,
which is,

2121
02:07:59.891 --> 02:08:03.250
you talk about the fucking scoundrels that signed you.
But I mean that's also,

2122
02:08:03.490 --> 02:08:06.580
you think about a music company.
How many people did they sign?

2123
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:10.660
They might sign 101 of them might become great white.
You know,
there's,

2124
02:08:10.661 --> 02:08:15.661
there's a lot of failure involved on their end to prognostication fell down.

2125
02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:20.170
That's what they call the write offs.
You know,
the write up bands,
but yeah.
Yeah.

2126
02:08:20.171 --> 02:08:24.340
But for a band that successful,
the,
the,
the reality behind it.

2127
02:08:24.341 --> 02:08:27.080
Did you ever read that piece that Courtney love wrote on the,
um,

2128
02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:28.180
the music business?

2129
02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:32.830
She wrote a pretty incredible piece about explaining the expenses and how much

2130
02:08:32.831 --> 02:08:36.460
it actually costs and what had artists actually gets paid and how much the

2131
02:08:36.461 --> 02:08:41.380
studio gets paid and how they go about saying how much things are worth.

2132
02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:42.850
I haven't read the piece,

2133
02:08:42.851 --> 02:08:45.880
but I'm glad she wrote something like that because it was school,

2134
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:49.390
the audience and you know,
yeah.
It's a product that's not their business.

2135
02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:52.390
Pretty incredible stuff getting,
yeah.
Well there's a little bit of that,

2136
02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:55.510
but it's also the educational

2137
02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:57.930
<v 2>people will understand that,
you know,</v>

2138
02:08:57.931 --> 02:09:02.100
we work really hard and we're not just walking around,
you know,
a zillionaire.

2139
02:09:02.101 --> 02:09:02.450
Yeah.

2140
02:09:02.450 --> 02:09:05.430
<v 3>Were you bummed out when the whole Napster thing came along and people started</v>

2141
02:09:05.431 --> 02:09:09.450
downloading MP three s and it just almost immediately sort of took the wind out

2142
02:09:09.451 --> 02:09:11.100
of the sails of a records?

2143
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:12.703
<v 5>MMM.</v>

2144
02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:16.240
<v 2>You know,
I was bummed out even before that a little bit.</v>

2145
02:09:16.290 --> 02:09:19.590
<v 5>But you know,
I know</v>

2146
02:09:19.670 --> 02:09:21.310
<v 2>me,
like I were talking about earlier,</v>

2147
02:09:21.311 --> 02:09:25.160
that I'm a fan of music and I like to support the artists.

2148
02:09:25.210 --> 02:09:28.660
I go out and buy their albums.
You know,
I want the artwork,

2149
02:09:28.690 --> 02:09:30.280
I want to know who wrote the songs.

2150
02:09:30.281 --> 02:09:34.110
I want to know where they recorded this album.
I,
you know,
I,

2151
02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:38.620
I just think that's part of it and it's what makes the world go round in music

2152
02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:40.540
is to support the artists.

2153
02:09:40.541 --> 02:09:44.140
So I go out and buy a Zz top CD and you know,

2154
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:47.820
but when somebody comes up and go,
hey man,
I just got your new album,

2155
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:51.400
I copied it from my friend.
It's like,
well thanks.
You know,

2156
02:09:51.401 --> 02:09:55.410
at least he's going to maybe give me some feedback and if he likes it or not or

2157
02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:59.940
hopefully he'll go see a live,
you know,
live or whatever.
But yeah.
Um,

2158
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:01.630
I dunno man.

2159
02:10:03.670 --> 02:10:06.700
<v 3>It is what,
I'm not going to say that that for it is what it is,</v>

2160
02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:10.840
but it is what it is.
I mean,
we were changing,
the world is changing around us.

2161
02:10:10.841 --> 02:10:13.930
Technology is forcing us to change and we have to adapt.

2162
02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:16.210
But the most important thing is you're still creating,

2163
02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:18.190
you're still doing what you love,
you still doing what he's doing.

2164
02:10:18.370 --> 02:10:22.270
And then the commerce aspect of it has to morph and has to morph to accommodate

2165
02:10:22.271 --> 02:10:24.010
this new environment that we live in.

2166
02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:26.860
But the environment is so beneficial in so many other ways.
It's just,

2167
02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:29.710
it just is what it is.
It has to change.

2168
02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:34.070
There's no way you're not going to have the world change

2169
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:38.020
<v 1>when something like the Internet comes along.
So all of these other way.
But the,</v>

2170
02:10:38.090 --> 02:10:42.200
I think the benefits way outweigh the negatives in my opinion.

2171
02:10:42.250 --> 02:10:44.560
<v 2>Definitely.
And our fans are loyal to,</v>

2172
02:10:44.561 --> 02:10:49.360
I mean we go over to Sweden or you know,
uh,

2173
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:53.890
Switzerland or whatever and they're all there in front of the stage,
you know,
so,

2174
02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:57.280
so we,
we are blessed in that way.
I mean,
you know,

2175
02:10:57.281 --> 02:11:00.900
no matter what happens in the industry,
our fans have always hung,
you know,

2176
02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:04.540
so it's like,
you know,
well that's cause you guys appreciate it.

2177
02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:07.270
I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.
We are grateful for our fans.

2178
02:11:07.271 --> 02:11:11.200
And I always tell them that.
And you know,
in the,

2179
02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:15.460
in the days when we were playing arenas every night it's very difficult,

2180
02:11:15.461 --> 02:11:18.220
you know,
that the constructed meet and greets,

2181
02:11:18.221 --> 02:11:21.940
we can only meet a few and you really can't go out and say,
hey,
you know,

2182
02:11:21.941 --> 02:11:26.140
invite 20,000 people back stitching to pay for the party,
you know.

2183
02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:31.690
But we've really taken advantage of,
of being able to hear their stories.
Man.

2184
02:11:31.691 --> 02:11:36.550
I mean I'm talking like stories that I don't remember.
I mean,
you know,

2185
02:11:36.610 --> 02:11:41.320
people doing my laundry and it gave me a ride here or you know,

2186
02:11:41.321 --> 02:11:46.240
they were in this certain place or this guy got married to this song or you
know,

2187
02:11:46.810 --> 02:11:51.220
uh,
it got laid because you know that your song,
this one or you know what I mean?

2188
02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:52.910
It just,
the stories are endless.
And,

2189
02:11:52.911 --> 02:11:56.070
and how you personally affected these pieces?

2190
02:11:57.640 --> 02:11:59.340
If our music is involved,

2191
02:11:59.341 --> 02:12:03.310
the people's life on like that because I have a can,

2192
02:12:03.311 --> 02:12:05.800
I can relay it because like I was saying earlier,

2193
02:12:05.801 --> 02:12:09.370
I literally have visuals when I hear certain songs,
you know,

2194
02:12:09.371 --> 02:12:13.750
like I remember where I was,
how old I was,
what I was doing,

2195
02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:19.240
you know,
almost like the smell that was in the air practically.
You know.

2196
02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:23.800
And so when people come up and have a similar story about music that,

2197
