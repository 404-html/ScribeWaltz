00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:43.024
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

117
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 1>so the get the oil,</v>

118
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.380
<v Speaker 1>what they would do is they would go to the sewer,</v>

119
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.150
<v Speaker 1>they would take raw sewage out of the sewer and then boil it down.</v>

120
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.250
<v Speaker 1>The way they'd make wax hash wax,</v>

121
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.610
<v Speaker 1>they'd boil off the sewage and whatever was left.</v>

122
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>That's cooking oil that they would use.</v>

123
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>It's super fucking harmful.</v>

124
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>And then sell to like a lot of the street noodle guys.</v>

125
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>That face is what I made that same face.</v>

127
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>They were cooking with sewer oil,</v>

128
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.004
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

129
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>It was going around.</v>

130
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's not common,</v>

131
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 1>but it was possible.</v>

132
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like that's the only way they do it.</v>

133
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.531
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

134
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>but the street places where like you run a risk here,</v>

135
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>it's cheaper oil.</v>

136
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.921
<v Speaker 1>All mine.</v>

137

146
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Delighted by what she finds,</v>

147
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.390
<v Speaker 3>what's how others might view as revolting.</v>
