1
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.180
Fly.
We're ready.
Damn.
That was quick.

2
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.200
Jesus little wheezes.

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.750
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you.
I said my name,
fuck.

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.890
This episode of the podcast is brought to you by ting.

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.240
Ting is a mobile cell phone company.

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.860
I shouldn't say mobile shouldn't say carphone either.
Don't say that.

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.550
People know you're over.
40 thing is a cell phone company,

8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.690
I guess you'd call it a cell phone comedy that does things differently.

9
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.910
And what they do is they,
they,

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.260
they use the sprint backbone and they do everything their way.
No contracts,

11
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.090
no early termination fees.

12
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.570
They sell you the phone instead of this bullshit when you,

13
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.080
if you buy a phone from a regular provider,
not a regular provider,

14
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.010
but one of the big ones,

15
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.920
what you're doing is you're not really buying the phone for the most part.

16
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.860
What you're doing is you're paying for some of the phone upfront.

17
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.400
Like the phone only costs 200 bucks with,
uh,
you know,
with a contract,

18
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.010
the phone is really like 600 bucks.

19
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.420
But they trick you into getting in debt with them and then when you want to

20
00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:06.800
leave they go,

21
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:11.690
oh well you can't leave unless you give us this early termination fee.
You,

22
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.040
they fuck you.
They,
they make you pay.
Got Down at,
they take your money.

23
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.963
Bert Kreischer

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.780
<v 2>is that what they're doing with the cell phones?
Yes.
Do you not understand this?</v>

25
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.570
I fuck.
I've been so out of the cell phone game for so long.

26
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.920
How do you get out of cell phone?
My wife does it all.
That's nice.

27
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.240
But she'll be like,
yeah,
you're available for an upgrade.
You can get a new phone.

28
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:33.710
You just pass it off to her.
Oh Dude.
She's like a great lab partner.
That's great.

29
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.420
Cheat off her homework to help.
She helps me on the tests but I,

30
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.900
but I'm the cool guy on the table.

31
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:41.480
So all the other lab partners like think art table must be fun.

32
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.250
Don't you earn the money though?
That's what I,

33
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:46.430
that's the part I do and I make us friends with people.

34
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.790
Like my wife will meet the people,
but I'm the closer on the franchise player.

35
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.330
<v 1>There you go.
Um,
98% of people would save money with tank.</v>

36
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.370
The way Tim handles it,
you don't pay like a certain set amount per month either.

37
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.390
And I think in the future is good to be with all cell phone companies are going

38
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:03.500
to be forced to do.
I remember back in the day

39
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.660
<v 2>when cell phone companies,
they used to uh,
they used to charge,</v>

40
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.290
you have your roaming and you could roam by just driving your fucking friends

41
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:14.700
house by the lutes in Tampa.
If you went to my house,
you were fucking roaming.

42
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.630
Isn't that crazy?
And you'd see the thing on the top of your phone.
Ah Shit,

43
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:22.830
I'm roaming
and it wasn't far.

44
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.850
And you know,

45
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.780
it also used to be that long distance would cost you a fuck load of money.

46
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.930
If you would call someone in New York,
it would cost you a fuck load of money.

47
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.840
All that stuff is gone now it's gone.

48
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:37.510
Long distance on your phone is gone and your cell phone's gone.
It's all gone.

49
00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:40.230
And the reason why it's gone is because it's a good reason.

50
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:43.880
It's because of competition and competition is also causing a

51
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.620
<v 1>company like tink to show up and when Tim does is they sell you the very best</v>

They got Samsung Galaxy s five the LG flex,

56

rate.

caffeine,
any like speedy type feeling.

73
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.530
It's all based on the court accepts mushrooms.
It's really fascinating stuff.

74
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.590
Quarter sips sinensis thousands of years of use by people.

75
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.230
Not really smarter than you,
but they knew more shit about mushrooms,

76
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.280
<v 3>the five HTP and the new mood actually.</v>

77
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.410
Like if you get obsessive compulsive about stuff,

78
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.950
it will dial that shit back 100% really?
Oh yes.

79
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.300
Well I'll get into like little spirals sometimes.
So for you it does that for me.

80
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.620
100% if you take new mood and I'm not even fucking around,

81
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.813
I think it,
I,

82
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.480
I can a market difference when you get obsessive about something and you can't

83
00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:45.330
let it go,
that's weird.
So don't think that you're obsessive.

84
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:49.410
Thing is like a mental,
like a chemical thing,
you know?
Yeah.
Oh completely.

85
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.220
I think,

86
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.120
I think what I do is I steal all my dopamine at night for my body and then

87
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:57.090
during the day my body's going like Jones and for it like,

88
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.300
and then so what it does to get rid of it is just makes me think about one

89
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:02.820
thought over and over and over again.
Like we're like a bad thought.

90
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.650
Do you ever try to do something about that other than take new mood?
Uh,
yeah.

91
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.320
Yeah.
It's,
it's hard to get out of men.

92
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.320
I'll tell you a story when we get done this had about when I thought I had

93
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:17.700
genital warts.
Oh Jesus.
Let's get it.
That was the first time I dealt with this.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.580

<v 2>It's just me and Bert and Jamie.</v>

110
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.550
Even though I told motherfucking Brian to be here on time,

111
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.460
I call him at 11 o'clock waking him up

112
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.790
and go off fucking be there on time.

113
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.000
You got to be up early tomorrow.
No problem.
No problem.

114
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.750
That fuck no.
It's like how an employee like that.

115
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.250
I only know what it's like to have him as a friend and that's fucking

116
00:06:36.251 --> 00:06:39.580
fascinating.
It's fascinating.
Yeah.
Imagine relying on him.

117
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.800
<v 4>Anyway,
we're here.
We're queer.
Get used to it.</v>

118
00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:47.850
It's so funny that you guys like are still as close as you arch and considering

I want to be red band,

I'll come to your house,
man,
we'll hang out.

122
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.440

123
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.550
it's like you guys are that,
that that worked.
You know,

124
00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:09.000
that you and Brian worked that,
that he wasn't a lunatic and he just,

125
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.690
and you guys just,

126
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.200
<v 2>well he's definitely a lunatic,
but he's,
he's talented and he's funny.
He's,</v>

127
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.720
he's in his own weird ways.
You know,
he's a quirky little guy.
Yeah.

128
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.820
He's a an odd fellow.
It's an interesting mix.

129
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.740
<v 4>Thanks dude.
Being in,

131
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:30.970
fascinating.

134
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.680
Someone was like,

She comes over my house.

135
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.240
She's fucking amazing.
She's cool.
Really insanely smart.

136
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.510
It's like,
and like Stan hope I was telling you was Stan hope,
standard hope.

137
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.790
And I just met the other night and like hung out.

138
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.510
We had known each other through stand up,

139
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:54.820
I'm coming in hot and I'm not a pro burst house.

140
00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:58.120

All right.
Okay.
So I told my wife,
I go,

142
00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:04.540
I'm gonna go run and get beer for Stan hope and you can hang out with him.

143
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.490
She's like,
I'm not going.
That was Doug Stanhope like no fucking way.
So I go,

144
00:08:09.491 --> 00:08:11.380
you go get beer,
I'll wait for Stan hope.

145
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.570
And they just happened to meet on the front porch.

146
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.210
And here's the thing that no one gets about.
Stan hope.

147
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.320
He is a very real person.
Like he's not like,

148
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.670
they think he's this guy on stage.
It's like,
ah,
abortion and AIDS and rape and,

149
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.170
but he's like a genuinely a real person.
So we go back,
we drink,

150
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.700
we do a podcast for like fucking four hours.
What time was this weird?

151
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.430
Three in the afternoon.
It was the morning,
three in the afternoon.

152
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.290
We Start and then my wife,
and this is what blew me away,
is my wife goes,

153
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.350
you know,
just,
hey,
we're serving the girl's dinner.
Doug,

154
00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:47.110
would you like to stay for dinner?
Now we all are.
Everyone knows the answer.

155
00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:49.480
You're expecting to hear us.
No,
I'm not going to hang out with your family,

156
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.930
but Doug is such a real fucking person.
He's like,
I'd like that.

157
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.030
So we sat down with my daughters.
Fuck.

158
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.700
<v 6>Why do you find that so odd?
Because,
so maybe it's me because I,</v>

159
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.820
but so many people would be like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Like that intimacy,

160
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.660
like to share a meal with a family.
That intimacy is not,

161
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:10.710
everyone has a de,
I dunno,
maybe it's,
I've known Doug for so long.

162
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.020
You've known Doug for,
I think the,

163
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.810
what people know of dog is different than what you know of dog.
Well,

164
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.520
I think it's one of those things where whenever someone's a comedian,

165
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:25.170
it's like this rabble rousing drinking,
you know,

166
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:28.420
a abortion proponent.
Yeah.

167
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.593
Like Doug is,

168
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:35.450
<v 1>you just assume that it's the act and then he's just like this like Kinison guy</v>

169
00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:36.890
like all day long.

170
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.140
But when Doug talks about something on stage it's because these are like actual

171
00:09:42.141 --> 00:09:45.110
opinions at,
he's formulated this.
One of the things,

172
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.720
it's a real problem with that kind of edgy comedy.

173
00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:51.470
One of the reasons why edgy comedy a lot of times sucks.

174
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.470
The DIS tastefulness a lot of it would,

175
00:09:54.471 --> 00:09:57.230
it comes from is a lot of these fucking guys that are faking it.

176
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.590
That's what they're doing is they're trying to be edgy.

177
00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:02.960
They're trying to find the edge point of view.

178
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.040
I mean how many times have you gone to like either an open Mike night or a

179
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.470
showcase night and as a comic that goes up it's seen a bunch of it like really

180
00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:11.360
mean shit.
It's not funny,

181
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.530
but he thinks it's going to be funny if he just edgy,
you know,

182
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:20.531
if he just says something inflammatory or rude or mean or you know.

183
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.710
<v 6>Yeah,
I was,
I was that comic I think to an extent,</v>

184
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.160
like I didn't know what my voice was.
Yeah.
I think a lot of us were.

185
00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:29.160
I definitely wasn't the beginning.
You,

186
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:33.520
you become that because you're just trying to,
I always described it to stages.

187
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.180
The comedy,
the first stage is just trying to figure out what works.

188
00:10:37.181 --> 00:10:40.720
Like you're terrified.
You don't want to bomb you just trying to just,

189
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.890
it's almost like you have tools like,
well,
how do I cut this wood?
Does it,

190
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.010
can I use a saw?
Yes,
the saw works.
Uh,
can I use a hammer?
No,

191
00:10:48.011 --> 00:10:50.170
he can't cut with a hammer.
Okay.
Don't try to hammer again.

192
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.800
And then there's a while.
We were like,
stay the fuck away from hammering

193
00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.630
shit and then people will give you advice.
Dude.

194
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.150
I brought up a hammer and Fort Lauderdale and the audience killed me.
Okay,

195
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.870
no more hammered.
Otello go,
dude.

196
00:11:04.871 --> 00:11:07.030
I like the way you use that hammer and you're like,
even though it bombed,

197
00:11:07.031 --> 00:11:09.460
I'm sticking with the fucking hammer.
Hammer back with the hammer.

198
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:12.340
When a rework the hammer,
I tell likes the hammer.

199
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.350
It's so true.
If your friend got,
it becomes a real problem with comics,

200
00:11:17.351 --> 00:11:20.710
by the way.
Shout out to the young comedians out there listening,

201
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.030
do not try to make the back of the room laugh.
Oh,

202
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.170
that becomes a real issue and it's ruined.
Guys' careers were comics

203
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:34.050
<v 1>say obscure Shit just to make their comedian friends go,
ah,</v>

204
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.490
you are only making someone laugh.
Who knows you're doing like anti comedy.

205
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.340
There's guys that have like that.
It worked.
Talented,

206
00:11:42.341 --> 00:11:47.080
funny guys that thought that like telling an actual funny joke was beneath them

207
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.680
and what they wanted to do was only make the comics laugh because those are

208
00:11:50.681 --> 00:11:53.230
their peers and they fucked themselves.

209
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.970
<v 4>They,
there's a lot of guys that fuck themselves doing that.
The differences,</v>

210
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.480
when you hear someone who does make the back of the room laugh with his obscure

211
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:04.360
joke,
he didn't write it like I'll use it tells an example.

212
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.710
I remember the line was,
I was sitting in the back with Patrice and I,

213
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.780
by the way,
I apologize if my memory of this,
of these events is an accurate,
but,

214
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.950
but I'm telling you what.
I remember I was with Patrice in the packet,
uh,

215
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.780
comedy cellar,
sitting next priest betrayals.

216
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.100
And I weren't like good friends at all,

217
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.000
but Lisa Lampanelli walked through and he made a joke about her.

218
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:26.740
This is before she was who she is today.

219
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.000
He made a joke about her and she laughed and then he didn't,

220
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.350
and then he said they had,
the joke was,
and I hate that I'm even saying this now,

221
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:39.970
but he's like,
oh,
look at her.
She's,
she's smiling like the special needs girl.

222
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:43.170
After she got raped by the softball team or the baseball team.
Oh,
fear.

223
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.260
God's tomorrow.

224
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.310
And I remember Patrice and our own fucking stitches and we were like,

225
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.310
but he wasn't,
he was really hoping everyone would get that,

226
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.850
but no one got it except for the two of us.
What do you mean by get it?

227
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.410
Like get the joke,
like the joke was,
it was very,
it's very obscure,

228
00:12:58.411 --> 00:12:59.470
but there's a book written and I was,

229
00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:01.240
I only know this because I was working at Barnes and noble at the time.

230
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.630
There was a book written about a baseball team that raped her mentally

231
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.980
challenged girl in Jersey and they all got away with it.
Yeah.

232
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:11.860
They all got away with it and,
but the joke was,
I'm,

233
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:14.350
I'm fucking butchering this and tells him he be like,
I never said that.

234
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.650
I don't cause now it's like out of context.
I'm making him sound bad,

235
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:18.881
but I don't mean to.

236
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:22.570
But I remember Patrice and I laughed fucking hysterically and she laughed.

237
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.600
She laughed.
She laughed at the joke was,
oh look at her.
She's laughing.

238
00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:28.720
Like those special needs girls that just got raped by the baseball team and
said,

239
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.400
okay,
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

240
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.910
Like the special needs girl didn't understand that.

241
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.100
What had just happened was horrible to her.

242
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.940
Dave was making that analogy that she didn't understand that he wasn't being

243
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:42.160
nice.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.

244
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.310
People give a lot of shit to Lisa Lampanelli people give a lot of shit.

245
00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:48.490
Lisa Lampanelli and I don't get along.
Really?
Yeah.

246
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.290
How come you guys don't get along?

247
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.340
I was doing radio one time in Tampa with my buddy cowhead and I was,

248
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.570
I lived in town.
I wasn't doing dates.
I was just hanging out and uh,

249
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.690
and uh,

250
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.160
my mom was visiting my family and I'd go in and do radio in the morning and she

251
00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:06.970
came by and she was like,
he needs to leave.
And it's like,
oh,

252
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.940
he's not promoting anything.
He's just a here.
She's like,
yeah,

253
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:12.130
I don't do co radio with other comics.
And he's like,
yeah,

254
00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:14.800
but he's a friend of the show.
He just,
he'll trust me.
Births good.

255
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:18.940
He'll just laugh,
he'll have a good time.
It'll set you up.
And she was like,

256
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.460
well then I don't do the show.
And he's like,
well,
he's my friend.

257
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:23.560
I'm not gonna ask him to fucking leave.
She was like,

258
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:26.080
you either leaves or I leave.
And I was like,

259
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:28.370
and I actually kind of newer and so I went,

260
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.450
I went to go say something to her and when,
I guess as soon as she saw me,

261
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:34.300
she fucking bolt it.
That's why I was like,
what the fuck was that?

262
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.870
Like I would never,
this was a long time to shoot.
Not so long ago.

263
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:42.160
She probably don't remember.
But like,
uh,
probably nine years ago,

264
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.290
it's seven years ago.
And I just was like,
I was like,
I was,

265
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.140
cause I wanted to pair like the biggest fucking compliment because I'd known her

266
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:52.460
when she would wear the gold chains on stage

267
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.280
<v 6>and the gold chains and she used to go on stage with the,</v>

268
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.650
with a huge Mercedes emblem around her neck.
Yeah.

269
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.350
And go rings all over her hands,
swear to God and,
and,
and be like a rapper.
Like,

270
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.820
oh no,
Yo,
Yo,
Yo,
Yo,
I'm down with the black dude.

271
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.290
It wasn't,

272
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:14.180
it wasn't a fought out act like she has like her act now is a lot more clean.

273
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.880
She would wear like a costume on stage and I,

274
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:20.210
and I wanted to compliment her and maybe she,
maybe she was afraid I'd say that.

275
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.920
I don't know.
But I wanted to compliment her and say,
you're killing it.
Like how?

276
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.740
I was excited to see her,
but she didn't want me in the room.
That's wild.

277
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.450
Maybe she takes so much shit or took so much shit from comedic so that she just

278
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:35.810
didn't want have anything to do with the,
the possibility of being judged.

279
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.530
I could relate to that feeling totally.

280
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.830
Especially if she did a lot of,
you know,

281
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.880
she experimented with a lot of stuff and tried really hard and a lot of people

282
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:49.550
like gave her a hard time for her racial jokes.

283
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.970
Saying that she was trying too hard to be edgy and they would just be really

284
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.350
mean to her.
But
I never got into that man.

285
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:02.360
I might take on a comedy is if I don't like it,
why would I be mad at you?

286
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.650
Like I get it.
If it sucks,
I don't want to listen to it.
I don't want to be there,

287
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.510
but why would I be mad at you like for me to want to sabotage someone?

288
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:16.820
I would never do that.
So I could never do that.

289
00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:20.030
And I was I a n n if you make me laugh,
I can't help it.
You make me laugh.

290
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.070
Lisa Lampanelli made me laugh.

291
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.150
Maybe it's just fucking too many dudes are fucking,
whether,
you know,
maybe,

292
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.380
maybe it was just too much.

293
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:31.700
So she just had this keep your eyes on the prize type thing in her head and,

294
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.360
and you know,
this guy's gonna fuck with my vibe.
Get 'em out.
Probably.

295
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.070
I mean I was a lot more,

296
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.820
I was really burned up about it when it happened and I was like,
I was like,

297
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:42.910
Fuck Lisa Lampanelli it,
but I don't care.
I don't think,

298
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.020
I don't feel that way at all now I'm,
I'm so,

299
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.280
it's neat to see her succeed and like the global kind of way that she is.

300
00:16:49.281 --> 00:16:52.040
But yeah,
so this is like 2005 ish probably.

301
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.540
She was getting a lot of heat for being a hack back then by a lot of comics

302
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.000
because that was the one she was just starting to become successful.

303
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.480
And you know that thing when people just start to become successful,

304
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:06.500
the wave of resentment from all the fucking,
all the Comedians,

305
00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:09.260
that just shit on you dude.
I think that,

306
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.710
I think that makes people not want to succeed.

307
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.030
Oh that's crazy.
I think there are shops,
office sabotaging people where you just,

308
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.660
Oh I don't think maybe it's third fucking,
they were never going to,

309
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.540
they're just looking for a reason to not succeed.
If that's the case,

310
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:26.840
if it's because somebody calls you a hack.
I'm obsessed right now with the,

311
00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:30.770
with the type of comic that um,
the,

312
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.780
maybe the art form of standup isn't as important as fame and like getting to

313
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.060
like the fame of it.
Why don't you be obsessed,

314
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.350
not obsessed about honestly because uh,

315
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.820
not obsessed about it but it's definitely where my head's at right now cause I

316
00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:48.470
think in promoting the book that I'm promoting non fucking stop.

317
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.100
You like this disconnect

318
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.980
<v 2>from,
from reality and you've,</v>

319
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.250
and you then I look at like guys that are not really comics per se,

320
00:17:56.251 --> 00:18:00.990
but then go out and,
and it's just more about being famous as opposed to being,

321
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.810
you know what I mean?
Is that making any sense?
Totally.

322
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:07.200
Do you ever take an acting class?
No.
Have you ever took an acting class?

323
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:09.870
You'd be around those fucking people.
24 seven the fucking empty.

324
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.390
That's all they do.
Yeah.
They're just looking to get it.

325
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.380
Or you know what they really should have.
They should have reality TV classes.

326
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:20.390
If you really wanted to get sick people just,
this is how you get a it.

327
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.110
That's what we should do.

328
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.760
We should start a fucking seminar on how to become a reality TV star reality TV

329
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:30.360
stars.
Exactly what I'm talking about.
They're like the guys who just,
it's,

330
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.760
it's not about anything other than just being famous and,
and,

331
00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:39.060
and you and I could probably qualify to teach that.
I mean,
you're on trip flip.

332
00:18:39.061 --> 00:18:42.060
Yeah.
You were on your other shows before that.
Yeah.

333
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:45.870
Those are all sort of reality shows,
you know?
And me fear factor.

334
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.730
That's once a minute.
That's sort of a reality show too.
I mean it's all reality,

335
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.150
you know.
But if we wanted to do that,

336
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.750
we've wanted to do a quote unquote reality show,

337
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.890
we easily could get that done.
You know,
we could,

338
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.570
we could start coaching people on that would be hilarious.

339
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.780
Coaching people on how to be like the most vapid reality star.

340
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.660
This is what you have to do.
It teach them about conflict.

341
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.450
You got to get involved with co in conflict with people online.

342
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.350
It's many famous people as possible.
Twitter wars are good for business.

343
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.070
Like teach them about Twitter wars,
teach them how to make youtube videos,

344
00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:24.780
calling people out and you know,

345
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:27.120
this is the way to get it is the most amount of hits.

346
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.800
Photoshop your head on porn stars,
bodies release it all over the Internet.

347
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:32.700
People think it's real.

348
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.300
You gotta have a porn tape if you can have a porn tape get appointed.

349
00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.790
But if you have a little Dick,
stay away from the porn tape.
God,

350
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.300
can you imagine if you,
if you have a porn tape and it backfires.

351
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.550
Like if you do a porn tape,
but you got a little tiny deck,

352
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.030
like you have no reference for what it,
how big a dick is and you're like,

353
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.540
don't watch porn.
Yeah.
Maybe it's like a comic who's never really watched comedy.

354
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.030
They go on stage.
I don't know what you're doing.
You never really watched porn.

355
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.720
Didn't that guy who was the fucking shooter in Santa Barbara say that he didn't

356
00:19:57.721 --> 00:20:01.830
watch porn because he would get jealous of the men in the porn videos?

357
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.680
I'm pretty sure that that that was something that,
that crazy fucking said.

358
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.430
Tech Kid.
I read the,
I read his manifesto.
I think he,

359
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.880
if he had had sex once,
he'd be like,
oh,
there's none of this is fucking worth it.

360
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.310
I watched the video.
I did,
I wasn't going to,

361
00:20:17.311 --> 00:20:18.870
but yesterday I found myself watching it.

362
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:23.910
I just clicking through and looking at other stuff online and this w one of the

363
00:20:23.911 --> 00:20:28.650
reasons why I watched it is because it's now become this really odd thing where

364
00:20:28.651 --> 00:20:29.670
it's these,
uh,

365
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:35.210
feminists and men's rights groups or like using it as a platform to do battle.

366
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:41.550
It's become like this battlefield,
is that the yes,
yes.
Women can or no?

367
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:45.630
Yes.
All women and I think what their campaign is,

368
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:47.740
what they're trying to do with this Hashtag is they're saying

369
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:53.110
<v 1>[inaudible] guys are saying not every guy is like him and what they're saying</v>

370
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:54.280
is,
yeah,
but yes,

371
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:58.750
all women are subject to those assholes and that yes,

372
00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:03.250
all women get fucked with.
Yes.
All women experience misogyny.
Yes.

373
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:04.930
All women experience sexism.

374
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.920
My problem with all this from both sides is that it's not going to fix mentally

375
00:21:11.111 --> 00:21:16.111
deranged people and we're also not being completely objective with why he is the

376
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:17.494
way he is.

377
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:22.830
There's obviously something really fucking wrong with your brain if you can go

378
00:21:23.171 --> 00:21:26.230
out and shoot a bunch of people and then shoot yourself.
Okay.
Yeah,
we,

379
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:27.400
I think we could all agree on that.

380
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:32.610
All agree on that and obviously he had some extreme issues with his personality.

381
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.310
If you watch the video and you don't have to,

382
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.220
I mean I just did yesterday,

383
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.610
but if you watch that video you can see like he's a psychopath.

384
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:46.420
There's something really wrong with this guy or something so wrong burgers.

385
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.640
Who knows?
I don't know what that means.

386
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.170
You know I don't like all these wacky labels when it comes to mental illnesses

387
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:57.220
cause I'm not sure I trust them all.
You know,
like he's on the spectrum.
Oh,

388
00:21:57.221 --> 00:21:59.860
is he really?
What are you,
is this,
can you weigh that?

389
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.880
Can you put that spectrum on a scale?
Can you make that guy uh,

390
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.500
jumping a tank of water and it reads how autistic he is?
Like I don't,

391
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.860
I'm not sure.
I believe you.
You know what I'm saying?
It's like Adhd.

392
00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:14.580
The kid's got ADHD does he did it.
It didn't.

393
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.430
Someone just say that they invented that and that it's not real.
I mean,

394
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.750
what does it mean he doesn't like school?
Who the fuck does,
it's boring as shit.

395
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.630
You put me in school right now.
You would think I need drugs.

396
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.450
If they made me go back to high school right now,

397
00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:31.630
they would put me on fucking Ritalin.
Like,
this kid's got problems.

398
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:34.930
He's got the Adhd.
He's never going to succeed in this life.

399
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.900
He's never going to be a functional part of society unless he takes medication.

400
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.110
It becomes a fucking square peg.
You can't be living your life as a round hole.

401
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:41.930
You fuckhead.

402
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:42.111
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

403
00:22:42.111 --> 00:22:44.120
What do you think you're going to do is just go sit on the stage to make people

404
00:22:44.121 --> 00:22:48.260
laugh.
There's no fucking,
I love it.
I love that analogy of a,

405
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.980
if you put them in a tank of water,
that's what they did with the witches.

406
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.550
Will they do with body fat?
If you tell your body fat percentage

407
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.930
while they drowned them really tell if there are with,
she doesn't die.

408
00:23:02.931 --> 00:23:05.870
She's a witch.
Sorry,
we were wrong.

409
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.180
I don't know if that's what they actually said,

410
00:23:08.181 --> 00:23:11.370
but they probably figured out some way that she's still a,

411
00:23:11.371 --> 00:23:14.420
which I think I probably would have been registered on the spectrum somewhere.

412
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.280
Fuck yeah,
you would.
Every comic.
I know.

413
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.910
<v 1>Talking to Moshe Kasher yesterday about that.
We were talking about how,</v>

414
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.750
well actually it wasn't him I was talking to about that,
but um,

415
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.240
it was another comic recently about how you,

416
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:34.330
we didn't talk about yesterday about like finding early on who the hell was it,

417
00:23:34.911 --> 00:23:38.960
which comic was in here,
but finding someone early on and recognizing like,
hey,

418
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.730
it was motion.
We were like,
you're all fucked up in a lot of ways.
It's like,
dude,

419
00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:45.050
do like get them right now.
All these impulsive,

420
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.350
crazy wild kids do and nutty shit.
Yeah.
You get them right now and go,
hey,

421
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:53.110
you're probably a comedian.
It was yesterday.
Yeah,
it was Moshe w.

422
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.110
But finding someone who can pay attention classes,
always mocking everybody.

423
00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:02.210
Comerica park there,
there's hope for you really is like you like,
uh,

424
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.950
the number one draft pick in this,

425
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:07.090
in this class as far as like the standup comics trapped.

426
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:11.300
If I was going to come in,
you know,
as a,
I'm an expert on comedy.
Okay.

427
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.880
Stand up comedian a long fucking time.

428
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.530
I could come in and I could sit down with all these high school kids and who's

429
00:24:18.531 --> 00:24:22.220
the biggest fuck up come here man.
Uh,
what,
what do you get in trouble for?

430
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.910
And the kid would start talking to me if I can get this kid to relax and start

431
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.960
saying,
well,
this fat fuck over here won't leave me alone.
You know,
it's like,

432
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.920
you know the in this bitch thinks his shit doesn't stink.

433
00:24:33.921 --> 00:24:38.000
And meanwhile I know that she blew my friend.
She denies it.
And you,

434
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.200
you could find some crazy dude who is probably wild maniac like you can imagine

435
00:24:43.611 --> 00:24:45.680
with Joey Diaz is like,
it was like a news 15 years old.

436
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:48.710
I'll probably stabbing people in class throwing bombs.
I mean,

437
00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:51.660
who the fuck knows what he did?
Who knows what that guy did?
Yeah.

438
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.890
But if you could be there at that time and go,
hey listen,

439
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.630
you probably convenient.
Like you could be a great comic,

440
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.280
like all this other stuff.
It's not going to work out,
man.

441
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.730
That lawyer thing that your mom's pushing for,
shit ain't going to happen.

442
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.260
It's not going to happen.
You'll go crazy.
You'll jump off a fucking building,
man,

443
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:11.790
you're not.
You're a goddamn comedian.
That's the one I,
I,

444
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.410
there was no options in life when I was in college.
It was like,
you want to,

445
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:15.891
you want to go,

446
00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:19.190
she'll carpet and east Georgia maq highs are going to hook you up with that.

447
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.750
Or like maybe I was never going to go sell medical supplies.

448
00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.100
I wasn't smart enough to God.
I tried.

449
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:30.200
I tried doing the construction route so hard.
I couldn't work.
It was so hard.

450
00:25:30.201 --> 00:25:34.580
It would drive me crazy.
I was doing it while it was still competing and man,

451
00:25:34.581 --> 00:25:38.870
I did a,
I worked in my buddy Jimmy.
Hey we,
we did this,

452
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:42.530
a knights of Columbus Hall and it was all like a wheelchair ramp.

453
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.230
So for like two weeks it was just carrying pressure,

454
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:47.810
treated lumber and bags of concrete.

455
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.560
It was fucking brutal.
And up to the end of the day,

456
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:55.280
I had no energy to do anything.
I couldn't train,
I couldn't,

457
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:59.150
I didn't want to fuck.
I just want to sleep.
And then I'd get up in the morning,

458
00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:01.790
the alarm would go off and I'd be like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

459
00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:06.440
I can't believe I have to get up.
I'm so tired.
And you'd do it all over again.

460
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:10.190
It was every day it was carrying like who knows how many hundreds of pounds of

461
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:14.270
shit.
And I just thought of it,
I'm like,
this is some people's life man forever.

462
00:26:14.271 --> 00:26:18.260
And they just look forward to Saturday and Sunday and then Monday comes along

463
00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:21.710
and they bite down in their mouthpiece and they fucking just go out there

464
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:26.060
swinging and pick up those bags of cement,
carry him up that fucking ramp.

465
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.950
I'll never forget that week,

466
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.500
those two weeks that I worked for this construction company,

467
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.260
I mean it was a tough two weeks.
It was the summer.
It was hot out.

468
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:38.000
It was a tough job.
And ordinarily,
you know,
they're carpenters are ordinarily,

469
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:40.850
they don't have to deal with as many things like that.
Like they,

470
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.400
they build houses.
But occasionally there's a weird project,

471
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.460
<v 2>like a giant wheelchair ramp at a knights of Columbus Hall.</v>

472
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:49.710
It's a long ass fucking ramp required,

473
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:53.340
a lot of cement and a lot of pressure treated lumber and the truck pressure,

474
00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:53.881
treated lumber,

475
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:57.930
the splinters getting your hand and just all I could think of is not feeling

476
00:26:57.931 --> 00:27:00.270
sorry for myself at all but think,

477
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.360
oh like you could get stuck here like this is,

478
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.880
there's a whole lot of paths and options in life.
And I was,

479
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.880
I was on a really bad one and I was like,
Ooh,
you can get stuck here.
I mean,

480
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.080
it's a good honest living.
It's not as bad as a path of crime.

481
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:17.640
It's not as bad as a path of exploitation is not,
you know,
something morally bad.

482
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.960
But it was like,
Whoa,

483
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:22.770
this is going to be difficult and not very rewarding is going to feel terrible

484
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:24.630
and it does not going to pay you very much money either.

485
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.770
If you want to be a grunt,
if you want to be a laborer,
like it's tough work.

486
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.450
It's a real tough way to make a living.

487
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.840
And I remember knowing because of that that I had to find a way out and then

488
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.160
almost within,
you know,

489
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.740
a year or so I was doing standup but it was a part of the whole evolution that

490
00:27:43.741 --> 00:27:48.240
that having that job was a part of my whole evolution cause I was like there's

491
00:27:48.241 --> 00:27:52.290
no way this can't happen.
This I'll go crazy.

492
00:27:52.291 --> 00:27:56.400
This will be a hellish life because when someone is just telling you what to do

493
00:27:56.401 --> 00:28:00.420
all day and it's physically breaking and not rewarding.

494
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.460
W we're designed to want to play our,
our,

495
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.480
our mind wants to wander.

496
00:28:06.481 --> 00:28:09.450
We want to figure things out and we're going to build things.
We want to,

497
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.530
we want to create,
we want to explore,
we're going to see new things.

498
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.820
That's what the human mind wants.

499
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:20.060
It doesn't want to carry bags of dirt up a fucking ramp all day bags or rocks

500
00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:26.280
and dirt and fucking it's lumber all day.

501
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.530
Your body doesn't want that.
Your mind doesn't want that either.

502
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:30.750
Your mind wants to do with the shit.
You might want to go find some bugs,

503
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.890
but do you think,

504
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.520
do you think there are guys that really genuinely loved that job?

505
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.960
I don't know.
I would hope so.
Who knows how,
what people like and what,

506
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.620
I don't understand the grateful dead.
There's people out there that love him.
Oh,

507
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:44.970
I love the grateful dead.
They go.

508
00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.580
I'm not saying you shouldn't love the grateful dead.

509
00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:50.940
I bet this is a lot of shit I like to you don't like,
do you like Dwight Yoakam?

510
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.350
I loved Dwight Yoakam.
I love Dwight Yoakam.
Huh?
Johnny Cash.

511
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.160
Love Johnny Cash.
My dog's named Johnny Cash.
Yeah.
Okay.

512
00:28:59.161 --> 00:29:02.090
I'm going to tell you a page on named something.
I'd think you don't like it.

513
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:07.320
Okay,
got it.
Do you like the smiths?
No.
You like the violent femmes?

514
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.940
No.
Are you shitting me?
No,
I don't hate them.
I'm just not drawn to them.

515
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:16.550
Yeah.
But I like weird shit.
Like I lacked Neta and you know to and that as,
no,

516
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.640
he's just like a transvestite guy in,
uh,

517
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:24.510
in Toronto and he does these crazy youtube videos and they get like fucking

518
00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:27.870
millions of hits.
I actually bought it as a vinyl because he's sold a vinyl.

519
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.610
So I'm like,
if I ever get a record player,

520
00:29:29.611 --> 00:29:33.120
I want to have this guy shit because this guy doing it completely on his own.

521
00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:34.140
He's up in Toronto,

522
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.310
he's apparently got a kid and his son like just not like it.

523
00:29:38.311 --> 00:29:41.640
It sounds like full grown.
He's probably in his fifties at sky.
Oh really?

524
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:46.090
He does all of his own music.
He makes all of his own like really crude videos,

525
00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:47.530
like super low budget.

526
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:51.670
Like some of them are just like a towel that's hanging in front.

527
00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:53.890
There's him and that image dancing.

528
00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.680
<v 6>Oh my God.
Yeah.
Oh,
I can see as a son not enjoying that.</v>

529
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:03.200
That's just one of his more extreme videos.
But almost all of his,
no,

530
00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:05.240
there's other stuff you don't have.
There's other stuff.

531
00:30:05.241 --> 00:30:09.350
If you go to his youtube videos,
his youtube videos are kind of interesting.

532
00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.600
They're like,
uh,

533
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.540
with those is real Niccolo tech and I think he like doctor and mom got into

534
00:30:14.541 --> 00:30:19.190
Puffy nipples.
You chest got into puffy nipple.
How'd that happen?

535
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:23.870
It does take a pill and
bump your head.

536
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.440
I was,
I got a,
I was doing some,

537
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.790
I was doing something somewhere and I've walked by and the girl that was working

538
00:30:31.791 --> 00:30:33.800
the front desk didn't have like a,

539
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:37.830
she didn't have like a bra on but her blouse definitely you could see like she

540
00:30:37.831 --> 00:30:39.140
had it,
they didn't look like nipples.

541
00:30:39.141 --> 00:30:42.530
It looked like little nouns on her tits and I just got caught off guard and I

542
00:30:42.531 --> 00:30:45.050
was like,
what is that?
Like I've never seen them,

543
00:30:45.051 --> 00:30:47.240
I've never been up close with them in my life.

544
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.570
<v 2>It's amazing how much,
like whether you're pro or con,</v>

545
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:56.750
how much that can change things like some guys like are really into big nipples

546
00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.850
and then some guy's like almost no nipple.

547
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:04.680
So someone could look at the same breast and one guy be like,
yes.
Yeah.

548
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.630
<v 6>Another guy bill you like I can imagine.
I think it's,</v>

549
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.780
I think it's for when you're like 14 cause when you,
yeah,

550
00:31:11.781 --> 00:31:15.110
what you see first I think sometimes sets your formation.

551
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.210
I'd never seen Puffy nipples and let me tell you something.

552
00:31:17.211 --> 00:31:21.230
I might've been creeped out if I ever saw them growing up.
But man,
I got onto,

553
00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:25.130
there's a tumbler page drunk perv in your,

554
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:29.540
in your latter years,
go to Buffy nipples.
Uh,
there's a a tumbler,

555
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:32.030
whereas like I'm glad you found me.
I'm a fan too.

556
00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.310
Here's all the pictures I've accrued.
Don't go there.

557
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.930
I don't want to see that Jesus Christ.
So Strip people are so strange.

558
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.510
What's the weirdest thing you've seen on a girl?

559
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:44.000
A girl's body that you've never seen it?
Another girl that you were like,

560
00:31:44.001 --> 00:31:48.440
what the fuck is this?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Like,
like a,

561
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:53.180
he never seen a girl with hair on her back.
No.
Like heroin.
Uracil yeah,

562
00:31:53.181 --> 00:31:56.270
but that was standard back in the eighties man.
Yeah,
that was,

563
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.640
I don't see it at all.
White male and he's only my wife.

564
00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.930
You make sure you don't see it,
right?
I don't like that whip.
Hey Brian,

565
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.290
let's get back to you to what

566
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.120
<v 2>we were talking about to begin with,
which was this,</v>

567
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:09.930
this battle that's going on with the men's rights and the,
and the feminist.

568
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:14.700
It's pretty fascinating cause I read this blog today where this,
all right,

569
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.380
here's the thing about all this stuff.
It's,
it's,

570
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:20.820
it's certainly important to be nice to women.

571
00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.010
It's certainly important to be nice to men.

572
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.860
It's certainly important that we all get along and be cool with each other,

573
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:31.310
but there's things that happen when something goes down and these really extreme

574
00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:36.840
versions of these ideas emerge,
and on the men's side,

575
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.130
the men's rights,
these,
some of these fucking

576
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:41.240
<v 1>creepers,</v>

577
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.210
these pieces of many people were so gross that one of the things that they're

578
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:46.850
saying is that if women fuck this guy,

579
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.320
that he wouldn't have gone this rampage and it's because all you stuck up,

580
00:32:51.321 --> 00:32:54.940
bitches wouldn't fuck this guy.
Like this is what you created or you seeing,

581
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.750
oh yeah,
no bullshit,
no bullshit.

582
00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:02.050
There's people out there and this world that genuinely suck and they genuinely

583
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:04.550
hate women and for whatever reason,

584
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:07.610
whether it's the programming they got from their mother,

585
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.170
whether it's the genetics that they got from their parents and their

586
00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:15.350
grandparents,
I don't understand how personalities just totally created.

587
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.110
I don't think anybody truly does.
I think it's all guesswork.

588
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.450
I think there are occasionally though,

589
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:25.250
horrible examples of people who've gone through life and just been shit on and

590
00:33:25.251 --> 00:33:29.120
fucked over and they've turned into monsters and so you'll run into him at age,

591
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:32.390
whatever,
30 whatever the fuck old that guy is.
It wrote that thing.

592
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.610
And you essentially have a woman hating monster.
Yeah.

593
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:40.100
That's the difference between feminism and the men's rights guys.

594
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.470
Because if feminism,
if they don't like men,
no one's gonna rape me.
You know?

595
00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:47.330
If the women are upset with men,
you know,

596
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:52.331
if you wanted to similarly unhinged woman and she's bummed out about dudes,

597
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:55.070
it's very rare that she's going to resort to violence,

598
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:59.360
but a man who's like this guide,
it's like Zeus fucking stuck.

599
00:33:59.361 --> 00:34:02.150
How bitches just fuck that doesn't really,

600
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.180
that doesn't work the other way.
It doesn't.
You don't need it.

601
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:10.160
I'm not going to hear that from women.
So the real problem with all this stuff,

602
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:12.380
it's not like that.

603
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:17.570
These men's right guys are all evil or feminists are all cons.

604
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:19.940
It's that we're doing,

605
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.750
there's two sides doing battle with each other for no fucking reason.
It's like,

606
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.050
what side do you want on the male side?
I'm on the woman's side.

607
00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:32.180
How about just on the good human side?
Because if you're on the good human side,

608
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:36.590
all of it gets abandoned.
All of it.
It's all,
the whole battle gets abandoned.

609
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:40.910
It's like they forget that this is all about the people who died for nothing.

610
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:46.250
But what I'm saying is that like instead of like instead of like trying to like

611
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:48.140
attack each other and go back and forth,

612
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:51.290
that shit is never going to fix anything.
Instead of that,

613
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.030
instead of even engaging in that,

614
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:59.150
be like more proactive and support the good human being.

615
00:34:59.151 --> 00:35:02.300
Ethics who support the good human being idea.

616
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:06.500
Just fucking be cool to each other and everyone who can't be cool to each other,

617
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:08.330
keep them the fuck away from me.

618
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:13.510
Keep them the fuck away from all of us are our issues aren't like men versus

619
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:16.670
women are issues are due.

620
00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:20.060
She fucked up men first is conti women.

621
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.890
That's our problem.

622
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.570
That's our real problem in this life and the Douchey fucked up men victimize

623
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:30.500
more women than the women victimized men.
If a woman victimizes the man.

624
00:35:30.501 --> 00:35:34.070
Here's the big one you always hear the big one you always hear is this fucking

625
00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:37.780
bitch.
She schemed him.
She married him,
she pregnant,

626
00:35:37.781 --> 00:35:42.720
and she took all his fucking money.
It was a plan the whole time so wide.

627
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.950
So what did she fuck?
'Em Yeah.
Then she did what he wanted.

628
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.180
She wanted money.
He wanted to fuck.
They got together.

629
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.360
She pretended to like him more than she did because she like money.

630
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.450
And the way to get him to give her the money is to potentially like some,

631
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.560
it's not fucking rocket science.
You're angry at that.
So you're angry.

632
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:04.290
A dumb guy with money got roped in.
Well guess what?

633
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.770
As smart as he was to figure out how to make all that money,

634
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.580
figuring out how to get good with human communication.

635
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.430
So we know when someone's just a hooker figured out how to figure out how to

636
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:19.230
spot.
Some chick has just trying to rob you because you're ugly and old,

637
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:23.790
but your richest fuck you thought she loved you.
Are you crazy?

638
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.000
Are you fucking crazy?
Do you have a mirror in your house?

639
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:30.420
And go stand in front of me.
Go smell your own breath.
You fucking creep.

640
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.860
You think she wanted to fuck you because you're hot.
Come on.
You had money.

641
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:39.120
She's got looks.
It was an exchange.
She got tired of it.
She left.

642
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.740
You didn't set it up right.
He did a bad job.
You got fucked over.

643
00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:46.290
You lost all your money.
Start from scratch.
Stupid.

644
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.800
You're not a little kid born in Ethiopia with no feet.
All right.
I'm not,

645
00:36:49.801 --> 00:36:51.100
I don't feel for those guys.
Yeah.

646
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.770
There's a big difference between a guy who's willing to just get in his car and

647
00:36:55.771 --> 00:37:00.630
start shooting people because chicks won't fuck him and some girl who's trying

648
00:37:00.631 --> 00:37:05.250
to con some rich dude in marrying her and getting her pregnant so she could get

649
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:07.080
a lot of money and fuck him over a divorce.

650
00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.950
Who cares about that guy who gets the worst thing that can happen?

651
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.660
Child childcare and child support are the two ones that are really creepy

652
00:37:15.661 --> 00:37:18.660
because some relationships they get so fucked up and again,

653
00:37:18.661 --> 00:37:21.540
it's not a man versus woman thing.
It's an evil person thing,

654
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:26.610
like men will be accused of doing crazy shit to their kids that they've never

655
00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:29.670
done anything but the wife hates the man so much.

656
00:37:29.671 --> 00:37:32.880
Like maybe the guy fucked around on her with is some woman at work or something

657
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:35.520
like that and got her pregnant and I'm crazy and this and they're getting

658
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:40.080
divorced.
Women will say some evil shit.
She's like,

659
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:41.340
men will say some evil shit.

660
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:45.000
Men will make up things about their wife having affairs.

661
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.190
They'll lie about spending money,
the live,

662
00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:50.400
they'll plant drugs on each other and then call the cops on each other.

663
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:54.140
People do that shit like that's one of the things cops look for in divorce
cases.

664
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:57.320
Like when someone calls in and says,
you know this guy a,
my husband,
he's,

665
00:37:57.321 --> 00:38:00.810
he's using drugs.
I know he's using drugs cops ago.
Oh really?
Oh yeah,

666
00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:04.890
he's using drugs.
You guys getting divorced or something,
you know?
Fuck yeah,

667
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.740
they have to.
They have to.
You have to win.

668
00:38:07.741 --> 00:38:11.160
If you're a detective and you come and you're talking to someone,
they're like,

669
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:15.090
I found a bag of cocaine in my husband's underwear drawer.
Did you really?

670
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.590
Okay.
Are you guys getting divorced?
Yeah,
because if you're getting divorced,
hmm,

671
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:23.670
I'm,
I want to put you on a machine that finds out if you're telling the truth or

672
00:38:23.671 --> 00:38:27.570
not.
Would you be cool with that?
The Fuck Outta here?
People are crazy.

673
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.690
Men and women.
Everyone's crazy.
No.
Was the women's side,

674
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:36.160
the women's side is that they have to deal with people like that all the time

675
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.950
<v 6>and that men don't and that we should respect it.
But my point of view is,</v>

676
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.060
is that,
I mean what I've already said,

677
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:47.230
but also that I think there's a lot of people that jump jump up when these

678
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:50.860
things happen and they look to make a big grand statement.

679
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.700
And I don't know if they're making a big grand statement because they really

680
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:58.660
think they're going to change things or because they want like moral Brownie

681
00:38:58.661 --> 00:39:01.960
points.
Do you know those things where people do,
where you're like,
Ooh,

682
00:39:01.961 --> 00:39:04.000
I think you're kind of being gross here.

683
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.480
I don't know why I just feel gross about this.
You know what I mean?

684
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.180
Sometimes people do,
they'll,
they'll talk about shit and you're like,

685
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.660
I know that you believe this,

686
00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:18.661
but I also know you are loving all this like positive progressive ground Brownie

687
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:21.850
points are getting with this article.
This is like a bit of ego behind it.

688
00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:24.340
That's quite distasteful.
Wait,
what was the article you read?

689
00:39:24.341 --> 00:39:28.900
Was this one about Seth Rogan One?
No,
no,
no.
Did you hear about that one?
Yeah,

690
00:39:28.901 --> 00:39:31.300
but this is,
no,
this is all about the murder.

691
00:39:31.301 --> 00:39:33.070
All about the mass murder in Santa Barbara.
Yeah.

692
00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:36.730
He had one about the mass party blame Seth Rogan on the murder murder in Santa

693
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.810
Barbara.
Oh my gosh,
girl.
I didn't read her her article per se,

694
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.170
but it was a feminist writing an article about Seth Rogan saying this is what

695
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:45.430
you get when you get,

696
00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.470
when you make these male oriented movies like neighbors where the women are just

697
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:54.040
kind of like goody bags at the end of the movie and the women don't have a
voice.

698
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:56.080
And I think I'm,
I'm,
by the way,
I,

699
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.290
I'm never fucking listen to what I say.

700
00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:04.630
I started this off by saying I genital warts.
No,
no,
no worries.
I general ward,

701
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:09.010
I was worried.
That's incredible.
Judd Apatow slam a movie critic,

702
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:14.050
a movie critic,
Washington Post's and horn.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

703
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.830
Well,
you know,
it's funny,
but there's a lot of women that,
you know,

704
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:19.870
you go to the movies,
like here's when I,

705
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.970
when I really thought about it for the first time,

706
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.960
the first time I ever really thought about how weird it is and how biased movies

707
00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:29.230
are,
and if I really do have white privilege,
it's definitely in the movies.

708
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.550
And this is why I went to see planet of the apes in a black neighborhood in

709
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:38.080
Philadelphia with my friend Tommy Jr and his girlfriend.
And,
uh,

710
00:40:38.081 --> 00:40:40.090
we were,
what year is this?

711
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:44.410
This is recently the new plant of the apes.
Yeah.

712
00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:48.770
A better story if it's 1976 no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
This is the real,

713
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.750
what year was a real printed names?
I think it was like earlier in the 70.

714
00:40:51.751 --> 00:40:55.480
[inaudible] I think the shit was really early.
Um,
because black and white,

715
00:40:55.481 --> 00:40:58.650
it wasn't,
it was playing on apes fucking,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Chad,

716
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:03.400
the albino monkey,
excuse me.
Anyway,
um,

717
00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:08.401
so we were watching these previews for these movies and every movie was about

718
00:41:08.681 --> 00:41:13.420
white people.
Every movie was about white people and over and over,

719
00:41:13.421 --> 00:41:17.110
because you were in that room,
you're now seeing it.
You're like,
oh fuck.
Totally.

720
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.980
And then when there's finally 1968 was the original plan of the apes.

721
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.170
And when there's finally a,
um,
a scene where there's a black guy in it,
the black,

722
00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:30.790
I was like a maniac.
I forget what the,
the thing was at the black guy was like,

723
00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.970
oh,
complete over the top,
you know,
like this morning,

724
00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:39.130
my fuck up crazy.
I don't remember who the book,

725
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.400
I think it was Tracy Morgan,
I think it was a movie with Tracy Morgan.

726
00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.830
It was totally,
completely buffoonish and over the top.
And I was like,

727
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.770
wow.
And I never thought about it before,

728
00:41:48.771 --> 00:41:52.100
but I was sitting there in that movie theater surrounded by nothing but black

729
00:41:52.101 --> 00:41:56.900
people.
And I was thinking,
this is what is this light?
This is terrible,

730
00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.620
this is annoying.
And then I realize what it,
you know,

731
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:05.390
I'd never even considered it before as a privileged white male,

732
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.250
I just would go to the movies and like,
Oh,

733
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:12.200
here's another fucking Tom Cruise movie.
Yawn.
Oh,
are you really in space,
Tom?

734
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:16.250
Are you really going to save the world?
Tom John,
oh,

735
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:20.830
here's Bradley Cooper.
He's taken a pill that makes them super smart.
John.

736
00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:22.700
Oh,
here.
Scarlet Johannson.

737
00:42:22.701 --> 00:42:25.940
They just injected her with something that makes her super smart.
Yeah,

738
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:31.040
I saw the trailer,
that scarlet to him.
What the fuck out of here?

739
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:34.700
It's all white people,
but if you're a it,
you know it's normal.

740
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.060
But if you go to the black theater and you're watching it with surrounded by

741
00:42:38.061 --> 00:42:41.730
black people and you're like,
oh my God,
we're gross.
Yeah,
we're gross.

742
00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:46.190
And we fucking,
we don't,
we don't make any movies for black people.
It's like,

743
00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:46.690
have you listened?

744
00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:49.790
Have you ever listened to opiate Anthony with your kids in the car?
Yes.

745
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:52.690
For like a half a second.
Can you realize it doesn't affect,
like,

746
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.860
I would never be get offended by opie and Anthony.

747
00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.450
I don't even realize what they're talking about.
Like when I listened,
I just go,

748
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.340
oh,
this is great.
It's so entertaining.

749
00:43:01.341 --> 00:43:04.170
And then your kids are in the car and you're like,
Daddy,
what's a Blumkin?

750
00:43:04.171 --> 00:43:07.970
And you're like,
oh fuck,
I never gets that far.
I turned,

751
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:12.960
I turned on the car the other day and Anthony was screaming because she's,
hi,

752
00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.040
I forgot what it was.
It what have been a best of,
I don't know what it was,

753
00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:22.940
but it was just,
it was so ridiculous.
I heard the one,
one sec,
I'm sorry.
Using,

754
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:27.560
he's a cunt.
He's a Co.
It was,
he's a cunt.
Fuck.
What was it about,

755
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:30.320
goddammit.
And I heard that episode before,

756
00:43:30.321 --> 00:43:34.670
so I wanted to hit the button immediately.
I immediately shut it off.

757
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:37.940
I'll listen to their old,
either old episodes when you're like,

758
00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:41.330
when everyone's in Collin,
Patrice,
I listen to,

759
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:42.860
I'll listen to any of the ones Patrice is on.

760
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.410
I was listening to Patrice when the how,
and the other day was,
uh,

761
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.040
Anthony dressed up as a Nazi and Patrice

762
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:55.280
drop it and bombs left and right.
Great.
And He,
uh,

763
00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:57.860
was they were trying to see who'd get picked up quicker.

764
00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.340
A guy who looked like a Nazi or was a rapper or no,

765
00:44:01.341 --> 00:44:06.210
or just a blind versus Nazis.
What it is.
Yeah.
But did he,
um,

766
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.960
did Patrice dress up like he did it go super ghetto.

767
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.160
I think he was just already black.
Oh,
here's the video.
Look,
get to Anthony's,

768
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:17.080
got a goddamn helmet on and they're picking him up before they pick it up a

769
00:44:17.081 --> 00:44:20.050
trees and he's doing the hail Hitler thing and I like the arm up.
Yeah,

770
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.940
that's how he's got a Nazi helmet on

771
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:26.663
Nazi.

772
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:38.610
<v 7>I stopped and I see,
maybe not see brother,</v>

773
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.920
you chose not to over Nigga?

774
00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:53.510
<v 2>No,
no.
I remember who it was they were talking about Ellis.
About uh,</v>

775
00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:58.430
uh,
Jason.
Hello?
Jason Ellis.
Jason Nelson number and a few.
Yeah.
Oh really?
Yeah,

776
00:44:58.431 --> 00:45:02.510
that's what it is.
That's whenever that one aired,

777
00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:08.810
that's when they hit that button.
Fucking Christ.
My kids are just like,
fuck.

778
00:45:08.811 --> 00:45:13.030
You could tell they just open up a door.
There's monsters inside.

779
00:45:13.031 --> 00:45:16.010
Could chunk in the door just shot.
What was that Daddy?
Nothing.

780
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.410
It's nothing in there.
Nothing.

781
00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:23.250
<v 4>I uh,
I did the audio book and my book and I wrote an article,</v>

782
00:45:23.251 --> 00:45:26.520
a chapter about Patrice and I had to decide in their,

783
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:31.100
do I do Patrice has voice or do I just do a regular voice?
So in the,

784
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.720
so in when you buy the audio book and my book,
you hear me going,

785
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.980
it's not even a good,
even a good.
And I was like,

786
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:41.070
do I do that with all black people?
Like when I,
when will Smith talks too,

787
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.620
I make him like I did it,
I did it.
It's done.

788
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:46.390
<v 7>Well Patrice is just so big with it.</v>

789
00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:50.920
<v 2>He's so his,
you know,
his voice was so big and he was kind of almost have to do</v>

790
00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:54.150
<v 4>cause yeah.
Cause you heard,
I was telling him on opiate Anthony,</v>

791
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:56.310
but with the whole thing was that I did it again with cerebral palsy.

792
00:45:56.311 --> 00:45:58.890
He didn't know she had cerebral palsy because I was drinking so much and Patrice

793
00:45:58.891 --> 00:46:01.050
thought that was fucking hilarious.
And he kept saying

794
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.890
<v 7>that is the worst version.
But it's like</v>

795
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.890
<v 2>Diaz impression and you have to do it right.</v>

796
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.910
If you're going to say something that Joey said you,

797
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.800
you kind of have to say it again.
Everybody does.
Everybody does.

798
00:46:17.801 --> 00:46:22.150
If they say something as Joey,
you don't just say like,
if Ari has a joke,

799
00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:25.420
you know,
like I might say it like as me,
I might tell you all are,

800
00:46:25.421 --> 00:46:28.060
he's got this great new joke,
you know about blah blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

801
00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.250
Except if you're describing Ari mad,
then you'll do the

802
00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:33.603
normal mumble.

803
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.610
<v 7>You can't do that.
You can't do that.</v>

804
00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.160
<v 4>What was your will Smith voice though?
I'm saying</v>

805
00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:43.120
<v 2>exactly.
Hey we exactly.</v>

806
00:46:43.121 --> 00:46:44.440
This is Coby Bryant voice.

807
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.860
<v 4>I wrote the n word in the book twice and I was as white people saying it.</v>

808
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:52.190
I didn't realize it because I didn't fucking really pay much attention to the

809
00:46:52.191 --> 00:46:56.300
editing of it.
I just wrote them and then if,
if the publisher liked him,

810
00:46:56.301 --> 00:46:59.180
I was in and I was like,
I read it and was like,
Oh shit,

811
00:46:59.181 --> 00:47:02.120
I've got to say the m word.
And I was thinking for history,

812
00:47:02.121 --> 00:47:06.110
I'll go down as saying the word and despite whether or not I've ever said it,

813
00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:10.310
no one's got me on record saying it.
So I called my buddy Omar Dorsey,
who's on,

814
00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.350
uh,
eastbound and down,
and I was like,
Hey,

815
00:47:12.351 --> 00:47:16.070
can you come and read a passage of my book?
And he's like,
Oh,
I'd be honored.

816
00:47:16.071 --> 00:47:17.020
Thanks.
Oh my God.

817
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:25.780
<v 7>Oh,
he did?
He goes,
how am I supposed to do?
Am I supposed to do this?</v>

818
00:47:25.781 --> 00:47:30.000
Like a white person?
I go,
post sound good that way.
Did it?
He's

819
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.980
<v 4>like,
you know,
I love you,
but I'm getting you out of this one.
Yeah.</v>

820
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.930
He's own up to it.
In the book itself,

821
00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.890
<v 2>book itself,
you would say,
well,
there's a question we'll word in this passage.</v>

822
00:47:42.891 --> 00:47:43.960
So I brought in a good,

823
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:48.910
<v 4>I do.
Oh,
do you?
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.
Fucking 16 hours to read my own audio book.</v>

824
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:53.370
I was like,
oh my God,
I cannot read out loud to save my life.
16 hours.

825
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:58.660
How many hours is the actual audio book?
Three.
Whoa,
that's crazy.

826
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:02.710
I am the worst out loud reader and for like the first two chapters get mad if

827
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:07.480
you fuck it up.
Yeah.
The guy asked me like,
oh the first,
first chapter.
He's like,

828
00:48:07.481 --> 00:48:10.930
hey man,
do you need glasses?
I was like,
no,
I just,
I'm not that good about.

829
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.240
And I was like,
I'll do it drunk.
Everyone wants to hear me do a drunk,

830
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.300
you can't fucking read drunk.
So then I described that day,

831
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:20.050
that day is all useless.
We had to go back and Redo it and then,

832
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:24.790
and then I was also like,
like I'd read a passage and then I'd go on and be like,

833
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:28.720
I'm like,
and then I'd expound on what I just read and kind of was like an,

834
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:33.580
I was like a podcast and that was fucking horrible cause that took like forever

835
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.500
and so that finally the guys like just fucking read it.

836
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.410
So I just read it towards the end,
but it gets better.

837
00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:41.690
<v 2>I think it would be better if you just read it and if you fucked up,</v>

838
00:48:41.691 --> 00:48:44.510
just comment on the fact that you fucked that word up and just keep going on

839
00:48:44.511 --> 00:48:48.920
like that way people would,
they would get,
they'd get the book,
the whole book,

840
00:48:48.921 --> 00:48:52.430
but they'd also get like spirits of you reading the book.

841
00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.250
Like you separating yourself from the book while you're at it.

842
00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:59.360
<v 4>Oh yeah.
I mean they,
I don't know what it's going to sound like but I,
cause I,</v>

843
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.520
I did acknowledge it.

844
00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:05.230
I did what I did fuck up cause I'm a comic so I would work the piece as I was

845
00:49:05.231 --> 00:49:09.580
like if I was on stage.
And did they keep that in or do they edit that stuff?

846
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.420
I think they kept some of it in but they couldn't have kept all of it in.

847
00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:17.470
<v 2>That's so weird though.
The day decide what gets left in and what comes out.</v>

848
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.370
<v 4>This whole to this whole book writing process has been vulnerable,</v>

849
00:49:20.371 --> 00:49:21.250
is fucked because you,

850
00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.490
you really let go of it because it's a totally different industry.

851
00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.230
<v 2>Yeah.
I didn't,
I passed,
I had a book deal.</v>

852
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:31.340
I was just writing the book and they were still giving these old wacky fucking

853
00:49:31.341 --> 00:49:36.140
notes.
Just advice on like how I should talk about things,
what I should describe,

854
00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:39.220
how I was like,
we're not,
this is not happening.
You know,

855
00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.860
you're not involved in the creative process.
I gave them their money back.

856
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:44.000
I was like,
this is crazy.

857
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:49.150
Like they wanted me to essentially write my act down on paper and sell it as a

858
00:49:49.641 --> 00:49:52.490
book.
And they're like,
well George Carlin did it and Jerry Seinfeld did it.

859
00:49:52.491 --> 00:49:55.880
I was like,
ah,
that's nice.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm not doing that.

860
00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.050
I W I write different than I do standup.
It's two different things.

861
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:03.590
Like you can write when you're writing,
like just writing.

862
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:08.090
There's a way that you can express yourself that's unavailable if you're
talking,

863
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:09.683
you know,

864
00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:10.350
<v 4>it's,
it's why you,</v>

865
00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:13.170
the dragon dictate didn't work for me cause you'd talk it into this dragon

866
00:50:13.171 --> 00:50:16.590
dictate and it would put it right into the computer,
like print it.

867
00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:20.800
But it didn't work for me because it sounded spoken like it sounded like and,

868
00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:24.130
and,
and a couple,
like,
one of the hard things for me was I,

869
00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.040
I did that same thing where they wanted to,

870
00:50:26.041 --> 00:50:30.170
all the stories I had told on stage or on podcasts,
I was like,
I can't,

871
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:32.240
I can't do that.
I can't just fill it up with that.
Yeah.

872
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:35.300
They want the stuff that they think they're going to sell.
It's not a,

873
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:37.790
an artistic thing.
It's like,
guess what dummy?

874
00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.890
The same person that told those funny stories.

875
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.750
I can tell you other funny stories.

876
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:45.530
It's like we're not running out of funny stories here.
It's really fascinating.

877
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.860
And like their stories,
I had to put in the book,
I had to put the machine in.

878
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:51.530
I can't not write that in there.
And there's a lot of,

879
00:50:51.531 --> 00:50:53.930
there's like the Will Smith Story.
I had to put it in,

880
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.220
but then I wanted to do the several polls.

881
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:59.090
One I wanted to do one where I met Ralph Sampson and when I was a kid I was,

882
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:03.620
I got off Thompson.
Um,
he was a basketball player and I was,
I went to school at,

883
00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:04.460
I went to,

884
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.860
I was like in eighth grade I decided I really want to be a basketball player.

885
00:51:06.861 --> 00:51:11.861
And so I went to Villanova basketball camp and Ralph Sampson came to speak.

886
00:51:11.901 --> 00:51:15.530
And like the first night I got a concussion and the two best basketball players

887
00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:19.030
got pulled out for drinking.
So the next day I had to sit out with too.

888
00:51:19.031 --> 00:51:21.230
That's possible players and everyone thought we drank together.

889
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.360
So now all of a sudden I'm 15,

890
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.600
14 and everyone thinks I'm cool because I'm partying with the 18 year olds.

891
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:29.030
So Ralph Sampson comes,
I thought this define me.

892
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.220
Ralph Sampson comes up to give a speech.
He's like,

893
00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:33.740
I'm here to talk to you about two things.

894
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.710
There's 5,000 kids on the gym floor.
He said,

895
00:51:36.711 --> 00:51:39.650
we're talking about basketball and we're talking about discipline first.

896
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.660
Let's talk about discipline.
Who in here?
Parties.

897
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:44.690
And I was under the impression we were all gonna put our hands up,

898
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:48.770
but I was the only fucking person.
I just went trunk.
And he was like,
oh,

899
00:51:48.771 --> 00:51:53.240
one person,
5,000 kids.
No one raised her fucking hand.
He's like,
how do you party?

900
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:56.850
I was fucking 13 I know how to,
I didn't,
I never partied in my life.

901
00:51:56.851 --> 00:52:00.860
So all I said was hardy and he fucking lost it.

902
00:52:00.861 --> 00:52:04.700
And 5,000 kids are slapping the gym floor.
Like,
Oh shit,

903
00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.820
we're going to make an example out of you.
Party animal.
He's lost the room.

904
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:12.020
So he brings me up front to the in front of all the kids and he makes me stand

905
00:52:12.021 --> 00:52:15.230
up and he puts a basketball behind my legs like this.

906
00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:19.490
And then one on my arms like this.
And he's like,
we party hardy.
What?

907
00:52:19.491 --> 00:52:20.660
We're going to party hardy today.

908
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:25.400
So I'm standing like this for his whole fucking hour speech with basketball here

909
00:52:25.401 --> 00:52:28.730
and there.
And he's like,
and he keeps coming back to me.
And by the way,

910
00:52:28.731 --> 00:52:31.850
I'm so in my head that I'm,
I'm have social anxiety disorder,

911
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:36.290
but I'm in front of everyone and I'm like being made fun of being mocked that I

912
00:52:36.291 --> 00:52:37.850
wasn't listening to his question to him.
And he's like,

913
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:40.970
you think you'll ever party again?
I just said,
yeah,

914
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:45.650
and the fucking place went bananas.
They're like,
oh.
And he's like,

915
00:52:45.651 --> 00:52:48.590
how do you party hardy?
I was like,
and I didn't know the answer.
I just was like,

916
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:49.610
with two hands,

917
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.390
fucking people are losing you think could do marijuana and now I'm killing.

918
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.510
I'm like,
I'll get to in college and these kids,

919
00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:01.010
I left that gym and everyone wanted to talk to me.
Everyone's like party animal.

920
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:04.280
What are you doing and that you're still holding the basketball between your

921
00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:08.330
legs.
Go home the whole fucking time.
Cracking jokes while I'm cracking jokes.

922
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.250
And how long did you hold the basketball?
An hour.

923
00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:13.520
That's a long time by my cousin Abe almost brought him here today.
I should have,

924
00:53:13.521 --> 00:53:14.360
I didn't even think about it.

925
00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:17.450
My cousin aid was there at the camp even cause he's from Philly.

926
00:53:17.451 --> 00:53:20.190
I didn't know anyone.
My cousin,
he was like,
I didn't even,

927
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.270
I didn't know you partied.
I go,
I don't,
I don't.

928
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.260
I just thought we'd all put our fucking hands up.
He's like,
yeah,

929
00:53:26.261 --> 00:53:27.870
why would you put your hands up if you don't party?
I was like,

930
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:30.270
I want it to be cool.
So yeah,

931
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:33.560
so like so now and then everyone would come up and they'd be like,
party animal,

932
00:53:33.561 --> 00:53:35.730
you partying hard.
I'd be like,
yeah.

933
00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:40.170
But then I became cool at that camp and then I have friends and so I wrote that

934
00:53:40.171 --> 00:53:43.440
story is a little longer and I gave it to them.
I go,
this is the best story.

935
00:53:43.441 --> 00:53:48.300
This defines me.
And they're like,
ah,
I'm not really,
that's hilarious.

936
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:52.260
So it's all partying stories,
but it's like that's a hilarious story.
Oh,
thanks.

937
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.640
Oh,
nutty.

938
00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:58.490
That this could have possibly sent you on a path when you were that young.
Yeah,

939
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.700
13 years old.
I just,
I,
and it's all just wanting to be accepted.
I don't know.

940
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:04.980
Did you ever have one of those moments where you'd go somewhere and you didn't

941
00:54:04.981 --> 00:54:08.640
know anybody?
Sure.
But you felt like everyone fucking grew up together.
Yeah.

942
00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:11.370
That's a weird feeling.
I felt like that a lot as a kid,

943
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.880
but I thought that that define me because then I became the Po.

944
00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:18.990
I became the party animal that kind of lived up to whatever I,
by the way,

945
00:54:18.991 --> 00:54:21.090
I went to high school the very next year.
It didn't know anyone.

946
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:25.350
So I'm sure that kind of,
I was like,
well it worked in Villanova.
So yeah,

947
00:54:25.351 --> 00:54:28.560
there's definitely different personality that develops when kids have to move
to,

948
00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:31.860
right.
If they move from one spot to another spot,
they move more than once.

949
00:54:31.861 --> 00:54:36.480
They developed this,
like there's this weird newcomer personality,

950
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:40.140
you know,
in every romantic kids movie,

951
00:54:40.141 --> 00:54:41.670
the rebel that moved into town,

952
00:54:41.671 --> 00:54:44.970
the new kid that you don't know of any think he smoked cigarettes and fucking

953
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:48.640
twilight style movie or even like karate kid.

954
00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:51.060
He like move into some new town dude,

955
00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:55.480
cry kid fucking the day karate kid came out,

956
00:54:55.481 --> 00:54:59.640
it was my first day at tennis camp and so,
so I go,

957
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.220
I got to fucking can't believe I didn't write about this,
this,

958
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:07.230
I didn't know anyone.
I know anyone.
So then the,
these all the law very into camp.

959
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:09.120
I started meeting the cool kids and they're like,
hey man,

960
00:55:09.121 --> 00:55:11.130
what are you doing today?
I was like,
nothing.
And they're like,

961
00:55:11.131 --> 00:55:12.150
you want to go see karate kid?

962
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.150
And I didn't know anything about it and I was like,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
that'd be cool.

963
00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.880
So like,
cool.
Meet us at mission bell.
That's where this place was.

964
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.360
My Mom's late picking me up,
we're late doing everything.

965
00:55:21.361 --> 00:55:24.840
She drops me off to the movie late and I go in and the movie's already started.

966
00:55:24.841 --> 00:55:25.920
I can't find any of the kids,

967
00:55:25.921 --> 00:55:28.980
but I already bought the ticket and I already have popcorn and a drink and I'm

968
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:31.580
like fuck.
So I just go down and I sit down.

969
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:35.220
I've never seen a movie by myself that time and I just sit down and I keep

970
00:55:35.221 --> 00:55:36.660
looking for him,
but I can't fucking find them.

971
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:40.920
But then the movie starts and it's a great fucking movie and it's a movie about

972
00:55:40.921 --> 00:55:44.610
a loner kid like myself that doesn't know anyone and he's trying to break into

973
00:55:44.611 --> 00:55:47.670
the new group just like I was doing a tennis camp and I really get involved in

974
00:55:47.671 --> 00:55:51.630
it.
I get so involved in the movie that when he does the fucking crane kick and

975
00:55:51.631 --> 00:55:56.460
kicks the guy,
I start bawling fucking crying,
thinking I'm Danielson.

976
00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.370
I'm Dan.
In my head I'm like,
I feel like Daniel son,

977
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.870
the houselights come up and the fucking kids that were had wanted me to meet,

978
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:08.030
we're sitting directly like two rows in front of me and I've heard you weeping.

979
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.550
They heard me crying and I'm sobbing and weeping,
like sobbing,

980
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.870
like a fucking 10 year old cry,
like if you were 10 how'd that work out?

981
00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:20.580
They turn around and they saw me crying and there were about to make fun of me

982
00:56:20.581 --> 00:56:24.040
and they're like,
oh,
you got us,
you got,
we thought you

983
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.860
<v 3>were crying.
You fucking with us.
You were sitting behind us the whole time.</v>

984
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:28.780
And I was like,
yeah,
yeah,
that's it.

985
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:33.910
<v 4>That's it.
And I fucking walked out that movie.
I still to this day,</v>

986
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:35.860
so you,
you had to fake that.

987
00:56:35.861 --> 00:56:38.250
You weren't crying to fake that I wasn't crying and then we all hung out and

988
00:56:38.251 --> 00:56:42.250
they're like,
you can just do that.
Make yourself cry.
I was like,
yeah,
wow.

989
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:46.360
Either credit or movie.
Yeah,
I've definitely cried in movies.
Like what?

990
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.473
Old yeller.

991
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:52.740
<v 3>Oh,
even like boys in the hood.</v>

992
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:56.230
No,
I didn't cry in that.
I cry,

993
00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:01.660
<v 4>watch movies with,
with when things happen.
A little kids.
Oh,
like a ransom.</v>

994
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.930
And I give them watch that movement.
I couldn't,
it's not going to happen.
Yeah,

995
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:08.650
I can't,
I don't want to.
How about the time traveler's wife?
What's that?

996
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.710
That's a movie that I cried really bad at.

997
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:15.880
What is it about this dude who taught can time travel?
But yeah,

998
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.340
it's Eric Bana,
but as a kid,
I'm fucking out of here with that.

999
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:24.630
<v 3>Hi.
Where they,
where they pitched that it was a woman.
She wrote it.</v>

1000
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:28.170
I told Dunkin about it and he goes,
did you read the book?
And I said,
no.

1001
00:57:28.171 --> 00:57:31.680
And he goes,
in the movie,
does he come back and teach himself to Jack?
Off I go,

1002
00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.030
it's not in the movie.
He goes,

1003
00:57:33.031 --> 00:57:36.890
and then they didn't follow the book and the book came back and taught himself

1004
00:57:36.891 --> 00:57:37.471
on a jerk off.

1005
00:57:37.471 --> 00:57:40.920
So you just kind of gain for himself who's a gay pat out to himself.
Yeah.

1006
00:57:40.921 --> 00:57:44.520
But he's only turned on the kids that looked like him.
Exactly.
But only,

1007
00:57:44.521 --> 00:57:48.600
maybe it's 14.
Hey everybody,
go to burp or protect common order.

1008
00:57:48.601 --> 00:57:52.290
My Book Go.
If you see in a bookstore,
buy it please.

1009
00:57:52.291 --> 00:57:56.020
And tweet me a picture of you shirtless reading in a Barnes and noble,
Tom Seger,

1010
00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:57.660
Tom Segura and Brendan Walsh.

1011
00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:01.770
<v 4>Your book,
when you wrote it,
like how much,</v>

1012
00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:05.300
how much input did they have as far as like what you could and couldn't put in?

1013
00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:08.860
Um,
probably 100%.
100%.
Like,
like,
uh,

1014
00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:12.800
like there was things they wanted in there.
There were things I wanted in there,

1015
00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:13.980
there were things they wanted in there.

1016
00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:17.080
So did you like have to meet in the middle?
Yeah,
I met in the middle.
Like it,

1017
00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:21.540
it is like a,
it is probably,
I think 14,
12 chapters.

1018
00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:24.720
It's probably maybe four chapters.

1019
00:58:24.721 --> 00:58:28.020
People heard the story like the machine and,
but uh,

1020
00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:31.200
but the rest of the one I got to,
but then there were ones they wanted to,

1021
00:58:31.201 --> 00:58:33.900
from like the article I told about the time I shit on a pizza box to win an

1022
00:58:33.901 --> 00:58:38.130
election.
Um,
I talk about,
uh,

1023
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.900
I talk about,
uh,

1024
00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:42.630
me and my buddy Eddie took over this town one time that took over it,

1025
00:58:42.631 --> 00:58:45.420
but we told them we were writing a book like right out of college.

1026
00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:49.380
We told him we're writing a book for MTV about partying and then these,

1027
00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:53.040
these girls do a fucking insane party for us.
And they were all like,
fucking,

1028
00:58:53.041 --> 00:58:53.520
I mean it was,

1029
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.400
it was like just out of a movie and then we all drank together and then I'm

1030
00:58:56.401 --> 00:58:59.460
trying to fuck this chick at like three in the morning and she's like,

1031
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.040
she stops me.
She's like,
buddy,
I'm just doing enough to get in the book.

1032
00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:05.730
And I'd forgotten about the book lie.
So I'm like,
well,
book.
She's like,

1033
00:59:05.731 --> 00:59:07.620
you're writing a book.
And I was like,
I'm not writing a fucking book.

1034
00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:10.710
She was like,
that's the only reason we're here.
And I was like,
Oh yeah,
the book.

1035
00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:14.100
So then I wrote at the end of that chapter,
honey,
I don't know where you are,

1036
00:59:14.101 --> 00:59:17.490
what your name is,
but you made it in the fucking book finally,

1037
00:59:17.491 --> 00:59:22.010
after all these years.
That's funny.
Yeah.
So it was fun,
but it

1038
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.780
<v 6>was,
it was,
I don't know.
I probably won't do it again.</v>

1039
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:29.120
Seems like a shit ton of work.
So fucking a lot of work for very little money,

1040
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:33.020
but you've lived a fucked up life,
so it's probably important to document it.

1041
00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.110
Have you ever got an alcohol poisoning?
Have you ever taken it to the next one?

1042
00:59:36.111 --> 00:59:40.200
No,
I haven't.
I've never gotten alcohol poisoning.
But your liver,
you know,

1043
00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:43.160
talking about my liver,
you know they have those fog.
Voila.

1044
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.580
They made it illegal in California.
Duck liver,
inflame duck livers.

1045
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.833
They're delicious.

1046
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:51.140
Then what they do is they take a duck and they put a feed are down its throat

1047
00:59:51.141 --> 00:59:54.350
and they force feed it and people hate it.
You know?
It's like,

1048
00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.990
it becomes like this horrible cruelty issue,

1049
00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:59.960
but meanwhile you can kill them and eat them still.

1050
00:59:59.961 --> 01:00:03.560
You just can't do that to their liver.
It's very strange.
And you,

1051
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:07.250
you're not even supposed to sell it organic.
You can't have organic fog.
Why?

1052
01:00:07.251 --> 01:00:09.860
Which would mean you wouldn't overfeed them.
You just give them a lot of food.

1053
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.010
Just have food around them all the time.
There'll be smaller livers,

1054
01:00:13.011 --> 01:00:17.360
but still delicious.
They don't even allow that,
which is crazy really.
It's like,

1055
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:21.970
but it's still like you need the rest of the animal though.
Docs.

1056
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.580
People eat ducks all the time.
The goose lake,
they had all that shit.

1057
01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:27.500
They ain't geese.
It can still eat it in Vegas.
That right,

1058
01:00:27.501 --> 01:00:30.080
cause I think I saw it in Vegas yesterday.
I'm thinking.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1059
01:00:30.081 --> 01:00:32.870
you can get it in Vegas.
It's a to in France too.

1060
01:00:32.871 --> 01:00:35.960
I think we had it in France or animal cruelty.
Don't get me wrong,

1061
01:00:35.961 --> 01:00:39.860
but what's weird about the fog wall thing is there's ways of doing it ethically.

1062
01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.790
There's ways of doing it where the,
the the,
they actually want to get overfed.

1063
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:48.560
Like they actually go around the feeder.
Like the birds are looking for it.

1064
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:51.770
They want to get fed.
Really?
Yeah.
It's,

1065
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:56.030
it's not necessary to hold their fucking neck like that and shove it down them,

1066
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:58.700
but if you just give them a shitload of food,

1067
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:01.310
you're going to have get a pretty good result.

1068
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:05.360
It might not be as good as stuffing it down their throat,

1069
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:09.770
but the idea is like banning.
It is ridiculous.

1070
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:14.120
Like banning the shooting of a duck's liver.
Oh,
don't answer it.

1071
01:01:14.121 --> 01:01:17.270
We're on podcasts.
Fell.
I see where you're going to say I don't know.
Nevermind.

1072
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:20.790
Go ahead and answer it.
No,
no.
He hung up.
Sorry.
He won't leave a message.

1073
01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:21.021
You though.

1074
01:01:21.021 --> 01:01:24.050
He will not leave a message and then he'll be upset when you don't call him
back,

1075
01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:25.880
but you don't know what it's about.
Well,
that's what he wants.

1076
01:01:25.881 --> 01:01:28.910
He just wants to see miss call on his phone and then he calls you back.

1077
01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:31.040
Anything else?
Yeah,
I texted him one time.

1078
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:35.040
I tried to text him and he was just nothing.
And you're like,
well,
I texted,

1079
01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:37.640
I don't fucking look at that Shit Dawg.
I'm not looking at that shit.

1080
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:42.230
Come on Bert.
Kreischer yeah,
he said he's got rules.
Yeah.

1081
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:46.790
If you want to communicate with the Dawn,
how to follow the rule.
Fucking love.

1082
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:50.180
Joey.
Joey has rules.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like I said,

1083
01:01:50.181 --> 01:01:53.840
he's a perfect example of a guy who like had to be a comic.
You know there's a,

1084
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:57.140
there's a lot of us,
man,
he's just got a guy that I'd like to see a book written.

1085
01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:59.520
What happened with that Tracy Morgan thing?

1086
01:01:59.521 --> 01:02:01.910
Cause Tracy Morgan says that that story's bullshit.

1087
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
You know that story that you did and j more wind up doing for a while and

1088
01:02:07.161 --> 01:02:11.270
stopped doing.
He says it's bullshit.
Is it just lying?

1089
01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:15.380
He just doesn't want people that I knew it when I first told him that he was

1090
01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:17.600
going to say it the first time that story ever got out,
I was like,

1091
01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:19.590
here's one reason I want to tell it.

1092
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:23.910
<v 4>Number one,
Tracy Morgan,
uh,
we'll never remember that story.</v>

1093
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:25.380
He's never going to ever that night with me.

1094
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.350
And he's definitely not going to fuck you.
I never thought he'd ever be like,

1095
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.010
Oh yeah,
that's all true.
But Tony Woods was there.
So I mean,

1096
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:34.140
and Tony Woods says it's totally,
woods remembers that.

1097
01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:36.930
Just like Tony remembers it a little differently than I do,
but we,

1098
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:41.130
what we remember is now that's how you get out of paying the check.
And Tony,

1099
01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:43.530
and I've always said this,
and I've,
and I said this on your podcast,

1100
01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.480
first time I told it was,

1101
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:50.130
and it's one of those things like I wanted to put this story in the book because

1102
01:02:50.131 --> 01:02:54.540
I wanted to clear up whatever rumor there was for good.
And that is when I,

1103
01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:59.070
when I got smoked that with Pete,
with Tracy Morgan,
he asks,

1104
01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.530
I remember saying,
what's in your weed?
And then he,
he said,

1105
01:03:01.531 --> 01:03:04.680
you smoked schermer whatever.
I want to ride over to Tony Woods.

1106
01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:07.110
And Tony Woods was like,
he's just fucking with you.

1107
01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:10.110
So like I've always said that I thought he was fucking with me,

1108
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:12.270
that I didn't think I smoked PCP,

1109
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.300
that he was just fucking with me the whole night.
So I'm like,

1110
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.730
or not,
I don't fucking know.
But,
but I've never,
I've never said,

1111
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:25.670
I've never said like me and him were smoking PCP.
What had happened was Pete,

1112
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.150
the story he heard,

1113
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:31.890
the story everyone had heard was jade Moore's version of it and he added things

1114
01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:34.140
to it.
Well,
it didn't happen to him.
So he didn't care.

1115
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.480
He didn't have an attachment to the truth.
Right.
He,
you know,

1116
01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:37.530
so like in his thing,

1117
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:42.660
I think it's were pretty much definitely smoking PCP all night long and they

1118
01:03:42.661 --> 01:03:44.730
were punching out car windows and having lightening bolt fights.

1119
01:03:44.731 --> 01:03:49.170
It was a much better story his way.
But my way was very attached to the truth of,

1120
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:51.320
of I didn't know I had no fucking

1121
01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:53.180
<v 2>can idea.
What do you think about that?</v>

1122
01:03:53.181 --> 01:03:56.150
About taking a story and then adding a bunch of shit to it?

1123
01:03:56.570 --> 01:04:01.550
Like it's,
it's tricky,
right?
Because it does make it funnier.

1124
01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:05.530
Fuck yeah.
But it's not really,
it's like what,

1125
01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.970
where does it become art?
You know,
it's not,

1126
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.410
it's like a weird collage of reality and paintings,
you know,

1127
01:04:12.411 --> 01:04:16.190
like dude,
a fake background,
like a real life,
but a fake background.

1128
01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:20.130
What kind of looks cool,
but like,
what is this?
This is a picture I go,

1129
01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.730
you telling me a story that really happened or are you just,

1130
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:27.290
is this a like a fictional piece that you've created?
You know,

1131
01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:30.140
it's like one of those,
I was watching that fucking w movie.

1132
01:04:30.141 --> 01:04:33.890
Do you ever see the w movie?
Terrible movie.
Awful movie too.

1133
01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:35.780
We're just so clunky and cartoonish.

1134
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:38.450
It's like an ABC after school special on the former president,

1135
01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.700
but while it's going on,
I was like,

1136
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:45.170
I'm watching people pretend that these were the words that came out of all these

1137
01:04:45.171 --> 01:04:48.290
people's mouth in this order.
Like you don't know.
You weren't there.
I can't.

1138
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:52.370
These people are alive still.
Like,
I can't watch this.
This is so ridiculous.

1139
01:04:52.371 --> 01:04:53.204
I can't watch it.

1140
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:57.070
<v 4>I I'm,
I'm not a,
I've always been very,</v>

1141
01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.240
it's the problem with my storytelling is like the machine story is 100% true.

1142
01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.570
I can't really veered that much off the truth.
That's good though.

1143
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.900
That makes you a good story,
but it makes it difficult.
Like I,

1144
01:05:07.901 --> 01:05:09.490
that's the reason I don't really,

1145
01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:12.190
I don't tell this Tracy Morgan story on stage just because when I tell it,

1146
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.310
it's not very entertaining.
It says entertaining as it is,

1147
01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.300
but it's not like a great story.
There's big fucking Lowell's.

1148
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.360
<v 6>We were just hearing me give you facts of how,
what was next?
What happened next?</v>

1149
01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:26.200
I wrote it in the book.
I would try to be fair to Tracy cause I didn't want,

1150
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.780
I don't want people saying he smoked PCP.

1151
01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.970
Like I don't want him to have to defend that.
I would,

1152
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.410
I would not like that either.

1153
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.900
So I had to write it very fucking accurate to exactly what happened.

1154
01:05:35.901 --> 01:05:38.410
So that when,
if he does read it,
he goes,
oh yeah,
there were,

1155
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:40.150
there had to be more than one night like that.

1156
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:45.880
There had to be open about that,
which is why I was surprised he's,
well,

1157
01:05:45.881 --> 01:05:48.730
he said,
he said,
I will listen to him and NPR.

1158
01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:52.690
This is way before that story ever won a weird world.
Tracy Morgan's on NPR,

1159
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.200
there was an NPR interview,
it's considered,
and he said,

1160
01:05:56.230 --> 01:06:00.070
he had said he'd never done drugs in his entire life.
Oh,
well that makes sense.

1161
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:03.340
And I was like,
he said is yeah.
And so I was like,
okay.

1162
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:07.450
And I saw on Reddit,
he was like,
I've always smoked my own weed.

1163
01:06:07.451 --> 01:06:10.660
I've never spoke PCP.
And then I'm like,
okay.
And in my head I was like,

1164
01:06:10.661 --> 01:06:13.750
well I just,
I don't,
those two statements are mutually exclusive,

1165
01:06:13.751 --> 01:06:15.220
but that's why I was like,
that's why I was like,

1166
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.990
that's why I never wanted to tell the fucking story cause I was like,

1167
01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:19.960
he says he's never done drugs.
I've done them with,
I've smoked weed with him.

1168
01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:25.790
I think it's just like,
you kinda just let Tracy Morgan be Tracy Morgan.
Hey,

1169
01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:30.770
probably talk about that.
Does that story's done.
He said it.
It's done.

1170
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.730
I would like to say nothing but good things about him from here on out.

1171
01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.080
I say in the book,

1172
01:06:35.081 --> 01:06:39.670
he is a fucking a well calculated smart guy who knows what the fuck he's doing.

1173
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.970
It's funny shit man.
He's fucking hilarious too.
Makes me laugh all the time.

1174
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.210
Bums me out that he hears my name and it and it fucking make and he's just like,

1175
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.860
Oh man,
that fucking guy.
Maybe he doesn't,
you know,

1176
01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:53.260
maybe you'll see it one day or maybe meet him and he starts smacking me around

1177
01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:56.950
maybe.
And Red van has to save you.
Do you think you,

1178
01:06:56.951 --> 01:06:58.970
what do you think Brian would jump in front of a bullet for you?

1179
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:02.210
You'd see my Jordans and be like,
damn,
all right.
Yeah.

1180
01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:04.660
I think Brian would save my life.

1181
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:08.410
What do you think about when people would see your Jordans and have respect for

1182
01:07:08.411 --> 01:07:11.080
you and stop fighting?
Did I got some pretty sweet Jordans?

1183
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.800
I don't think it works that way.
Good luck trying though.
Yeah.

1184
01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:17.750
What do I think of when you think about when the like,
like,

1185
01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:20.980
cause I read a lot of like comics,
books,
Comedians,
books.

1186
01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:24.880
One of the things I was disconnected with was when guys would just,

1187
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:30.390
it seemed like they just would reinvent their history and just be like a lie

1188
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.930
about it or maybe just not like,
not own up to things.

1189
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.793
Yeah.

1190
01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:42.040
<v 2>Uh,
I don't know.
You know,
I've only read a little bit of a few comics books.</v>

1191
01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:45.580
I've never read a whole comics writing from start to finish.

1192
01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:49.450
I've read books on comics,
like a,
the Kinison books his brother wrote.

1193
01:07:49.451 --> 01:07:52.890
And um,
I read a little bit of,
um,

1194
01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:58.330
of Steve Martin's book,
but I get bored.
I get bored reading about,
you know,

1195
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.090
I get it.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,

1196
01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.260
I think that if I want to hear a comic,
uh,

1197
01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:08.350
if I wanted to read some comics writing,
most of the time I'd want to read,

1198
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.500
you know,
what,
what,
what's their thought process like what do they,

1199
01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:14.710
what do they think about things like what,
what,
what's happening in their life?

1200
01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.370
You know what,
um,

1201
01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.820
<v 6>you know,
what do they think about the world that we live in?
Like what are their,</v>

1202
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:23.870
what are their thoughts that couldn't be condensed to a stand up act?

1203
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:27.290
You know what I mean?
Like you'd rather hear someone's process,

1204
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:30.350
write a book about their process or the way they think or the way they see

1205
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:34.090
things as opposed to just like,
just,
just for tonic.

1206
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:37.820
My mom moved in with my Stepdad who was a real piece of shit.
You know,
like,

1207
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:41.730
I've heard those too many stories like that before.
You know,
that's not my

1208
01:08:43.450 --> 01:08:47.450
fucking,
I that that white guy in the black movie theater life where you go,

1209
01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.510
God damn white privilege.
Holy Shit.
What do you mean?

1210
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:53.000
Like where you were talking about with when you were in the black movie theater?

1211
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54.170
Like I don't think I've,

1212
01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:58.250
I don't think I've had any of the struggle that anyone has in their life.

1213
01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:03.380
And I think that can cause anxiety to some people.
So you start thinking,

1214
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:05.840
when's that going to happen?
When's the struggle happened?

1215
01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.370
When's the bad thing happened?

1216
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:12.230
Like death or cancer or loss of a child or a kidnapping or a fucking school

1217
01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:14.840
shooting and your kid does it.
But you think about that shit all the time.

1218
01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:17.870
You're always thinking about like bad things happening all the time.
Yeah.

1219
01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:19.760
You just put that in the book.

1220
01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.880
How you're always thinking about bad things happening all the time.
You don't,

1221
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:27.170
you don't think like that you can.
No.
You know,
I can.
I mean,

1222
01:09:27.171 --> 01:09:31.520
but I don't let it happen.
Yeah,
I don't,
yeah,
I just,
I stopped those thoughts.

1223
01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.050
Really?
Yeah.
They don't help you.
I know it's Paul.
I'm not stupid.

1224
01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.350
I know that people could shoot people.
I know that meteors can land.

1225
01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:42.260
I know the earthquake had hit at any moment,
but

1226
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:45.560
right now it's okay.
Feel that.

1227
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:50.220
<v 1>Nothing.
So here's the problem that most of your time is going to be fine,</v>

1228
01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.120
and everybody sits around waiting for the one moment when the fucking tsunami

1229
01:09:54.121 --> 01:09:58.770
hits instead of enjoying all the moments up until that point.
So what?

1230
01:09:58.771 --> 01:10:01.200
You're going to be bobbing around in the middle of the ocean,

1231
01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:05.310
gasping for air going,
I was right,
I was right,
you were wrong,
and I was right.

1232
01:10:05.311 --> 01:10:09.270
We're all fucking dead.
You know when?
Then you're dead.
Too stupid.

1233
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:12.780
But the problem is the now.
Right now,

1234
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:17.990
that's what people are so terrified of and terrible at managing people who are

1235
01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:22.350
terrible at managing the constant state,
the state of right now.

1236
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:26.520
So you're always looking for the future and you always worried about the past.

1237
01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:31.260
You're always looking towards some moment where it's going to all go bad and the

1238
01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:34.980
fucking sky's going to turn black and lightening bolts are going to go sideways

1239
01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:39.630
through the fucking town.
Everybody's worried about that,
but not enjoying,

1240
01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.160
not enjoying,
not things happening.
You're fine,
you're fine.
I'm fine.

1241
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.180
One day I'm going to have cancer.
You don't have cancer now.
Okay?
And if you do,

1242
01:10:50.181 --> 01:10:54.710
you're still alive.
You know,
if you have hep c,
well you least,
you can say,

1243
01:10:54.711 --> 01:10:57.350
I have hep c when you're dead.
You can even say that

1244
01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:02.330
people are real bad at now.
The fucking,

1245
01:11:02.331 --> 01:11:04.610
so you're always worried about this and that and that and this.

1246
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:08.270
You don't have to be okay.
If it happens,
it happens,

1247
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:11.810
but right now it's not happening.
Concentrate on right now.

1248
01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.400
That's what people suck at.
People suck

1249
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.990
<v 6>at living in the present.
It's very,
very uncomfortable for a lot of people.</v>

1250
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.890
I think if you don't live in the moment,
you have a hard time writing.
Oh yeah,

1251
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:27.690
I know.
I've been,
I've been in your own head.
Oh yeah.
Like Hey,
fuck you.

1252
01:11:27.691 --> 01:11:28.890
Just to go.
Seriously.

1253
01:11:28.891 --> 01:11:32.820
I just spent fucking three hours in bed worrying.

1254
01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:37.740
Can I feel my liver touching my my rib cage and then not living in like the

1255
01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:40.470
flame.
Does it have,
does that happen?

1256
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:45.120
Does it really have your liver is probably enormous.
Oh,
am I fucking left side?

1257
01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.040
The pain is what?
Your fucking rights side.

1258
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.530
It's on your right side because your liver is on your right side.
Yes.

1259
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.950
I don't even bother googling and now you're upset when you get in with a left

1260
01:11:55.951 --> 01:11:58.260
hook.
Think about where you get hit with a left hook.

1261
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:03.480
I've had pain here like in my heart.
It's below,
but it's like right here,

1262
01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:07.450
factory.
We,
your deck is dude.
I was not my liver off.
Fuck.

1263
01:12:07.451 --> 01:12:10.470
That makes me feel so much better.
Well,
it's probably your kidneys.
Your fuck.

1264
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:12.630
I think it might be.
I think that might have kidney stones.

1265
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:15.660
He breaking all those goddamn things I'm going to,
I need to fucking,

1266
01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:19.020
I would like to do one cycle of growth just to get my body back,

1267
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.270
like just to get,
it doesn't work like that.

1268
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:27.640
I just want to take one pill.
That brings me back to 20 everything.

1269
01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.980
Oh No,
no.
It doesn't help with healing.
Helps with healing,

1270
01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:34.290
but you're not going to heal the shit that's broken.

1271
01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:37.710
Like you can't just do a cycle of steroids and everything starts what you might

1272
01:12:37.711 --> 01:12:40.290
have wrong with you if you're seeing heal everything.
Like what do you got?

1273
01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:42.870
Do you need surgery?
I don't know.
My back is all fucked up.

1274
01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.020
Fucking bulging discs and shit.
Yeah.

1275
01:12:46.021 --> 01:12:49.060
You know you got to take care of yourself son growth.

1276
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:51.210
I was just like,

1277
01:12:51.211 --> 01:12:54.310
yeah I thought maybe if I got on growth I get inspired to take care of it.

1278
01:12:54.311 --> 01:12:56.090
Count how often you work out a lot.

1279
01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:00.840
I just started doing a lot of core and like the yoga where you do like double up

1280
01:13:00.841 --> 01:13:03.660
when you do the hold the pose and then you pump it.
Um,

1281
01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:07.110
but I just got these arm bars and my back cause I was like I'm going to fucking

1282
01:13:07.111 --> 01:13:10.010
fix my core hanging out with Stan.
Hope I think I have a hernia is too.

1283
01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.140
I'm fucking,
let's just do,
just open a bottle of fucking whiskey.

1284
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:20.790
This is a fucking,
I'm what's matter what?
Nothing.
Trying to get whiskey now.

1285
01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.470
I've had three days of honesty,

1286
01:13:24.471 --> 01:13:28.140
sincerity that I thought I could feel my liver now.
No,
it's on the other side.

1287
01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:31.440
You have any idea what to fucking,
do you ever go to the doctor once a year?

1288
01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:34.470
I'll go next week.
And what you fucking gearing up for that.

1289
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:37.770
What's the thought process behind that?

1290
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:40.800
Do you ever worry that you might be giving yourself something but thinking about

1291
01:13:40.801 --> 01:13:45.590
it all the time?
I think about that too.
I,

1292
01:13:45.591 --> 01:13:48.690
uh,
I do,
I definitely prepped for the doctor.

1293
01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:51.810
Like I don't go in raw like I fucking have a week of by,

1294
01:13:51.811 --> 01:13:54.090
but I just started not drinking on planes.

1295
01:13:54.091 --> 01:13:57.000
That was my biggest thing was just started,
just started.

1296
01:13:57.390 --> 01:14:01.920
So every time you take a plane flight,
you would get hammered every time.
Wow.

1297
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:06.150
And that,
I was like,
that's not that I can genuinely feel that.

1298
01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:09.030
Does anybody ever reached out to you?
Like a doctor drew type dude,
Dr Joo,

1299
01:14:09.031 --> 01:14:11.890
I talked to doctor about it.
What did he say?
He's like,
it's bad

1300
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.440
<v 3>while you're,
you're,
you're an alcoholic.
No,
no,
no.</v>

1301
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:17.380
It doesn't say I'm an alcoholic because here's the other thing is that I can

1302
01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.580
totally not drink,
but I couldn't.
The thing is I couldn't not drink on planes.

1303
01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.460
I really genuinely could not,
not drink on planes.

1304
01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:27.010
Like I got to a place that if I was on a plane or if I was getting on a plane,

1305
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:32.220
I had to drink and I would be physically ill having to put alcohol in my mouth

1306
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:35.950
at like for a six in the morning flight on a Sunday and you're just like,

1307
01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:38.110
I don't fucking,
I like gagging going,

1308
01:14:38.111 --> 01:14:41.560
this is disgusting by need to calm down because I'm freaking the fuck out.

1309
01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.190
It's weird that that's the one public place where it's totally acceptable to get

1310
01:14:45.191 --> 01:14:46.420
fucked up.
Yeah.

1311
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:50.560
I mean the plane is the one public place where they're the people that work

1312
01:14:50.561 --> 01:14:54.920
there who are also involved in making sure you're safe,
serve you booze.

1313
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:58.690
I mean,
how weird is that?
Like it's totally,
I mean,

1314
01:14:58.691 --> 01:15:01.860
would you like a Mimosa and they all see you and then you want to double that

1315
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:03.220
always doubled for half the price.

1316
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.500
That's the right at the first thing they ever hear in an airport.

1317
01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:08.860
Can I get a jack on the rocks?
Would you like a double for half the price?
Sure.

1318
01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.630
Done.
Double for half the price.
The second one.
Second one's hot half.
Wow.

1319
01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:17.350
Yeah.
But they're trying to get you fucked up so they can sell,
sell booze,

1320
01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:18.520
not people who are scared.

1321
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:21.680
Why isn't there the junk or on the plane now you never see like the [inaudible]

1322
01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.950
or there are,
oh they are if you fly as much as I do,

1323
01:15:23.951 --> 01:15:27.790
you see aggressively drunk people and the arguments on planes,

1324
01:15:27.791 --> 01:15:31.390
which is really uncomfortable.
The problem is as a guy who drank on planes,

1325
01:15:31.391 --> 01:15:33.640
I was never,
I was always well below the radar.

1326
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:38.190
Like I never caused drama if I never pushed it when it came to drinks,

1327
01:15:38.191 --> 01:15:41.330
if I felt like I had ordered too many I would stop and,

1328
01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.790
and I was well aware of it.

1329
01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:47.680
And then when you see it and then when we went to Hawaii,
like recently,

1330
01:15:47.681 --> 01:15:51.070
like a few weeks ago,
Leanna came off the road a fly in from like,

1331
01:15:51.071 --> 01:15:53.260
I don't know where it was by flying in and I'm coming in hot.

1332
01:15:53.261 --> 01:15:54.120
Like you can tell like I'm,

1333
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:57.940
I've been drinking on the plane a lot and I'm a flying like every other day and

1334
01:15:57.941 --> 01:16:01.840
Leanne's like pulled the plugs.
He goes,
no booze on this trip.
And went,
what?

1335
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:04.090
She goes,
no booze on this trip.
You're gonna hang out with the family.

1336
01:16:04.091 --> 01:16:05.950
You're going to connect with the family.
And I was like,

1337
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:10.870
this is a problem in the crusher household.
I said,
I said,
no.
I said,
okay,

1338
01:16:10.871 --> 01:16:13.330
I can do that in Hawaii about on the plane.
She goes,
no booze on the plane.

1339
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:17.500
See if you can do it.
See if you can do it.
And so I was like,
can I take a Xanax?

1340
01:16:17.501 --> 01:16:22.050
And she was like,
yeah,
Jesus,

1341
01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:26.170
Fun and so much.
But you take a nap.
I don't have that brain,
Brian.

1342
01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:29.770
Oh my God,
Brian.
I don't ever,
if I have something to do,

1343
01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:31.870
I would never sleep through an alarm.
I love,

1344
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:35.710
I literally stay awake thinking I got to wake up in the morning.
Like I'll,

1345
01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:39.880
I'll sleep half,
half.
Like,
uh,
like I got an early,
I don't want to miss my alarm.

1346
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:43.900
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
I don't,

1347
01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.770
why didn't she say you can take a Xanax if you're trying to stay sober to me on

1348
01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:52.600
a plane,
I'm getting Xanax puts it gets you fucked up right now it's very mild.

1349
01:16:52.601 --> 01:16:55.240
And I talked to doctor drew about it because I was concerned.
So I was like,

1350
01:16:55.241 --> 01:16:58.000
I don't want to take,
be taken Xanax.
He goes,
one,
what you're taking,

1351
01:16:58.001 --> 01:16:59.920
what I take is what I would take to fly now.

1352
01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:03.520
So I'll take it to fly and it's all only time I take it is half a milligram.

1353
01:17:03.690 --> 01:17:04.570
He was half a milligram.

1354
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:09.710
Your body processes it that like less than a shot of Tequila.
Hmm.
He's like,

1355
01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:10.490
it's that

1356
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:13.940
<v 6>healthy for you.
He said the problem is,
I'll see for liver wise,</v>

1357
01:17:13.941 --> 01:17:17.600
I'm talking about it was not healthy for me.
It's just not bad for you.

1358
01:17:17.601 --> 01:17:21.870
It's not bad for you.
Okay.
Um,
and I take it healthy.

1359
01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:26.060
It's not healthy morning with their fruit.
It's a fruit salad and Xanax.

1360
01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.940
Oddly enough,
it does take your blood pressure down.

1361
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:32.570
It makes me calmer and it allows my food to process more efficiently.

1362
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.540
Imagine they found a Xanax,
like does shit like that.

1363
01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.670
It allows your body to process things better.

1364
01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.110
I find I learn better when I'm on Xanax.
Dude.
Have you ever had a,

1365
01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:46.070
have you ever had the ADHD medicine?
The,
what?
Is that Adderall.
Adderall.
No,

1366
01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.720
no.
We talk about it all the time though.
I know.
I know it,
dude.

1367
01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:50.120
He's got a problem.
I know.

1368
01:17:50.121 --> 01:17:54.050
It's a couple dudes who have a problem with it is in fact,
yeah.

1369
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:57.340
One that's got a real problem with it though.
Yeah,
it's amazing.
You know,

1370
01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:02.490
never tried it.
Scared.
Really not interested.
Oh,
it's,
it's,
you can focus like it.

1371
01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:07.070
My chat a whole lot to do anything that it speeds me up,
man.

1372
01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:11.640
I'm trying to stay calm.
You and sandy says,
I don't want that either.

1373
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:15.200
I'm fine.
I smoke a little weed.
Weed is better for you.

1374
01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:20.120
We'd is better for your liver then Xanax.
I'm not interested in those pill highs,

1375
01:18:20.121 --> 01:18:22.370
man.
I'm,
maybe it's a good one.
I don't know.

1376
01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.430
But those pill Heizer they're creepy to me.
I don't know.

1377
01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:30.410
I don't want to enjoy it.
I like it.
And then be looking to support some pill,

1378
01:18:30.411 --> 01:18:31.760
high company and,
but you know,

1379
01:18:31.761 --> 01:18:34.940
it's really hypocritical on my fault on my part because what is Xanax?

1380
01:18:34.941 --> 01:18:35.900
It's just technology.

1381
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:39.230
Somebody figured out how to isolate some compounds that do something very

1382
01:18:39.231 --> 01:18:43.760
particular to the human body,
like why would I be against that?
I love science.

1383
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:48.200
I love the idea of the constant innovation and that's what that is.

1384
01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:53.270
Someone figured out a way to alter human neurochemistry.
I just don't trust me.

1385
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:57.890
That's why like I said,
things like Adderall,
I'm like [inaudible] not for me.

1386
01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:01.060
I'm too crazy.
What if I like it?
What if I like and I started,

1387
01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.540
I have really good self control,

1388
01:19:02.690 --> 01:19:06.260
but if I started taking Adderall and getting a lot of shit done,

1389
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:10.610
I could see me justifying taken Adderall a lot and getting shit done.

1390
01:19:10.611 --> 01:19:15.611
What time to get shit done and just fucking just fucking ramp up with some

1391
01:19:15.771 --> 01:19:19.370
Adderall and start rebuilding a wing of my fucking house.
If that's what you do.

1392
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:23.480
Yeah.
I'm not interested in that.
It's like spinach.
Yeah.
I'm trying to stay calm.

1393
01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:27.470
I thought I thought it Adderall would be great to write a book.
I bet it would.

1394
01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.390
I've heard of people snorting Adderall or a friend who's a author,
allegedly,

1395
01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:37.330
he's just snort Adderall.
And uh,
his wife got mad at a beach,

1396
01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:40.250
you snorting Adderall.
And he's like,
I'm just trying to fucking write the book.

1397
01:19:40.251 --> 01:19:43.430
She was like,
you're fucking snorting it.
He said,
well that's the most difficult.

1398
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:47.120
I don't care.
Just take it to take it and wait an hour.

1399
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:51.590
Do you have to fucking snort it like this big Duke had?
He's like,
what do you,

1400
01:19:51.591 --> 01:19:53.750
what do you care about the delivery method?
She's like,

1401
01:19:53.751 --> 01:19:56.060
I'm not having this argument with you.
Don't start drugs in my house.

1402
01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.800
I told you my dad was doing that speed for a long time.
Your Dad was doing speed.

1403
01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:06.170
I told you a long time ago.
It was probably three years ago.
But yeah,
he uh,

1404
01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:11.100
he was,
the doctors prescribed it.
Oh.
And he was taking the pill and it was,

1405
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:13.080
and he didn't realize it was speed and he was just like,

1406
01:20:13.081 --> 01:20:15.010
I'm getting so much shit done.
And,

1407
01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:20.140
and you said it is the other phen phen phen was one was a [inaudible] was a fan

1408
01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:26.120
fan trim spa.
What does that stuff,

1409
01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:30.390
they ain't in Nicole Smith Eia Sta.
So didn't that what stuck they got,

1410
01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:33.210
they pulled a lot of that shit off the market.
Right.
Like rip fuel,

1411
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.420
you can't buy that anymore.
Right.
I have a bottom of terms.
Spotlight.

1412
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:38.970
Nicole's son died in the waiting room.

1413
01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:43.740
Overdosed in the waiting room at her deathbed.
Daddy.
Really?
Yeah.

1414
01:20:43.741 --> 01:20:48.741
Like she was overdosed and dying and then he overdosed and died or wait,

1415
01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.630
maybe wait,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm sorry.
He died.

1416
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:56.490
She had a baby and he died in the waiting room for the baby.
Oh God.
Man.

1417
01:20:56.491 --> 01:20:57.324
That fucking,

1418
01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:01.510
<v 1>yeah,
it's not a good role model.
That and Nicole,</v>

1419
01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:05.170
is that really going to teach you the ins and outs of life?

1420
01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:10.840
Character Development?
No.
Fucking ah,
so crazy.

1421
01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.950
I have a,
uh,
a family member that's got the problem with the oxys.
Oh,

1422
01:21:14.951 --> 01:21:17.620
we have lots of family members with those guy was totally normal.

1423
01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:22.090
Got Injured at work,
back problems,
just like bad,
lower back.

1424
01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:25.780
Dr Hooks him up with the pills.
Boom.
He's off to the races now.

1425
01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:28.860
He's a fucking complete total loser and can't keep a job.
He was all,

1426
01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:33.100
I'm knew that kid from early age,
it's always worked,

1427
01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:36.910
always been responsible,
you know,
cat,
a little nutty but always on the ball.

1428
01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:40.680
Got Things done.
All he needed was that getting hooked on those auctions.

1429
01:21:40.690 --> 01:21:45.070
That was his checkout.
Donesville pain pills are so fucking good.

1430
01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:49.480
I can,
I can imagine.
I can totally imagine.
I just never done them.

1431
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:52.300
You don't like after your surgeries with your back?
Nope.

1432
01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:56.940
Well I did one with one surgery,
my first ACL surgery where they uh,

1433
01:21:56.941 --> 01:22:00.400
it was a very particularly painful way of doing it because a,

1434
01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:05.190
they did what's called the Patella tendon ligament,
a PCL.
Um,

1435
01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:09.670
they take the um,
the PTL,
um,
and they take a slice of it.

1436
01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:13.000
Like say if your Patella tendon is about that wide,

1437
01:22:13.001 --> 01:22:15.280
they might take like a third of it and that Strip,

1438
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:19.420
cause you did Patel attendance really big.
You don't need that to be that big.

1439
01:22:19.421 --> 01:22:21.970
It's sort of over designed.
So they take a piece of it,

1440
01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.120
then the open you up and then they screw it in and they create a new ligament

1441
01:22:27.221 --> 01:22:32.221
with your own body and then your body accepts it immediately because it's yours.

1442
01:22:32.890 --> 01:22:37.510
But you have a screw in the bones of your upper and lower leg and you have this

1443
01:22:37.511 --> 01:22:39.070
ligament that's a part of your Patella.

1444
01:22:39.071 --> 01:22:42.400
The whole thing is fucking inflame and swollen.
It's pretty painful.

1445
01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.430
And they gave me one of those,
we couldn't figure out which one it was,

1446
01:22:45.431 --> 01:22:47.650
viking or percosets.
But uh,

1447
01:22:47.651 --> 01:22:51.340
I took one and I felt so fucking dumb.

1448
01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:56.810
I just was like,
just dumb.
Just doll.
My mind was shot.

1449
01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:57.161
I was like,

1450
01:22:57.161 --> 01:23:01.870
I'd way rather deal with the pain and the pain was excruciating.

1451
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:06.190
It was,
I would get up,
the real pain was when I would lie there,
um,
on the bed,

1452
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.660
<v 2>like watching TV.
And then when I would get up,
when I put my foot on the ground,</v>

1453
01:23:10.661 --> 01:23:15.661
all the blood would rush to my knee and it was like laser beams and razor blades

1454
01:23:17.051 --> 01:23:21.690
and sand and hot lava and does

1455
01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:26.860
the whole knee was on fire.
So that was like for a few days,

1456
01:23:26.861 --> 01:23:30.940
but that was better than the Vicodin dude.
We take fucking him for Sunburns,

1457
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:38.020
<v 6>Florida.
If you've got a really bad sunburn.
He goes,
if I get in his sleep,
okay,</v>

1458
01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:39.490
Laura though,
man,

1459
01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:45.310
<v 2>have the pain really shut pain off.
Why?
Because you can deal with it.</v>

1460
01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:49.240
But I go,
people fester on pain.
I mean,
there's some excruciating pain.

1461
01:23:49.241 --> 01:23:51.730
Don't get me wrong.
I mean it's not all pain is not the same,

1462
01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:55.990
but the pain of like surgeries,
like,
like when I had my nose fixed,
I had a septum

1463
01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:00.180
<v 6>this.
Well before I knew you and I saw,
didn't you do a video of you training it?</v>

1464
01:24:00.181 --> 01:24:00.290
Yeah.

1465
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:04.220
<v 2>Tom's correct.
Yeah.
What time's the girl was in the answer.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1466
01:24:04.221 --> 01:24:05.720
We did a video because,
um,

1467
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:09.440
I wanted people to know that it was no big deal because I was terrified to doing

1468
01:24:09.441 --> 01:24:13.430
it and I waited a long time to do it.
My nose was broken when I was like five.

1469
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:15.770
I fell down a flight of stairs when I was five.

1470
01:24:15.771 --> 01:24:17.600
And like my whole life growing up,

1471
01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:22.400
my nose was fucked from everything from sports,
from martial arts.

1472
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:25.100
It was fucked.
It was just,
there was nothing in there,
but just,

1473
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:30.530
it was just a blocked up by scar tissue.
And so when they opened it up,

1474
01:24:30.531 --> 01:24:32.780
they actually made it a little wider.
Like you can actually,

1475
01:24:32.781 --> 01:24:34.610
I can tell the difference in pictures.
Look,

1476
01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:38.360
looks wider because he opened it up and cut the turbinates.

1477
01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.120
They're these like these things inside these lumps.

1478
01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.110
He cut it and he put these plastic splints in there and stretched it all out.

1479
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:49.460
And then these other,
uh,
these sponges get stuffed into the,

1480
01:24:49.461 --> 01:24:52.040
the holes like beside the plastic splints.

1481
01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.310
And so the sponges stay in your nose for,
I think it was like a week.

1482
01:24:55.311 --> 01:24:58.970
I don't remember how many days the sponges come out and then two weeks later

1483
01:24:58.971 --> 01:25:02.170
they pull the plastic strips out and you just got this,
oh,
it's this,

1484
01:25:02.210 --> 01:25:04.100
is this you cleaning it?
This is me.

1485
01:25:04.190 --> 01:25:08.420
Like right after the surgery I had to clean it with a waterpik.

1486
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:10.140
I would use a waterpik

1487
01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:13.500
<v 6>skinny Tom Ziglar is,
it's like a baby.</v>

1488
01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:18.520
<v 2>Okay.
Barrick time,
poor little child.
He gained a company,
parents.
So,</v>

1489
01:25:18.521 --> 01:25:20.860
uh,
you will you use this waterpik

1490
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:22.820
<v 6>can you pump it up clean?
Yeah,</v>

1491
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:26.270
<v 8>yeah,
exactly.
My operation</v>

1492
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:30.090
twice a day or I take some water.

1493
01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:36.220
<v 6>Special nostrils attachment.
That's like a Neti Pot,</v>

1494
01:25:36.221 --> 01:25:38.680
right?
Yeah.
Hold on.
Steroids.

1495
01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:43.860
I was blowing mads sons if photos you sent us picture messaging back.

1496
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:48.400
Yeah,
I put on a,
I put them on Twitter.
Some of them,
some of them were so big,

1497
01:25:48.401 --> 01:25:52.270
the boogers was so big.
It looks like I faked it.
It looks like I,

1498
01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:54.040
I brought in some CGI boogers.

1499
01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:57.340
I showed one at a time with the airport and he started heaving.

1500
01:25:57.670 --> 01:26:00.360
He started mu immediately

1501
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:04.070
<v 2>was hurling.
Yeah.
That was um,</v>

1502
01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.920
<v 1>but they gave me all kinds of shit they gave me prescriptions for.</v>

1503
01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.020
He gave me prescriptions for two different pain pills.

1504
01:26:10.230 --> 01:26:13.320
And I remember after the operation,
walking around my house going,
I'm fine.

1505
01:26:13.321 --> 01:26:16.050
Like I don't need anything.
And um,
my mind was like,

1506
01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.940
do you want to take the prescription and stuff?
And I was like,

1507
01:26:17.941 --> 01:26:19.980
I'm not taking shit.
Like,
I'm fine.
Like,

1508
01:26:19.981 --> 01:26:22.020
what is everybody fucking complaining about?
It was nothing.

1509
01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.960
It was literally nothing.
It was like,
oh no,

1510
01:26:24.961 --> 01:26:29.640
it feels slightly uncomfortable in my nose.
But people tweak,
they start freaking,

1511
01:26:29.641 --> 01:26:32.550
I mean,
they caught the turbinates,
they stuffed it,

1512
01:26:32.670 --> 01:26:37.440
they cut out all the scar tissue,
the whole deal.
And I was like,
nothing.

1513
01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:41.100
You know,
it's just like a little little achy.
Like so what?

1514
01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.170
It wasn't anything serious.

1515
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:48.350
But a lot of people are like any little slight uncomfort feeling any slight

1516
01:26:48.361 --> 01:26:51.690
discomfort like,
yeah,
maybe.
I mean lane pills,

1517
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:55.710
it's just like a door that just opens up and gives you a free ride.

1518
01:26:55.900 --> 01:27:00.360
Just a free ride to start doing pills.
You know,
a free ride.
Just,
yeah,
come on.

1519
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:04.200
You got a free ride.
Very injured.
You need medication.

1520
01:27:04.201 --> 01:27:07.590
Mr Kreischer recursion and next thing you know,

1521
01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:11.460
you're lying in bed with your feet propped up and you're in fucking Xanax.

1522
01:27:11.461 --> 01:27:12.460
Land Du du,

1523
01:27:12.461 --> 01:27:17.180
Du du Du du Du pump pump pump him.

1524
01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:18.160
Why do you like the dead?

1525
01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:23.150
<v 6>Explain that.
When I fly lately I've been listening to the dead.
Just a nice,</v>

1526
01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:25.850
you don't have to worry about it.
It's a,
it reminds me of college.

1527
01:27:25.851 --> 01:27:29.870
It reminds me of like a time when I literally lived in a microcosm of just

1528
01:27:29.871 --> 01:27:34.460
having a great time when you could tap out,
get off the grid.
Like I was like,

1529
01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:38.150
like it's a reason I cut off the grid.
Yeah.
You mean like

1530
01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:44.620
you can't like can't really tap out as easy as I could back then because you're

1531
01:27:44.621 --> 01:27:48.610
not all I have is one phone and it was in my house.
Oh,
you could,

1532
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:53.150
you could literally get a bag of weed and with some frisbees and just be gone

1533
01:27:53.151 --> 01:27:55.790
from the world and you,
and you were in the moment.

1534
01:27:55.791 --> 01:27:59.120
I was really in the moment back then because you were like talking to your

1535
01:27:59.121 --> 01:28:02.000
people and no one was going into their pocket looking at their hands.

1536
01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.200
I was talking to this lady today and I was dropping my daughter off at school

1537
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:09.020
and she goes,
wouldn't you love to be their age again?

1538
01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:12.890
She was an older lady and I said,
I don't know.
I said,
I think,
uh,

1539
01:28:12.891 --> 01:28:17.330
I think the world is way more complicated now for them than it was for us.
And,

1540
01:28:17.331 --> 01:28:21.170
uh,
she goes,
oh,
you got that right.
And so I leave,

1541
01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:22.460
I say goodbye to the little one.

1542
01:28:22.461 --> 01:28:25.730
I get in the car and I started driving off and as I'm driving,

1543
01:28:25.731 --> 01:28:26.780
that's all I could think about.

1544
01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:31.400
All I could think about is how crazy it would be to be a baby today to be a baby

1545
01:28:31.401 --> 01:28:33.980
today.
And you know,
you're going to have to grow up.
Why?

1546
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:35.750
By the time you're in high school,

1547
01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:37.850
there's going to be mind to mind communication.

1548
01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.330
You now when you're going to know everyone's going to know everything about

1549
01:28:41.331 --> 01:28:45.050
everybody,
you're going to have some of the weirdest technology that's just,

1550
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:48.740
it's just done computers and drawing boards right now,

1551
01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:52.780
but it's going to all exist.
It's going to be the same.
Yeah,
within 18 years.
Yeah.

1552
01:28:52.781 --> 01:28:53.331
It's crazy.

1553
01:28:53.331 --> 01:28:56.390
The world is going to be an 18 years and these kids are growing up and

1554
01:28:56.391 --> 01:28:57.224
experiencing it.

1555
01:28:58.650 --> 01:29:02.100
I would want to be 10 years less at all the way.
I

1556
01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:04.650
<v 4>don't,
I don't want,
here's what I be honest with you.</v>

1557
01:29:04.651 --> 01:29:09.270
I think Twitter and like and like email.
I think it's,

1558
01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:11.640
I think it's the cause of depression with a lot of people.

1559
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:15.120
I look at Facebook and how much people share on there.
Like I was,

1560
01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:16.860
I'm not gonna say anyone's name.

1561
01:29:16.861 --> 01:29:20.970
I was following this girl who's talking about the breakup of her marriage and

1562
01:29:20.971 --> 01:29:25.440
the fact that her husband was kind of having a hard time with it and that he was

1563
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:29.010
maybe like acting inappropriate or he came by and he asked to get some of his

1564
01:29:29.011 --> 01:29:32.700
stuff and she was sharing all of this on Facebook with all these people and all

1565
01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:35.880
these people know her and her husband.
But I mean,
but if you look,

1566
01:29:35.881 --> 01:29:39.930
I mean all people do is talk about tragedy on Facebook and like,

1567
01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:42.900
it's like they're sharing,
it's this,
it's this want to be famous.

1568
01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:47.340
It's this one that everyone has to put,
make their lives public.

1569
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.780
And it's so,
it's not everybody,
man.
It's not everybody

1570
01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:53.360
<v 1>dummies.
There's a lot of people that aren't doing that.</v>

1571
01:29:53.361 --> 01:29:57.410
When I see people like fighting on Twitter,
like relationship fights on Twitter.

1572
01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:59.930
I stopped talking to both of them.

1573
01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:05.120
Not talking to either one of you dummies.
You doing,
you're,
you're,

1574
01:30:05.121 --> 01:30:07.160
you're talking shit about each other on Twitter.

1575
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:10.850
What are you trying to hurt each other's feelings?
Well,
you fucking 12.

1576
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:14.690
You're a man in your thirties and you're fucking tweet negative shit about your

1577
01:30:14.691 --> 01:30:17.750
ex letting the world know how she would come home at three o'clock in the

1578
01:30:17.751 --> 01:30:22.730
morning.
Shut the fuck up.
You're so fucking write about that.
You weak bitch.

1579
01:30:22.731 --> 01:30:23.660
You're the problem.

1580
01:30:24.130 --> 01:30:27.490
<v 4>Yeah.
You look at people getting in fights on Twitter and you're like really</v>

1581
01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:32.650
disgusting dude.
Trolls.
Trolls.
But I would never,

1582
01:30:32.651 --> 01:30:35.500
I've never engaged.
I've never responded.
I never replied.

1583
01:30:35.501 --> 01:30:38.260
I don't fuck around like that.
I just have you say something negative in me.

1584
01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:41.500
I don't block you.
I just,
I put it my memory,
my memory bank.

1585
01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.940
<v 1>Yo,
it's fucked up,
man.
Um,</v>

1586
01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:47.120
one of the things that people were talking about when they were talking about

1587
01:30:47.121 --> 01:30:50.330
this kid in Santa Barbara that went on this fucking killing spree was him being

1588
01:30:50.331 --> 01:30:51.164
rejected.

1589
01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:55.940
And this guy on this message board that I go to was talking about how he knew

1590
01:30:55.941 --> 01:30:59.450
this kid in high school that was like that and he knew them all growing up and

1591
01:30:59.451 --> 01:31:02.150
he was just not a good looking guy.
And he started out pretty normal,

1592
01:31:02.151 --> 01:31:03.470
but people were mean,

1593
01:31:03.471 --> 01:31:06.170
knew him and all this rejection like all throughout his life.

1594
01:31:06.171 --> 01:31:10.970
It's just constant state of rejection,
rejection,
fucking people pranking him.

1595
01:31:10.971 --> 01:31:11.840
It's just an ugly dude.

1596
01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:15.200
And then he was talking about how by the time it got to high school,

1597
01:31:15.201 --> 01:31:18.090
the kid started getting dark and one of the girls in their high school and

1598
01:31:18.091 --> 01:31:22.730
attractive girl died in a car accident and he was laughing and he was mocking

1599
01:31:22.731 --> 01:31:26.630
her and they were like,
Holy Shit.
And that's when they realize like,
wow,

1600
01:31:26.631 --> 01:31:31.190
this guy has become a monster.
Like he's,
he's mocking that this girl died.

1601
01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:35.710
It was pretty fascinating because here's the deal with a guy like this guy who's

1602
01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.870
a Santa Barbara killer,
like he was a handsome kid.

1603
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:42.830
Like if you look at him,
he's not an ugly kid by any stretch of the imagination.

1604
01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:46.190
What was he small,
whatever he was.
I mean he's maybe,
look,

1605
01:31:46.191 --> 01:31:47.730
Tony Hinchcliffe is small.
Nobody.

1606
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:51.020
Tony's got a great personality and his hilarious,
you know what I mean?

1607
01:31:51.021 --> 01:31:51.854
And people love him.

1608
01:31:52.130 --> 01:31:57.020
It's like you could be a tiny little person and girls will still Iq this,

1609
01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:00.160
this guy.
There was something obviously like really,

1610
01:32:00.161 --> 01:32:02.230
really wrong with him mentally,

1611
01:32:02.231 --> 01:32:07.231
but it got me thinking about like a person's looks like that's a motherfucker

1612
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:12.850
man.
Like if you're born fucked up,
like if you have a diff,

1613
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:15.700
something deformed or if you just have a weird skull,

1614
01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:20.470
your fucking face looks weird.
Like your whole life,
people are going to like,

1615
01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:25.270
Eh,
Eh,
eh.
The normal reaction that people have to you is like,

1616
01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:30.160
eh,
this norm.
It's like,
it takes them a while to come up with the warmth,
but the,

1617
01:32:30.161 --> 01:32:34.150
the immediate react,
nothing can be done about that.
Like a,

1618
01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:38.290
that is a genetic motherfucker.
You know,
you're talking about like a lottery.

1619
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:42.820
If you're a woman and you're six foot three,
you know,
and you waste 300 pounds,

1620
01:32:42.821 --> 01:32:47.360
your fucking heads,
enormous shit.
You know,
there's women out there that align.

1621
01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:50.410
And then they're just like,
you know,

1622
01:32:50.411 --> 01:32:52.930
everywhere they go there's by no fault of their own,

1623
01:32:52.931 --> 01:32:57.370
they just got this wacky genetic fucking roll.
The dice,
cleft palates,

1624
01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:01.440
cleft palates I the thalidomide babies,
there's a,

1625
01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:05.910
there's a Wa there's a organization called Operation Smile that I think that

1626
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.450
I've donated to in the past,

1627
01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:12.610
but I would do anything for because exactly what you're saying is what they fix

1628
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:16.180
that for like a hundred bucks.
It's a,
you fix a cleft pallet on a child.

1629
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:21.130
A child knows why would anyone,
no one deserves to go through life looking at,

1630
01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:24.310
I mean I'm just saying,
but looking like a,
like a monster,

1631
01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:26.890
like and if you have a cleft palate is pretty aggressive.

1632
01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:29.760
So like I look at that operation smile dude.

1633
01:33:29.761 --> 01:33:32.020
That's how fucking great place to present money.
Yeah,

1634
01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.580
you're going to send fucking money go.
That's,

1635
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:39.390
you can fucking change a person's life for ever by letting,

1636
01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:44.080
by gifting them the surgery.
I think we're just starting to realize as a race,

1637
01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:48.220
the human race is over the last x amount of a hundred or thousand years.

1638
01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.190
We're just starting to realize that we have to kind of take care of each other

1639
01:33:51.191 --> 01:33:54.100
better.
Sis,
it's like,
it's all there.
There's,

1640
01:33:54.490 --> 01:33:56.950
we're constantly dealing with competition as well though.

1641
01:33:57.010 --> 01:34:01.090
And when the competition comes up,
that's when people get this fucking attitude.

1642
01:34:01.330 --> 01:34:06.280
Like this guy who was angry at this,
at all these women,
you know,
this,
uh,

1643
01:34:06.281 --> 01:34:10.270
this one that my friend,
uh,
online,
it talked about,
when you think about that guy,

1644
01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:12.880
like that's almost like a guy who was in competition and kept losing over and

1645
01:34:12.881 --> 01:34:15.070
over and over again and hated the competition.

1646
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:19.090
Like in a lot of ways it's very similar.
You know,
like the hated the other side.

1647
01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.200
He hated those.

1648
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:24.370
Like human beings have got to figure out a way to stop that.

1649
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:28.450
Like once we figured out a way to work together and stop competing about shit

1650
01:34:28.451 --> 01:34:29.284
like that.

1651
01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:34.090
But the problem is there's always gonna be people that have just massive,

1652
01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:38.020
unfair advantages.
And that's one of the things that this kid was talking about.

1653
01:34:38.021 --> 01:34:40.790
Like with,
when he described men as brutes said,

1654
01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:45.760
girls just wanting to have sex with a big muscle bound.
Brutes,
you know,

1655
01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:49.420
like in his mind it's like he could never be a brute.

1656
01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:53.380
He just was always shut out of that.
If a girl wanted that,
it's like dammit.

1657
01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.110
Like it didn't make any sense.
It didn't make any sense.

1658
01:34:56.111 --> 01:34:58.310
You add that to the fact he was a fucking psycho

1659
01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:02.630
<v 2>and then boom.
Whereas most people that are,
you know,</v>

1660
01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:07.660
unfortunately built or unfortunate looking or how unfortunate genetics or

1661
01:35:07.911 --> 01:35:12.530
whatever it is,
they just,
they just deal,
they just have to deal.

1662
01:35:12.531 --> 01:35:17.531
And so the difference between a guy like Ryan Reynolds who walks through this

1663
01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:23.090
world,
like on a fucking magic carpet of gold,
you know,
he's a beautiful man.
Just,

1664
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.430
yeah,
everywhere you see them,
you want to smile babies,

1665
01:35:25.431 --> 01:35:29.690
I'll smile at them and then,
you know,

1666
01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:33.400
fill in the blank,
figuring out your guy.
No,
no,
you're good.
Look,

1667
01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.780
<v 4>yeah,
but it's not regular looking human being.
I mean,</v>

1668
01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.980
that's why I believe if formed my personality,

1669
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:41.800
whatever soft shoe I know how to do to get people like me,

1670
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:43.450
it was because I didn't have the,

1671
01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:46.930
I didn't have the fuck in the jaw line that maybe like,

1672
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:48.940
like one of my buddies had that like I have,

1673
01:35:48.941 --> 01:35:51.850
I have a buddy I wrote about him book as my Buddy Jeff Hartley.

1674
01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:56.110
He's like one of the fucking best looking guys.
Confident big fucking hands.

1675
01:35:56.970 --> 01:36:00.850
Like just everything about him is just bigger and,
and,
and he knows how.

1676
01:36:00.851 --> 01:36:05.851
And I guess at a young age you realize worlds cruise and easy for you and you

1677
01:36:06.341 --> 01:36:10.030
learn how to just be like,
you learn how to fucking fill the shoes.
And just,

1678
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:13.360
and he's,
I never had that,
so I had to learn how to talk to chicks.
Like,

1679
01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:17.750
like not spit game but be like,
you know,
be funny.
And I think at four,

1680
01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:20.350
my personality,
yeah,
without a doubt.

1681
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:23.930
Most funny dudes are funny because they had to make checks laugh.
Yeah.
You know,

1682
01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.800
that's why good looking guys are not usually very funny.
Harley's funny,

1683
01:36:26.801 --> 01:36:30.870
but he's funny too.
A bunch of dudes and a dude way.
Not like,
yeah,
lot of times.

1684
01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:35.050
And not even that,
you know it's like hot checks.

1685
01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.020
So a lot of hot chicks that are really good at stand up.
Yeah,

1686
01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.480
they don't have to be me.

1687
01:36:39.490 --> 01:36:43.840
How many hot chicks are really good does they're like 20 of them.
Schumer?
Yeah,

1688
01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.550
Schumer.
There's a few other ones.

1689
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:49.740
I know a few other ones I always find when the chicks funny,
I want to fuck her.

1690
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:54.280
Whoa.
Easy part.
And I'm not saying it like about Amy.
No,
I mean I always,

1691
01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:57.700
I used to tell Amy that.
I know,
I know I could have sex with her if I wanted to.

1692
01:36:57.910 --> 01:37:00.850
And it would always be like,
you're fucking out of your mind.

1693
01:37:00.970 --> 01:37:02.720
And that seems like a rude thing to say.
No.

1694
01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:05.530
I told her we were doing this so reality bites back.
I was like,

1695
01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:08.740
I could totally have sex with you.
And she was like,
no you couldn't.

1696
01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:11.470
And I was like,
no,
I know who I can and you're in my soft spot.

1697
01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:15.340
Like I know where she was like,
no,
you really can't.
And I go to Amy trusts me,

1698
01:37:15.341 --> 01:37:17.590
I could get,
you know,
what did she find this amusing?

1699
01:37:19.090 --> 01:37:21.730
I've known Amy for a very long time.
So you waited a couple of weeks.

1700
01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.610
My wife by the way,
like yeah,

1701
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:26.680
Amy used to stay at our house when we'd go to on vacation,

1702
01:37:26.890 --> 01:37:30.300
Amy would use our house and come out to La and do like meetings and stuff.

1703
01:37:30.301 --> 01:37:34.630
It's cool.
Yeah.
Good friends with my sisters.
No Shit.
Yeah.
And so like when I,

1704
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:38.170
when I was on the road,
if I was over on the road and were are,
we were together,

1705
01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:41.080
she'd be like call.
Like I was important.
One time she calls,
she's like,

1706
01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:44.710
we're fucking party at tonight.
I've been on a tour,
we're partying.

1707
01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.960
And my wife's totally like four in the morning.

1708
01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:49.690
I'm in a hotel room with Schumer and a bunch of people we don't know.

1709
01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:53.260
And my wife's like,
and I had to tell my wife and she's like,
oh cool.
Telling me.

1710
01:37:53.261 --> 01:37:55.800
I said Hi.
Tell her to keep her head on shoulders.

1711
01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:59.760
<v 2>His fucking big world makes,
you know,
Amy kind of blew up all at once.</v>

1712
01:37:59.761 --> 01:38:03.570
Real quickly,
you know?
And so,
and my wife knew her before that.

1713
01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.680
So your point is,
I have no fucking idea,
John.

1714
01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:11.500
Sometimes I talk to you and I find myself,

1715
01:38:13.230 --> 01:38:18.120
I can't stop speaking while you're kind of umbrella Mr Bert Kreischer.

1716
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:24.540
That's what you do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nothing wrong with it.
No.

1717
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:28.200
Yeah.
Just your style of communicating.
Yeah.
I talk a lot in quickly.

1718
01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:31.380
Well then also like when you talk a lot in quickly,

1719
01:38:31.381 --> 01:38:33.360
like anybody that's entertaining like that,

1720
01:38:33.361 --> 01:38:37.440
like every now and then you're gonna run into like a sentence that doesn't have

1721
01:38:37.441 --> 01:38:41.670
an end.
And,
uh,
so yeah.
Amy was,

1722
01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:46.520
Amy is my friend
ended that way.
Like a,
so a,
yeah,

1723
01:38:46.770 --> 01:38:48.220
Florida.
So it's hard.

1724
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:53.730
I wish I had those smoke bombs dropping in front of me and just walk away.

1725
01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.710
Yeah.
People would tell bad stories do that way too much.
You know,

1726
01:38:58.711 --> 01:39:00.720
like if it's just occasionally,

1727
01:39:00.721 --> 01:39:05.550
but in the art of storytelling when you have to go,
yeah.
Well,
uh,
so,
uh,

1728
01:39:05.551 --> 01:39:06.990
that's a,
that's Detroit for you.

1729
01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:14.760
Unless it's really funny.
That's really something you should shy away from.

1730
01:39:14.761 --> 01:39:16.680
If you want people to pay attention,
you're fucking stories.

1731
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:23.370
Like I think the lesson here is
some people are brutal,
man.

1732
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:26.910
Some people would just give you fucking ear beatings and never realized that

1733
01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:31.890
there were,
uh,
there was a dude the other day in a green room.
I step in and uh,

1734
01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:32.851
we're talking,

1735
01:39:32.851 --> 01:39:36.480
me and this other guy were talking for like two minutes and going back and forth

1736
01:39:36.481 --> 01:39:41.050
and someone brings up some subject that this dude had some personal experiences

1737
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:45.390
and then it becomes his show.
And so for the next five minutes,

1738
01:39:45.391 --> 01:39:49.770
he's telling this fucking long drawn out story and I can't take it anymore.

1739
01:39:49.771 --> 01:39:52.260
And Brian was there.
I can't take it anymore.
So I had to leave the room.

1740
01:39:52.290 --> 01:39:55.310
I just got up and left.
I'm like the middle of the story.
I just,

1741
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:58.140
just slowly like moving over and still am I,
I'm not gonna do this.

1742
01:39:58.141 --> 01:40:02.610
You're not going to beat me down.
And there was no point to it.
Zero,
none.

1743
01:40:02.611 --> 01:40:04.680
And I knew it.
I knew it from halfway into it.

1744
01:40:04.930 --> 01:40:07.320
And it was all these details and it was just like,
oh,

1745
01:40:07.321 --> 01:40:12.320
it was that fucking crime was a crime against humanity.
I just got out of there.

1746
01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:14.730
I was like,
I'm not going to be rude,
but I'm not going to listen.

1747
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:17.890
You can't make me listen to this.
By the way,
it's my green room.
All right.

1748
01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:18.840
I'm the one that's performing.

1749
01:40:18.841 --> 01:40:22.710
Hearing he wasn't even performing there is stepped in and fucking beat me down.

1750
01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:24.540
Was it your colleague?
Whatever,
whatever.

1751
01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:29.610
What's crazy is that he thought it was like someone in that moment thinks that's

1752
01:40:29.611 --> 01:40:32.010
their moment to shine.
You know what?
It's not even that dude.

1753
01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:35.640
This is a problem with comedians.
Some comedians,

1754
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:37.680
they don't really have conversations with you.

1755
01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:41.910
They just talk and sometimes they don't.

1756
01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:46.980
They don't absorb like what the other person is saying.
You know,

1757
01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:47.670
like if you,

1758
01:40:47.670 --> 01:40:51.480
you might tell your story about how you didn't know that you're a girl had

1759
01:40:51.481 --> 01:40:54.340
cerebral palsy because you were so drunk off that you might tell that story

1760
01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:59.460
<v 6>and they're just waiting to tell a better story about a better drunk girl or a</v>

1761
01:41:00.401 --> 01:41:04.120
battle or better situation with the fucked up.
They're just waiting,
you know,

1762
01:41:04.121 --> 01:41:07.010
they're like almost he Dunbar Dunbar,
you don't worry.
Did not like,

1763
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:09.170
like they don't have any questions for it.
You're like,
wait a minute,
wait,
wait.

1764
01:41:09.190 --> 01:41:11.380
You didn't know she was drunk.
There's none of that.
There's none of that.

1765
01:41:11.381 --> 01:41:16.000
It's like what may talk glad maybe cog and those guys are goddamn exhausting.

1766
01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.670
They're waiting for the moment where they hear the bell.
Like your turn.

1767
01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:22.390
That was this guy,
right?
Yeah,
it was.
It just needs to be edited.

1768
01:41:22.391 --> 01:41:25.540
Like his whole story.
It was just like,
I just wanted it to go,

1769
01:41:25.541 --> 01:41:28.880
you need to edit it.
You know,
throw in a little bit more interesting.
Peeks into,

1770
01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:33.640
totally took over our conversation and it was like seven people in the room.

1771
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:35.650
There's so many people in the room with like all of us had to,

1772
01:41:35.651 --> 01:41:36.820
just like we had no other choice.

1773
01:41:36.821 --> 01:41:39.760
We were supposed to stare at this person and he wasn't a good story.

1774
01:41:40.210 --> 01:41:44.800
It was brutal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's why I have to limit your,
your engagements.

1775
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:47.980
You have to limit the type of people that you communicate with Mr. Crusher.

1776
01:41:47.981 --> 01:41:50.350
Every now and then you're going to find someone who's a fucking white belt in

1777
01:41:50.351 --> 01:41:54.580
ear beatings and they just,
they stumbled through it.
They pull hamstrings.

1778
01:41:54.610 --> 01:41:59.440
They just kind of can't.
You can't.
You're the kind of person that just goes,

1779
01:41:59.441 --> 01:42:02.860
yeah,
like,
like you don't allow people to take liberties with you.

1780
01:42:02.861 --> 01:42:05.910
If someone's like,
hey Joe,
can I take a picture with you?
I want to like,
uh,

1781
01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:08.770
I want to grab your face.
You'd be like,
no,
it's not going to fucking happen.

1782
01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:12.620
I definitely am like,
all right,
grab my face.
Why do you let them

1783
01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:17.300
come out to Philly this week?
Going to be like,
let me grab your fucking face.

1784
01:42:17.301 --> 01:42:20.650
It's going to happen.
No one would say that.
It's going to happen for sure.

1785
01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:21.910
Do as you're writing that down.

1786
01:42:21.911 --> 01:42:25.870
Now we're opening up the notes APP on their phone.
I always get,
Hey,

1787
01:42:25.871 --> 01:42:28.660
can you take your shirt off?
Can I get his picture with your shirt off?

1788
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.530
You're going to be here,
Brian.
What does that,
what do you get Dylan?

1789
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:34.600
He's grabbing my fucking phone.

1790
01:42:34.610 --> 01:42:37.940
Are you taking a picture in the middle of the podcast?
You Fuck Jesus Christ.

1791
01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:43.590
20 minutes late and stops in the middle of the podcast to take pictures.
A luck.

1792
01:42:44.110 --> 01:42:47.980
Got To fucking love him.
Fuck.
Um,
yeah,
I'm,
I'm,
I,

1793
01:42:47.981 --> 01:42:51.820
I just don't know where to draw lines.
Well you do.
You're just,

1794
01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:53.920
you're just a nice guy and you let people grab your face.

1795
01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.600
I had to do to ask if he could pick me up once to let them know.
No,

1796
01:42:58.601 --> 01:43:02.560
you're not picking me up,
man.
Why did you do that Brian?
Dry Mat.
No,
I don't.

1797
01:43:02.561 --> 01:43:04.810
I took a car service.
I've never driven to one of your podcasts.

1798
01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:08.380
My life could move.
Good.
Move.
Fucking learn.
Very young.

1799
01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:12.670
Do you have a can opener on that thing?
This bad ass fucking knife.

1800
01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:16.270
Do you open up with a knife?
That's how you open up bottles.

1801
01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:19.300
I'm obsessed with knives.
He's days.
Oh,
that's not good.

1802
01:43:19.301 --> 01:43:22.390
Why are you obsessed with knives?
I love them.
I just think the coolest shit.

1803
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:26.620
You love knives.
You 12 how old are,
you know,
but I feel like I'm a grown up.

1804
01:43:26.621 --> 01:43:28.890
Like when you started getting into pro hunting,
I was like,
man,

1805
01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.670
there's a lot of shit I can afford to do that.

1806
01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:33.100
I've never thought about doing that.
I would when I was a kid I was like,

1807
01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:36.940
I totally,
I was talking to Mike Maryfield about it when he was like,
I told him,

1808
01:43:36.941 --> 01:43:40.090
I thought I was like,
there's a lot of shit.
Like I want a motorcycle miles,
beers.

1809
01:43:40.330 --> 01:43:44.710
And he goes,
Mike Merrifield bought a motorcycle.
Dude,
I fucking love motorcycles.

1810
01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:48.180
You're reckless motherfucker.
Burke Christ.
No.

1811
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:51.920
You'd want a motorcycle to a little bit.
Oh,
I definitely would.

1812
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:55.100
<v 3>Does that whole like crashing and losing your legs part?</v>

1813
01:43:55.101 --> 01:44:00.030
It's not attractive to me.
Jan.
Jamie wants to get one of those little moped one,

1814
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:03.660
so that's even worse.
Even worse than that.

1815
01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:05.540
Lose Jamie if you want to be the next Jamie.

1816
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.630
Even worse than that are the bikes that have motors on them,

1817
01:44:08.690 --> 01:44:12.680
the bicycles that have motors on them,
but like,
uh,
I was like,
yeah,

1818
01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:16.010
there's a bunch of Shit I've wanted to do and like I can afford to buy a cool

1819
01:44:16.011 --> 01:44:17.840
knife every now and then.
So like when I'm on the road,

1820
01:44:17.841 --> 01:44:20.750
like in Brazil or somewhere,
I'll see a knife and I'll go,

1821
01:44:20.751 --> 01:44:23.330
you know what that remind me of my trip.
And so I buy knives.

1822
01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:26.300
So you're a knife collector.
Little bit.
You have.
I'm like locked up.

1823
01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.170
I'm all over the house to protect me.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1824
01:44:30.171 --> 01:44:32.540
Anyone ever breaks into my house?
Have a machete next to my man cave.

1825
01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:35.780
What the fuck bird.
You got a machete people.
I'll have a gun.

1826
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:38.330
What if you machete the wrong guy?
It's like surprise.

1827
01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.930
If you're already on your way down with this.

1828
01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:45.740
If you're in my man cave and I'm pulling out the machete too late,

1829
01:44:45.741 --> 01:44:49.010
it's too late.
It's too late.
Do you have like,
like a protocol?

1830
01:44:49.011 --> 01:44:52.290
Like when the machete will come out.
It's a rubber with,

1831
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:56.450
it's just a kid who's like got a crack problem and he's breaking in and try to

1832
01:44:56.451 --> 01:44:59.210
steal a stereo.
You got a machete him,
we get some machete.
Wow,

1833
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:04.340
you've got a machete him,
but if he's not big,
what if you could smack him around?

1834
01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:07.090
It was a little tiny guy,
a little Tony Hinchcliffe looking guy too,

1835
01:45:07.110 --> 01:45:08.090
trying to steal your stereo.

1836
01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:11.450
That fucking the kids hold them down and call the cops.
Tony [inaudible].

1837
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:14.960
Tony hits that.
He's that scrawny.
That scares me.

1838
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:18.950
The scrappy kids probably as good stamina.
Yeah,

1839
01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:22.850
probably if you like start heaving Hoven you know you're in the middle of a a

1840
01:45:22.851 --> 01:45:26.070
prolonged battle and you started fading.
It would turn her,

1841
01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:29.240
turn up the heat on you and all of a sudden he was going faster than I ever saw

1842
01:45:29.241 --> 01:45:31.790
him go beat you over the head with one of those things that you shake up and you

1843
01:45:31.791 --> 01:45:34.850
see the snow in it.
This little paper weights,
that's what he's going to get.

1844
01:45:34.851 --> 01:45:36.920
Michelle and we have those all over my fucking house.

1845
01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:40.910
We have snow Globes everywhere.
Are they from all these different places?

1846
01:45:40.911 --> 01:45:42.740
You visit by Snow Globes for the girls.

1847
01:45:42.741 --> 01:45:47.150
So ridiculous Snow Globes and and blades.

1848
01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.790
So you're buying all over the world.
I'm fucking,

1849
01:45:49.791 --> 01:45:53.420
FBI has got a file on you about that thick traveling over the world.

1850
01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.130
They said that they were going to release some,
uh,

1851
01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:58.820
Greg Glenn Greenwald said they were going to release some new shit this week and

1852
01:45:58.821 --> 01:46:02.540
it's going to be a list of all the people that the NSA was spying on.

1853
01:46:02.541 --> 01:46:07.340
All the Americans.
They have a full list of everyone.
I want to be on that.

1854
01:46:07.341 --> 01:46:11.360
So fucking bad.
You were all on it,
dude.
We are so close.

1855
01:46:11.630 --> 01:46:16.100
We're so close to everything being tape recorded.
We are.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1856
01:46:16.101 --> 01:46:19.580
We're being tape recorded and I've been training on podcasts one when people

1857
01:46:19.581 --> 01:46:22.790
like when people start recording each other,

1858
01:46:22.791 --> 01:46:26.150
private citizens start recording each other and not just the owner of the

1859
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:28.070
clippers.
That's when it's going to go fuck.

1860
01:46:28.071 --> 01:46:31.700
Just so that you can get that guy fired talking shit about your boss and that

1861
01:46:31.701 --> 01:46:34.760
once that goes,
that's the fucking,
then everyone's gonna know.

1862
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:37.760
Like I talked to a kid after one of my shows in Irvine the other day and he was

1863
01:46:37.761 --> 01:46:38.594
like,

1864
01:46:38.630 --> 01:46:41.760
and he was asking me something and I was uncomfortable with what he was asking

1865
01:46:41.761 --> 01:46:44.210
and he's like,
hey man,
I'm not tape recording you.
And I was like,

1866
01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:47.420
even in fact that he thought about it made me go,
fuck,

1867
01:46:47.421 --> 01:46:50.010
what's he trying to blow you?
He's like this.

1868
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:52.950
<v 6>He was just wanting to talk about something and I didn't want to talk about it</v>

1869
01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:55.980
all weird.
And I was,
and he was like,
it was like 10 and tell me.
And I was like,

1870
01:46:55.981 --> 01:46:59.400
Eh,
I'm good.
He's like,
I'm not tape recording you.
But the fact that he said that,

1871
01:46:59.401 --> 01:47:03.840
I was like,
Oh shit,
people are fucking strange man.
They're so strange.
You'll,

1872
01:47:03.841 --> 01:47:06.870
you'll meet people after shows and they just start hitting you with like a

1873
01:47:06.871 --> 01:47:09.490
barrage of questions and you're like,
what are you doing?
Like,

1874
01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:12.210
are you interviewing me?
Is this for your own,

1875
01:47:12.211 --> 01:47:15.420
like a d did you save all these questions up and you're ready to throw them at

1876
01:47:15.421 --> 01:47:19.770
me?
Yeah.
People are type,
recording everything at this point.

1877
01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.950
Assume you're being tape recorded.
As soon every phone call you make,

1878
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:26.280
every voice mail message,
you leave every text message you leave.

1879
01:47:26.281 --> 01:47:30.750
Assume all that shit is being recorded,
I assume.
Yeah.
You better live.

1880
01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:32.940
Don't live your life like you're being tape recorded.
Live your life.

1881
01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:33.990
A good fucking person.

1882
01:47:33.991 --> 01:47:37.080
You imagine if it turns out that the government spying a comedian,

1883
01:47:37.670 --> 01:47:38.850
I would fucking love that.

1884
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:43.110
I just read something the other day where they admit that they are recording

1885
01:47:43.111 --> 01:47:47.410
people that have uh,
like a large group of people you know,
like their,

1886
01:47:47.630 --> 01:47:49.830
their voice is heard from a large group of people.

1887
01:47:49.831 --> 01:47:53.930
I'm trying to find the art right now.
Very public figures.
Figures.
Yeah.

1888
01:47:54.210 --> 01:47:56.340
<v 2>See the thing that they,
uh,
there's,
I don't know,</v>

1889
01:47:56.341 --> 01:48:00.420
it was on natural news.com so you never know.
That's,
that's site seems a little,

1890
01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:03.180
a little on the sketch.
Not quite sure.

1891
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:07.890
But the article was saying that they had fake vaccinations in the Middle East

1892
01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:11.730
that gave feed people fake vaccination so they could collect DNA.

1893
01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.890
Seriously.
Yeah.
Fucking genius.

1894
01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:19.590
It's fucking creepy.
You're like,
you're,

1895
01:48:19.591 --> 01:48:23.340
you're getting away with something in another country that you could never get

1896
01:48:23.341 --> 01:48:26.970
away with an America like that.
In a way,

1897
01:48:27.090 --> 01:48:31.920
it's kind of dehumanizing because let's imagine if they were doing that in the

1898
01:48:31.921 --> 01:48:33.090
United States,
in the ghetto,

1899
01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:37.530
like let's imagine they went to Compton or watts and they were doing this and

1900
01:48:37.531 --> 01:48:41.130
they were getting these people that believe they're being vaccinated,

1901
01:48:41.131 --> 01:48:45.120
but really they would just withdrawing DNA.
Could you imagine the outrage?

1902
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:50.350
It would be insane.
It would be insane.
People would go crazy.
Why?
Well,
because we,

1903
01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:54.060
we're Americans and we believe that we have certain amount of rights and our

1904
01:48:54.061 --> 01:48:58.110
government doesn't deserve to be extracting our DNA and lying to us like,

1905
01:48:58.290 --> 01:49:00.810
what are you,
are you a dictator or this is,

1906
01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:04.470
are you the overlord or you are representative government because this doesn't

1907
01:49:04.471 --> 01:49:07.830
seem like a representative government.
If you're fucking giving poor people fit,

1908
01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:12.420
but it's okay if it's in another country.
See if it's in another country.

1909
01:49:12.570 --> 01:49:15.540
Somehow they could justify like,
well,
they're not even Americans.

1910
01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:20.790
They're humans.
They're human beings.
You're giving them fake vaccination.

1911
01:49:20.791 --> 01:49:24.900
So you could,
if that is true,
and again,
I don't know if it is,
but if it is,

1912
01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:29.400
it's a,
it's a,
it's a practice that's as old as time.

1913
01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:33.450
People have found a way to demonize the others,

1914
01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:37.200
whether it's the people that they were at war with,
whether it's,
you know,

1915
01:49:37.201 --> 01:49:40.080
you look back at the horrific things that the Nazis did to the Jews.

1916
01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:43.770
Look at the horrific things that the Mongols did to all these different places

1917
01:49:43.771 --> 01:49:47.980
where they conquered.
Look at throughout human history,
every

1918
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.870
<v 1>time a group has been able to identify another group as the enemy,</v>

1919
01:49:53.230 --> 01:49:55.660
they've been able to justify horrific things.

1920
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:57.880
And that's what happened with this fucking evil kid,

1921
01:49:58.120 --> 01:49:59.560
this evil kid in Santa Barbara.

1922
01:49:59.830 --> 01:50:01.810
And that's what's happening right now with these idiots,

1923
01:50:01.811 --> 01:50:06.160
these male rights idiots that are battling it out with feminists online,

1924
01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:07.300
going back and forth.

1925
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:10.480
These people that are actually saying that this guy who have girls,

1926
01:50:10.481 --> 01:50:13.910
fuck this guy,
he wouldn't have gone on this killing spree.
It's fucking crazy.

1927
01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:16.720
You can only say that if you're dealing with an us and them.

1928
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:20.430
You can only say that if it's the enemy,
you know,
it's,
it's,

1929
01:50:20.590 --> 01:50:24.460
it's a weird thing that people do.
Man,
this enemy thing,

1930
01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.260
they'll do it with fucking the Phillies.

1931
01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:28.780
They'll do it with teams and Philadelphia.

1932
01:50:28.781 --> 01:50:32.790
Joey Diaz would telling me the story about this guy that was there and uh,
I,
I,

1933
01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:36.280
it was a football game and he was,
I don't know what team this guy was wearing,

1934
01:50:36.281 --> 01:50:39.790
a jersey,
but he got in a fight with these guys.
They stomped his leg.

1935
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.520
They broke his leg in a stairwell.

1936
01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:47.830
They threw him down and stomped his leg.
I have snapped his femur.

1937
01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:50.630
<v 3>They stay.
Did that too in dodger stadium to the,</v>

1938
01:50:50.650 --> 01:50:54.300
to God there was a fan of the writer or the beat him up days.
Days.

1939
01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:58.460
That scares me to not want to go to fighting it to events for sure.

1940
01:50:58.470 --> 01:51:02.000
But someone was telling me that just in a coma for like a week.
Right.

1941
01:51:02.150 --> 01:51:04.220
And you just went to a fucking game with your kid.

1942
01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:05.761
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1943
01:51:05.761 --> 01:51:08.970
You just rooting for the wrong team or you ran into the wrong group of drunk

1944
01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:09.893
assholes.

1945
01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:14.880
And see that's where the women have a real good point because this is not

1946
01:51:14.881 --> 01:51:17.520
happening to men.
If you're running into women,

1947
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:21.930
you're not running into drunk women coming down an alleyway and they're breaking

1948
01:51:21.931 --> 01:51:24.060
your leg and beating the fuck out of you.
It's trunk men.

1949
01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.690
It's men and women have to worry about it even more than men have to worry about

1950
01:51:27.691 --> 01:51:28.530
it.
You know,

1951
01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:33.080
<v 3>it's,
I,
I,
I didn't know anything about the all,
all the women or what is it?</v>

1952
01:51:33.110 --> 01:51:36.310
All in the f all the women.
You're the one that,
yeah,

1953
01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:38.980
I just started reading about it today.
All the women.
Yeah.

1954
01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.840
And I never knew the point of view.
You know,

1955
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:44.900
what happens with these things that they become so polarizing.

1956
01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:48.490
You think both the people who are fucking totally crazy and you lose the maybe

1957
01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:52.420
subtle point that should be represented in that all the women and what I,

1958
01:51:52.450 --> 01:51:55.760
what I realized that you kind of put it out that I think is pretty brilliant.

1959
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:59.840
I never really seen it like,
Hey,
not all men rape,
but all women can get raped.

1960
01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:03.770
Like most of them.
Ronda Rousey's be tough as shit

1961
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:08.780
<v 7>kill you,
right?
When you think you raping,</v>

1962
01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:10.830
you just get triangled son.

1963
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:24.560
She just tells you to lick her pussy.
Right when you go in for the kill,

1964
01:52:24.561 --> 01:52:26.170
she slaps that triangle

1965
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:32.180
and the lights go out and Georgia,
you start seeing it close in.
Oh No.

1966
01:52:32.181 --> 01:52:33.014
That's what it's like.

1967
01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:36.160
<v 3>Oh,
you getting choked out.
I know.
It gets to like,
it's like an elevator door.</v>

1968
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:39.670
I'd been choked out.
Have you?
Who choked you out a fucking Henzel Gracie.

1969
01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:45.230
What was Gilbert?
Is that what it's called?
Kill Bert.
Bert.
Bert hurt Bert.
Know

1970
01:52:46.210 --> 01:52:49.460
<v 2>the whatever.
Ridiculous that no wonder why your back's all fucked up,
man.</v>

1971
01:52:49.461 --> 01:52:51.530
He let people throw you around and been a stunt man.

1972
01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:53.900
I've been a practicing stunk,
man.
That's like being a stock man.

1973
01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:57.800
You feel that it was it hands over the chat or voice.
Horian Horian Horian.
Oh,

1974
01:52:57.801 --> 01:53:02.780
the older the,
the guy who founded it at all.
He founded the UFC.
Horian was the,

1975
01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:08.060
he's the father of a hand air and here on,
yeah,
those,
I thought those guys too.

1976
01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:10.820
They fought all of them.
They had to haul beat the shit.

1977
01:53:11.150 --> 01:53:13.490
They just gave me a knife that I tried to strap a Brazilian.
Oh.

1978
01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:17.870
Which by the way gave you a knife after going to Brazil.
Holy Shit Man.

1979
01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:22.490
Brazilians are like the fucking sturdy Istock of human in the world.

1980
01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:26.810
It's a hard life over there for a lot of folks and it's also very active,

1981
01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:30.980
very active.
They're always on the beach like we were watching or hotel room.

1982
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:33.800
These fucking surfers were incredible man.

1983
01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:37.160
Me and Ari were there or it came down to watch the fights down there with me

1984
01:53:37.161 --> 01:53:41.210
once and we were standing there on my balcony watching these kids surf.

1985
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:45.410
We were also,
it was like a,
you know,
your time is all fucked up.

1986
01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:48.680
It's like several hours in the future.
Like,

1987
01:53:48.681 --> 01:53:51.830
what is it like three or four hours ahead of,
I think it's the head of New York.

1988
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:56.240
Yeah.
I don't remember like six hours,
whatever it was.
I was all whacked out,

1989
01:53:56.241 --> 01:53:57.650
so it was like five o'clock in the morning.

1990
01:53:57.651 --> 01:54:01.010
We were still up and the sun was coming up like five,
six,
whatever it was,

1991
01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:03.560
and all of a sudden these people started showing up at the beach,

1992
01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:08.540
like kids and adults and flip flops and everybody was hanging out and like,
wow,

1993
01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:12.890
these people are active bikes start running by six Sam joggers and shit.

1994
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:15.410
I was like,
these are like really active people.

1995
01:54:15.411 --> 01:54:17.060
Then all of sudden that soccer game broke out,

1996
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:19.610
so it was like seven o'clock in the morning with drinking coffee and watching

1997
01:54:19.611 --> 01:54:23.060
people play soccer on the beach like this is,
this is interesting.
I'm like,

1998
01:54:23.061 --> 01:54:26.750
there's so much more active than the average Americans.
Yeah.
You know,

1999
01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:30.710
if people here get fucking super sedentary,
man,
I am

2000
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:35.540
super common.
It's more common than not.
Right.

2001
01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:40.190
I think my whole thing now is like I have my weight set up in my backyard,

2002
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:45.380
so I go,
if I'm fucking,
if I,
if I get like a little weird funk,

2003
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:46.370
I go fuck it.
Lift weights.

2004
01:54:46.371 --> 01:54:50.060
Because I know for a fact that like lifting weights to the point where your of

2005
01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:53.330
your tits are all fire,
that releases some serotonin in your body.

2006
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:56.960
You should be a doctor and that should be a meme lifting weights until your tits

2007
01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:00.380
were,
I know that releases some Sarah Tillery and your body,

2008
01:55:00.381 --> 01:55:05.240
Bert Kreischer and you holding your tits.
Yeah,
that'd be a great meme.
Not meme,

2009
01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:09.290
um,
uh,
gifts you texted,
made a Gif,
Gif,

2010
01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:10.790
gif files.
Yeah.

2011
01:55:11.630 --> 01:55:14.810
That's a great way to fucking cover sports on the Internet.

2012
01:55:15.170 --> 01:55:18.530
Like you posted something about the fight that's Oh yeah.
You know what it was.

2013
01:55:18.531 --> 01:55:21.470
It wasn't that I posted something.
I'll tell you exactly what it was.

2014
01:55:21.471 --> 01:55:25.360
There was a thing on fight land where someone broke down a Hanan Barao,

2015
01:55:25.361 --> 01:55:26.660
a guy named Jack Slack.

2016
01:55:26.661 --> 01:55:31.070
It's how Tj Dillashaw killed the king and it's on fight land.

2017
01:55:31.071 --> 01:55:35.660
It's one of the,
um,
the vice channels.
And I'm vice,

2018
01:55:35.661 --> 01:55:40.661
this guy did a great job of breaking down like the technical aspects of a Hanan

2019
01:55:41.690 --> 01:55:44.100
Barao style and how,
what Tj Dillashaw was able

2020
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.870
<v 6>to exploit it.
And in doing so,
he used these animated gifs as,
um,
as,</v>

2021
01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:53.430
uh,
examples of different specific moments in the fight where things changed and

2022
01:55:53.431 --> 01:55:56.160
what Tj did well and what Hanan Barao did wrong.

2023
01:55:56.190 --> 01:55:59.640
He's really good at breaking things down.
That's,
but that's also,

2024
01:55:59.670 --> 01:56:01.260
they're in cahoots with the UFC.

2025
01:56:01.261 --> 01:56:03.690
That's why they're allowed to use those animated gif files.

2026
01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:07.560
But it's a great way to cover.
That's great.
Fantastic.
I'm,
and I'm glad that Ken,

2027
01:56:07.561 --> 01:56:10.770
but other people in other sites like if you try to,
you know,

2028
01:56:10.771 --> 01:56:14.430
put up animated Gif files,
they'll get pissed at you.
Yeah.
They don't want it.

2029
01:56:14.431 --> 01:56:17.730
Animated Gif files.
Did you follow this?
A Floyd Mayweather.
I fight.

2030
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.410
I saw some shit on online,
like some of the,
you know,
Flint mayor was saying,

2031
01:56:22.411 --> 01:56:27.330
you gotta you gotta Control Your Bitch Bitch.
Um,
you know,

2032
01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:31.080
if you want to get in a fight with Floyd Mayweather and you're a rapper,
good.

2033
01:56:31.170 --> 01:56:33.840
Good luck with all that.
Like,
what's all this chair throwing with Saul?

2034
01:56:33.841 --> 01:56:37.770
Stop the nonsense and realize that you're not going to get into a fucking fight

2035
01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:41.010
cause one of the greatest boxers that's ever walked the face of the the world.

2036
01:56:41.070 --> 01:56:44.550
Can we,
can we just agree on that?
Yeah.
You're just bullshitting.
Okay.

2037
01:56:44.551 --> 01:56:45.540
Because if there's no one here,

2038
01:56:45.541 --> 01:56:47.880
but you and him and you are both in a room with no objects,

2039
01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:49.620
just your body's let's start over.

2040
01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.000
They're both fucking millionaires in their water burger.
Like I don't get,

2041
01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:54.270
get hungry and people get hungry.

2042
01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:57.930
You're so high profile and your Floyd Mayweather.
What do you likes?
Burgers.

2043
01:56:58.290 --> 01:57:00.770
Burgers all the time.
That's like part of his thing.
Like he,

2044
01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:03.190
he would always be like driving around in his Bentley and he beat,
you know,

2045
01:57:03.210 --> 01:57:07.400
like a Jack in the box.
Really?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Tia,

2046
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:11.070
I can take on Floyd Mayweather.
Just sign.
Did he really say that?
Yeah,
he,

2047
01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:13.350
he's posted a video that,
wait a minute,

2048
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:15.510
they sent us a video of him like working out or something.

2049
01:57:15.511 --> 01:57:19.020
Like why is he ended his,
his,
it's about his um,
dump place.

2050
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:21.180
Supposed to have black eyes silly.

2051
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:22.920
They said he had black eyes and he's saying he didn't.

2052
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:27.420
All that happened is he hurt his hand and he had his hand wrapped,
I think.

2053
01:57:27.421 --> 01:57:32.160
But I think the threat is the Gis posse's going to shoot Floyd Mayweather.
Oh,

2054
01:57:32.250 --> 01:57:34.350
not that they're going to fist fight.
Cause he said,

2055
01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:37.410
he said Floyd Mayweather said to him in this interaction was,

2056
01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:40.260
I think maybe you forgot what I did for a living,
right.

2057
01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:44.760
I fight and t I said I fight,
but in the streets I fight for real.

2058
01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:49.290
And so I think that was a,
uh,
a veiled threat of a,
yeah,
I fight too,

2059
01:57:49.291 --> 01:57:50.760
but we do it and we'd kill you.

2060
01:57:50.850 --> 01:57:55.800
Or we really analyzing the Tei Floyd Mayweather discussion and who got the most

2061
01:57:55.801 --> 01:58:00.180
out of their verbal exchange.
Floyd made a very good point.
That t,

2062
01:58:00.181 --> 01:58:02.250
I forgot what he does for a living,

2063
01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:06.690
but what Floyd forgot his TEI keeps it real fucking in the trap.

2064
01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:11.220
He's from the streets and he's still connected to those streets.

2065
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:16.020
I'm most impressed with tiny,
who's tying his flow?
Tiny.
Is it the guy's wife?

2066
01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.280
She's not even really that hot,

2067
01:58:17.281 --> 01:58:21.890
but they're fucking fighting over to fucking millionaires.
Why are you impressed?

2068
01:58:21.891 --> 01:58:26.190
They're idiots.
This is the whole thing for target.
The whole thing is so stupid,

2069
01:58:27.210 --> 01:58:32.130
whatever.
That's not what it is.
It's,
it's an ego thing.
It's ridiculous.
Yeah.

2070
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:36.930
Yeah.
The whole thing is ridiculous.
Yeah.
How dare you talk about it for so long.

2071
01:58:37.290 --> 01:58:40.770
I'm disgusted.
I'm disgusted by the whole scenario.
I'm done.
Thank you.

2072
01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:42.130
So who's the cook brothers?

2073
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:42.381
<v 9>What are,</v>

2074
01:58:42.381 --> 01:58:46.300
what is the Koch brothers brothers like we talked about him before by super rich

2075
01:58:46.301 --> 01:58:49.090
do is that you don't want to talk about in a podcast or they will come fuck you.

2076
01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:53.560
How about that?
Next?
They,
uh,
they just fuck the Columbus zoo up.

2077
01:58:53.590 --> 01:58:55.210
And how did they fuck up the Columbus zoo?

2078
01:58:56.050 --> 01:59:00.670
Stephen Colbert did a really quick blurb about it and he explains it perfectly,

2079
01:59:00.671 --> 01:59:04.920
but pretty much what they did is they,
they had this big valid on the,
uh,

2080
01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:07.540
on level the latest vote that said,
hey,

2081
01:59:07.541 --> 01:59:10.900
we need to make money or are zoos is going to close down.

2082
01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:15.160
So we're going to raise property tax by just a teeny teeny bit.

2083
01:59:15.490 --> 01:59:20.110
And the Koch brothers were like,
yeah,
you're going to go up like 105% in your,

2084
01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:23.830
your property taxes.
When in reality it was only going to be 20 bucks.

2085
01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:27.700
But to all the voters voted against it and now the zoos like we're fucked.

2086
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:31.520
We don't know what to do.
I mean like lied about how much the property.
Yeah.

2087
01:59:31.810 --> 01:59:35.920
And this is like one of the number one,
number two zoos in the nation and,

2088
01:59:35.921 --> 01:59:39.700
and now they're fun.
This is one of Jack Hanna's from zoos are weird man.

2089
01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:42.770
<v 2>Cause I agree with them with certain animals.</v>

2090
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:47.060
But those most animals in the zoo,
I think zoos,

2091
01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:51.170
I think the only way you should really be able to have a zoo and be able to

2092
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:54.320
pretend that it's humane is do it the way they do in Africa.

2093
01:59:54.590 --> 01:59:58.520
But don't have people hunt in there.
You know in Africa.

2094
01:59:58.550 --> 02:00:00.550
The reason why they have so many God damn animals now,

2095
02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:02.060
cause they have these huge preserves,

2096
02:00:02.061 --> 02:00:05.720
thousands and thousands of acres and they have these animals run free.

2097
02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:07.730
But they do it so they could profit off it.

2098
02:00:07.731 --> 02:00:09.890
They bring in hunters and the hunters hump these wild animals.

2099
02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:11.890
So they think they're on a wild animal hunting.

2100
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:16.030
They technically or on a wild animal hub.
But really these,
it's a cage ton.

2101
02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:16.911
These animals,

2102
02:00:16.911 --> 02:00:20.060
I mean they are hunting lions but those lines aren't going anywhere.
You know,

2103
02:00:20.061 --> 02:00:23.570
it's like it's a very sketchy area when it comes to um,

2104
02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:26.000
people that believe in fair chase hunting.

2105
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Like the Africa thing is a fucker because the other problem is they do preserve

2106
02:00:31.611 --> 02:00:33.980
those populations this way.
Cause other than that,

2107
02:00:34.190 --> 02:00:37.100
no one else is trying to keep the eland alive.
No one,
you know,

2108
02:00:37.101 --> 02:00:40.520
no one is working hard to make sure that all these different versions of

2109
02:00:40.521 --> 02:00:44.360
antelope or healthy populations if it wasn't for these hunters.

2110
02:00:44.361 --> 02:00:46.100
But it gets,

2111
02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:50.000
it gets real weird when you start thinking about like zoos because we'll,
okay,

2112
02:00:50.001 --> 02:00:52.580
what's a zoo?
We only have like a couple of them.

2113
02:00:52.581 --> 02:00:54.890
You have like a two giraffes are three giraffes.

2114
02:00:54.891 --> 02:00:58.370
You have like a couple and everybody's separated from everybody and you're all

2115
02:00:58.371 --> 02:01:01.790
in this weird non-natural environment where nobody can move around.

2116
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:06.290
I'm not opposed to like a giant animal park where you could kind of drive

2117
02:01:06.291 --> 02:01:06.621
through,

2118
02:01:06.621 --> 02:01:10.190
but I think you've got to let nature take its course in that motherfucker.

2119
02:01:10.191 --> 02:01:14.630
You got to have monkeys swinging through the trees above Jaguars.
You gotta have,

2120
02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:17.900
you gotta have giraffes that are running away from lions.

2121
02:01:17.901 --> 02:01:20.030
You got to have the whole thing.
Cause if you don't have the whole thing,

2122
02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:21.163
what are you doing?

2123
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:24.560
You're taking these animals and you're deciding that their reality,

2124
02:01:24.561 --> 02:01:28.700
their nature itself is not humane.
Like it's not right.

2125
02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:31.240
<v 9>It's not right to seem very dated.
Now that you say that,</v>

2126
02:01:31.290 --> 02:01:33.040
it seems like a throwback to the thirties

2127
02:01:33.170 --> 02:01:36.530
<v 2>it's from when people didn't have DVDs,</v>

2128
02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:38.930
they didn't have the animal planet.

2129
02:01:38.931 --> 02:01:42.620
They have any of these things where they can go and watch a show on a species

2130
02:01:42.621 --> 02:01:44.270
and watch a fascinating documentary.

2131
02:01:44.670 --> 02:01:48.310
You only way to see it would be to go see it in live.
But you go to the zoo.

2132
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:50.550
<v 9>Oh Daddy,
look at the elephant.</v>

2133
02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:54.390
You would never see a lion if you didn't see it in a zoo in the fucking,

2134
02:01:54.750 --> 02:01:56.970
in the 30s absolutely.
I'm pretty,

2135
02:01:56.971 --> 02:02:00.990
I think though a lot of people are getting like see roads shit mixed up with

2136
02:02:00.991 --> 02:02:05.220
like zoos though because I think that's why everyone didn't know that.

2137
02:02:05.221 --> 02:02:07.980
See Road kidnapped these,
they thought that,

2138
02:02:07.981 --> 02:02:11.320
oh these were taken here because they were injured more.
The zoo,
like I,

2139
02:02:11.321 --> 02:02:15.160
I just moved to San Diego Zoo zoo,
one of the best zoos in the nation,

2140
02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:18.450
San Diego and uh,
they have this whole thing.

2141
02:02:18.451 --> 02:02:21.180
We did the tour this time and they had this whole thing that you can tell,

2142
02:02:21.181 --> 02:02:23.240
it's almost them getting ready for the,

2143
02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:26.970
their version of black fish that's coming up because they were already talking

2144
02:02:26.971 --> 02:02:31.740
like,
look,
we hate animals in cages.
Awesome.
But we are nonprofit.

2145
02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:34.760
We,
these animals right here,
there was only two left in the road.

2146
02:02:34.761 --> 02:02:39.000
We thought this animal was extinct in 1960 was the last time we saw this,

2147
02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:41.820
this one kind of pig or whatever it was.
And he's like,
he's like,

2148
02:02:41.821 --> 02:02:44.100
now there's 20 of them because we take them here.

2149
02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:46.530
We breed them and then we put them back into the wild.

2150
02:02:46.650 --> 02:02:48.720
Now I don't think they put them in Africa.
They're probably put it in some,

2151
02:02:49.190 --> 02:02:51.490
you know,
baby version of it.

2152
02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:55.580
<v 2>Do put it in Africa.
They put them in these wildlife sanctuaries,</v>

2153
02:02:55.581 --> 02:02:57.590
this gigantic places where they let people hunt them.

2154
02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:59.130
They just don't let them hunt that pig.

2155
02:02:59.170 --> 02:03:03.400
<v 9>That's what they do.
But,
but it was,
it was very eye opening for this.
This,</v>

2156
02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:06.640
when I went to this one,
because they were showing us all the work they've done.

2157
02:03:06.641 --> 02:03:08.560
Like,
like there was like only two of these birds.

2158
02:03:08.570 --> 02:03:12.820
Now there's a 200 and every animal on there says they're endangered.

2159
02:03:12.821 --> 02:03:15.880
Well what their,
their level of endangerment.
Now there's like monkeys,

2160
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:18.490
like some monkeys.
There's a billion of these monkeys so they don't give a shit,

2161
02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:19.030
you know?

2162
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:22.750
But most of those animals in there are only in there for a reason because

2163
02:03:22.751 --> 02:03:25.840
they're injured or whatever.
And then they're getting put it back in the wild.

2164
02:03:26.110 --> 02:03:29.140
And that's why we're like these Cook Koch brother things.
You know,

2165
02:03:29.141 --> 02:03:32.650
where they're completely lying there.
All these animals are screwed.

2166
02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:33.420
These animals,

2167
02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:36.610
like this is one of the best zoos in the nation that they've taken care of.

2168
02:03:36.611 --> 02:03:40.570
So many,
you know,
the white lion or a,
I think it was came,
you know,

2169
02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:44.930
it's endanger white line that they had there.
Yeah.

2170
02:03:45.010 --> 02:03:47.950
Back in the day and check this one clip out.

2171
02:03:47.951 --> 02:03:51.930
This is how fucked up this thing is with the Columbus Zoo for prosperity.

2172
02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:55.550
<v 2>That's hilarious.
That's so funny.
And it's so true.
Yeah.</v>

2173
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:59.020
So why do they want that property?
What do they want to do with it?

2174
02:03:59.150 --> 02:04:01.730
<v 9>I,
you know,
I don't know anything about that.</v>

2175
02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:03.420
I just found out about this the other day.
I was,

2176
02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:07.010
cause I was talking about how the zoo was so,
such a great thing growing up,

2177
02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:09.950
you're going to lose it.
Totally.
I,
I don't know that they have until November,

2178
02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:13.460
but they're also fucked till November.
And I dunno man.

2179
02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:18.380
Growing up I went to summer camp at the zoo and Jack Hanna was our camp leader

2180
02:04:18.381 --> 02:04:23.030
and we would like spend the night at the zoo and it was just the best childhood

2181
02:04:23.031 --> 02:04:27.560
memory ever learning about animals being at the zoo,
you know.
And it's,

2182
02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:32.600
it really sucks that zoos are getting kind of attached to this whole black fish

2183
02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:37.380
seaworld bullshit cause it's really once making profit and one's trying to make

2184
02:04:37.381 --> 02:04:40.280
profit office stolen the animals from the water and one's just trying to help

2185
02:04:40.290 --> 02:04:45.060
animals.
We are zoos.
Are Zoos more a nonprofit organizations?
Most of them are,

2186
02:04:45.090 --> 02:04:45.570
yeah.

2187
02:04:45.570 --> 02:04:46.403
<v 2>Well the,
the,</v>

2188
02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:49.650
the itch that people that have an issue with zoos have an issue with the

2189
02:04:49.651 --> 02:04:51.120
conditions.
They have an issue.

2190
02:04:51.121 --> 02:04:55.320
Like there was a zoo that I was driving limos once and I was coming home from a

2191
02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:56.400
Gig that I had a,

2192
02:04:56.401 --> 02:05:00.390
I had to drop somebody off in New Hampshire and I was driving down and there was

2193
02:05:00.391 --> 02:05:04.320
a zoo and just on a Lark I just said,

2194
02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:05.980
well let me see what the zoo looks like.
And I,

2195
02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:08.640
I went to this little tiny zoo and there was this,

2196
02:05:08.910 --> 02:05:12.240
there was a lion and a bear and the lion,

2197
02:05:12.241 --> 02:05:16.620
it was the saddest fucking thing ever.
This line was just pacing back and forth.

2198
02:05:16.650 --> 02:05:20.130
His tiny little enclosure and there was nowhere to go.

2199
02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:21.480
It was just pacing back and forth.

2200
02:05:21.481 --> 02:05:24.900
It was all concrete and it's like little pond forum and I was like,

2201
02:05:24.901 --> 02:05:28.150
this is the saddest shit I've ever seen.
This thing is just pace.

2202
02:05:28.151 --> 02:05:31.680
It can't go anywhere and he can't,
it does.
It doesn't get to kill anything.

2203
02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:33.720
It doesn't get to be a lion doesn't get to be aligned,

2204
02:05:33.721 --> 02:05:38.610
just pacing back and forth,
back and forth.
And um,
I just remember thinking like,

2205
02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:42.720
how is that better than it not being alive?
Like that's not,
but what?

2206
02:05:42.721 --> 02:05:44.850
Just so we could look at it.
So it's,
it's a,

2207
02:05:44.851 --> 02:05:47.100
it's better than not be know that thinks she'd be dead.

2208
02:05:47.101 --> 02:05:49.920
It's better off being dead than living like that.
That's crazy.

2209
02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:53.850
Or let the mother fucker go bring it back to Africa.
Put It,

2210
02:05:53.851 --> 02:05:57.090
if you really give a shit about lions,
set up cameras set up,

2211
02:05:57.091 --> 02:06:00.220
can't we make people go there on Safari?
Make people drive around,

2212
02:06:00.250 --> 02:06:01.950
see the actual real thing,
you know,

2213
02:06:01.951 --> 02:06:05.670
maybe it'll really get an appreciation for what it's like to live in Africa.

2214
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.500
If you could actually see them in a wild conditions.
You see like,

2215
02:06:09.810 --> 02:06:11.700
but San Diego is huge.

2216
02:06:11.850 --> 02:06:14.790
The thing about that animal park that's really dope is that they have big

2217
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:19.370
enclosures like the area where the giraffes are.
Holy Shit,
it's fucked.

2218
02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:22.890
<v 9>Is this the safari place?
Hey,
drive around the zoo.
Yeah.</v>

2219
02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:23.900
But they also have the safari thing.

2220
02:06:23.901 --> 02:06:28.190
And another cool thing is they also do a lot of alternative methods to make the

2221
02:06:28.191 --> 02:06:31.310
animals not go crazy.
Like they hide the food.
They will,

2222
02:06:31.311 --> 02:06:32.480
they'll take the animals out,

2223
02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:36.710
they'll go round Hyde neat and like trees and bushes and putting it inside of

2224
02:06:36.711 --> 02:06:39.590
things.
And then that the animals just like their natural habitat,

2225
02:06:39.591 --> 02:06:42.560
look on hunt for food.
So there's a lot of things that they do.

2226
02:06:42.620 --> 02:06:45.620
Like the elephants have these new things that they created,
uh,
called uh,

2227
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:50.120
the hey pen Jada's and it's these huge Penn Jada's with hey inside of them.

2228
02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:54.680
So the elephant has to work out and try to beat these things open to the zoo.

2229
02:06:54.681 --> 02:06:57.050
And then there's a wild animal park.
We're just two different things.

2230
02:06:57.051 --> 02:07:00.220
That's what it is.
I've only been to the wild animal park zoo.

2231
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:04.580
The zoo is humongous if you think that wild animal park zoo,
it's crazy.

2232
02:07:04.581 --> 02:07:07.520
Bit of both.
Real Bill.
Yeah,
and all I can think is the bad.

2233
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:11.210
The alternative ways to keep them unoccupied that you would come up with if you

2234
02:07:11.211 --> 02:07:14.360
work there,
you're like,
hey guys,
I felt one of our trainer outfits with meat.

2235
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:15.860
We're going to give it to lions.
See if he can,

2236
02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:19.560
<v 2>they definitely should let animals go and let the animals kill him.
I mean,</v>

2237
02:07:19.561 --> 02:07:24.300
it's so ridiculous that they have to butcher the animal.
It's like,
come on,

2238
02:07:24.301 --> 02:07:26.370
what are you doing?
Like letter an ally and be alliance.

2239
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:28.730
<v 9>That's a,
that's the saddest is it's like,</v>

2240
02:07:29.370 --> 02:07:32.290
it's just like the same as what we were talking about with kids in school.

2241
02:07:32.590 --> 02:07:35.110
Kids got a little bit of a fucking quirk and all of a sudden they're like,
no,
no,

2242
02:07:35.111 --> 02:07:36.130
no,
he's not fitting in the form.

2243
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:39.100
<v 2>Well,
how about this?
What if they gave me a pill?</v>

2244
02:07:39.250 --> 02:07:43.720
What if they gave you a pill that made uh,
the,
the common your balls dry up,

2245
02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:48.340
but it kept you horny.
You know that that wouldn't be acceptable.
It's like,

2246
02:07:48.341 --> 02:07:51.160
well look,
we've checked his balls is very little common area,
but he's like,

2247
02:07:51.170 --> 02:07:54.070
I'm on book.
Oh all done.
But the balls don't know.

2248
02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.620
Well that's what it's like to be aligned and get fed meat.

2249
02:07:56.830 --> 02:08:00.280
They're just sliding meet under the door.
So every day you're eating and be like,

2250
02:08:00.281 --> 02:08:01.600
I didn't kill Shit today.

2251
02:08:01.630 --> 02:08:05.440
And so you get this thing where everything that moves past you,
you look at,

2252
02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:09.700
you roll a ball of yarn past a lion,
they jump on it just like a cat does.

2253
02:08:10.150 --> 02:08:13.380
It's like they have that instinct.
Cats have an instinct to chase moving thing.

2254
02:08:13.381 --> 02:08:15.550
So it alliance,
it's part of why they're Elian.

2255
02:08:15.850 --> 02:08:18.130
It's like their whole reward system.

2256
02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:23.030
Their whole genetic reward system is geared up to fuck and to chase things and

2257
02:08:23.031 --> 02:08:25.060
the cash dominate the whole deal.

2258
02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:27.790
The all of it is supposed to be a part and the mail's supposed to protect the,

2259
02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:31.800
the pack.
What did they pride rather?
The female's supposed to hunt it.

2260
02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:34.690
They have instincts to do these things and all those instincts you just

2261
02:08:34.691 --> 02:08:35.860
completely shut off.

2262
02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:39.370
And then they're in this enclosure with nothing else but them.

2263
02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:41.710
And every now and then some food comes in.
They're like,
okay,

2264
02:08:41.711 --> 02:08:44.810
well here's our food.
What kind of fucking life is this?
Yeah,

2265
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:49.950
it's a life completely outside of the adventure of being alive in the adventure

2266
02:08:51.161 --> 02:08:53.650
of being aligned is the adventure of being a predator.

2267
02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:55.750
That's the whole thing about being aligned,

2268
02:08:55.751 --> 02:08:59.320
that their whole existence is based on chasing down the week.

2269
02:08:59.321 --> 02:09:03.090
There's like the cleaning system and like they're,

2270
02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:07.870
they're like making sure that the genetics of the wild stay strong.

2271
02:09:08.050 --> 02:09:12.840
They liked the genetics,
integrity,
experts.
Anybody that's weak,
anybody's limping,

2272
02:09:12.970 --> 02:09:17.050
anybody that's slept in and anybody that gets cocky and goes near the water hall

2273
02:09:17.051 --> 02:09:20.450
without paying attention to the grass,
moving your fucks.
Vale.

2274
02:09:20.770 --> 02:09:23.500
And that's how nature has it set up to make sure there's not too many fucking

2275
02:09:23.501 --> 02:09:28.420
antelopes.
They have a whole system,
but we come along and go,
fuck your system.

2276
02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:29.620
We have a system to,

2277
02:09:29.621 --> 02:09:33.520
it's called [inaudible] and this is called a fence and this is a tray.

2278
02:09:33.521 --> 02:09:37.090
And on its meat he'd go eat it.
We're gonna stare at you.
You got to stare at me.

2279
02:09:37.390 --> 02:09:39.970
Like staring at a lion is unheard of.

2280
02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:44.020
You imagine being a fucking lion and there's glass and all these little pink

2281
02:09:44.021 --> 02:09:47.020
monkeys have the audacity to look you in the fucking eye and you're like

2282
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:51.970
all day everybody avoid your eye contact.

2283
02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:56.040
<v 10>You're welcome to walk around like a fucking hall monitor.</v>

2284
02:09:56.190 --> 02:09:57.720
Everyone sees you and like get the fuck away.

2285
02:09:57.870 --> 02:10:01.440
And then Dan there you believe what that must be like for this poor fucking

2286
02:10:01.441 --> 02:10:01.980
lines.

2287
02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:03.750
<v 2>Oh,
for a lion,</v>

2288
02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:07.710
if a lion is walking through the grass and something locks eyes with it to like

2289
02:10:08.130 --> 02:10:12.750
fuck.
That's the immediate reaction.
You see those eyes,

2290
02:10:12.751 --> 02:10:17.751
those fucking weird orangy amber eyes attach to this giant fucking skull of

2291
02:10:19.351 --> 02:10:23.880
death.
He just run immediately run,
get with the pack,

2292
02:10:23.881 --> 02:10:28.830
hope they get the slow one behind you.
Fucking trip your friend run.

2293
02:10:29.250 --> 02:10:32.430
It's a lion.
But meanwhile at the zoo we're like,
well look,
he's right there,

2294
02:10:32.431 --> 02:10:34.130
mom hook.
He's right there.

2295
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:36.890
<v 3>Knock,
knock,
knock,
knock,
knock,
knock.
Yeah.</v>

2296
02:10:37.610 --> 02:10:42.020
What they should do is take those old zoos that are kind of like haggard and

2297
02:10:42.021 --> 02:10:46.100
they should fill it with like celebrities,
like celebrities.
Like,
no,

2298
02:10:46.101 --> 02:10:47.570
I'm not saying Tom Sizemore is a mess,

2299
02:10:47.571 --> 02:10:51.050
but give them booze and alcohol and put them in a cage and let you stare at him

2300
02:10:51.051 --> 02:10:54.620
and him just say whatever the fuck he wants because he's getting paid $1 million

2301
02:10:54.621 --> 02:10:57.350
for one year to be in a cage.
That's not enough money.

2302
02:10:58.490 --> 02:11:02.270
What is the New York you worked for the moon at the New York at the New York

2303
02:11:02.271 --> 02:11:04.280
City.
You did that move knows and Massachusetts.

2304
02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:08.030
We actually did it at a zoo that is,
um,
is not,

2305
02:11:08.770 --> 02:11:11.180
it's not operational right now.
It's kind of going under.

2306
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:16.390
That's kind of so was celebrities fill up with fucking all sweetie.

2307
02:11:16.671 --> 02:11:19.970
That,
that idea sucks.
What's better than my other idea,

2308
02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:24.140
which was we just put cages in the wild and you can go in the wild and have

2309
02:11:24.141 --> 02:11:28.220
those animals around you.
Yeah.
That's a better idea.

2310
02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:30.020
Like I cause that when I go,

2311
02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:32.300
I went swimming with sharks with my daughter's a couple of weeks,

2312
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:36.140
few weeks ago in why?
How was that?
I love it.
Fucking love it.
So what do you do?

2313
02:11:36.141 --> 02:11:39.630
You go actually in scuba gear or you go under the sharks,
what do you do again?

2314
02:11:39.690 --> 02:11:42.320
They,
you take,
they take out like three miles.
It's all,

2315
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:46.370
it's all like a eco ecofriendly like they don't feed the sharks,

2316
02:11:46.670 --> 02:11:50.780
but the sharks just come out because that's where they think they're fishermen

2317
02:11:50.781 --> 02:11:54.920
dropping bait.
And so they go out and you get,
you get in the cage,

2318
02:11:54.921 --> 02:11:56.810
they pull the boat away and you're just sitting in a cage.

2319
02:11:57.170 --> 02:12:00.260
Just the boats like 30 yards away from you,

2320
02:12:00.261 --> 02:12:04.640
40 yards away from you and the sharks.
There's least 20 fucking sharks.

2321
02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:08.210
Dirty sharks.
I've done this one place like five times.

2322
02:12:08.330 --> 02:12:12.470
What part of Hawaii is this?
A wahoo.
Wahoo.
Fucking amazing.

2323
02:12:12.650 --> 02:12:17.150
So what is it like for your kids?
Uh,
they were scared at first,

2324
02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:20.930
but what happened was I just told the guys who ran the boat,
who I knew,

2325
02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:23.930
because I'd done it for TV.
I told him,
I said,
you just be in charge.

2326
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:27.590
Don't let anyone say no,
just be in charge.
This is how we do it guys.

2327
02:12:27.591 --> 02:12:29.870
Everyone get your masks on and grab your mask.
Everyone get your mask.

2328
02:12:30.140 --> 02:12:30.980
Ali got your mask.

2329
02:12:30.981 --> 02:12:33.770
And so there's no point where they can get out of it by talking to me.

2330
02:12:33.771 --> 02:12:36.200
Cause I knew they wanted to do it by knew that we're going to be scared.

2331
02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:39.020
And I would let,
I would never let them do something they weren't,

2332
02:12:39.021 --> 02:12:42.180
didn't feel safe doing.
But the guys did it.
And the girls were just in Rome.

2333
02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:44.540
They were like,
okay.
He's like,
all right,
this foot right here,

2334
02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:47.870
this foot right here.
Here we go.
And then we're going to back into the cage.

2335
02:12:47.871 --> 02:12:49.340
There you go.
I'll,
you're in first Georgia.

2336
02:12:49.570 --> 02:12:53.270
I'm already in the cage and I get them and they're like holding on and you can

2337
02:12:53.271 --> 02:12:54.950
see they're scared.
And I got to go pro going on.

2338
02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.330
I filmed all of it and I was a seven to nine.

2339
02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:03.980
Wow.
That's fascinating.
That's really cool.
And they fucking loved it.

2340
02:13:03.981 --> 02:13:06.290
The first look you can see she's scared out of,

2341
02:13:06.291 --> 02:13:08.510
puts her face in the water and then pops up.

2342
02:13:08.511 --> 02:13:11.300
And I just caught it on the Gopro and she's so excited.

2343
02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:15.190
She throws her face right back in the water to look again.
And they were,
uh,

2344
02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:18.440
they were boggling.
They had so much fucking fun.
Well,

2345
02:13:18.441 --> 02:13:21.680
if you feel safe and you could really see sharks out in the wild,

2346
02:13:21.681 --> 02:13:22.630
it's gotta be pretty wild.

2347
02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:26.030
Be a kid to see something like that and you're in the cage for the first time in

2348
02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:28.970
their lives.
They're the one in the cage and the cage is a pretty safe,
right?

2349
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.490
I mean,
it just really say a giant ass fucking great white to fuck that cage up.

2350
02:13:32.491 --> 02:13:36.270
Or is that just in the movies?
You know,
so crazy.
We get out of the cage and a,

2351
02:13:36.271 --> 02:13:41.070
and a whale to whales come by.
Oh Shit.
Big Ass fucking wheels.

2352
02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:43.780
Like maybe 20 feet off the boat.
I got this on video too.
Wow.

2353
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:47.790
20 feet off the boat,
swim around the back and dive right by the cage.

2354
02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:50.160
And I threw my Gopro in.
One of the guys grabbed it.

2355
02:13:50.161 --> 02:13:54.930
She got the whales going down and it was surreal.
But what's crazy as you think,

2356
02:13:55.410 --> 02:13:58.680
if those whales decided they could just fucking jump up and land on the boat,

2357
02:13:58.681 --> 02:14:02.100
the cage,
and we're all dead as fuck.
Does that ever happen?
Yeah.

2358
02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:04.230
It happened with the sailboat in Australia.

2359
02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:07.600
A whale just jumped up and landed on the sailboat.
Yeah.

2360
02:14:07.770 --> 02:14:12.450
What are you showing Brian?
Burt's.
I wouldn't trip like we do it.
That's the cage.

2361
02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:14.040
Yeah.
Same foods that we do want to triple it.

2362
02:14:14.041 --> 02:14:17.250
We've done it twice and I love it so much because it's one of those moments

2363
02:14:17.251 --> 02:14:20.680
where you really have this like kind of surreal life experience.

2364
02:14:20.681 --> 02:14:22.860
What it's like going to church and getting it.
Wow.
I want to go.

2365
02:14:24.060 --> 02:14:28.490
It's a lot of fucking fun.
Scuba diving.
It seems like it'd be crazy to just,

2366
02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.010
and you've done that right?
Yeah.
I'm going to scuba [inaudible] for trip.
Yeah.

2367
02:14:32.011 --> 02:14:35.520
But I'm not certified.
I've done it.
I do you like do a day certification.

2368
02:14:35.570 --> 02:14:40.110
It's like entering into just the very front patio of another world.

2369
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:45.390
You know?
It's like you just open the front door.
He's Stan,
you look around,

2370
02:14:45.570 --> 02:14:49.560
you kind of go in a couple of steps,
but it's a whole other world out there.

2371
02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:53.010
There's a lot of things that I've done on the show that,
um,
that are,
are mine,

2372
02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:56.310
like riding motorcycles.
I would've never done that if it wasn't for that show,

2373
02:14:56.370 --> 02:15:00.420
but now dude,
it is that you have often rushing in the world.

2374
02:15:00.450 --> 02:15:02.400
You not worried about crashing?
Of course I am,

2375
02:15:02.430 --> 02:15:04.890
but that's what makes it maybe you could get like a,

2376
02:15:04.891 --> 02:15:08.100
a big Harley type bike drive slow,

2377
02:15:08.101 --> 02:15:12.300
don't get crazy and only drive in populated areas.
That's what they say.

2378
02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:13.930
Where else?
A lot of traffic.

2379
02:15:14.190 --> 02:15:18.090
They say young leaving the comedy store last night and one of those off like

2380
02:15:18.091 --> 02:15:21.180
this crazy four by four motorcycle.
Fake motorcycles.

2381
02:15:21.410 --> 02:15:26.100
TV like like Dmx?
Yeah,
like what's that one?

2382
02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:28.230
What was he driving when those ones,

2383
02:15:28.231 --> 02:15:30.940
it's almost looks like it has training wheels but it's a motorcycle.

2384
02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:34.440
It's like a trike and trike.
Yeah,
I knew what I was going to tell you.

2385
02:15:34.530 --> 02:15:36.810
What's he doing on that?
I don't know.
It was weird seeing him on that.

2386
02:15:36.930 --> 02:15:38.340
We grown up in Florida.

2387
02:15:38.341 --> 02:15:43.341
We played bows and arrows all the time like it was meant to tell you this and so

2388
02:15:43.651 --> 02:15:44.431
we're in Hawaii.

2389
02:15:44.431 --> 02:15:47.900
We went on a boar hunt where in Hawaii where we chase it with the dogs and then

2390
02:15:47.901 --> 02:15:52.270
stab it in the launch for trip flip.
Yeah.
Whoa.
That's a crazy fucking trip.
Oh,

2391
02:15:52.271 --> 02:15:56.600
who's was,
is that someone's idea?
That guy's idea?
No,
it was our idea.
Oh,

2392
02:15:56.610 --> 02:15:58.490
it was your idea for them.
Yeah.
It's like,
yeah,

2393
02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:01.340
you got to go murder an animal that's murdering you.

2394
02:16:01.341 --> 02:16:03.640
Gotta you gotta you gotta run it by them and you know,
be like,

2395
02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:04.560
you cool with this.

2396
02:16:04.650 --> 02:16:07.020
I'm never going to put someone in a situation and if they weren't cool that we

2397
02:16:07.021 --> 02:16:09.810
just wouldn't have done it.
Right.
But it's,
look,
it's,
it's,
I believe this,

2398
02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:13.510
if you're going to enjoy bacon,
you better be cool with the harvest.
Yes.

2399
02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:16.140
I believe that.
And so,
um,

2400
02:16:16.530 --> 02:16:21.480
so we get it like a thing full of pimples and we go catch a pig,
hold it down.

2401
02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:26.730
My guy grabs a knife,
stabs in the heart,
and then when they,
then they tie it up,

2402
02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:30.850
they tie the feet and legs together,
like the wrists and the ankles together.

2403
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:33.550
And I wear it like a backpack carrying it out of the woods.

2404
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:35.390
Fucking heavy ass pitch.

2405
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:39.310
But the best part is that I know and I know I can fuck around with a bone arrow

2406
02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:41.890
pretty easily and be okay.

2407
02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:45.760
So we're with all these real fucking Hawaiian hunters and they got everything

2408
02:16:45.761 --> 02:16:49.000
they got and they've got in their backyard,
this huge house.

2409
02:16:49.001 --> 02:16:52.300
They've got the Hay bales with the target.
And I said,

2410
02:16:52.450 --> 02:16:55.990
I bet anyone in the crew right now,
I can get close to a bullseye.

2411
02:16:56.390 --> 02:17:00.760
I can hit the target from like hugging,
not 100 yards,

2412
02:17:00.761 --> 02:17:04.360
but like 50 yards under the tent.
I said,
I can do it from under the tent.

2413
02:17:04.361 --> 02:17:05.860
There's a big fucking fennel,
this,

2414
02:17:06.330 --> 02:17:10.480
there's a tent and you're going to shoot from under the tent out through the

2415
02:17:10.481 --> 02:17:13.760
tent into the fucking bullseye.
And they're like,

2416
02:17:14.590 --> 02:17:17.740
just by shooting.
Wait a minute,
what kind of a boat?

2417
02:17:17.741 --> 02:17:21.510
You're talking about a compound bow and it's going to go 50 yards.
It's gonna go,

2418
02:17:21.511 --> 02:17:23.980
I'm gonna.
I'm guessing you get assigned a ballpark right now.
I don't remember.

2419
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:26.680
Are you looking through a site?
They have it.
Well there is a site on the,

2420
02:17:26.681 --> 02:17:30.580
there was a site on this on a string and then another site,

2421
02:17:30.581 --> 02:17:35.170
the aligning the site up with,
uh,
it was,
it was the,
it was,
uh,
it was,

2422
02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:38.380
there was a site,
I don't know what site it was,
but in my head I'm like,

2423
02:17:38.381 --> 02:17:40.450
I can confidently do it without the site.
Like,

2424
02:17:40.510 --> 02:17:42.270
cause I'm getting hit the bullseye from fifth night,

2425
02:17:42.330 --> 02:17:44.890
not the bullseye by sending could hit the target.
It's,
but,

2426
02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:48.310
and I really hard to do really hard to do it,
but I know I can do it.
So I'm like,

2427
02:17:48.430 --> 02:17:52.420
I go who's in?
And I was,
and everyone's like,
bullshit,
bullshit.

2428
02:17:52.450 --> 02:17:55.360
I get one of the fucking tent,
I pull back,
I hold it.

2429
02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:58.360
And as soon as I pull the back,
once you pull compound bow back,

2430
02:17:58.480 --> 02:17:59.530
it's easy to hold.

2431
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:04.960
And so I hold it and I start lining up the site seeing lucky as fuck.

2432
02:18:04.961 --> 02:18:07.840
I hit the target and I like,
part of me was like,
I don't know if I can do this,

2433
02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:10.210
but everyone on the crew was like,
shut the fuck up.

2434
02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:11.710
So then everyone on the crew tried to do it.

2435
02:18:11.770 --> 02:18:14.800
They couldn't even pull the compound bow back like they were.
They were like,

2436
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:17.860
there's a picture I posted on Instagram a while and my buddy Eric trying to pull

2437
02:18:17.861 --> 02:18:19.870
the bow back and he couldn't even get it all the way back.

2438
02:18:19.871 --> 02:18:23.950
How many pounds of pole was it?
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
Just one of the guys is pretty,

2439
02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:27.820
it was a pretty heavy bowl.
It's very difficult to hit a target that's 50 yards,

2440
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:32.620
50 yards,
maybe longer than I may be exaggerating for,
but I don't know.

2441
02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:37.180
This is very difficult to know where the pin's going.
Like if you would have to,

2442
02:18:37.930 --> 02:18:40.640
if you have a pin on a boat,
there's two different types of pens.

2443
02:18:40.641 --> 02:18:42.940
Does a single pin and a single pin.

2444
02:18:42.970 --> 02:18:45.700
You rotate forward and backward with this site.

2445
02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.230
So the site has like a yardage on it.
So like you have it set at 20 yards,

2446
02:18:50.530 --> 02:18:51.610
20 yards is like,

2447
02:18:51.611 --> 02:18:56.530
we're like maybe a shortish shot would be like,
say if you're going to Trieste.

2448
02:18:56.530 --> 02:19:00.940
It was longer than it was longer than 20 yards.
Okay.
So then if it's longer,

2449
02:19:00.941 --> 02:19:04.150
what you do is you put a,
uh,
like a laser sight on it.

2450
02:19:04.390 --> 02:19:09.040
You Lock on how far it is,
the exact distance.
He was drunk.
I was drunk.

2451
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:13.450
Then you dial it back.
But my point is that an Arrow,
when you shoot an now,

2452
02:19:13.451 --> 02:19:16.480
if like 50 yards,
it's going to drop considerably.

2453
02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:20.110
Especially depending on how strong the bow is,
how heavy the Arrow is.

2454
02:19:20.430 --> 02:19:22.510
This is very hard.
The may not have been 50 yards,

2455
02:19:22.511 --> 02:19:24.950
but it was definitely further for a shit.
Okay.

2456
02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:27.620
You feel like you could do it again?
Yeah.

2457
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:30.320
<v 2>Wow.
Yeah.
Dude,
you gotta come over my house.
Was She?
Dude,</v>

2458
02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:34.100
it's so funny that you're gonna make a video of those.
We,
I told you we,

2459
02:19:34.101 --> 02:19:35.570
when we were kids,
we used to do them with our feet.

2460
02:19:35.980 --> 02:19:39.610
Like that was our big things because we went to a camp was all bone arrowheads,

2461
02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:44.300
recurve bow.
Is that what it was?
I have regular bow and arrow.
We did.

2462
02:19:44.420 --> 02:19:47.920
We it compound though,
right?
There wasn't a compound bow.
We did.
We went deer.

2463
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:52.010
We went hunting in Italy with bows.
But the ones that you got to hold the arrows,

2464
02:19:52.050 --> 02:19:55.910
you got to hold the boat sideways,
sideways.
It was still like some bows.

2465
02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:58.550
You can't just like,
uh,
dammit man,

2466
02:19:58.551 --> 02:20:01.700
I wish I was smarter and I paid attention more.
Oh,
I know what you're saying.

2467
02:20:01.701 --> 02:20:03.500
Because they don't have arrest,
they don't have a rest.

2468
02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:05.780
So you've got to hold it sideways and to shoot the bow that way.

2469
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:07.870
The way the Mongols used to do it right.

2470
02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:10.520
And I'd never shot with one of those boats,
but I was cocky vent too.

2471
02:20:10.730 --> 02:20:11.870
And I was like,
oh I got this.

2472
02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:15.890
It's that grew up with bows and arrows and I fucking pulled it back and I

2473
02:20:15.891 --> 02:20:19.130
fucking could not hit this goddamn deer.
I fuck.

2474
02:20:19.140 --> 02:20:23.180
I mean I tried like it's not an easy thing to do man.
It's really regular bow,

2475
02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:24.770
regular bows or hardy shit.

2476
02:20:24.771 --> 02:20:28.280
Compound bows are a little more user friendly and my opinions Wazier yeah,

2477
02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:29.233
it's way easier.

2478
02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:31.390
That's why they say that if you really want to learn about an error,

2479
02:20:31.391 --> 02:20:35.420
you should learn on a traditional,
like a recurve.
Yeah.
It's cause becomes like,

2480
02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:38.630
you know,
like you,
if you were shooting a three pointer,
you know,

2481
02:20:38.631 --> 02:20:39.960
you kinda gotta you,

2482
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:43.580
you throw it a few times and you kind of get a judge of how hard you have to

2483
02:20:43.581 --> 02:20:47.120
throw it and then eventually you get it,
you figure it out.

2484
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:51.350
Well that's the whole idea behind a recurve is that you've got to figure out how

2485
02:20:51.351 --> 02:20:55.190
far that Arrow is going to go,
what's going to be the trajectory.

2486
02:20:55.191 --> 02:20:58.340
And if you shoot a hundred hours a day over the course of years,

2487
02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:01.160
you develop a real feel for it.
And some guys,

2488
02:21:01.161 --> 02:21:06.161
like I bought my bow at this place in Los Alamitos and the guy who,

2489
02:21:06.981 --> 02:21:07.530
uh,
owns,

2490
02:21:07.530 --> 02:21:11.090
it's been shooting bows and arrows since he was like a kid and he's in his

2491
02:21:11.450 --> 02:21:15.860
probably in his sixties and he just picked up this bow,
slapped an arrow on it.

2492
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:17.520
When,
I mean,
I'm,

2493
02:21:17.521 --> 02:21:22.250
I'm telling you like within like five or six seconds from picking the bow up,

2494
02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:26.090
putting the Arrow on shit he had let go and nail the target,

2495
02:21:26.140 --> 02:21:29.300
hit a bullseye at 20 yards.
I mean it was,
it was like this click,
click.

2496
02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:33.020
I mean it took no time at all.

2497
02:21:33.290 --> 02:21:36.680
He's just so he's like when you've shot as many hours as I have,

2498
02:21:36.681 --> 02:21:40.160
you just kind of know where the Arrow is going to go.
Just based on the numbers,

2499
02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:43.670
like the input,
like if you throw a hundred free throws,

2500
02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:46.520
he kind of get an idea of how hard you have to throw that free throw.

2501
02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:49.580
You'd shoot a hundred arrows,
you go,
oh that's over there and you,
your,

2502
02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:52.820
your brain almost has like a calculator as far as like distant,
like,

2503
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:56.000
like are you going to throw a rock?
You kind of know how far,
you know,

2504
02:21:56.060 --> 02:21:59.070
if I give you a rock and the rock is like the size of a golf ball,
you're like,

2505
02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:01.310
think I could throw it over there.

2506
02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:04.370
It kind of have a good idea where this rocks going.
It's muscle memory too.

2507
02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:08.300
Definitely.
It's input.
It's like you get enough input,

2508
02:22:08.301 --> 02:22:11.660
you shoot all these arrows like that one went there,
that one there.
Okay,

2509
02:22:11.661 --> 02:22:12.610
I see where it's going on.

2510
02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:17.480
And then you start calculating up in your brain and then your mind knows exactly

2511
02:22:17.481 --> 02:22:20.330
how high you should raise that Arrow,
you know,

2512
02:22:20.331 --> 02:22:23.700
so that it compensates for the distance that has to travel and the drop that

2513
02:22:23.701 --> 02:22:26.490
it's going to have over the course of time.
Yeah.
But with a compound bow,

2514
02:22:26.491 --> 02:22:28.860
you don't do that as much you do with a site.

2515
02:22:29.430 --> 02:22:32.630
I want to say there was a green laser on it,
but I can't remember.
Yeah,

2516
02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:36.600
they have this thing Trijicon has one,
it looks like a green laser,

2517
02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:41.100
but it's really like a triangle and you rotate it forward and backward depending

2518
02:22:41.101 --> 02:22:42.000
on how the distances,

2519
02:22:42.030 --> 02:22:44.690
these guys would totally take you if you want to go boar hunting in Hawaiian

2520
02:22:44.691 --> 02:22:47.970
next time we was on [inaudible].
But uh,
if I go to Hawaii,

2521
02:22:47.971 --> 02:22:49.890
it's with my family and I'm not coming home bloody.

2522
02:22:53.250 --> 02:22:58.250
There's certain things that I separate all my manly type behaviors really

2523
02:22:58.651 --> 02:23:00.180
separated from my little girls.
Yeah.

2524
02:23:00.220 --> 02:23:03.690
I don't think I want them to see me fucking stab a bore with a knife.

2525
02:23:03.691 --> 02:23:06.030
What dogs are holding it down?
What you doing?

2526
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:10.830
I bet if they saw a real wild pig though,

2527
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:13.940
they'd probably be completely freaked out because like,
fuck yeah.

2528
02:23:14.010 --> 02:23:18.150
Pigs to them are these cute things.
They did see,
we took them to,
um,

2529
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:22.880
there's a,
a farm up in,
um,
southern California,

2530
02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:24.930
forget the name of the farm,
but you go there,

2531
02:23:24.931 --> 02:23:29.850
it's like you could pick your own vegetables and you can,
um,
you can,

2532
02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:33.600
uh,
they wave them for you.
Like you pick radishes and whatever and it's fun,

2533
02:23:33.630 --> 02:23:34.770
you know,
the kids get to do that and,

2534
02:23:34.771 --> 02:23:38.760
but they also have this fucking pig that's as big as this table dude.
I mean,

2535
02:23:38.761 --> 02:23:42.000
is the biggest pig you've ever seen in your life.
It's just gigantic,

2536
02:23:42.001 --> 02:23:44.670
this huge thing.
And they tweak out on that thing.
They're like,

2537
02:23:44.671 --> 02:23:49.490
what the fuck is like?
They think of a pig as being like a cute little pay.

2538
02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:52.050
Like they have stuffed piggies,
you know,
uh,

2539
02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:54.270
one of my daughters is a piggy backpack that she wears.

2540
02:23:54.271 --> 02:23:58.860
Sometimes it's a little pink piggy and then they're seen as fucking wallowing,

2541
02:23:58.861 --> 02:24:03.270
mud covered BMS,
enormous pig.

2542
02:24:03.271 --> 02:24:08.220
It's so fucking big.
And they're like,
what is that?
I'm like,
that's a pig.
Like,
no,

2543
02:24:08.221 --> 02:24:12.870
it's not.
That's on a pig.
Yeah,
that's a pig.
It's not pink.

2544
02:24:13.530 --> 02:24:16.190
Pigs aren't pink.
They're not all pink.
Like what?

2545
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:17.940
And he can see their little faces.

2546
02:24:17.941 --> 02:24:20.250
They little computer spinning like that's a fucking pig.

2547
02:24:20.460 --> 02:24:24.640
I mean things just this big around fat fucked up.
Oh,

2548
02:24:24.930 --> 02:24:29.040
covenant Mage.
Just discuss.
It is a disgusting animal.

2549
02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:31.400
But if you see a wild one,
they're even more gangster.
Yeah,

2550
02:24:31.401 --> 02:24:35.590
but they don't taste good.
Wild woman.
Wild pigs.
You're out of your mind.

2551
02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:39.150
What they told us.
Don't tell,
don't listen to anybody.
They're delicious.

2552
02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:44.180
I shot a wild pig and made ham and it's the best ham I've ever had in my life.

2553
02:24:44.671 --> 02:24:47.610
Serious.
Smoked it over to like at least 10 hours.

2554
02:24:47.611 --> 02:24:49.890
I don't know how many hours it took.
Takes a lot time.

2555
02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:53.310
Isn't there a truth to the fact of what the pig eats?
You are then eating.

2556
02:24:53.670 --> 02:24:56.340
So if it's living off like fucking shitty vegetation,

2557
02:24:56.790 --> 02:25:00.210
it's going to take shitty because they were telling us the pig.

2558
02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:01.350
Normally when they,

2559
02:25:01.350 --> 02:25:05.200
they'll catch the pig and then they'll put it and keep it if feed it good too.

2560
02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:09.980
That's not a pig and the pig family.
Well,
yeah,
you can do that.
I mean,

2561
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:13.140
you definitely could do that.
And some guys do that too to get the pig fatter.

2562
02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:15.210
Like some of the wild pigs aren't as fat.

2563
02:25:15.390 --> 02:25:17.910
The wild pig that I shot though is that to hone ranch,

2564
02:25:17.911 --> 02:25:21.720
which is like rich and acorns and all these different things that the pigs can

2565
02:25:21.721 --> 02:25:25.780
eat.
It was fat.
It was delicious.
It was so good,
man.

2566
02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:28.070
I smoked it,
um,
uh,

2567
02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:31.960
in one of those smokers and I brined it for like six days before I smoked it.

2568
02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:33.180
Brian.
Yeah.

2569
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:36.160
That was some of the best meeting I've ever had in my really delicious,

2570
02:25:36.190 --> 02:25:38.770
if I had to choose one meat that I've ever had ever,

2571
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:41.320
that would have been the one that chose as the best meeting I've ever been told

2572
02:25:41.321 --> 02:25:42.700
us.
They told us someone we killed,
they're like,

2573
02:25:42.701 --> 02:25:44.530
it's not going to taste that great,
but they're idiots.

2574
02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:47.140
They're taking it home and eating it.
They don't know what they're doing either.

2575
02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:51.850
Yeah,
that's probably that I found out that that was true about,
um,
Marlin,

2576
02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:54.820
like you catch a Marlin,
they tell you,
oh you can't even eat these,
you know,

2577
02:25:54.821 --> 02:25:55.511
meanwhile,
yeah,

2578
02:25:55.511 --> 02:25:58.900
you can eat a Marlin that it's like swordfish and to chop it up in steaks.

2579
02:25:59.110 --> 02:26:01.360
But when you,
it's kind of a racket when you,
uh,

2580
02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:04.450
pay for someone to take your fishing or pay for someone to take your hunting.

2581
02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:06.970
Sometimes they want that meat and they're like,
you don't even want this meat,

2582
02:26:06.971 --> 02:26:10.030
dude.
This is a bad meat.
Really.
Like,
oh,
it's okay.
It's bad.
Mean.

2583
02:26:10.210 --> 02:26:14.320
Wild pig is some of the most delicious meat you will ever eat in your life.

2584
02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:15.430
Without a doubt.

2585
02:26:15.431 --> 02:26:18.550
I can say that with a hundred percent confidence cause I haven't just eaten this

2586
02:26:18.551 --> 02:26:22.810
pig.
I've eaten other people's pigs.
They're shot and it's fucking fantastic.

2587
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:26.710
Do you think maybe that's just Hawaiian then?
No.
No tire note.

2588
02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:28.570
These are telling you they're bullshitting you.

2589
02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:33.220
Hawaiians are famous for Lou owls.
What did they cook?
Are there Louis pigs?

2590
02:26:33.340 --> 02:26:35.860
Why do they cook pigs?
Because that's what they hunt.

2591
02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:37.840
They have wild pigs all over Hawaii.

2592
02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:40.390
It's one of the few animals that they brought over with them.

2593
02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:44.650
When people call an Hawaii like it's one of the few animals that they left loose

2594
02:26:44.651 --> 02:26:46.150
and they became feral.
They have deer,

2595
02:26:46.151 --> 02:26:50.170
they have different axis deer and some of the islands they have some mountain

2596
02:26:50.171 --> 02:26:54.220
goats and some of the places,
but maybe,
or maybe I missed who the fuck dude,

2597
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:57.790
they fucked you and they stole your pig.
We,
we weren't going to take it home.

2598
02:26:58.140 --> 02:26:59.980
Well,
they probably didn't want you to eat any of it.

2599
02:27:00.850 --> 02:27:02.950
They didn't want you to bring it back to the restaurant.

2600
02:27:02.951 --> 02:27:05.620
They could probably sell it.
I don't know though.
They were good guys.

2601
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:09.730
I don't think they're are good guys.
You're on TV,
whatever.
Whatever.
I love.

2602
02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:12.820
Give me a hug.
Give me a hug and give me that fucking pig.

2603
02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:17.770
He said they stole your pig,
Bro.
It's no big deal.
They're delicious,
man.

2604
02:27:17.771 --> 02:27:18.850
Don't let anybody tell you different.

2605
02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:21.880
There's a lot of animals that people will tell you that they're not good to eat.

2606
02:27:21.881 --> 02:27:25.600
Like another one that keeps coming up as black bear and like someone got mad at

2607
02:27:25.601 --> 02:27:26.710
my friend Cameron Hanes.

2608
02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:30.040
I posted this video of him shooting a black bear with a bow and arrow.

2609
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:34.150
People like,
that's fucking horrible.
That's disgusting.
They don't even eat those.

2610
02:27:34.151 --> 02:27:36.610
They taste like shit.
There's all these people saying they taste terrible.

2611
02:27:37.090 --> 02:27:41.440
I've had black bear tastes delicious.
It tastes weird.
It definitely is different.

2612
02:27:41.441 --> 02:27:44.680
Like you kind of know you're eating a bear because he's like a bear.

2613
02:27:44.890 --> 02:27:48.820
It's a different taste,
but it's good.
It's like if you ever had elk,
yeah,

2614
02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:51.400
delicious,
but you'll be really fucking good.
No,

2615
02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:54.910
you're eating when you're eating out you're like,
Ooh,
this is different.

2616
02:27:54.911 --> 02:27:56.080
It's kind of crazy.

2617
02:27:56.280 --> 02:28:00.130
It's like that wild pig that didn't taste like anything else right now that just

2618
02:28:00.131 --> 02:28:02.370
tastes,
it tastes like ham.
You've tasted Sigar,

2619
02:28:02.371 --> 02:28:07.080
but word of for core lately stopped doing that.
He,

2620
02:28:07.310 --> 02:28:09.950
he's like Kodiak,
Kodiak.

2621
02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:14.790
It's a dip that's got a bear on the copper

2622
02:28:17.530 --> 02:28:21.420
is a different kind of berries reluctant.
You saw when,

2623
02:28:21.430 --> 02:28:22.550
when I was getting my nose fixed,

2624
02:28:22.551 --> 02:28:26.930
he was like find reluctant bear being a Bareback,
that jogging and shit.

2625
02:28:27.350 --> 02:28:29.690
Oh,
just taking them on the road.
It probably wasn't doing so well.

2626
02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:31.550
It isn't as much money for food,
you know,

2627
02:28:31.551 --> 02:28:32.960
now I can eat whatever the fuck he wants.

2628
02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:35.900
You ever see the pictures of him when he was at in high school?
No.

2629
02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.140
He looks like a male model.
A swear to God.
I swear to God he,

2630
02:28:40.610 --> 02:28:42.860
he sent some picture.
I don't know what it was,
but it was,

2631
02:28:42.890 --> 02:28:47.780
he looked like a male model.
I was like,
he's a funny dude.
He's so fucking funny.

2632
02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:49.700
Finally do it.
I love hanging out with that guy too.

2633
02:28:49.701 --> 02:28:52.850
We just did the comedy Magic Club together a couple of weeks ago.

2634
02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:56.950
Last week or so.
Funny Dude,
man Thomson [inaudible].

2635
02:28:56.990 --> 02:29:00.170
He was the only guy out of all the people that I went on that maxim comedy tour

2636
02:29:00.171 --> 02:29:04.030
with,
um,
that I,
uh,
I really stayed friends with.
Um,

2637
02:29:04.310 --> 02:29:05.780
like out of the guys that opened,

2638
02:29:05.781 --> 02:29:08.630
I'm still friends with Charlie Murphy and half Ron.
But there was like,

2639
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:13.280
we had 22 different openers,
but one of them stood out.
It was the girl.

2640
02:29:13.310 --> 02:29:18.290
Do you remember any of the other ones?
Yeah.
Josh McDermitt.
No,
no,
no,

2641
02:29:18.291 --> 02:29:18.830
no,
no,
no.

2642
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:23.830
Josh McDermitt opened up for us in Phoenix when he did a competition and that

2643
02:29:24.021 --> 02:29:27.800
was a funny story.
It was one of the Joey Diaz missing in action videos.

2644
02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:32.480
Joey Diaz and fucking vanish like a fucking pow and numb and you couldn't get

2645
02:29:32.481 --> 02:29:33.920
any words were fuck he was,

2646
02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:36.740
I started bringing two guys in the road from me for that very reason.

2647
02:29:36.741 --> 02:29:41.000
And that was one of those times where Joey advantaged,
Joey vanished.

2648
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:43.570
And we couldn't get ahold of them.
So who was it was Mcdermott.

2649
02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:48.380
And who else was at Dunkin or Ari?
Ari.
Shit.
It might've been mad at Kirsch.

2650
02:29:48.390 --> 02:29:51.290
It was a long ass time ago.
It might've been.
Who knows who it was,

2651
02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:53.270
but whoever it was,
we had to get someone.

2652
02:29:53.810 --> 02:29:57.090
And we were there the night before because I had to do radio and we've watched

2653
02:29:57.100 --> 02:30:00.920
this local contest and Josh McDermitt went up and he was living in Phoenix at

2654
02:30:00.921 --> 02:30:05.060
the time.
He's fucking hilarious.
And so now he's on the walking dead.
It's crazy.

2655
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:07.150
Oh,
are you shitting me?
He's one of the,

2656
02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:09.290
he's a super smart scientist dude in the walking dead.

2657
02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:11.880
Are you fucking kidding me?
Yeah,
that dude,
he uh,

2658
02:30:11.881 --> 02:30:14.390
he did the podcast before he did the podcast a long time ago.

2659
02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:18.830
Ice House chronical.
Yeah.
What does this dude,
five o four what's that?

2660
02:30:18.860 --> 02:30:23.210
What's episodes?
That's five oh four.
This is five oh six.
Jesus Christ.

2661
02:30:23.330 --> 02:30:24.530
Josh McDermitt is a good dude.

2662
02:30:24.890 --> 02:30:28.040
He got to get them on the podcast posts that show and have him come and talk

2663
02:30:28.041 --> 02:30:31.490
about it.
I've been trying,
he's going to,
as soon as he get,
how many they,
oh yeah,

2664
02:30:31.491 --> 02:30:34.220
they fill in like crazy.
I mean the shows down,

2665
02:30:34.221 --> 02:30:37.700
so that means they're filming the next season.
Fuck.
Doing one of those shows,
man.

2666
02:30:37.730 --> 02:30:42.110
That's the rest of your life.
When you do a show like that,
like those,

2667
02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:46.970
those shows,
they take 16 hours a day to film.
If you hear her,

2668
02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:51.080
that claim,
that's the Jack Daniels Char Slo,
I'm celebrating goes,
yeah,

2669
02:30:51.081 --> 02:30:54.980
you are celebrating,
celebrating,
fine.
I'm an accomplished author.

2670
02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:58.910
I have a pug liver,
your liver and the liver is good.

2671
02:30:58.911 --> 02:31:00.740
It's on the other side of my body.
It hadn't been hurting at all.

2672
02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:05.120
Gimme a Swig of that,
Mr crusher is whiskey or Maine liquor.

2673
02:31:05.210 --> 02:31:09.800
Is that your big go through like a tequila phase or do you go through phases?

2674
02:31:09.801 --> 02:31:12.710
Like I may only do vodka.
Like what happened in the machine back guy by the way?

2675
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:15.620
Well,
it's fucking dead.
That was the biggest fucking mistake of my life.

2676
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:19.980
What happened?
Oh,
it's just a nightmare,
man.
And what'll happen is

2677
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:22.770
<v 3>someone will hear this and I appreciate everyone who helped out thank you every</v>

2678
02:31:22.770 --> 02:31:27.660
month.
I know you all are big fans of Joe's podcast.
Um,
uh,
it just,

2679
02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:29.700
it,
it,
it's a racket.
It's,

2680
02:31:29.730 --> 02:31:33.660
you can understand why it's a family run businesses that you can't get in.

2681
02:31:33.661 --> 02:31:36.480
It's like a country club.
And so it's like,

2682
02:31:36.481 --> 02:31:40.260
and no one wanted to deliver business and it just is really expensive.

2683
02:31:40.261 --> 02:31:44.610
And because puff daddy get in there,
honestly,
you could probably do it.

2684
02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:49.170
You could probably do it,
but yeah,
yeah.
But to be me and do it is impossible.

2685
02:31:49.490 --> 02:31:52.710
Like one of the first people I told you about was really great.

2686
02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:57.770
I was a great fucking investment I thought and what it was his travel size vodka

2687
02:31:57.841 --> 02:32:01.200
pouches.
Remember I told you about that one really easy stamp,

2688
02:32:01.201 --> 02:32:05.160
the face on the cover and you do these travel pouches,
they're great for summer.

2689
02:32:05.160 --> 02:32:08.190
You put them in your drinks and,
and it's really cheap.

2690
02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:10.020
The problem is they were like,
okay,

2691
02:32:10.250 --> 02:32:13.650
well you went $250,000 and your shipping will be ready to be picked up on

2692
02:32:13.651 --> 02:32:16.380
Thursday.
And I was like,
okay,
understand the money.

2693
02:32:16.381 --> 02:32:18.180
But even when my shipment and they're like,

2694
02:32:18.181 --> 02:32:20.670
well you got to pick it up and then you need to store it somewhere and then you

2695
02:32:20.671 --> 02:32:21.900
need to sell it out of somewhere.
I was like,

2696
02:32:22.290 --> 02:32:25.560
I'm starting to fucking do this whole thing.
Yeah.
And so I was like,
okay,

2697
02:32:25.561 --> 02:32:27.350
that's not what I wanted to do.
What did you want to do?

2698
02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:30.890
You want it to put your name on it and they deal with everything and wanted to

2699
02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:34.290
stamp my name on it and help promote it.
Then happened.
You could just,

2700
02:32:34.310 --> 02:32:37.590
you just need to get with a better company.
I can't whine.
Jeremy can do it.

2701
02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:39.070
You can do it.
Why can't it happen?

2702
02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:44.010
I've tried four times and every time it is the exact same thing is that you need

2703
02:32:44.011 --> 02:32:47.170
it like some managerial type people to take care of that shit for you.
I,

2704
02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:49.920
I've tried on your own.
I'm doing it on my own with my,

2705
02:32:49.921 --> 02:32:52.980
with my wife and it's just a fucking nightmare.

2706
02:32:53.070 --> 02:32:56.520
All due respect to you and your wife.
You're not,
you're not in the business.
No.

2707
02:32:56.521 --> 02:32:59.190
I should get someone who knows how to do it.
We did.

2708
02:32:59.250 --> 02:33:00.600
There was a guy that came out in Portland,

2709
02:33:00.601 --> 02:33:02.670
really nice and he came and met with me and he's like,

2710
02:33:02.671 --> 02:33:06.090
I've heard that you want to start a get through Joe's podcast,
let me do this.

2711
02:33:06.120 --> 02:33:09.330
And then we came in.
We had a big fucking tasting.
We selected our brand.

2712
02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:13.260
We liked it.
I got fucking everyone.
I mean,
everyone was in,

2713
02:33:13.261 --> 02:33:15.150
we did a tasting at my house.
Everyone tried it.

2714
02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:19.680
Everyone liked the exact same one.
Okay,
great.
Let's go.
And they're like,
you know,

2715
02:33:20.010 --> 02:33:22.440
quarter million dollars and what are you going to,

2716
02:33:22.470 --> 02:33:25.140
how are you going to distribute the progress?
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

2717
02:33:25.170 --> 02:33:28.410
You had to give him a quarter billion dollars.
Not Him.
He,
he was doing it.

2718
02:33:28.590 --> 02:33:31.560
This guy was really cool.
We should remember his name.
He was really cool.

2719
02:33:31.561 --> 02:33:34.980
He just set me up and he was like,
I don't want,
I don't need a piece of it.

2720
02:33:35.070 --> 02:33:37.860
I want,
I like Joe's podcast.
I like you.

2721
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:40.770
I think this would be a good thing for you.
I'll set you up with the people.

2722
02:33:40.771 --> 02:33:43.740
And as soon as it he did,
he moved out of it.
The people were like,
we want,

2723
02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:46.860
you've got to pay all this fucking money.
I was like,

2724
02:33:46.861 --> 02:33:50.550
I just want you to stamp it on.
Like that's not gonna happen.
So it's like,

2725
02:33:50.551 --> 02:33:54.480
it just is.
So it was a scam.
That's a scam.
It is kind of a scam.
They're there.

2726
02:33:54.570 --> 02:33:56.280
They want you to take all the risks.

2727
02:33:56.310 --> 02:33:57.920
They don't really want to be in business with you.
Right.

2728
02:33:57.930 --> 02:34:01.440
But what they'll do is they'll be your distributor,
they'll make your,

2729
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:04.380
make your notes or your manufacturer manufacturer,

2730
02:34:04.470 --> 02:34:06.600
they'll make your whiskey and then you got to figure out how to get it into

2731
02:34:06.601 --> 02:34:10.020
stores.
Right.
And so it just was like a fucking,
I was like,
I'm done.

2732
02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:13.760
That seems like it's been such a pain in the ass that I,
and I and I,

2733
02:34:13.770 --> 02:34:17.480
you get so excited cause it gets so close and then it just falls apart.

2734
02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:20.060
You're like,
oh fuck it.
Yeah.
There's a kitten deed.

2735
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:23.620
There's a website said actually,
you know,
dudes be like,

2736
02:34:23.621 --> 02:34:28.480
where you can start your own brand of like Fyedka or whiskey and stuff.

2737
02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:31.150
Like there's so much more to this that I'm not even sharing with you.

2738
02:34:31.151 --> 02:34:35.770
Apparently your label needs to be approved by the FDA.
So like,
so you can't,

2739
02:34:35.780 --> 02:34:38.080
it can't be as simple as just being on a website.

2740
02:34:38.290 --> 02:34:41.530
I only say that because we got to the places where it got really difficult.

2741
02:34:41.531 --> 02:34:45.460
And I was just like,
it's not worth our time.
Yeah.
That seems like a drag.

2742
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:47.500
I'm telling you what man,
I'm going to do a fucking,

2743
02:34:47.530 --> 02:34:50.620
after I'm done with this book and I'm,
and I'm going back on the road,

2744
02:34:51.370 --> 02:34:55.900
I'm going bill burst style and I'm scrapping fucking material cause I feel like

2745
02:34:55.901 --> 02:35:00.490
I've,
I feel like I've been treading water artistically and not moving forward.

2746
02:35:00.850 --> 02:35:04.360
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
You don't throw your shit out.

2747
02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:07.480
I they do a special my po,
I haven't done a special so long.

2748
02:35:07.481 --> 02:35:09.910
My problem is I write a lot on stage,

2749
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:13.270
so I always have like 20 minutes and new stuff every night where I'm kind of

2750
02:35:13.271 --> 02:35:17.740
fucking around and figuring things out.
Um,
but like I got,
I got,
I got caught,

2751
02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:20.860
I got caught telling the machine story.
You know that machine story.

2752
02:35:20.861 --> 02:35:22.210
Everyone was different and I get it.

2753
02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:26.410
I totally want them to hear that they paid for the tickets.
Do you?
Right,
right.

2754
02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:27.770
Do you sit down in front of the computer?

2755
02:35:27.771 --> 02:35:29.740
And like I did with the book and with the book,

2756
02:35:29.741 --> 02:35:34.741
I found that my writing got exponentially better and tighter and I was like,

2757
02:35:35.171 --> 02:35:35.911
Holy Shit Man,
I'm,

2758
02:35:35.911 --> 02:35:39.040
I'm dealing with things because I wouldn't got into like the machine's story.

2759
02:35:39.041 --> 02:35:41.200
I told it in the book,
it is to row.

2760
02:35:41.350 --> 02:35:43.720
Like I talk about the dude I remember telling you about this,

2761
02:35:43.721 --> 02:35:45.820
but like I shortened it for stage.

2762
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:48.770
There was another dude with me that whole night.
I really kind of got into the,

2763
02:35:49.090 --> 02:35:53.250
the how they got the money into the country to pay off the mafia.
And I,

2764
02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:56.140
you're like,
God dammit,
why wasn't I talking about this on stage before?

2765
02:35:56.710 --> 02:36:01.710
So writing really does help with that process of writing on stage and it just

2766
02:36:02.381 --> 02:36:06.730
makes it better.
Yeah.
I'm sure writing is everything,
man,

2767
02:36:07.210 --> 02:36:10.300
you know,
planet of the apes.
I got to remember that story.
Um,

2768
02:36:10.390 --> 02:36:12.830
I find that being on the podcast helps me,
uh,

2769
02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:16.060
do like doing my podcast helps me write material just in the,

2770
02:36:16.061 --> 02:36:18.580
in the sense that you come up with a thought and you're like,
oh,

2771
02:36:18.581 --> 02:36:21.320
that's fucking funny.
Do you do this?
Do you like,
this is mine.

2772
02:36:21.460 --> 02:36:23.410
Over the last few months we've had these legal pads.

2773
02:36:23.411 --> 02:36:26.890
I leave around here for the guests from me.
Anytime.
Something that you can't,

2774
02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:30.070
you know,
you got to remember,
you've got to go back to it later.

2775
02:36:30.071 --> 02:36:33.970
I just write shit down on these things.
I just started taping my sets.

2776
02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:35.410
I just started recently.

2777
02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:38.320
I don't like it because if I tape that I don't feel creative.

2778
02:36:38.350 --> 02:36:40.840
I feel like I'm not going to talk.
I feel like I'll work on material.

2779
02:36:41.470 --> 02:36:44.380
I know you say just tape every set and then it becomes normal.

2780
02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:45.850
I know I'm going to,

2781
02:36:45.851 --> 02:36:48.370
the problem is I don't listen to them a lot unless there's something really

2782
02:36:48.371 --> 02:36:50.680
genius happens.
You have it.
Look,

2783
02:36:50.740 --> 02:36:53.590
I have a hundred fucking plus sets on my,

2784
02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:57.190
on my phone at all times at any given time.

2785
02:36:58.510 --> 02:37:01.330
At any given time.
These are all different comedy sets.

2786
02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:03.820
Where do you get your phone out?
Off to the side.

2787
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:07.150
I just put it on a stool as hundreds of sets,
man.

2788
02:37:07.570 --> 02:37:10.310
I think every comic does that nowadays.
It's on your phone.
Yeah,

2789
02:37:10.311 --> 02:37:13.690
I have one or two.
Tell you what,

2790
02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:16.750
when I was young there were two times,
and by the way,

2791
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:19.640
I understand that I'm setting myself up to be slammed on this.

2792
02:37:19.940 --> 02:37:23.030
There are two types of topics.
I can't help it.
I like it.

2793
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:29.990
I fucking,
I have miss hanging out like this.

2794
02:37:33.620 --> 02:37:34.580
There were two types of comics.

2795
02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:38.780
There were the guys that had tape recorders on stage and then there were the

2796
02:37:38.781 --> 02:37:43.430
black comics
and I liked the black comics,

2797
02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:46.700
like Mike Epps,
Mike Apps,
trashy,
Tracy Morgan.

2798
02:37:46.701 --> 02:37:49.580
And I know that me and him ain't never be friends.
My caps,
Tracy Morgan,

2799
02:37:49.581 --> 02:37:51.990
Dave Chappelle,
Tony Woods,
where the guys,

2800
02:37:52.570 --> 02:37:55.920
I never partied with Dave Chappelle by party,
a party with apps and apart.

2801
02:37:55.970 --> 02:37:59.420
It would Tony and,
and,
and I hung out with Chappelle one night like,

2802
02:37:59.421 --> 02:38:00.790
but not nothing big.
Right.

2803
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:03.200
I'd watch him on stage and it was like they were creating in the moment.

2804
02:38:03.201 --> 02:38:05.510
Greer Barnes.
Do you remember Greer balling.
Bruce.
Hilarious.

2805
02:38:05.540 --> 02:38:08.110
I'll fucking monster it.
A lot of road gigs with Greer.

2806
02:38:08.450 --> 02:38:11.150
He is one of the best comics I've ever seen on stage.

2807
02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:13.210
<v 2>It's a funny dude man.
He's always,
always shocked.</v>

2808
02:38:13.211 --> 02:38:16.500
Did that guy didn't become famous.
There's a few of those guys.

2809
02:38:16.890 --> 02:38:19.760
Reggie McFadden is another one I talk about all the time.
Do you remember that?

2810
02:38:19.770 --> 02:38:24.480
Go understand it.
Reggie McFadden when we were living in New York.
Yeah,

2811
02:38:24.481 --> 02:38:27.330
well I was in new Rochelle.
I like 92 or something like that.

2812
02:38:27.331 --> 02:38:32.331
I saw Reggie Mcfadden Eta a black comedy club and all black comedy club in Mount

2813
02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:34.110
Vernon called the champagne comedy club.

2814
02:38:34.410 --> 02:38:37.240
I could never work it cause you had to be squeaky clean.
Yeah,

2815
02:38:37.620 --> 02:38:41.160
like does he do had all these rules?
No,
motherfuckers can't see.

2816
02:38:41.161 --> 02:38:42.490
No motherfucker know motherfucker.

2817
02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:47.820
He don't say the bitch had a big ass said the girl had a wide behind.

2818
02:38:47.821 --> 02:38:52.200
Like he would give you these things,
the way you describe things.
I was like,

2819
02:38:52.201 --> 02:38:55.170
well I'll never work at this place.
But at least I can go with my friend.

2820
02:38:55.170 --> 02:38:58.580
My friend was working there and he was working with Reggie Mcfadden and Reggie,

2821
02:38:58.581 --> 02:39:02.190
just a straw destroyed.
I remember watching him going,
Whoa,

2822
02:39:02.191 --> 02:39:05.550
this kid is talented.
And I remember thinking,
you know,

2823
02:39:05.551 --> 02:39:10.020
I was in my early twenties I Jess,
I was like 23 or 24 or something like that.

2824
02:39:10.021 --> 02:39:11.820
And I was thinking,
man,
this is so cool.

2825
02:39:11.821 --> 02:39:14.910
It's like to be a part of like this scene and you know,

2826
02:39:14.911 --> 02:39:19.110
being around these comedians and they're all going to be shooed someday.
The,

2827
02:39:19.111 --> 02:39:22.980
some of them for whatever,
Tony Woods.
So for some of them I just,
I don't get it.

2828
02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:27.630
How does Tony Woods not gigantic?
I don't know man.
Tony Woods.
It's fucking hot,

2829
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:28.600
Larry.

2830
02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:32.200
<v 3>Oh,
it's coming up.
Tony.
What was came to the DC Improv one night.
I wish.</v>

2831
02:39:32.201 --> 02:39:34.670
Why don't people take these moments and it's only words.

2832
02:39:34.671 --> 02:39:38.980
It comes to DCM problem at night,
sold out.
Beautiful,
beautiful.
And He,

2833
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:43.300
I hear him in the back.
Why don't you tell that Tracy Morgan story?
I said,

2834
02:39:43.660 --> 02:39:46.480
who is that?
And in my head,
I thought it's either one or two people.

2835
02:39:46.481 --> 02:39:49.600
It's either Tony Woods or Tracy Morgan.
Right,
right,
right.
And I said,

2836
02:39:49.601 --> 02:39:54.460
is that Tony?
Yeah,
Bert.
Tell that story.
Tell your story of that night.

2837
02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:57.670
And I went,
all right,
everyone in the guy that was there with me that night,

2838
02:39:57.720 --> 02:40:00.310
Tony Woods,
he's in the room.
I said,
Tony,
why don't you do this?

2839
02:40:00.311 --> 02:40:03.370
Why don't we come up on stage?
You come up,
you tell your side of the story.

2840
02:40:03.371 --> 02:40:05.740
I'll tell him my side of the story and we'll see where the two middles meat.

2841
02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:09.520
He's like,
that's what I want.
So he went up and down it goes up.

2842
02:40:09.521 --> 02:40:13.170
We have two mikes and we told the story and it's amazing to hear his words that

2843
02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:17.250
Oh yeah,
I got all fucking stage.
Fucking I'm,
and I told and I,
cause I,

2844
02:40:17.310 --> 02:40:20.580
cause one of my favorite things is I don't remember,
I don't remember anything.

2845
02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:24.990
But I wanted to know if Tony remembered the end of that night,

2846
02:40:24.991 --> 02:40:29.430
the exact same way I did with that same bill.
Burke.
Quite sure.

2847
02:40:29.490 --> 02:40:33.960
So I said to him,
I said,
uh,
I said,
and he's on the ground.
And Tony,

2848
02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:37.260
I remember Tony said,
all I'm thinking is,
well,
we can do with the dead.

2849
02:40:37.261 --> 02:40:40.860
Tracy Morgan man is going to ruin on Korea.

2850
02:40:40.861 --> 02:40:43.140
Burton and I go,

2851
02:40:43.141 --> 02:40:47.250
and then he stood up and I looked at Tony and he die.
I mean identical.
He goes,

2852
02:40:47.370 --> 02:40:49.230
he snapped a shirt and he looked,
he said,

2853
02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:52.800
now that's how you get out of paying the check and walked away.
And I was like,

2854
02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:53.663
fucking,

2855
02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:56.970
it was like one of those things where you've got proven that you didn't lie.

2856
02:40:57.360 --> 02:40:59.250
And I was like,
I fucking knew it.

2857
02:40:59.550 --> 02:41:02.400
It was like a on Facebook that people that know,
obviously the book's been out,

2858
02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:05.970
the people that were involved in the Russian train story of all heard about it.

2859
02:41:06.210 --> 02:41:09.000
And so they're all replying like,
yeah,
I was there 100% true.
That's fine.

2860
02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:12.330
And even when you hear it,
you're like,
I fucking knew it.
Like,
and you know,

2861
02:41:12.331 --> 02:41:15.870
you're telling the truth,
but it's just as a comic,
like you said,

2862
02:41:16.650 --> 02:41:20.520
your imagination takes over and you try to get the laugh.
And you never know.

2863
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:22.610
Yeah,
it's,
it's,

2864
02:41:22.770 --> 02:41:26.340
it's weird when you go back and you think about those dudes like Reggie
Mcfadden.

2865
02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:30.900
So like regimen fatten.
Uh,
and this story,
it may not be accurate,

2866
02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:32.550
but this is how I remember it.

2867
02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:38.190
Regiment found word I'll do in a very cash showcase and the line is be clean.

2868
02:41:38.310 --> 02:41:39.720
Oh No,
who says that?

2869
02:41:39.750 --> 02:41:43.410
But I think it was Barry son of a bitch and Reggie McFadden goes up on stage and

2870
02:41:43.411 --> 02:41:47.830
his first joke is,
um,
let me tell you why he never supposed to eat strip a pussy.

2871
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:52.830
Like I bet,
look,
I've fucking,
who fucking knows?

2872
02:41:53.250 --> 02:41:57.570
I don't want Reggie Mag upset by remember Hims Kinda clean.
It seemed,
it seemed,

2873
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:59.780
it seemed fucking end.

2874
02:41:59.781 --> 02:42:03.590
He talked about if you're the first person he stripper pussy,
you're not,

2875
02:42:03.630 --> 02:42:05.520
you're not the first person he stripper pussy that night.

2876
02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.310
You're the fifth person and you're gonna get like,
it was a joke.

2877
02:42:08.311 --> 02:42:09.390
But that was the whole fucking premise.

2878
02:42:09.550 --> 02:42:11.310
I remember Barry in the back like ringing us and it's like,

2879
02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:15.960
I thought I said to work clean.
How come he didn't work clean?
Oh yeah,

2880
02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:20.580
we're cleaning is always so stupid.
Greer Barnes a monster.
Do you remember,

2881
02:42:20.910 --> 02:42:21.900
was it Hans,

2882
02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:27.660
do you remember a guy who had a joke about the Jamaican subway shooting?
No.

2883
02:42:27.690 --> 02:42:30.450
Remember the Jamaican guy that went on the long island expressway with the
rifle?

2884
02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:32.950
Yes.
Do you remember?
You don't remember the guy who,
the joke?
No,

2885
02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:36.270
one of the most murderous jokes I've ever seen and I wish I could remember it.

2886
02:42:36.271 --> 02:42:40.220
And then France,
France was his name.
I feel like I was out of New York by,
yeah,

2887
02:42:40.490 --> 02:42:43.470
I think I was already in a la black dude.

2888
02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:46.410
I remember when you first came out to La and you,
and I want to say,

2889
02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:51.030
I want to say I remember it because it was like you're done some article about,

2890
02:42:51.090 --> 02:42:53.610
uh,
about,
uh,

2891
02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:56.160
who was and wasn't funny anymore or something.

2892
02:42:56.161 --> 02:42:59.400
But I remember it was like maybe videotape,
but it was on your lot like,

2893
02:42:59.700 --> 02:43:01.230
and you were standing and you were telling him like,
Oh yeah,

2894
02:43:01.231 --> 02:43:03.780
that guy's not fucking funny.
Oh,
once,
I dunno.

2895
02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:07.500
I'm talking about trying to remember the best I can happen.

2896
02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:09.570
Really?
Yeah.

2897
02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:14.020
There's no way I was doing video saying who's not funny anymore that someone

2898
02:43:14.021 --> 02:43:18.640
used to be funny and isn't
confusing me with somebody else really,

2899
02:43:19.410 --> 02:43:22.780
cause I always thought it was you and I was
the only bed.

2900
02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:26.530
The best part is that I remember the best part was that I remember I guess

2901
02:43:26.531 --> 02:43:29.260
watching it with some people and Bobby Kelly was like,
aw man,

2902
02:43:29.261 --> 02:43:34.140
there goes all my acting gigs.
I looked just like the guy I fucking job Kelly.

2903
02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:37.720
She looked just like me and I can't remember.
I can't remember.
Kelly's my friend.

2904
02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:40.930
Yeah,
I know,
but I know him from a long time ago.
No,
no,
no.
Oh,

2905
02:43:40.931 --> 02:43:43.780
then it may not have been,
you know,
it wasn't me.
It wasn't you then?
No.

2906
02:43:43.781 --> 02:43:46.240
Bobby Kelly and I had sex in the same room together.

2907
02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:51.910
We picked up these two chicks and brought it back [inaudible] two chicks and

2908
02:43:51.911 --> 02:43:54.340
brought him back to his place.
Really?

2909
02:43:55.620 --> 02:43:58.660
I tried to do that with Dane one time.
Didn't Dame wasn't into it.

2910
02:43:59.140 --> 02:44:02.170
Dang got so pissed at me.
He's scared of you.
He was like,
no,
he's pissed.

2911
02:44:02.170 --> 02:44:05.620
He was like,
he's like bigger.
What if the CRO haunts you?
What if you're funnier?

2912
02:44:05.740 --> 02:44:09.220
He goes,
turn it off.
Burden.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
I go,
what?

2913
02:44:09.221 --> 02:44:13.420
And he goes to comedy.
We're done.
It's over.
Let's make this happen.
By the way,

2914
02:44:13.421 --> 02:44:16.090
she probably shouldn't be telling this story.
Probably Shit.
Jesus Christ.

2915
02:44:16.390 --> 02:44:20.140
We didn't fuck anyone.
We didn't fuck anyone.
Don't lie from here on out.

2916
02:44:20.141 --> 02:44:24.520
Just let it go.
Okay.
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you that.
Picked up two girls.

2917
02:44:25.090 --> 02:44:28.560
Don't tell the story.
I'll tell you said,
tell the truth.
No,
no,
no.

2918
02:44:28.570 --> 02:44:31.360
Don't tell him we didn't fuck anybody.
Remember Dane,

2919
02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:35.320
the valuable lesson and that was Dame was like,
uh,
you're not gonna see my car.

2920
02:44:35.350 --> 02:44:38.750
Nope.
He goes,
uh,
he goes,
you got to learn when to turn it off.
I'm leaving.

2921
02:44:39.150 --> 02:44:41.950
He's always have to turn it off because I was being a comic in the bed and like,

2922
02:44:41.951 --> 02:44:46.000
I was trying to joke around and Danes like,
you're cock blocking the moment.

2923
02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:49.420
I trying to be funny.
We're done.
We did the stage show.
It's over,

2924
02:44:51.380 --> 02:44:53.170
mother fucker.
This is going to be the most,

2925
02:44:54.210 --> 02:44:57.900
I'm just burning bridges left and right on this podcast today.
He was like that.

2926
02:44:59.230 --> 02:45:02.230
I would advise not talking anymore.
We didn't have sex with anyone.

2927
02:45:02.231 --> 02:45:05.530
We just hung out with some girls.
Then that's over.
Whatever,
whatever.
Well,

2928
02:45:05.531 --> 02:45:07.560
you know there's some dudes that like they,

2929
02:45:07.570 --> 02:45:10.810
they will feel like you're fucking up their vibe if you're just constantly

2930
02:45:10.811 --> 02:45:14.200
hitting on the Yuk Yuks and they're trying to get some Barry white music plan.

2931
02:45:14.590 --> 02:45:18.160
That's me.
Yeah.
I'm not finding,
fuck yeah,
I'm not,
I'm not,
I can't,

2932
02:45:18.161 --> 02:45:21.640
I can't turn it off ever.
Like when you're having sex.
Yep.

2933
02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:25.360
I'll tickle you when I'm fucking,
if I turn it off,
if I turn it off during sex,

2934
02:45:25.361 --> 02:45:26.194
it looks completely

2935
02:45:28.330 --> 02:45:31.660
don't want all the other images that I have of you in my head.

2936
02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:34.760
They're all jammed together.
Now.
I can't,

2937
02:45:34.770 --> 02:45:37.950
I can't glean girls and they're just shaking their head looking at you like,

2938
02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:42.850
can you just shut it down and just go into sexy mode?

2939
02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:51.350
Oh yeah.
You know,
it's like people either have sexy mode.

2940
02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:57.430
It's like a toggle switch.
She knew when you were either,
hey,

2941
02:45:57.431 --> 02:46:00.220
I didn't work for it.
I'm not proud of it.
It's like something,

2942
02:46:00.221 --> 02:46:01.240
I was just born with

2943
02:46:07.260 --> 02:46:10.070
it or you don't Bro,
I don't have it

2944
02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:12.620
<v 2>and I don't even know why I got it.
I got it.
Go.</v>

2945
02:46:14.900 --> 02:46:17.570
Did you see Bobby Kelly sexy mode when you guys had sex with her

2946
02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:21.760
fucking hammered,
you know,
21 or so.
Do you ever,

2947
02:46:21.810 --> 02:46:25.550
ever let another dude see your sexy mode?
There's no sexy mode,
man.

2948
02:46:25.551 --> 02:46:28.880
We were laughing.
You know,
we,
we took these chicks,
we met them,

2949
02:46:28.881 --> 02:46:31.520
they were really cool.
We had a good time and next thing you know,

2950
02:46:31.521 --> 02:46:35.150
we're back at Bobby's place and I don't even think we thought we were going to

2951
02:46:35.210 --> 02:46:38.930
wind up actually having sex.
But next thing you know,
everyone's naked.
Really?

2952
02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:43.190
Yeah.
Bobby and his girl were over there and he gave me his bed.

2953
02:46:43.191 --> 02:46:46.820
He's fucking cool guy.
And me and this chick,
we're on Bobby's bed.

2954
02:46:47.300 --> 02:46:50.930
Horrible children.
We were were all children.
You know,

2955
02:46:50.931 --> 02:46:52.520
I was probably 24 I think.

2956
02:46:52.521 --> 02:46:57.050
Maybe somewhere around then love Bobby and Bobby was a shit.

2957
02:46:57.080 --> 02:46:59.840
Bobby was probably the same age or somewhere around there.

2958
02:46:59.841 --> 02:47:02.060
I think he's a little younger than me.
Yeah,
he's,
I think he's,

2959
02:47:02.330 --> 02:47:05.180
I want to say he's my age.
How old are you?
41.
Yeah.

2960
02:47:05.181 --> 02:47:07.100
Maybe it didn't make too much sense.

2961
02:47:07.130 --> 02:47:10.970
That doesn't make too much sense cause then he would be some 46,

2962
02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:14.930
he'd be five years.
Actually you'd be 20 at the time before I was 25 or 24.

2963
02:47:14.931 --> 02:47:17.960
He was in 19.
I don't think so.
I don't think he was that young.

2964
02:47:18.350 --> 02:47:21.980
But either way we were working together and it was when he was with a,

2965
02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:26.690
he had a commie team with Dane Cook.
They were Al and among the monkeys.

2966
02:47:26.700 --> 02:47:31.250
Yeah.
And Him and al and Dane and Bobby would do,

2967
02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:35.480
they would do sketches and then they would do like each do like five minutes to

2968
02:47:35.481 --> 02:47:37.910
stand up.
And uh,
then,
uh,

2969
02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:42.590
Dayne would do like the last bit and then I would go on up to those guys and I

2970
02:47:42.591 --> 02:47:45.290
would just do stand up.
Can we did a couple of gigs together like that.

2971
02:47:45.350 --> 02:47:48.470
By the way,
guys,
I'm not talking shit about Bobby.
And Dane,
please don't start.

2972
02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:50.750
If I was a good dude,
he's one of my favorite people.

2973
02:47:50.751 --> 02:47:54.320
I call them when I have drama.
Bad guy either.
He's just struggled.

2974
02:47:54.620 --> 02:47:58.140
Like many Comedians,
you know,
he's made his errors for sure,
but he's,

2975
02:47:58.180 --> 02:48:00.800
he suffered for those errors.
And there's a lot of,
uh,

2976
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:04.010
there's a lot of value to that suffering for comedians.

2977
02:48:04.011 --> 02:48:08.930
Both value to the creative aspect of his suffering.
And you know,
the,

2978
02:48:08.990 --> 02:48:13.430
the originality aspect to the suffering.
When your originality is questioned,

2979
02:48:13.940 --> 02:48:14.360
you know,

2980
02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:18.050
everybody has thought of something that somebody had already thought of.

2981
02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:21.140
It just happens.
You know,
there's a lot of shit that's kind of,

2982
02:48:21.470 --> 02:48:26.090
I want to say obvious,
but it's available if you do the math,

2983
02:48:26.180 --> 02:48:26.601
you know,

2984
02:48:26.601 --> 02:48:31.250
and there's the real problem is when guys find out that they,

2985
02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:34.700
that there's a bit that already exists and they don't drop their own,

2986
02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:37.970
you're too thirsty,
then you're too hungry.
You're too,

2987
02:48:38.140 --> 02:48:41.660
and you're also not confident enough and you're not your own abilities because

2988
02:48:41.661 --> 02:48:43.460
your own abilities you should have,

2989
02:48:43.490 --> 02:48:47.810
you should have enough confidence in the fact that you put in the hours you work

2990
02:48:47.811 --> 02:48:50.480
on your writing,
you work on your craft,
you work on your,
your,

2991
02:48:50.481 --> 02:48:52.670
your idea of being an artist,
a standup comedian,

2992
02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:55.160
and what's the threat to that art?
Well,

2993
02:48:55.161 --> 02:48:58.310
you would say one of the big threats to that art is if you,

2994
02:48:58.490 --> 02:49:03.080
you're not original,
that's a threat.
If you can't be creative,
that's a threat.

2995
02:49:03.230 --> 02:49:06.800
So if something comes along and then threatens that originality,
creativity,

2996
02:49:06.801 --> 02:49:10.590
you shouldn't say,
Hey,
but I'm still getting laughed at that sort of fuck it.

2997
02:49:10.591 --> 02:49:11.520
I'm going to keep going.
No,

2998
02:49:11.521 --> 02:49:16.521
what you should do is abandon that and concentrate solely on creating something

2999
02:49:16.831 --> 02:49:20.280
to fill its place.
Say,
oh,
there's a bit that like,

3000
02:49:20.430 --> 02:49:23.580
here's an example of one where I fucked up on and I don't even know.

3001
02:49:23.581 --> 02:49:28.581
I fucked up until years and years later I did a bit about penguins and it was

3002
02:49:29.821 --> 02:49:33.770
about that at that march of the penguins bit that remember that movie from March

3003
02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:38.280
of the penguins,
Morgan Freeman is hosting it.
And uh,
I did a bit about,

3004
02:49:38.310 --> 02:49:41.490
it's so obvious about,
you know,
penguins are monogamous,

3005
02:49:41.820 --> 02:49:44.340
but it's not that impressive because they look exactly the same.

3006
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:47.640
It's not like one is Rosie O'donnell,
one looks like Jenna Jameson.

3007
02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:50.170
<v 3>No,
it's the fucking penguins.</v>

3008
02:49:50.171 --> 02:49:52.940
So you can pretend you're banging your sister or your mom.

3009
02:49:52.941 --> 02:49:54.270
They all have the same.
Yeah.

3010
02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:55.233
<v 2>And uh,</v>

3011
02:49:55.630 --> 02:50:00.630
Ellen did generous had a bit years before that and I didn't even hear it until I

3012
02:50:00.671 --> 02:50:05.140
was driving in my car and I was listening to a XM satellite radio at the time.

3013
02:50:05.380 --> 02:50:07.800
And they had the comedy hour or whatever it was.
Raw Dog.
Yeah.

3014
02:50:08.110 --> 02:50:11.950
And Ellen Degeneres was talking about penguins looking exactly the same.

3015
02:50:12.490 --> 02:50:15.250
Like why it's not that impressive.
They're monogamous.
They look exactly the same.

3016
02:50:15.370 --> 02:50:19.210
It's so obvious.
It's right there.
But if I had heard her do it,

3017
02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:22.930
I would have never done it.
But I think she got there first.
I think like the,

3018
02:50:22.931 --> 02:50:23.950
the year of her,

3019
02:50:24.220 --> 02:50:28.080
her bit precedes the Year of mine cause I think she didn't have even mentioned

3020
02:50:28.081 --> 02:50:29.170
the march of the penguins.

3021
02:50:29.380 --> 02:50:31.510
I think it was before March of the penguins even came out.

3022
02:50:32.210 --> 02:50:35.380
<v 3>That's one of the,
one of the biggest fears of your young comic is,</v>

3023
02:50:35.500 --> 02:50:38.290
is if you're afraid to listen to people's albums because you're afraid they're

3024
02:50:38.291 --> 02:50:41.560
going to do bits like you.
Yeah.
You need to fucking start writing more.
Well,

3025
02:50:41.561 --> 02:50:44.140
you know,
Jim Norton doesn't listen to other comedians for that very reason.

3026
02:50:44.141 --> 02:50:45.450
He doesn't like going to comedy.
No.

3027
02:50:45.451 --> 02:50:50.180
You gotta you got do and already said this already.
And I did a podcast,
uh,

3028
02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:55.400
this week about my first album ever and Ori was extremely critical of it and

3029
02:50:56.081 --> 02:50:57.820
rightfully so.
That's the reason we did,
are we wrapping up?

3030
02:50:58.090 --> 02:50:59.470
We can close to minutes.
We got five minutes.

3031
02:50:59.500 --> 02:51:01.300
And so Ari was extremely critical of it.

3032
02:51:01.301 --> 02:51:02.770
But I've said that's why I want to do this.

3033
02:51:02.771 --> 02:51:06.610
I want to look at one of me when I was young and fucking really bad and hungry

3034
02:51:06.611 --> 02:51:10.660
and dirty and not clean about what I wanted or my dreams,
my hopes,

3035
02:51:10.870 --> 02:51:12.160
because I don't want people to hear me,

3036
02:51:12.161 --> 02:51:16.300
just me and him just glad hand me on on a fucking,
on a,
on a CD.

3037
02:51:16.900 --> 02:51:19.600
And we did.
And there was a,
that was a lot of my fears of young.
It was just,

3038
02:51:19.690 --> 02:51:22.300
Oh just don't want your feet.
I want to be a headliner.
You've gotta do,

3039
02:51:22.301 --> 02:51:23.920
you've gotta let the base be the pace.

3040
02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:26.810
<v 2>Well you also have to fuck up and learn long.</v>

3041
02:51:26.920 --> 02:51:28.420
<v 3>You have to fuck up and learn.</v>

3042
02:51:28.990 --> 02:51:33.700
I'm taking a big sabbatical after I wrapped this and I'm going to fucking right

3043
02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:36.970
and work and just start hanging out at clubs.

3044
02:51:36.971 --> 02:51:40.180
But you got to watch young comics and find out what they're doing sometimes.

3045
02:51:40.350 --> 02:51:44.240
Cause you got to know where the,
where the fucking,
where the meter is.
Like who,

3046
02:51:44.590 --> 02:51:47.260
if I got to like art who was handling the thing,
if there's crocodile,

3047
02:51:47.320 --> 02:51:50.490
have a hundred bits were a big deal.
Well,
if you weren't in the clubs,

3048
02:51:50.520 --> 02:51:54.070
you didn't realize everyone had a fucking crocodile hunter bits.
Everybody.
Yeah.

3049
02:51:54.071 --> 02:51:58.210
And so I avoided it and I'd fucking have an obsession with lizards cause you

3050
02:51:58.211 --> 02:52:01.480
don't want to be the guy with a crocodile bit hunter bit also,

3051
02:52:01.640 --> 02:52:06.100
<v 2>dude,
I have a lizard skin ramp on my pool cue.
I have cases</v>

3052
02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:07.990
<v 6>that are made out of alligator skin.</v>

3053
02:52:08.210 --> 02:52:13.210
How obsessed with reptiles and the whole thing about this crocodile hunter,

3054
02:52:13.361 --> 02:52:14.680
this guy drove me crazy,

3055
02:52:14.950 --> 02:52:17.740
but I would never talk about him because of the fact there was so many.

3056
02:52:17.741 --> 02:52:20.950
But you would go on stage at the comedy store and if you had a 10 o'clock spot,

3057
02:52:21.460 --> 02:52:23.770
the show starts at eight there might be three guys before you,

3058
02:52:23.771 --> 02:52:25.960
they did a fucking crocodile hunter choke.
I don't want that.

3059
02:52:26.020 --> 02:52:28.900
I don't want to be the guy.
Go,
hey,
did anyone do the thing about blow jobs?

3060
02:52:29.140 --> 02:52:33.250
I have a ton of blow jobs.
Too late,
too late,
too late.

3061
02:52:34.180 --> 02:52:38.150
Here's what I like.
Blow jobs.
That's my Dave.
A towel.

3062
02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:41.950
Love that guy.
Yeah,
there's so many fake David tells out there.

3063
02:52:42.520 --> 02:52:46.930
Put me in that group.
No,
you don't do a David when you're younger,

3064
02:52:46.931 --> 02:52:50.130
you don't know what you're doing on stage and you emulate you don't,

3065
02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:53.290
you ready for what I'm doing?
Okay.
I talked to Fitzsimmons the other day.

3066
02:52:53.291 --> 02:52:55.750
He was on my podcast.
I'll,
I'll probably release it tomorrow.

3067
02:52:56.330 --> 02:52:59.430
Fitzsimmons is going to,
uh,
I'm gonna,

3068
02:52:59.460 --> 02:53:03.670
I'm gonna pay him and he's gonna sit and vet my hour.
Oh,
that's a good move.

3069
02:53:03.730 --> 02:53:08.020
Fitzsimmons is a brutal critic and he's smart as fuck and he's a real good
comic.

3070
02:53:08.250 --> 02:53:11.170
He's like,
he's like,
you know what bird,
I'll tell you what you don't need.

3071
02:53:11.350 --> 02:53:13.240
And I'll tell you what's hacky.
I'll tell you where you should go.

3072
02:53:13.390 --> 02:53:16.090
And then you may not be ready for another hour.
You may need to work.

3073
02:53:16.091 --> 02:53:18.220
But he's like,
you know,
you gotta do this.
You've got to do that.
Well,

3074
02:53:18.240 --> 02:53:19.300
a lot of guys who've done that,

3075
02:53:19.301 --> 02:53:21.610
like Chris rock did that when he created new hours,

3076
02:53:21.611 --> 02:53:24.980
you had nick Depaulo Rich Vos and they would write for him.
Right.
Right.
Idea.

3077
02:53:24.990 --> 02:53:27.850
I don't want Greg to write for me,
I'm very strict about that.

3078
02:53:27.850 --> 02:53:30.430
I write my own material.
I say my own material,
if it comes out of my mouth,

3079
02:53:30.431 --> 02:53:34.130
it's mine forever.
But I would like Greg too.

3080
02:53:34.270 --> 02:53:37.260
I don't mind Greg punching up a joke or helping me with the joke.
Right.
But I,
I,

3081
02:53:37.270 --> 02:53:40.510
but I,
I want him to tell me what is not what I'm better then.

3082
02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:44.740
No one's better to tell anything.
Greg.
Yeah,
he's a fucking,
Greg's one of the,

3083
02:53:45.070 --> 02:53:48.010
one of the fucking guys that,
because I'm a friend with you,

3084
02:53:48.011 --> 02:53:49.750
I've become friends with him.
He's a smart dude.

3085
02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:53.290
And also what I'm grateful for my friendship with you.
Let's wrap this up.

3086
02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:55.060
I'm grateful for my friendship with Youtube.

3087
02:53:55.450 --> 02:53:59.680
This has been a cool family to be involved in and it,
it is a,

3088
02:54:00.130 --> 02:54:01.510
it's one of the things I say,

3089
02:54:01.511 --> 02:54:05.710
I said to Stan hope is one of my favorite things is the fact that I've earned

3090
02:54:05.711 --> 02:54:09.040
the right to call myself a stand up comedian and then have real conversations

3091
02:54:09.041 --> 02:54:11.590
with real people like you guys because it's,

3092
02:54:11.920 --> 02:54:16.900
you can't get this at a country club.
No.
Well,
I think,
you know,
as we,
we,

3093
02:54:16.930 --> 02:54:21.160
Moshe Kasher yesterday we were talking about like all comics are like the only

3094
02:54:21.161 --> 02:54:25.410
people that truly understand comics.
Yeah.
No one's going to get us.
It's just,

3095
02:54:25.411 --> 02:54:29.740
it's so weird to be that kind of a fuck up and outside or that comes up with

3096
02:54:29.741 --> 02:54:31.540
these ideas that other people are just,
I mean,

3097
02:54:31.541 --> 02:54:33.730
some people are going to be funny upon occasion.

3098
02:54:33.731 --> 02:54:36.130
There's going to be a stress build up and someone's going to be the guy that

3099
02:54:36.131 --> 02:54:39.640
busts the bubble and release it and everyone's going to go,
Whoa,
John.
So funny.

3100
02:54:39.730 --> 02:54:43.300
Yeah.
There's a real difference between that and an Ari Shaffir.

3101
02:54:43.330 --> 02:54:45.840
There's a real difference between that and a craftsmen who's out there.

3102
02:54:45.910 --> 02:54:50.100
Joey Diaz or Doug,
Stan Hope,
Stan hope.
I love them.
We own,
you know,

3103
02:54:50.110 --> 02:54:51.880
it's hard for other people to understand each other.

3104
02:54:51.881 --> 02:54:56.290
That's why I've always been so supportive of other comedians and I think it's

3105
02:54:56.291 --> 02:54:59.590
real important.
It was really important to me when I,

3106
02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:02.800
when I first started out to get the green light and the approval from other

3107
02:55:02.810 --> 02:55:04.100
comedians like I've talked about

3108
02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:04.701
<v 2>on the podcast.</v>

3109
02:55:04.701 --> 02:55:07.720
I'm Mark Marin gave me like a little pep talk once when I was an open miker

3110
02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:12.740
changed my world.
Like I was convinced I could do it if this guy,
Mark Mann was a,

3111
02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:16.010
he was a real pro.
He was coming back from the comedy store,

3112
02:55:16.011 --> 02:55:18.710
but he knew that he was,
he used to work at the comedy store in La,

3113
02:55:18.711 --> 02:55:22.070
which was Mecca.
That was like this guy had been to Jerusalem or some shit,

3114
02:55:22.340 --> 02:55:25.460
you know,
I mean,
and when he told me I was good,
I was like,
Holy Shit,
I'm good.

3115
02:55:25.870 --> 02:55:29.790
Oh I'm going to really do this.
Like that,
those little moments for a comic to,

3116
02:55:29.930 --> 02:55:33.890
despite I bombed a fucking thousand times after that.
I mean everybody bombs,

3117
02:55:33.891 --> 02:55:34.740
everybody eats deck.

3118
02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:39.440
But that's also part of trying to find your voice and trying to find your,
your,

3119
02:55:39.441 --> 02:55:44.210
your material and trying to figure out.
It ain't easy.
It ain't easy to do this.

3120
02:55:44.211 --> 02:55:45.220
And we all need each other.

3121
02:55:45.350 --> 02:55:49.130
<v 3>Dude,
look at,
look at my life from when I met you guys.
But like,
I mean,</v>

3122
02:55:49.210 --> 02:55:53.000
like I say this,
I blow smoke up your ass a lot.
I've told me to stop,

3123
02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:57.490
but like Brian's wearing my shirt,
my book's out today and I'm hanging out.

3124
02:55:57.500 --> 02:56:02.320
We're all still friends and,
and I'm telling them machine story on stage,

3125
02:56:02.350 --> 02:56:04.790
I would have never fucking told had I not met you.

3126
02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:08.240
I would have never told him I love you buddy.
But you would have,

3127
02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:11.150
I wouldn't even navigate it out one day you would have got to a point where
like,

3128
02:56:11.151 --> 02:56:15.320
I need some new material.
I was in Russia and then it would just,

3129
02:56:15.630 --> 02:56:18.250
I would just start taking it up.
Look,
we help each other,

3130
02:56:18.330 --> 02:56:23.110
<v 2>man.
But you know,
you are just as important to me as I am to you.</v>

3131
02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:27.330
You know?
And Brian,
you're just as important to me as I am to you.
To all of you,

3132
02:56:27.370 --> 02:56:28.910
Jamie.
I could do with or without you.

3133
02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:34.400
<v 3>Bye.
[inaudible] I don't mean that.</v>

3134
02:56:34.990 --> 02:56:35.791
<v 2>No,
we,
we,</v>

3135
02:56:35.791 --> 02:56:40.450
we all feed off of each other and it's what you make out of these relationships

3136
02:56:40.510 --> 02:56:41.530
that is like,

3137
02:56:41.890 --> 02:56:46.890
that's sort of your responsibility when you're around as many talented people as

3138
02:56:47.381 --> 02:56:48.100
you can.

3139
02:56:48.100 --> 02:56:51.250
If you just sort of lay back and become the guy where everybody goes to the

3140
02:56:51.251 --> 02:56:54.760
fucking,
you know,
Timmy doesn't write new jokes.

3141
02:56:54.761 --> 02:56:57.550
This mother fucker is bombing all the time.
We bring him on the road,

3142
02:56:57.790 --> 02:57:00.010
it has the same jokes he did a year ago and he's eating Dick.

3143
02:57:00.430 --> 02:57:03.790
Then Tim is not doing his part and then Timmy winds up getting cut out of the

3144
02:57:03.791 --> 02:57:08.380
fucking Rose Bush and that's just how it goes.
And it's all for all of us to,

3145
02:57:08.381 --> 02:57:09.610
it's important.
Look,

3146
02:57:09.611 --> 02:57:13.870
I have benefited from being friends with all of the people in this room,

3147
02:57:14.110 --> 02:57:16.690
but I've also benefited from being friends with Dunkin,

3148
02:57:16.691 --> 02:57:18.760
from being inspired by him,

3149
02:57:18.970 --> 02:57:22.910
by being inspired by Joe Arr or your Doug or just,
you know,

3150
02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:25.660
fill the fill in the blank.
Keep going.
Hello.

3151
02:57:26.350 --> 02:57:29.850
Almost got my computer again.
My fucking Italian hand gestures.

3152
02:57:30.730 --> 02:57:34.570
Jesus Christ.
Look at it.
It's trying to find my computer like a fucking,

3153
02:57:34.810 --> 02:57:39.410
like a one of those lampreys in a um,
Shannon Doherty movie.
Yes.

3154
02:57:40.130 --> 02:57:42.370
I watched the attack of the killer lampreys

3155
02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:45.800
<v 3>Shannon Doherty,
she's back.</v>

3156
02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:51.340
I is back on the way here.
I was like,
wait,

3157
02:57:55.130 --> 02:57:58.980
Let's go get weird tone.

This guy's doing this shit in his living room and his underwear.

3166
02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:33.740
They'll take them away from me.
I'm happy doing drugs.

3167
02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:41.330
Sounds like shit.
It actually sounds pretty good to me.
Yeah.

3168

Yeah.

3191
03:00:07.381 --> 03:00:12.150
Thunderpussy,
which is a completely improvisational podcast.
The audience yells,

3192
03:00:12.151 --> 03:00:16.260
had ideas.
He'd go onstage,
