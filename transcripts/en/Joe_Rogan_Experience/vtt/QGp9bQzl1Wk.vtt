1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.460
How are you sir?
I am good.
Thanks for doing this man.

2
00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:04.260
I really appreciate it and I know I thank you for having me.

3
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:07.050
Thank you for thinking of me.
Please.
You are the guy.

4
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:11.190
Whenever anybody asks me who's the best fighter in the world,

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.320
you're the guy.
I appreciate it,
man.

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.490
I think if young guys are coming up and they want to learn how to fight,

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.750
where they take as little damage as possible and inflict as much as possible.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.680
You're my perfect example,
so thank you for being,
you know,
hey,
you know what?

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.190
I'm was doing my best to pay these bills.
I got,
I got bills to pay.
I understood,

10
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:33.090
but it's more than that,
man.
You can't just be paying bills because you,
you,

11
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.890
you don't just do enough work.
You do more like,
well,

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.090
it's pretty obvious when you fight that you are putting in crazy hours because

13
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.170
you keep getting better and better and better.

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.840
I guess it's not as simple as like you just paying the bills.

15
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:49.710
Like you obviously have a pretty deep passion for this.
I mean,

16
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.280
I would honestly say it's credited to a Matt Hume and brack Kurt's in,
uh,

17
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.110
ever since I started training mixed martial arts,
you know,
it,

18
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.790
I didn't jump in mixed martial arts because of the UFC.
I mean,

19
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:03.690
I did see the ultimate fighter and all that stuff,
but I saw it,
the workouts,

20
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:07.830
how in shape they were.
And then when I started fighting,
Matt was like,
okay,

21
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.830
you can do mixed martial arts fight.
So I had my first amateur fight.

22
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.210
The next mountain was like,
good job.
Okay.
Then I'll,
I'll go back to training.

23
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:17.460
And then that was like,
hey,
you can do,
uh,

24
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.370
how do you feel about doing a kickboxing fight?
I was like,
sure,
why not?

25
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.150
Did a kickboxing fight one that he goes,
good job.
Then he's like,
hey,

26
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.970
there's a Jujitsu Jujitsu tournament.
You need to go there and beat everybody.

27
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.920
I would go there,
take first place.
He goes,
good job at back of his mind.

28
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.020
I think he's like,
you know,
make it molding.

29
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:38.460
He's molding me to be very well rounded.
And then one time he's like,
hey,

30
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.860
there's a boxing fight.
You want to take it?
I'm like,
sure,

31
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:44.500
let's take it one that and the so forth.
They,
I did when we tie fight the,

32
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.210
I didn't know Jujitsu tournament,
so I never just did pure it,

33
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.470
mixed martial arts upbringing.

34
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.500
He would make me do different aspects of martial arts,

35
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.450
mixed martial arts to get me ready.

36
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:57.420
So if I got in a fight and I'm fighting a pure boxer,
I can get in there,

37
00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:00.270
but okay,
well I'm fighting a boxer,
so box or I can,
I can,

38
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.380
I can put my head super low and not have to get worried about knees,

39
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.850
knees and stuff.
But,

40
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:09.450
so I've dabbled in every single IQP in every single sport in mixed martial arts.

41
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:12.570
You know,
I never did tae Kwon do as a kid and all that stuff.
As I got older,

42
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:14.520
I did mixed.
Um,
I joined AMC,

43
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.670
he made me do those things and I've done like four or five Jujitsu tournaments,

44
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.450
not g,
just grappling because basically you have naked when you're fighting.

45
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:23.370
So that's where going that way.
Yeah.

46
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:26.250
How many years were you training before you had your first fight?

47
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.910
Amateur kind fight.
Oh Man.
Uh,

48
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.600
I trained maybe six months,
six months,
six months.

49
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.470
And how old were you at the time?
18.
19.

50
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.290
So you've been with him for 10 years.
So yeah,
so I was with,
um,

51
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.040
Matt had a satellite school,
which was a south.

52
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:49.041
So here's Tacoma where I used to live and here's Peolpe and then hears Auburn

53
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.000
and that's where his salary school where I didn't the heroes Renton.
Um,

54
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.730
then you got,
you can't,
for anybody who's listening to this,

55
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.690
he's moving his hands higher and higher.
Sorry,
Washington state.

56
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.110
Yes.
So way up north.
So my,
the AMC,

57
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.850
Matt's location is 45 to an hour away from me where I live now.
Prior to that,

58
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.810
it was like hour and 30 minutes away from me.
So I found his,
um,
satellite gym.

59
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.900
And even before I went to that gym,
I had no idea who Matt Hume was.

60
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.010
Even when I fought for Matt Hume,
he was sitting in a chair like Shao Kahn.

61
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.880
I just watched us fight and then he wouldn't talk to me.
Right.

62
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.500
Who Shall Kahn?
That's the last guy.
Monochrome comment too.
He sits it,

63
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.970
he sits in a chair and he goes finish him.
So,
but that's how it works.

64
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:36.550
You would just hear you say that like everybody would know what you're talking

65
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.680
about.
That's [inaudible] going to have video game hype.

66
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:41.680
So he would just sit there and watch.

67
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.330
He'll just sit there and watch and he won't even talk.

68
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.070
I mean he would talk to me but he will not talk to me.

69
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:49.450
Like it was just different it then eventually once I had the second fight,

70
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.000
the first fight with Ian Mccall,
he goes,
all right,
do me Joyce,

71
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.540
you got to start taking this shit seriously.
I was like,

72
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.800
what do you mean like we're going to USC.
I just fought for world title it,

73
00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:02.440
you know,
it gets Dominick Cruz.
He goes,
dude,
you only treat with me twice a week.

74
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.730
Like Saturdays.
And at that point I was only Saturdays.
Ah,

75
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.530
where's uh,
Wednesdays and Saturdays.
So you only train them in two days a week.

76
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.920
Like you need to take this shit seriously.
When people are professional athletes,

77
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:19.540
they come,
they leave their families and move away and train with the trainer.

78
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.650
And so that's why you saw a huge change on my game from the second year a coffee

79
00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:27.940
cause I started training on these him if I went to go take a shit and that was

80
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:30.760
like,
hey,
hey,
hey,
what color is that a poop.
I need to know.

81
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
He started overseeing everything I did when it was swimming,
conditioning,

82
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.690
everything.
Beginning of my MMA career when I was fighting,
you know,

83
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:41.770
Miguel Torres,
Keith Yamamoto,
Demassio page,
nick piece.

84
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.430
I was doing my own thing,
like doing my condition or my own money.

85
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.430
Tuesday and Thursday,

86
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.300
Friday I was doing my own thing and then Wednesday Matt will come down to down

87
00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:53.470
to south,
beat me up and then Saturday I'll train.

88
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.960
I'll drive up to Kirkland and trim with Tillman and who would spar.

89
00:04:56.961 --> 00:04:59.440
So after that fight,
the first name called coffee,
he was like,

90
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:01.360
you need to take this shit seriously.
And that's when I was like,
all right,

91
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.870
I'll do 100% with you then.
And then this is what you have now.

92
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.580
<v 1>What a lucky break for you to find that guy too,
like as a trainer.
Oh yeah.</v>

93
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.450
I mean he's,
if he's not the best,
there's,

94
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.850
this is a handful of guys like that I consider like the best,
like for Rasa,

95
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:17.680
hobbies in there,
Mattson there,

96
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:22.660
there's a few guys that are just at that upper level where they can coach you in

97
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:25.060
everything,
you know.
And that's um,

98
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.340
it's so fortunate for a young fighter like you to find him at just the beginning

99
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:31.000
stage page.

100
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.660
<v 0>Yeah.
Oh.
And,
and even though he's a,
I think he's 49,</v>

101
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.390
there'll be 50 this year.
Um,

102
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.130
it's always funny cause when we're getting ready for a fight,

103
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:42.520
we're all were in it 100% when we're training world learning and I'm still

104
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:47.230
learning.
And then when not going me for a fight,
you know,
he lets me do my thing,

105
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:49.090
stay in shape,
I do a good job doing that.

106
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:54.091
And then sometimes we'll come back and with spine and he was just in China and

107
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:58.050
he was in Singapore and I'm always like,
okay,
how am I going

108
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.310
<v 2>to get the best of her this time and get the best of him?
And so he's like,</v>

109
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:04.190
all right,
I think my spotter date,
he'll go upstairs,
get his gear on,

110
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.610
and then like my buddy Carol.
So he goes,
Oh dad,
that's when we sparked at night.

111
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.160
And I was like,
I'm not to get them much.
And we're spine.

112
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.650
And I remember we're a spine and he was hitting me and I was hitting him.

113
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.370
And then I remember I did a superman punch and I connect and I was like,
yeah.

114
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.770
And as I connected,
I was like,
boom,
high kick hit me and back to hit.

115
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.080
And I was like,
good fucking for you man.
Good for you.
You still got it,
don't you?

116
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.420
I mean,
it's just,
I mean,

117
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:31.140
he's just an amazing athlete even though he's 49 years old.
Um,

118
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.920
he was a great fighter.
Oh yeah.
He was amazing fighter.
Amazing.

119
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.790
I remember watching him way back in the day when he fought pat military.
Yup.

120
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.180
Yeah,
you broke Pat Miletich just knows which.
And they stopped the fight,

121
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:43.670
which I was like,
I remember even at the time I was like,

122
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:47.130
what the fuck are you going to stop a fight over a broken nose?
Yeah,

123
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.400
that's crazy.
It happens all the time of boxing.

124
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:52.070
It happens all the time in every sport,
but for whatever reason,

125
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:54.710
they just decided to stop.
The fight didn't make any sense.
Yeah.

126
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:56.940
I think it was a good thing he did.
I don't think that the fire was going,

127
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.530
it was going way south for a patent in which it was definitely going south for

128
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:03.620
pad.
Well,
Matt was so well rounded,
you know,

129
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:05.990
he had so many skills and so many different areas.

130
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.490
I remember he competed in that all submission tournament to remember they had

131
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:14.300
that professional all submission thing that they did on paper view once a long

132
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:17.590
time ago.
This is all damn dammit.

133
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.140
I'm trying to remember the night that he met me.
He tore a Kenny Mondays leg.

134
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.240
That was it.
Okay.
Yeah.
I see.
Yeah.
That was it.

135
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.490
Kenny Monday who was an Olympic gold medalist and red point.
Yep.
Yep.
Yeah.

136
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.540
Matt is like one of my all time favorite guys.
As far as like coaches,

137
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.940
like what those,
those are the two guys that I will tell people if they go,

138
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:35.361
hey man,

139
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:39.020
I'm thinking about really taking this serious like moved to Washington state or

140
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:42.450
move to Montreal.
There's your two places.
Yep.
I totally agree with you.
Um,

141
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.040
yeah man.

142
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.790
Anytime you're in Seattle and you were to come out and hang out in and probably

143
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:48.980
even grapple with Matt,
he would love to do it.
I mean,

144
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.340
he's still grapples and he still listen.

145
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:55.160
Amazing that he doesn't have any nagging injuries is not all fucked up.

146
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.031
You know what the,

147
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:59.240
one of the things that Matt tries to push on me is that he is like,

148
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:02.840
I always ask him if there's one thing you could've done different when you were

149
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:06.380
training as professional fighter,
what would it be?
And he said,
train smarter.

150
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.340
Don't beat my body up so bad.
And that's where he tries to implant on me.
But no,

151
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:11.990
no,
act a nagging injuries.
You know,

152
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.040
every once a while he'll pull something and he and he will take the time to

153
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:18.230
harass,
but when I'm get rid of her fight,
he goes,
I'm not going to jump in today.

154
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.500
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna get this rested.
I'm going to watch coach you.

155
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.890
And then once it's rested I'm going to jump in.
I'm like,
okay,
sounds good.

156
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:27.550
Just make sure you jump in here because I need you.
Yeah,

157
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:31.820
it's so smart to do that.
And so few guys do.
Everybody wants to be a tough guy.

158
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:36.770
Everybody wants to like rough it out and I'm above that.
So smart to do.

159
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:40.770
It's so smart to just let,
let the engine here,
let the machine,
he'll,

160
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.060
there's so many guys that think you have to be a hard ass.

161
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.480
You have to wrap up your arm like a mummy and get in there.
I mean,

162
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:49.970
you could always do something,
you know,
you could always,
like,

163
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:51.170
I know a lot of guys who have,

164
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:54.590
they've torn muscles so they do all the workouts in the pool or something along

165
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:55.650
those lines.
Well,

166
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.980
half fail dos Anjos before he beat Anthony Pettis for the title,

167
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:01.200
he had an MCL tear,
he couldn't do anything.

168
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.230
So all he did was sprints on the Airdyne.
Yeah.

169
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.690
I mean he was just doing an hour long sprints,
you know,

170
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:10.860
like just like interval sprints on the Airdyne and that's all he did for like

171
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:12.470
the last couple of weeks of his camp.
Yeah.

172
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.710
Well it's unfortunate because this is how us fighters make our money.
Um,

173
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:19.350
I remember when I asked him to fight John Dodson for the second time,

174
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:24.090
I tore something in my,
uh,
Cav.
And Matt's like,
you know,

175
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.370
I told him,
I said,
dude,
my calf,
my calf hurts.
And he's like,
all right,
lay down.

176
00:09:27.371 --> 00:09:31.110
And he and me see what's going on and it's a pop piteous I think it was.

177
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.310
And he goes,
yeah,
you pretty much tore it,
so we need to get that here.

178
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:37.630
And I was like,
well,
Matt,
what the fuck?
I was like,
what do you want me to do you,

179
00:09:37.631 --> 00:09:40.850
you,
you know,
we ran,
you know,
15 miles this week.

180
00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:45.270
And we also did sparring pads,
all,
all the,
you know,

181
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.800
the,
the worker was a very heavy,
and you're hanging on my neck and you know,

182
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.850
you're not 125 pounds or 175 pounds.
So I mean,

183
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.080
I'm doing my job and,
and push my body and I'm sorry that it's broken.
He goes,

184
00:09:58.081 --> 00:09:59.700
I know we just need to get to heal before the fight.

185
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:03.030
And so we spent most of our cardio workouts in the pool just doing the long

186
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:04.560
sprints.
And you know,

187
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:07.950
unfortunately it's injuries are part of this sport and we never want to pull out

188
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:11.430
from a fight,
but it's,
it happens to everybody.
Yeah,
it does happen.

189
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:15.300
And it's kind of crazy if you look at the UFC schedule,
I think out of,

190
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.800
they said that a 40 title fights that they had settled,
40 main events,

191
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.580
35 of them or 34 of them pulled out.
So I'm crazy like that.
Yeah,

192
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.140
you're right.
The majority,
the majority change,

193
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.950
which is insane that you want the smaller percentage to be down.
Well,

194
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.300
it's different than any other sport because like boxing,

195
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:36.390
it's very rare that a fighter or pulls out of a fight,

196
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:39.120
like even Manny Pacquiao had a torn shoulder.

197
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.350
He tore his labor and still wound up fighting Floyd Mayweather for the title,

198
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.970
you know,
and we could visit also,

199
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:48.630
he's got $100 million on the line or something insane like that.

200
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:50.920
I would if I had a torn ACL and everything,
Blah.

201
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.570
How'd you Mcdonald's is I'm wanting to get this paper.
Yeah,

202
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.490
because you never know when those paychecks are coming.

203
00:10:56.491 --> 00:11:00.420
Like that's a crazy paycheck once in a lifetime,
you know.

204
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.360
But so many people got mad at him after that fight when they found out that he

205
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:06.630
was injured.
True.
But at same time,
like you said,
once in a lifetime,

206
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.110
when's the next time they going to fight Floyd Mayweather.
Yeah,
right.

207
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.250
If you're so lucky to get in there,
I mean,
he is the ultimate payday.

208
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.110
I find him a box and I'm like,
dude,
I don't care what happens.
I was like,

209
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.700
I'll be taken care of.
I'm like,
we're done.
I was like,
baby,
I was like,
baby,

210
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.020
break out the red panties.
That's kind of a,

211
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.360
you know Conor McGregor?
What a hilarious motherfucker.
That guy is.

212
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.500
Jesus Christ.

213
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.800
When you see a guy like that that's getting so much attention talking shit,

214
00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:38.970
does it make you want to start talking shit?
No Man,
it's uh,
you know,

215
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:41.970
that's his gig.
You know,
that's his gig.
He,
he's doing a good job at it.

216
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:45.300
He's opening doors.
He's the best at it.
Yeah.
He's the best at best town.

217
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:49.020
I've never seen anybody that talks as much shit as he does,

218
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:52.020
but in his way with his Irish accent and it's all like,

219
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.990
it's all a part of the show,
you

220
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.470
<v 1>know?
Yep.</v>

221
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.080
<v 0>I agree.
Not,
I love it.
I,
I,</v>

222
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.150
I'm in the first time seeing her and fighting and I was watching and I was like,

223
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:03.110
okay,
he understands distance,
he understands,
he understands fighting.

224
00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.380
And then as I saw him fight,
you know,
a little better competition.
But you know,

225
00:12:06.381 --> 00:12:11.180
Diego Brandao dust employee and I saw how he crossed this dance and now he,

226
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.260
he could take a shot.
And I'm like,
okay,
all right,
let's,

227
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.410
let's see now the huge test.
You know,
I'm going to do see one of your faces like,

228
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.350
yeah,
uh,

229
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.050
<v 1>Aldo fight.
They're going to be Wu.</v>

230
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:24.820
Who knows what the fuck's going to happen in that fight.

231
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.180
That's what I like about it.
What I love about that fight where people go,

232
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:31.840
who's gonna win?
Who's going to win it?
I don't fucking know.
I don't fucking know.

233
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:34.450
I got no idea.
That's a,
I have no idea.

234
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:38.230
Fight cause anything can happen and God damn Connor takes a good shot.

235
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.550
Yeah he can take stress cause Mendez cannot,

236
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.340
he can bang and he connected a bunch of times and Connor just didn't seem phase

237
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:48.600
at all.
Yup.
I'm very impressed with that.
He's got a big ass head too.

238
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.020
And then when him and Aldo,
this truck come from a dude with a big asset as well.

239
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.860
But when him and Aldo are face to face and he's looking down on all though my

240
00:12:56.861 --> 00:13:01.060
choose Christ Lewis posted at the beard makes it look even bigger like yours.

241
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.200
Yeah.
It doesn't quite have a as majestic a beard is yours.
I appreciate it.

242
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.450
I appreciate quiet.
Thank you.
Not quite as majestic,

243
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.770
but like looking at the two of them together,

244
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.670
you realize how much bigger Connor is.
Yeah,
absolutely.

245
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.840
What do you think about the weight cut issue now because of the Ivy band for

246
00:13:16.841 --> 00:13:19.060
people listening to this don't know what we're talking about.

247
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.750
You used to be able to make weight and then after you made weight you could

248
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:27.610
rehydrate with Ivs intravenously.
They banned that because fighters,

249
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.890
apparently people in uh,

250
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.310
other sports have used Ivs to mask performance enhancing drugs,

251
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.770
so they banned Ivs.

252
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.390
A lot of people think it's dangerous because they think it's the most efficient

253
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:40.240
way to rehydrate.
And if you're going to have weight weigh ins,

254
00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:43.690
and especially if you're gonna have a big disparity of weight classes,

255
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:44.920
like you're in a weight class,

256
00:13:44.921 --> 00:13:48.880
like one 25 where there's a 10 pound jump between one 25,
one 35.
Yup.

257
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:49.750
But a lot of them,

258
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.780
like 85 to two oh five s 20 pounds or two oh five to two 65 is crazy.

259
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.550
Yup.
60 pounds.
It's a giant difference.

260
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:05.070
<v 0>You know,
I'm an ally,
I'm all for it.
Um,
I've never had the ivy,</v>

261
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.010
not once in my hotel career and there's been times I had to cut eight and a half

262
00:14:08.011 --> 00:14:10.590
pounds the day of Wayne's,
uh,

263
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.360
I think it's going to help people fight more at their natural weight classes.
Um,

264
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.020
you know,
I honestly think I'm probably one of the smallest guys in the flyweight

265
00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:21.920
division.
You know,
this morning,
I don't know when I woke up,

266
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.140
I know yesterday I woke up at one 41.5 and a half beer,

267
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.950
good food the night before.
So I'm a small guy.
Um,

268
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.360
so when I cut to one 25,
it,
I mean it's a hard cut.
I'm,
I'm,
you know,

269
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.570
cutting 15 pounds.
Um,
but IB hydro very well.

270
00:14:36.571 --> 00:14:40.560
I never get tired when I fight because I make sure I do my,
my homework.

271
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.640
I'm going to how to diet.
Right.

272
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.400
And they make sure I get enough water in me so I can have the water to cut out

273
00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:49.130
of my system.
Um,
but for guys who,
you know,
I know John Dotson,
I've heard he's,

274
00:14:49.131 --> 00:14:51.780
he gets his like one 57,
one six.
I'd seen a really,

275
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.780
that's why I've heard on the street,
I know Joseph,

276
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:56.480
he used to get big between his fights by hurt.
He's kind of,
you know,

277
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:57.171
last time I talked to him,

278
00:14:57.171 --> 00:14:59.810
he's kind of stay a little bit lower because in reality it's like what's the

279
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:03.350
point of getting big and put muscle on eventually you're going to have to cut it

280
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:04.370
off anyways.
I mean,

281
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.290
the first thing that goes when you're losing weight is typically muscle.

282
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.830
Then there's that and then so forth.
So for me,

283
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.740
I'm all for it at the unit starts seeing a lot of guys,
I can't eyebrow,

284
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:15.980
he's going to fight at one 45 now.
Who knows?
Conor McGregor,

285
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:20.120
he has a huge cut to one 45.
He's in posse fight at one 55.

286
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:22.370
So I think it's good.
I mean obviously I think,

287
00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:26.690
I know a lot of guys love the way you can ivy,
but now they're like,

288
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:29.090
I think the biggest thing is they're like,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.

289
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.060
We used to be able to do this for 20 years plus and now you're just gonna come

290
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:34.340
here and say we can't do it.
What?
I thought this was America.

291
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.300
So I think that's where people are getting their,
um,
their panties in a bunch.

292
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.160
<v 1>Well,</v>

293
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.160
the way the solution to that would be only have ivs that were supervised by

294
00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:47.590
doctors,
or here's a better solution.

295
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.580
Give someone a blood test at the weigh ins.
Like,
right.

296
00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:55.090
Just you don't need a lot of blood prick.
Prick them,
get a little bit of blood,

297
00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:00.160
then let them Iv and then,
you know,
test the blood.
So then,
you know,

298
00:16:00.161 --> 00:16:01.000
if they're doing anything,

299
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.910
it's real simple and then test them after the fight and you're covered.
Yeah.

300
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:04.750
And I think,
yeah,

301
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.510
<v 0>I think they're trying to do my personal pain.</v>

302
00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.260
I remember when we're doing the eye,

303
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.600
the you Usada meeting and uh,

304
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.710
it cracked me up because he was like,
well that's not totally of story.

305
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.660
But he said that one fighter came in,
did it give a name,
came in,

306
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:28.380
did his test before the fight?
No,
before we and tested.
Um,

307
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.770
that test came back clean.

308
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.040
But then after the fight they did the APP that the post bite,

309
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.300
they're like k there's something.
Um,
no.
So he came in weighing in,

310
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.800
they tested him before he weighed in and then after wanes they tested him again.

311
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.220
Then after the winds,
after the fight,
they tested them and they were like,
okay,

312
00:16:45.221 --> 00:16:47.980
Whoa,
something's wrong here.
Cause he'd be hydrated.

313
00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:50.590
And he was hiding something when he,
when he,
when he rehydrate it.

314
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.140
And then the Usada Guy,
um,
I forget his name,
he's like the head guy,
bald guy.

315
00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:56.080
And for the team.
Jeff numbers.

316
00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:59.140
Can you Jeff Bluesky he was saying this guy was hiding something.

317
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.280
We didn't further depth and he was heading,
he was masking drugs with the ivy.

318
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.830
And so I think we've already had that happen in our sport and that,

319
00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:09.210
and that guy got caught.
Oh the fuck is that?
I don't know.
I don't even know who,

320
00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:10.270
he didn't give a name.

321
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.060
<v 1>Really?
Yup.
Well how was that possible?
You're like the author.</v>

322
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.450
I thought all that stuff is public.

323
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:19.510
<v 0>No,
no,
no,
no.
He didn't go public because the person,
that person got caught,</v>

324
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.750
but he didn't give the name of the story of who the person was,

325
00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:27.220
who he t did they tested.
So he wouldn't say who got caught.
So let's say

326
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:29.970
<v 1>sang how someone got caught and the person who got caught,</v>

327
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.370
we know that they got caught.
So it was public that are,

328
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.730
<v 0>yes,
but we didn't know the whole story.
Just stick in and he was like,</v>

329
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:41.860
he was like,
this was recent.
So who was it happened?
Um,
just recently.
So,

330
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.110
<v 1>Huh?
Who the hell could that have been?
Who's been popped recently?</v>

331
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.680
Let's speculate.
Yeah.
Rumor mill,

332
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.200
<v 2>rumor mill,
while there's been a few guys,</v>

333
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.790
well obviously this is a sport that in the beginning you could do where the fuck

334
00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:59.910
you want and a lot of people did whatever the fuck they wanted.

335
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.430
And then I remember like,
I know a lot of people were like,
I'm a,

336
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:05.400
you're a big fan of like,
dude,
hey Joe means you're going to fight you.

337
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:07.710
You want to,
you want to juice.
How'd you is to you if you're on a,

338
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.900
we're on the same plane.
Um,
and I think I back in the day the,

339
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.990
the culture of it was okay with that because I'm,
don't get me wrong,

340
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.850
I'm pretty sure when God made us,
he goes,

341
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.560
I'm going to build you to build a fight.
You're out the year,
year after year,

342
00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.510
take all this damage to the head.
And someone was like,

343
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.020
what's the best way to take a shot?
A punch?
I was like,
there isn't my friend.

344
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:32.610
Your body's not designed to get beat up on.
It's not at all.
And so,
but with,

345
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.990
you know,
the TRT or testosterone or HGH,
all that stuff,

346
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.770
it helps the recovery of it so you can have a long career.

347
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.460
It doesn't just seem to help.
It seems to help your ability to take punishment.

348
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.350
Oh,
absolutely.
That's what's crazy.

349
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:49.530
It's like a lot of these guys that are juiced up,
they can take a better shot.

350
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.990
I tell you what,
whenever Alibaba routine off my phone,

351
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:56.160
I'm on my own following and goes,
dude,
after I got done the fight,
he goes,

352
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.860
I came home and he saw my knees,
my knees were just blown up.

353
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:03.730
You get the fuck out of that dude.
And he hung in there,
man.
He did.
And,

354
00:19:03.731 --> 00:19:06.390
and uh,
my father in and he goes,

355
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.030
I guarantee you he's going to pop for something.

356
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.080
No Man can take a beating like that and be able to walk away like that,

357
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:17.220
I promise you.
Sure.
Another fight after the fight by playing video games,

358
00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:20.310
somebody calls me,
do you hear what happened?
I was like,
no,
no.
What's,
what's up?

359
00:19:20.311 --> 00:19:25.110
And he goes,
he popped,
he popped her a EPO PPO and I was like,
ah,

360
00:19:25.111 --> 00:19:28.620
Shit,
Huh.
No worries.
And that was,
that was floored.
He goes,
no wonder,

361
00:19:28.621 --> 00:19:30.420
cause when we studied tape on him,
that was like,

362
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.880
he's going to get tired and you're gonna be able to finish him.

363
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.820
He's still got tired.
He still got tired,
but she's incredible.
Yeah.

364
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.860
And then Matt was like,
you're gonna be able to finish them.

365
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:41.010
And then when we didn't finish him and that one was like,
that's the reason why,

366
00:19:41.011 --> 00:19:44.470
because he never got tired and,
but he never,
just hard as he should have that.

367
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.430
He's a guy that he's got a,
there's a,

368
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:50.250
there's a style of fighting where it's Kinda like you're pushing,

369
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.460
you're going all in.
Yeah.
You know,
and that's what he does with all his punches.

370
00:19:53.461 --> 00:19:56.580
He's pushing all his chips and he's throwing a hundred percent effort into all

371
00:19:56.581 --> 00:19:58.500
of his punches.
He grips donuts,

372
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.300
winds up with his punches and it's got good power.
But that style,

373
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:06.450
you just can't fight like that for five rounds.
You just can't do it.

374
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.280
And it's really not a smart style.
Anyway,

375
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:12.630
because those punches come slower and there's a few guys that still fight like

376
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:16.080
that even though that's one of the worst ways to do it.

377
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.400
There's a lot of guys should like that,

378
00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:20.910
but it you can get away with it as you blow the guy out in the first round.

379
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:25.140
Exactly.
In another side of that double edged sword is that it's very exciting.

380
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.430
People,
like people were like,
oh well hey,
look at it.
Look at Ronda Rousey.
Yeah.

381
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.470
Is Perfect example.
Like Rhonda Rousey after the first run.

382
00:20:32.471 --> 00:20:35.520
But there's obviously there were stylistic issues and there was obviously

383
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:40.521
technical issues where she wasn't as good as we thought she was standing up.

384
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:45.030
You know when you see or here fight someone like batch hair,
she looked good,

385
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.100
but then you see her fight a skilled striker like Holly and some

386
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.450
<v 0>issues got exposed,
some technical issues,
but she fucking sprinted.</v>

387
00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.710
Like she came out the opening round and sprinted and by the end of the first

388
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:59.560
round she may hit a bunch,
she and she was exhausted.

389
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.860
She was exhausted and it was because she went all in.
She went all in.

390
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.130
And you think of it.
That's how she's been so successful.

391
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.880
Tell me the biggest thing you could do.

392
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.500
Nobody trained in the gym like k round one fight,
no fights like that.

393
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:16.210
So when you do that to upon it that that breaks them down,
it,
it freaks him out.

394
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.040
I would,
you know,

395
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.320
give praises to Greg Jackson and a journal Mickeljohn those guys over there on,

396
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.260
uh,
Albuquerque frickin Holly home ready for that because my mind would go into a

397
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:29.440
fight.
I was like,
if I was highly home,
I'll take a second.
Relax.

398
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.260
See what Ron is bringing,
you know,
use my jab,

399
00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:34.480
used my high kick you might spend in kicks just to,

400
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.750
just to get run off her game because one,
it likes to collapse.

401
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.470
She likes this collision.
Like you said,
when she fight basket hair.
Yeah.

402
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:45.940
She won that exchange to,
uh,
best crab when her wins an octagon.

403
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.560
If you look at the people,
she spot there combine record.
I did well,
my fans,
my,

404
00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:54.940
my mighty squad,
they did the mighty squad.
They might've squad my mighty squad.

405
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:57.020
They did that.
They brought me the numbers and they're like,
dude,
her,

406
00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:00.760
her goodbye and record of her opponents.
And USC was one and nine.

407
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.890
So you know,
that's the lane.
It's amazing.
So when you look at like,
you know,

408
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.940
obviously the promotion has to do their thing to sell next big fight.

409
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.180
But as me as an athlete,
I'm like,
so best care versus Ronda Rousey,

410
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.060
you wonder about how this is going to go run a Ross,

411
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:18.420
he's going to knock her out because yes,
Bachelors,
uh,

412
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.590
undefeated and I didn't know,
but who the fuck is she fought?

413
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.410
Like you have to look at,
you know who that person is spot.

414
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:25.880
So when I look at a person like [inaudible],

415
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.480
I always give him a high praises because the man's fight,
Dominic Cruz,

416
00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:31.410
he's only two losses between me.
Dominick Cruz,
John Dodson,
he,

417
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.550
he hasn't lost seven one 35 and he's only lost to one 25 is,
is to me.
So his,

418
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.570
his skill set is high up there too,
where,
you know,
a cat Zingano.

419
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.020
I thought she had the best chance,
chance to beat.
So I agree.
Uh,

420
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.640
run a Rossy but I spent time with her in the back when we get ready to fight UFC

421
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:51.190
one,
seven,
eight.
And she was so emotional.
I was like,

422
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:56.640
I was sitting back there just eat a banana.
And she was like not doing her thing.

423
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.300
I'm like,
it's just a fucking fight.
Don't worry about it.
Fuck yeah.
I was like,

424
00:23:01.301 --> 00:23:05.200
she's going to high.
She goes,
I don't need to hear that right now.
And I was like,

425
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.350
Hey,
she goes out there and she's so emotional.
I'm like,

426
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.950
that's going to be hurt her back on.
And I told you about,

427
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.380
said when she bites Rhonda,
she can't get emotional and then will she do,

428
00:23:14.381 --> 00:23:17.310
she goes out and throws a flying knee,
gets caught up on embark.

429
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.260
She went out there and like,
I'm in a fight,
take my time when my jab,

430
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.940
I got 25 minutes.
Why?
Why don't I need to rush?
Why during the rush,
if,

431
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.870
if there was like,
okay,
this is a time that you have five minutes,
let's,

432
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.250
who's going to win?
I'm a go all fucking in.
I'm gonna blow my wad.
Right.

433
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.150
But when you have 25 minutes,
I'm going to take my time and enjoy it.
Well,

434
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:38.140
I think the overwhelming moment of being there,
fighting for the title,

435
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:43.141
fighting Ronda or popularity or near the stop fight was probably the one that's

436
00:23:43.471 --> 00:23:46.010
set Rhonda over the top and then batch call.
Hey,

437
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.330
<v 1>I just shot her into the stratosphere because it was in Brazil.
Yup.</v>

438
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.680
I'll tell you,
man,
that was a surreal moment.

439
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.310
It was surreal being there in Brazil because every time I've been to Brazil

440
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:59.560
before,
they never cheer for Americans.
Yeah.
I mean they cheer will,

441
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.670
you know when you're over,
you give props to Brazil,

442
00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:04.610
but when you get your on the way in scale and you're fighting a Brazilian,

443
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:09.110
they're very proud.
Yeah.
And they were fucking Sheeran,
Rhonda and Boone.
PETCO.

444
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.040
Hey,
I know sites.
We would this only,
you bet it was crazy.

445
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:17.720
She's up there with the flag.
Brazil.
Brazil.
No,
no,

446
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:22.490
Rhonda.
You know,
it was,
it was crazy,
man.
It was.

447
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:26.610
It was,
and when she won it was just,
it was bizarre.
It was a bizarre moment.

448
00:24:26.611 --> 00:24:29.000
It was watch our strat around the octagon.
Like,

449
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:32.170
she was like taking it all in and walking around like some fucking gladiator

450
00:24:32.171 --> 00:24:36.830
shit.
I was like,
so Russell Crowe,
Shit.
I was like,
wow,
this is crazy.

451
00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.980
But for her,
what a trip it must be to go from that,

452
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.160
which is just like the most epic victory in Brazil in the home country.

453
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.360
Million pay per view buys.

454
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.220
She's a superstar in every talk show and everybody wants to talk to her to head

455
00:24:52.221 --> 00:24:55.410
kicked to beaten down and then head kicked.

456
00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.790
<v 0>Yeah.
Uh,
I think crazy.
Well watching that fight and how hot,
you know,</v>

457
00:24:59.791 --> 00:25:03.180
Matt always talks about pushing your Punnett to the distance we need to land.

458
00:25:03.181 --> 00:25:05.730
It came so once Holly,
I mean the,

459
00:25:05.731 --> 00:25:09.540
when Holly had her down once before and then she got up and how they kind of let

460
00:25:09.541 --> 00:25:10.260
her go.

461
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.230
And then the second time when she pushed her but into the high kick and I was

462
00:25:13.231 --> 00:25:16.950
like,
I mean I've always,
I didn't know too much about Holly Holm.
Then once,

463
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.390
you know,
the fight was getting built up and I was,
well,

464
00:25:18.391 --> 00:25:21.720
can we do a little more research,
highly home.
And then I saw how she was strong.

465
00:25:21.721 --> 00:25:26.250
She was an athletic,
um,
and,
you know,
she's always high kicks.

466
00:25:26.251 --> 00:25:30.180
Very good.
And then when she land on there and I was like,
this bitch is bad.

467
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.220
And so I,

468
00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.400
I just felt that Ronda Rousey ran into somebody who's just as athletic or more

469
00:25:35.401 --> 00:25:37.860
athletic than she is,
who doesn't,
who doesn't?

470
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:41.760
I'm not saying Ronda Rousey blows up between her,
her fight camp,
but I would say,

471
00:25:41.761 --> 00:25:44.340
you know,
if he went to a holiday home right now,
she would probably,
you know,

472
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:49.380
still have abs.
You know,
she's fit.
Yeah.
Um,
and who,
who's a great striker?
I mean,

473
00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:52.770
that's,
that's her domain.
I mean,
she's a world champion in boxing.
Um,

474
00:25:52.771 --> 00:25:56.250
I heard she's had a kickboxing background before too,
and that's one thing I say.

475
00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.240
I was talking to you Shaw about Rhonda Ross.
I'm like,
dammit.
I was like,
oh,
run.

476
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.410
Rashy her fabrics so good.

477
00:26:01.411 --> 00:26:05.600
But I just wanna see where fucking kick pad work it is.
Uh,

478
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.110
like her hands were really fast.

479
00:26:07.111 --> 00:26:10.190
Her hands are fast and what needs the body we're good but never kicks.
No,

480
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.840
never kicks.
I'm like,
I need to need to see your ticket.
You was like,
Bro,

481
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.220
she don't need it kicked dog shit.
She don't eat her.
I was like TD,

482
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.410
it'll shock me here.
Meet him,
talk on on on a daily,
not daily basis,

483
00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:21.990
but we should work together to kick.
Yeah,
he was shooting.

484
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.510
Everybody needs to kill.
Absolutely not.
I was like,
I just need to see her cake.

485
00:26:24.511 --> 00:26:29.160
I was like,
you know,
if she had a good Jab Jab in Sinai to to disrupt,
um,

486
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.700
Holly Holm is a base to change the distance,
you know,

487
00:26:32.701 --> 00:26:36.930
cause the only way Rhonda Rousey can hit you is from punches.
My,

488
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.370
my legs are longer than my feet,

489
00:26:38.371 --> 00:26:43.371
so I can use my kicks to change the distance to disguise my distance to Holly

490
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.190
<v 2>home.
But she doesn't have in her rubbing tour.
I don't know how.
I don't know if,</v>

491
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.810
uh,
Edmond is versatile and kicks or the clinch game cause he's time.

492
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:54.270
Rhonda clinches it's always,
I'm looking to throw you,

493
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:58.750
I'm not looking to clinch moo tie.
Throw elbows.
Oh shoot down for Aa takedown.
Oh,

494
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.460
take you,
switch your single lay,
drag you up on one foot,
go to left hook.

495
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.160
She's not in versus telling now.
So that's when people are like,
man,

496
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:09.210
she's the best robot in the fandom world.
I'm like,
I haven't seen her kick.

497
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:10.770
I haven't me do a double leg take down.

498
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:15.030
I haven't seen him dropped her back and do a heel.
I can't,
I can't buy into that.

499
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:16.860
I mean she's amazing,
amazing athlete.

500
00:27:16.861 --> 00:27:20.130
What she's done with the skill set she's been given.
Absolutely amazing.

501
00:27:20.131 --> 00:27:23.100
I mean she's blown up.
I mean our numbers are way better than the mind.

502
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.960
So what the fuck am I understanding?
Well,

503
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:29.730
her athleticism is unquestionable her will or drive her championship part.

504
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:30.650
All those are unquestionable.

505
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.840
But I think women's MMA is sort of at a level where men's MMA was in like the

506
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:40.860
late nineties like maybe the early two thousands you know,
so like the,

507
00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:43.230
the level of competition is just not,
oh,

508
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:48.030
nowhere near where it is in the men's division and in the men's division in the

509
00:27:48.031 --> 00:27:51.780
most competitive way.
Classes like yours,
one 35,
one 55,

510
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:56.370
you won 45,
you can't be one dimensional.
It is not,

511
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.520
it's not possible.
You have to be able to kick,
you have to be able to punch,

512
00:27:59.521 --> 00:28:02.730
you have to be able to escape submissions.
You have to have takedown defense.

513
00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:05.580
You have to be able to take people down.
Yeah.
You have to have everything.
Yeah.

514
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.640
And an MMA women's MMA brother you didn't have to for for awhile,

515
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:14.510
but wouldn't someone like Holly comes along now you're going to yes.

516
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.490
Or even you look at John Jay Check and amazing striker.

517
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.970
She's developed a way to Nag and take it down.

518
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.420
But when I saw from her last fight in gray,
she broke her hand.

519
00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:28.830
I don't know what round,
but when I saw what I saw from that fight,
I was like,

520
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.610
I know the person who could beat her now.
Um,
what Claude?
A good day.

521
00:28:32.611 --> 00:28:35.990
A almost beat her the first time they,
first time.
Very close fight.

522
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:41.140
Split decision for Joanna.
Yep.
Yup.
Um,
I think the person who's in middle,

523
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.570
the beat her and thrown her,
it would be page [inaudible] what really?

524
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:50.220
Wow.
The reason,
big,
big statement.
They say,
what about rose?

525
00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.320
What have page rows are going to throw down next week?
The biggest thing,
uh,

526
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.050
they were gonna throw it out next week.
And so like,
like I said,

527
00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:57.540
I had never liked to give out my,
uh,
my actions,

528
00:28:57.541 --> 00:29:01.440
my predictions because when you have to now,
because you just said,
Paige,

529
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.290
Paige is going to fight next weekend and that's rose.
Well,

530
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.570
this is the reason why.
Okay,
I love joining or j check don't,

531
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.340
doesn't mean I don't like her.
Right.

532
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.280
The theme that I see from Joanna is that she is,
she stand up artist.

533
00:29:14.281 --> 00:29:15.540
She hits like a fucking truck.

534
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.050
But the thing I see from page Manzana is that once you still green,

535
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:21.690
she's still new.
But the pace she puts on people,

536
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:25.050
the pace that Loretta Valerie put on,
and Joanna,

537
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.400
when Joanna wasn't hurting Valerie and I was okay,
so she's not hurting her,

538
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:33.600
but I can start to see Joanna.
It starts to slow down just a little bit.

539
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:38.370
It Valerie had little more wrestling,
a little more diverse,
just fighting.

540
00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:41.920
I'm just going to fight you I think.
And that's what page brings.

541
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.010
<v 0>When she fights,
she puts on a,
um,</v>

542
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.210
a high pace to where she's in your face.
Yes.
She has some word scrambles where,

543
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:51.430
you know,
it's like,
oh,
so what,
what the hell happened?

544
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:53.680
But she ends up on top and then she starts punching grounded pound.

545
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:58.270
I think that pace is going to give Joanna j check or problem.

546
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.290
Obviously Joanne is going to prepare for her and have a great take on it if
it's,

547
00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:05.380
but I think if,
um,
page where is that comes in and like,
okay,
I'm going to,

548
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.760
I'm going to get in your fucking face.

549
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:08.750
I'm not going to give you chance to get your jabs.

550
00:30:08.751 --> 00:30:11.650
Set your section when we tie up,
I'm gonna get on you.
We're going to do.

551
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.180
We're going to clinch,
I'm going to wrestle you.

552
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.190
Like when I did my Muay Thai fight,
I didn't did,

553
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.530
I didn't fight the Guy Muay Thai style.
I fucking wrestled him.
I got into it,

554
00:30:18.531 --> 00:30:20.410
started clicking to him,
grabbing his hair,

555
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.060
and then when he tried to put me off balance,

556
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.500
I put them off balance with my wrestling.

557
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.890
That's what you had to do with someone who's a Muay Thai world champion and I

558
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:29.380
believe page main exam.
It could do that if she has the right skills,

559
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.590
if she has the right coaching and the right attitude in,

560
00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.190
in Israeli to get fucking hit a lot,
she's going to get hit a lot.
And,

561
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.610
and with the rose in page,
the biggest thing,

562
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:42.280
and the same thing I tell Rose's that uh,

563
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.370
she's so emotional and I told her,
I told her face and I was like,

564
00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:48.850
don't be so emotional.
I was like,
you're so,
you're so talented.
He's so good.

565
00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.450
But I feel like you get the emotions,
get the best of you.
And I know it's hard.

566
00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:54.910
It's a fight.
It's absolutely 100% of fight.

567
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.430
And that's why I take myself out of the emotion.
I was like,
dude,

568
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.750
two things are gonna happen when we fight.

569
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.830
Am I going to lose or I'm going to win?
That's what's going to fucking happen.

570
00:31:02.831 --> 00:31:06.070
I'm just gonna have to do my best,
but I lose,
I lose if I win,
I win.
That's it.

571
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.900
Well,
Paige is very scrappy.
Oh yeah,
for sure.
You,
uh,

572
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.590
you watch her fight and there's no question about it.
She's enjoying herself.

573
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:18.850
She trains hard and she's got mad potential.
I mean,
she just turned 21 right?

574
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.680
Exactly.
Yeah.
She's 21.

575
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.190
She just turned 21 cause I'm gonna last and the last time we were hanging out

576
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:26.860
she was like,
Oh yeah,
that's why I can go to the club night.
I can drink.

577
00:31:26.861 --> 00:31:29.680
I've been to the club already,
but I still drink.
Well,
whatever.
So yeah,

578
00:31:29.681 --> 00:31:34.100
that's awesome.
Well,
she's at a great team to emails.

579
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.000
Got a lot of people here still shires,
which could push her to be like unique.

580
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.020
Like there's been times when I have five people in mass.

581
00:31:41.021 --> 00:31:45.070
Like you see this guy here.
When I find that to me the first time I was like,

582
00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:46.090
you need to be all over him.

583
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.540
You need to be on him from once the ball starts and you'd be in his face.

584
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.250
What I did the first time we fought,

585
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.310
I jumped all over him and that's what caused me to get dropped a couple of
times,

586
00:31:54.311 --> 00:31:56.110
but got my black ass back up.

587
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.680
It kept on going forward and then now the second time we fight,
I have way more.

588
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.280
I have a lot better footwork.
I'm more seasoned.
I'm,
I'm,

589
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.930
my skills have kind of harnessed now.
I'm like,
Hey,

590
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:09.760
I seen it'd be all over you and not overextend myself too where you can land

591
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:14.230
that big shot so it page can see them like,
Hey Joanna,
she needs time.

592
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.550
It's like a rapid or scientists versus surgery and that surgery predecide

593
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.990
Anthony Pettis and of the petty,
she has to go out there,

594
00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.070
get his saddest satis kicks up.
Okay.
He's,

595
00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:27.220
he's going to be set it up like Donald's Roy when first flat at the pedes

596
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:28.040
grabbed Donnes,

597
00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.240
Ronnie's hands ran out the cage through a flying knee and hit him.

598
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.690
Only way you can do that is if you get that person at a time to set up.
I'm like,

599
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.390
we're going to fight.
You're not gonna have time to look fucking pretty.

600
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.070
I'm going to make this a nice grueling.
I'm a get in your face

601
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.520
<v 2>and we're going to wrestle.
That's Angela's.
But those Honeywell state,</v>

602
00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:48.230
those angels just ran at him and he was always first.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.

603
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.690
And that's what you do with somebody who needs time to set up,

604
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.810
who needs time to test the distance and figured shit out.

605
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.530
You get it in their face while he trains with nick curse on Dos.
Anjos does,

606
00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.600
who is one of mob Marinovich.

607
00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:02.960
His disciples came and we were talking about it and he did the podcast and he

608
00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:04.730
was saying if you wash the fight,

609
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.380
what happened was that dose Angeles was always there just slightly quicker.

610
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:11.810
Like their skill sets were incredibly similar,

611
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.900
like incredibly similar as far as like how good they both are.

612
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:19.220
But Dolson Jess was just landing just a little bit quicker,
was a little bit,

613
00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:21.630
he was there first.
He never let um,

614
00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.310
pedes set up and because of that he won all the exchanges.
Yeah,

615
00:33:25.311 --> 00:33:27.620
he just won virtually every minute of every round.

616
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:30.200
But every time by that much there,

617
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:34.610
that's when you have a two way fighters playing with fractions of seconds to

618
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:37.200
where it's like I need to get off like of,

619
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.470
I think he does a good job when he gets taken down.

620
00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:42.280
Like when he fought Chad Mendes,
he got taken down and chats granted pan.

621
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.940
He's just,
okay,
you're hitting me,
you're hitting me.

622
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.020
But each time they got up congress,

623
00:33:46.021 --> 00:33:48.480
so they are putting the pressure on him because you think about in fights,

624
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.600
they get up.
They're like,
good job.
Oh,
right,
right,
right.

625
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:55.310
Let's go back to the center of the Octagon to fight.
Fuck that.
I met my distance.

626
00:33:55.311 --> 00:33:58.100
I'm going to start finding now and you're going to have to deal with the

627
00:33:58.101 --> 00:34:00.890
pressure.
I'm going to make you pay for taking me down and let me back up.

628
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.970
And that's where I think doors Honeywell's did Connor did against Chad Mendez,

629
00:34:04.971 --> 00:34:08.210
and I think you're going to start to see when people start to get it and have

630
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.410
the cardio to do it.

631
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.320
You're gonna start seeing a lot more of that and it mixed martial arts.
Yeah,

632
00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:13.130
I think so too.

633
00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:18.050
It's really interesting when you look at the progression of MMA from 1993 to

634
00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:22.070
today,
it's,
it's so crazy because if you will,
we've talked about this before,

635
00:34:22.071 --> 00:34:27.071
but if you watch football from 1993 and football from 2015 it's still football.

636
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.090
I mean back then you had Herschel Walker,

637
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.240
you know you had great football players.
He,

638
00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:36.020
there was a lot where you could compare and you could look at them and he'd go,

639
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:39.890
well,
these guys are elite athletes.
They're playing the same sport,
man.

640
00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:44.120
You go back and watch UFC one and it's not even,
it's not even the same support.

641
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:49.100
It's just not like the sport has evolved even from 2005 if you go back to the

642
00:34:49.101 --> 00:34:51.590
time when the UFC have the ultimate fighter,

643
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:54.560
if you go 10 years for the first season of the ultimate fighter,

644
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:58.520
you go 10 years ago and then watch now the difference between a world champions

645
00:34:58.521 --> 00:35:01.880
then and world champions,
now it's,
boy,
there's a giant leap.

646
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.770
I would say there's more athlete athletic people in a sport,

647
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.720
more athletes learning how to fight to Rebecca in a day.
Um,

648
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.940
you just had guys like,
I just wanted to fight.

649
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.520
I don't care how much you get paid.
That's it.

650
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.390
Now I know you probably been paying attention to a Jon Jones has been

651
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.400
powerlifting.
Oh yeah.
He's a,

652
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.460
he's taking it very serious now and he's,

653
00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.250
he just dead lifted 600 pounds on Monday and put it up on Instagram.
And,

654
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.950
but Daniel was saying that all this extra bulk is not good.
He's like,

655
00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:35.360
this is probably good for me that he's doing this.
I,
I think,
uh,

656
00:35:35.361 --> 00:35:38.040
I mean if you look back to the first time at Daniel Cormay Jon Jones fight,
he

657
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.250
<v 0>goes,
fuck,
I didn't realize how heavy it was when I had to carry him around.</v>

658
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.500
And I think the second time they fight,

659
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.910
he's going to have to carry that weight around because John Georges longer,
uh,

660
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.950
I would say John Joe's is maybe faster.
I mean the both still fast,

661
00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:55.270
but I think Jon Jones is going to have the upper hand in a striker.

662
00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.140
I'm so damn corny.
Should have to carry all that extra weight around.

663
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.950
And that's the beautiful thing is that Jon Jones,
Jessie's put on weight.

664
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.790
He's not,
you know,
you know,
big Jon Jones,
he's athletic.
He's been,

665
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:09.690
he's taking his time off more serious.
Seriously.
Then he of doing his,

666
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.170
his party and days.
So in retrospect,
when he gets in the camp,

667
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:15.360
he's already way ahead of the curve.
They,

668
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:17.880
he was when he fired a DC the first time.
So if anything,

669
00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:22.140
I think it's worse for DC that Jon Jones is lifting now because he's not,

670
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:23.670
he's not out partying and getting fat.
Right.

671
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.810
It was pretty incredible that he had coconut system three weeks before and you

672
00:36:28.811 --> 00:36:33.030
still be core me.
I like what the fuck.
And that just shows you towns.
Yeah.

673
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:38.060
That just shows you how talented he is and that mean it's fighting.

674
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:42.180
I mean,
he and he's able to adapt.
When he fights,
he's able to adapt.

675
00:36:42.181 --> 00:36:45.930
Like even after watching that fight,
when I'm watch DCA core me when they fought,

676
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.840
I felt like John Jones and I've always felt like this way of January's like when

677
00:36:48.841 --> 00:36:53.400
he fought a rampage.
Um,
uh,
even when he fought Leo Machida,

678
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:54.570
I feel that he goes out there,

679
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.300
he takes it all and see what his points wants to do.
Designee,

680
00:36:57.301 --> 00:37:00.450
tap and all that stuff where he kicks people's in in the,
in a kneecap.

681
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.670
But I feel that there's a point where he turns around,
he goes,
okay,

682
00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:05.760
I'm a fucking finish who now?
Like when he broke his foot,
when he broke his,

683
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:10.530
dislocated his toe,
uh,
just chill.
It was you.
I felt like you saw a different,

684
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.360
you know,
fighter where it's like of a wolf,
you know,
had it's prayed,

685
00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:16.780
it's playing with them.
They knew it was okay.
I'm gonna,

686
00:37:16.781 --> 00:37:17.820
I'm gonna take her to throw it out.

687
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.170
That's why I felt like when Jon Jones DC fight,

688
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.970
I felt like John Jones just Kinda,
he did it enough to win by.

689
00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:25.920
Felt like he wasn't like,
I'm going to fucking destroy you now.

690
00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:29.190
Like I'm going to put you on your back.
I'm going to take your back and see me.

691
00:37:29.191 --> 00:37:32.010
You Man.
I feel like next time you see Jon Jones fight DC,

692
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.090
I think you're going to see that.
Yeah.

693
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.210
<v 1>Well the channel son and fight,
he wanted to prove a point like you got,</v>

694
00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.860
you talked so much shit.
No,

695
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:40.600
you're not in my league so I'm just going to go out and fuck you up.

696
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.110
And he went out and fucked him up with his own game and he took [inaudible]
down,

697
00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.580
beat his ass from there.

698
00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.790
It's really what's really crazy about that fight as a John didn't know that he

699
00:37:48.791 --> 00:37:50.220
had dislocated his toe.
Yep.

700
00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.080
Until I was talking to him in the post fight interview.

701
00:37:53.081 --> 00:37:55.810
He looked down and saw his Tom what?
Oh my God.

702
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:59.740
And then he kind of went into shock.
But what was going through my head was like,

703
00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:03.030
what would have happened if channel made it out of that round?
Yeah.

704
00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:07.090
If channel made it out of that round might not have been able to continue.
Yeah.

705
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:08.500
I mean the doctors might might've stopped to,

706
00:38:08.501 --> 00:38:12.670
his foot was turned upside down where the bottom of his big toe was looking up

707
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.450
and it was fucked up.
It's amazing that it healed up so quickly,

708
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.830
but if chail had lasted somehow or another through that first round,
yeah,

709
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.380
he would have won the title.
Yeah.
He would be like,

710
00:38:23.381 --> 00:38:27.170
oh well default by chosen and angel,
you are talking to the best butter in

711
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:33.220
Joburg.
I'm looking at your picture.
Not Nice.
Thick.
You are excited,
my friend.

712
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.040
That's what he would have said.
Yeah,
he

713
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.870
<v 2>probably would have have like speeches plan.
I mean he's,
he's hilarious.</v>

714
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:42.580
He's a second best shit talker of all time.

715
00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:46.510
I always said he was the best until Connor came around.
He was the best,

716
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:49.150
he was the best.
But like all things,
you know,

717
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.400
there comes an end and the new ones come along and exactly when he almost beat

718
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:58.270
Anderson Silva,
that was a perfect example of a guy that was fighting injured.

719
00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.210
You know,
an Anderson had a fucked up rib going into that fight.

720
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:03.710
Couldn't stuff to take down.
It looked like,

721
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.080
couldn't stop it and still managed to pull off that triangle in the fifth round.

722
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.280
But if you watch that triangle,
like I've watched it,
a triangle a bunch of times,

723
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.230
it wasn't any.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think,
and once he starts scooting,

724
00:39:14.231 --> 00:39:16.840
it almost turned to a arm triangle armbar triangle.

725
00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.180
The foot was never locked in under the,
behind the knee.
It was neat.

726
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:24.270
It was never like,
you know,
like it was never like fucking clamped in.

727
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.570
You never tapped.
Remember,
he never tapped.
Zody said,
well remember Joe?
He goes,

728
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:30.820
I didn't tab.
What the hell are you doing here?
Well,

729
00:39:30.821 --> 00:39:35.410
he had had that issue before with Paulo Filio.
Remember that in WC?
Yeah,

730
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:40.520
yeah,
yeah.
And then they fought again.
And that was when Filio was a hedge.

731
00:39:40.521 --> 00:39:41.770
Lost his fucking mind.

732
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:47.430
I heard Matt was there and he was at the bar and he was just drinking,

733
00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:50.530
just hammering wine that night up before we ain't,

734
00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:54.190
I think it was somebody I didn't make the way.
No,

735
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:56.470
we didn't make the weight and I think somebody else was there with Matt.

736
00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:01.570
And then the guy called,
uh,
called,
uh,
the guy who was a bat and he goes,

737
00:40:01.571 --> 00:40:04.510
hey man,
hey,
I,
I'm thinking about gamma and the fight.
What do you think?

738
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:08.110
And this wasn't that.
This was a guy who has ever met.
And he goes,
well,

739
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.310
the way the fuck things,
look,
Paul,

740
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:13.720
it feels at the bar and I drink a fucking wine.
So if you're going to gamble,

741
00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:17.040
gamble had chosen.
He goes,
really?
All right,
I'm going on there then.

742
00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:21.220
And sure enough,
he cashed out even in his room drinking.
It's in public.

743
00:40:21.221 --> 00:40:23.080
That's how crazy that guy is.

744
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.280
Phileo was a fucking dynamic Brazilian Jujitsu artists though.

745
00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:29.890
He was a bad motherfucker when it came to his Jujitsu,

746
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.040
but he just couldn't control his demons for whatever reason,

747
00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:36.040
whatever those demons were,
he couldn't control him.
That's a guy,

748
00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:40.170
everybody forgets about God damn his Jujitsu is good.
Yeah.
Cause you just,

749
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:45.100
it was so tight number watching him fight.
I was like this guy's high level man.

750
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.983
Yeah.

751
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.290
It's very rare you see guys who come from pure Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with like a g

752
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.490
like Jacques Perrey.

753
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:56.710
You'd be on our Fernandez who come from [inaudible] perspective grappling and be

754
00:40:56.711 --> 00:41:00.400
able to transfer well over to mixed martial arts because I've grappled with a

755
00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:05.200
lot of black belts and Nogi in mixed martial arts.
And I'm like,

756
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:09.460
Eh,
I don't know how I feel about it.
But when I go like,
uh,
Bibiana I'm like,

757
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.670
Holy Shit.
Like this is a totally different level.

758
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:16.770
So I think without the key,
without the,
without the,

759
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:19.780
like each time I grab a baby on,
it's like when we get,

760
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:23.420
I rather be in Bibiano is a hand on what was that I would have had to be able to

761
00:41:23.421 --> 00:41:27.460
in my guard,
they need being his guard.
Wow.
Because I tell him like,
I was like,

762
00:41:27.461 --> 00:41:31.480
I don't like,
cause when we do MMA spying,
like it's different because he,
uh,

763
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.130
I just learned this,
it's called cooking the beans.
The Brazilian called

764
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.820
<v 0>the cooking the beans.
You need to,
you need to cook the beans.
And he's like,</v>

765
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.900
you see my friend,
would you,
when you take people down,
you'd like to posture up,

766
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:44.930
punch him in the face pass card.
And I was like,
yes,
that's how I've been trained.

767
00:41:44.931 --> 00:41:47.900
That's how that trains me.
He goes,
okay,
now I'm gonna teach you something else.

768
00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:50.510
And that's like,
Kay,
you,
you need to learn this side of Brazilian Jujitsu.

769
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.370
He goes,
it's called cooking the beans.
You know,

770
00:41:52.371 --> 00:41:56.270
you can't just throw beans in a pot and then respect and I'm going to be hard.

771
00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:00.500
You need to cook your beans,
let them simmer a,
then you can eat them.

772
00:42:00.501 --> 00:42:03.340
So that's what you gotta do doing in this part of Jujitsu.

773
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.760
You need to get in there,
work it,
change your Ela,
naturally,
change your,

774
00:42:07.761 --> 00:42:11.470
your pushes,
let them get tired.
And then once I get tired of,

775
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.210
then you can enjoy your dinner.
And that's what they beyond doesn't mean.

776
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.720
Like when we're sparring,
I'm like,
I'm like,
okay,
baby.
All right.
Whenever you,

777
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.750
whenever you want to pass my guard or do this and this,
you can do it.
He goes,

778
00:42:20.751 --> 00:42:23.120
don't,
don't,
don't,
you were admitted them.
Each dance I'm going to get you.

779
00:42:23.121 --> 00:42:27.140
Don't worry about it.
Then he fucking gets her.
I'm like,
bitch,
damn.
Damn.
Damn.

780
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:31.430
And so there's a lot of guys that started out with a g and they develop great

781
00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:34.610
habits for the game,
but terrible habits for Nogi.
I agree.

782
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:39.900
A lot of collar control grabbing cuffs,
scrapbooking this on the ground.

783
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.890
Oh my God.
And then they don't have those cuffs and they become like a bluebell.

784
00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:48.310
It's crazy to see a high level black belt that never trains Nogi.

785
00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.050
And then they trained,
they trained no gay,
and they,

786
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:54.070
they don't know what they're doing.
It's crazy.
Or even,
uh,

787
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:58.760
not even for the lines of Nogi of MMA.
Like,
oh,
I'm worse.

788
00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:02.300
Like I grew up with a summary of the other day and he was pure Jujitsu.

789
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:05.690
I'm way bigger than me,
but uh,
and he had a serious,
I'd like to go to,

790
00:43:05.691 --> 00:43:09.980
he had to go to Doris to um,
crucifix on your back and then,
uh,

791
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.070
from there,
uh,
take your back and try to choke you out.

792
00:43:13.071 --> 00:43:15.770
So once we went in for like two minutes,
I,
okay,
this is your game.

793
00:43:15.771 --> 00:43:18.530
I know what it is and which our graphite,
and then when he was in my guard,

794
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:20.720
he wouldn't,
he wouldn't try to,
he had a,

795
00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.030
he tried to go through and then with his knee and I was like,
okay,

796
00:43:23.031 --> 00:43:26.000
your PR pure Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
And I was like,
so at this was,
they may fight,

797
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.680
you know,
I'm right there.
I was like,

798
00:43:27.681 --> 00:43:30.170
I could just stand up and you in the stomach and start punching in the face.

799
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:33.440
And so I can tell once I go with somebody,
like if I were to grapple with,

800
00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.000
you know,
you'd be like,
hey man,
what you grew up with this guy?
I'm like,
okay,

801
00:43:36.001 --> 00:43:38.120
I grew up with you.
And then I'll,
I'll feel him out.
And I'm like,

802
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:41.630
you're just pure Jujitsu.
And I'm like,
because you're not,

803
00:43:41.631 --> 00:43:46.010
you're not mixing everything up with a mixed martial arts into it.

804
00:43:46.011 --> 00:43:50.780
Cause so even like when you're down on the ground with someone just rolling,

805
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:55.130
you could tell,
they can tell pure Jujitsu,
they set things up.
Yes.

806
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.020
I can tell if they're,

807
00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:01.850
if they were a pure Jujitsu and they've done mixed martial arts.
So for instance,

808
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:04.220
like for me,
you can tell like when I'm on my back,

809
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.190
I met a Brazilian Jujitsu fighter.
I know how to my,

810
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.330
I know how to do my commercials.

811
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:12.590
I know how to do my front chokes and elevate and tip you off and all that stuff.

812
00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.850
But typically when I'm on my back,
I'm doing either two things.

813
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.060
I'm trying to set your weights somewhere else so I can get back on my feet so I

814
00:44:20.061 --> 00:44:23.060
can start striking with you or I'm looking to,
you know,

815
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.490
elevate you to reverse you and then get my top game.

816
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:29.040
And it started playing my game to look in the punch.
You typically,
you know,
when,

817
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.010
when I go with Bibiano,
he has both those south where he'll cook

818
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.100
<v 2>the beans.
I mean we're,
he'll get heavy on when I'm on his back,</v>

819
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:38.890
when he's on his back,
he's throwing up the triangle,
the arm bar,
um,

820
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.800
doing certain steps where I'm like,
okay,
this guy,

821
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:44.280
he sees I don't want to be here.
I want to,
I don't,
I don't like,

822
00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:47.250
I want to pass your guard and get there to where the guy where with the other

823
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.600
night,
I can feel it.
I was like,

824
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.480
you're just trying to cook the beans dog and he ain't going to happen.

825
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:54.030
These things are going to be cooked.
And so that's why I was like,

826
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:57.240
can you just prejudge it to cook the beans is a great statement.

827
00:44:57.241 --> 00:45:00.160
I'm going to hold onto that one.
Cause I had heard cooking.
Look,

828
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.750
hoists says that before.
You know,
I've heard him say that you know,

829
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:06.080
that you go to cook your opponent and you got to cook them.

830
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:11.580
Or Matt always talks that when Matt,
uh,
one of his trainers,
uh,
Haru,

831
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.780
um,
he would always reference everything and fishing.
And so he goes,
you know,

832
00:45:15.781 --> 00:45:17.250
when you go out fishing,
you know,

833
00:45:17.251 --> 00:45:19.910
you told you you throw the line out there or you just don't,

834
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.820
we'll end up like that.
You don't,
you throw the line and you,
you Kinda,
you know,

835
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:26.610
make the fish,
take the bait.
Then once they take the bait and they bite you,

836
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.850
you hook them.
And so when Matt is talking about striking,
you know,
you got,

837
00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.640
then you start,
you know,
making them,
you know,

838
00:45:32.641 --> 00:45:35.350
if you have a counter or you want to give them that illusion like,
Hey,
I'm,

839
00:45:35.351 --> 00:45:39.000
I'm right here,
calm kind of what kind of dies.
Connor gets,
gets here,
you know,

840
00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:41.400
he's here.
And then when you start striking,
he's like,

841
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.620
I'm actually right here and I can hit you.

842
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.360
So that's where kind of reference of like,

843
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.210
I'm a big reference of a analogies when I teach mixed martial arts.

844
00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:52.430
When I used to teach,
I would always use analogies when I would teach my,
uh,

845
00:45:52.431 --> 00:45:57.431
the students at AMC that saw Connor also has the shit talking that he does while

846
00:45:58.681 --> 00:46:01.080
you're fighting it,
which is,
you know,

847
00:46:01.081 --> 00:46:04.560
I watched that Tyson Fury Vladimir critical fire.
Did you see that?
Yeah.

848
00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.110
Flat Amir Klitschko looked like dog shit.

849
00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.710
And I think one of the reasons why I look like dog shows that Tyson fury guy

850
00:46:10.711 --> 00:46:13.470
never shut the fuck up.
He didn't shut the fuck up,

851
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:16.740
but the press conferences didn't shut the fuck up.
But the way in,

852
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:19.680
he didn't shut the fuck up when they were introducing the fine.

853
00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.620
I mean with they're doing national anthems,
he didn't shut the fuck up.

854
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:27.000
And I think to a guy like Vladimir who barely speaks English anyway,
you know,

855
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:31.260
it was like a stoic sort of a guy.
Like I think that Fox would,
his head,

856
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.210
it could be,
I never forget when Chad was like,

857
00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:37.170
he was still talking shit when I was hitting him.
He goes,
ah,
ah,
ah.
And I think,

858
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:40.620
I think it can happen.
I mean,
you know,
for me,
if somebody was going to talk,

859
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.750
I remember when I was coming to fight Dawson,
second time he goes,

860
00:46:42.751 --> 00:46:45.000
I'm gonna Talk Shit to him in the end a fight.
I'm like,

861
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.960
well fucking see what we'll see in Aa.
And he did it.
Um,

862
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.390
there was a point in time where I wasn't,
you know,
Talk Shit.
I was like,

863
00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:53.670
yeah you would talk Shit denied,
Huh?
Yeah,
take,
take it.

864
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:57.120
But when you were dominating that fight,
like from the jump,

865
00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:01.530
I think he never really had a chance to get comfortable enough to start talking

866
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:03.250
shit.
Cause you,
you have to,

867
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.380
the thing about talking shit is you have to think about it while you're doing it

868
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:10.380
and then the opponent has to think about it while you're doing it.

869
00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:12.710
Like you have to think about it,
what you're doing it and your opponents,

870
00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.000
they like,
this is a whole nother element going on in the fight.

871
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.180
There's a conversation at home.
Yeah.

872
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.320
I think the only time I've ever talked shit bits where fights was somebody said,

873
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:27.350
uh,
I had a weak ass ground game and I was like,
it was just doing the countdown.

874
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.130
I was like,
okay,
I got a weak ground game.
Perfect.

875
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:33.250
<v 0>I just gave me more money.
There's,
he beat your ass for sure enough.</v>

876
00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.840
We get in a fight and I'm beating them up.

877
00:47:34.841 --> 00:47:38.230
And then I submit him and I walk away and I do my thing and I walk up to him and

878
00:47:38.231 --> 00:47:39.910
he was on the ground just,
you know,
like this and I said,

879
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.420
you got on my knees are like not bad for a week as ground game.
Huh.

880
00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:47.110
And it's walked off.
And I was like the end of that.
And,
and,
and,

881
00:47:47.111 --> 00:47:51.170
and the people who knew me knew what I said to him,
but it was that Morocco,
uh,

882
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:55.190
no,
no,
no,
no.
Who Was it?
It was a Chris Carr.
Yasso.
Oh,
Chris Carter.

883
00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.310
He also said that,
yeah,
he said he's having it cut down.

884
00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.560
But even like in all my opponents,

885
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:02.000
every single time I fought them to the John Doctrine,

886
00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.510
even though he talks shit about me to John Wrong and we talk shit about me,

887
00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.240
it the time I fight my guys,
I go to him and say,
dude,
hey,

888
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.580
this isn't the end of your career.
At the end of the day,

889
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:12.160
it's about being able to take care of your family,
pay your bills,

890
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:16.120
and have a career.
So this isn't the,
this isn't the end for you.

891
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:17.890
Keep on fighting and you know,

892
00:48:17.891 --> 00:48:21.820
maybe you get another chance at the title or maybe not then no matter how much

893
00:48:21.821 --> 00:48:24.490
shit they talk about me,
then that doesn't matter me.
Well,

894
00:48:24.491 --> 00:48:27.190
it's interesting because shit talking is almost a prerequisite.

895
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:29.950
It almost seems like it's,
it's almost mandatory.

896
00:48:29.951 --> 00:48:33.850
It's so rare that someone doesn't talk shit.
Then one time I've talked shit,

897
00:48:33.851 --> 00:48:36.940
you don't know.
Okay.
But it's rare.
It's very rare.

898
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:39.130
Like Luke Rockhold and Chris Weidman,

899
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:42.370
these two are talking more shit before this fight than any other fight I can

900
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:44.860
ever remember.
Weidman being in.
Yeah,
true.

901
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:48.080
And I think honestly it's because the numbers they want.

902
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.070
If somebody goes like this,
if I,
it's like Joe Rogan,

903
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:56.730
you are going to fight fucking the commentator for fucking Bella.

904
00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:59.020
I don't even know his name.
Jimmy Smith.
Jimmy Smith.
There you go.
Thank you.

905
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:03.230
You're going to fight.
Jimmy Smith came.
I'm going to pay you $2 million.
Okay.

906
00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.800
Just to fight.
You ain't got same thing.
You just show up,
make weight,

907
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.540
post some videos here and there.
You'll get $2 million,
right?
If like,

908
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.180
or if,
okay,
Joburg and here,
here's your contract.
Hey,

909
00:49:13.181 --> 00:49:17.200
you have a percentage that you can hit,
sir.
If you can hype this bite up,

910
00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:22.030
you want to get 50% of revenue my friend,
you'll be like,
fuck you know Smith man,

911
00:49:22.031 --> 00:49:24.250
he ain't shit.
Y'all see me hitting them weights today.

912
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:28.040
I'm going to destroy this guy.
He is slow.
Of course,
of course it's of,

913
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:31.250
it's totally different thing.
But if I came to you,
if I went to Luke Rocko,

914
00:49:31.251 --> 00:49:32.140
if I went to Chapman,
it's,

915
00:49:32.141 --> 00:49:35.410
I'm sure it's kind of rigor is still fucking talk shit.
Um,
but if talk shit,

916
00:49:35.411 --> 00:49:36.570
if it was free,
yeah.

917
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.510
But if I went to Josie Aldo and Conor McGregor and Luke Rockhold and Chris

918
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:43.990
Weidman,
I'm like,
okay guys,
here's the,
here's the thing.

919
00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:48.060
You're going to get $2 million.
You're going to $2 million chat,
uh,

920
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:53.350
Aldo and Conor you to get $5 million,
do your thing.
You Ain't gonna Talk Shit.

921
00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.770
Just do whatever you want to do the street and get paid.
I guarantee you,

922
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:58.210
you still might here.
You know,

923
00:49:58.211 --> 00:50:01.960
Luke Rocko say crystal had made a slow like [inaudible] more.
Uh,

924
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.770
it tells you when you're like,
you know,
if they were like,
oh,
Luke Rocco,

925
00:50:04.771 --> 00:50:07.840
what are the things you see about,
uh,
Chris Weidman?
I think you slow.

926
00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:12.600
I'm obviously think I am the more a better athlete than he is and I think it

927
00:50:12.601 --> 00:50:17.530
will be able to expose that,
uh,
uh,
tonight instead of him like Chris is slow,

928
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:22.760
slow,
slow,
slow,
you know,
trying to derogatory.
So that's,

929
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:27.010
that's my opinion.
But then again,
I could be wrong.
No,
I think you've got a point.

930
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.050
I think,
but I think it's,

931
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.140
<v 2>there's both things going on because like we said,</v>

932
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:33.140
there's a psychological game that's going on.
Then we'll go on no matter what,

933
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:36.320
but then there's the hype for financial gain.
Oh yeah.

934
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:39.500
The only reason I bought the best career area and Ronda Rousey fight is because

935
00:50:39.501 --> 00:50:41.710
we,
she was like,
don't cry.
I was like,

936
00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:46.210
I may have caught it's fucking order it and you guys see these big get word
that.

937
00:50:46.211 --> 00:50:48.530
That's the only reason why I bought it,

938
00:50:48.531 --> 00:50:51.740
because I knew how the buys or how the fight's going to go.

939
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:53.600
Like even like the Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather,

940
00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.440
like I didn't have to buy a fight.
I was like,
I knew he's that kind of,

941
00:50:55.441 --> 00:50:57.110
the fight was going to go.
Did you really?
Yeah.

942
00:50:57.111 --> 00:50:58.520
I knew exactly how the fight is going to go.

943
00:50:58.521 --> 00:51:02.030
You didn't think that if many patio was healthy that he presented some problems

944
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:06.780
because the way boxing has scored,
you don't get,
if I,

945
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:12.770
I guess you get points if I block your shot technically,

946
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:15.170
right,
so if I'm here,
you throw a hook.

947
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:17.930
I'm like caught that there's a point for me,
boom,
got that.

948
00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.590
Like when he fight a Medina and he was on the ropes getting beat up.

949
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.530
If that was mixed martial arts,
he would have won that fight.
Hands down.

950
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.230
But in boxing he's blocking on that.
You're wasting your punch,

951
00:51:27.231 --> 00:51:29.480
which rightfully so.
That's how it should be.
Yeah.

952
00:51:29.481 --> 00:51:32.600
You get to a 500 punches in a fucking round and you understand you only land 10

953
00:51:32.601 --> 00:51:34.670
of them.
What the hell are you?
What were you doing?

954
00:51:34.671 --> 00:51:37.490
Shit with those big gloves because you can block with the big gloves better.

955
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:41.510
Exactly.
Even even me.
Oh No.
Oh Man.
He threw 500 punches.

956
00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:44.380
How many of those fucking things landed?
I'm,

957
00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.790
that's why I'm so big on being technical.
Why?

958
00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:50.630
Why am I going to go out there and throw all these punches and nothing and do

959
00:51:50.631 --> 00:51:53.630
nothing?
So that was what was great about your victory over a Datsun.

960
00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.280
And I was interviewing here,
go look at me.

961
00:51:55.281 --> 00:51:58.340
I just went five rounds and I'm pretty as a motherfucker.
It was true.

962
00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.210
It was true.
It was hilarious cause you didn't just go,

963
00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.630
you went five rounds of the most dangerous guy and that's why I bring it to a

964
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:08.660
point where people like,
you know,
and sometimes I feel people get upset,

965
00:52:08.661 --> 00:52:13.060
they're like four from like a promoter sample.
You're like,
Ah Fuck Ah,

966
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:14.870
you know this was a fight to make,

967
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:18.260
you know Dotson's that guy who hits people and knocks him down and I'm like,

968
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.320
dude,
you hit hot heart.
I'm not going to fucking be there.

969
00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:23.510
I'm not going to sit there and let you hit me.
People were like,

970
00:52:23.511 --> 00:52:27.800
you need to bang it out.
Wow.
Look like you want to get more fans,

971
00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.180
dude.
If you want to make more money,
you just go to the one 35 and I'm like,

972
00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:35.390
so let me get this.
So you're saying I want to make more money.

973
00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:39.950
Find that one 35 is that in my contract?
Is that guaranteed?
Um,

974
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:44.720
no it's not.
So you're,
you're fucking high right now.
That's not right.
Anyway.

975
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.960
I mean your,
your weight classes,
correct.
This is where you belong.

976
00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:50.180
It's like you're fighting perfectly at this weight class.

977
00:52:50.181 --> 00:52:51.590
There's no problems whatsoever.

978
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:54.830
People just don't know what the fuck they're talking about and they don't

979
00:52:54.831 --> 00:52:58.130
appreciate the art of what you were doing your fight with don.

980
00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.650
John Dodson was one of my favorite fights of the year.
Thank you.

981
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:04.340
It was because it was like,
if I tell if I have a,

982
00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:06.740
if there's a young guy that's thinking about our young girls thinking about

983
00:53:06.741 --> 00:53:08.690
getting into MMA,
I will watch this fight.

984
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:11.630
You're watching a guy fight one of the most athletic,

985
00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:15.230
one of the most dangerous guys in the fucking,
in the sport.
Yeah.

986
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.640
A guy who legitimate one punch knockout power.
A guy who does flips.

987
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:23.210
You mean he's up.
He's way more athletic than me.
Like if freak,
if you're like,

988
00:53:23.211 --> 00:53:25.830
do go up and and do a back flip and do twisty shit.
I'm like,

989
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.020
you know what I can't do,
I'm not going to lie.

990
00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.990
Like I cannot do run up and do a bachelor's that I cannot do it now.

991
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:35.880
He's a freak.
Yeah.
John.
John Dodson is a freak,
but you shut it all down.

992
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:39.900
He shut it all down so,
and you shut it all down.
Not by running away,

993
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:44.220
not by avoiding him.
Bye.
I engage it over and over again.

994
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:47.190
But controlling the distance,
controlling the,
the position.

995
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:50.940
Like you were constantly out of position for him.
I mean he couldn't,

996
00:53:50.941 --> 00:53:53.490
he just couldn't find you.
He seemed fine.
Masterful.

997
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.520
You are very knowledgeable in the sports wear half them on the fuckers you were

998
00:53:56.521 --> 00:54:00.370
watching.
They're like,
ah,
AH,
so boom.
But yeah,

999
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:03.720
I wasn't bored for a second in that fight.
I was like,
God damn.

1000
00:54:03.721 --> 00:54:07.740
We were watching art.
We're watching a masterpiece.
It's a masterpiece.

1001
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:09.270
I appreciate.
It's one of the best fights ever.

1002
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.750
I really believe like the one of the best performances ever because I think

1003
00:54:12.751 --> 00:54:17.610
Dodson is so fucking dangerous.
Oh yeah.
He's so dangerous.
And I think,

1004
00:54:17.611 --> 00:54:18.450
and I can feel,

1005
00:54:18.451 --> 00:54:23.451
I can tell there'll be 0.3 points where like when we're training and I'll just

1006
00:54:23.701 --> 00:54:27.360
get hit so many times so much and I'm like,
this is fucking stupid.

1007
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:30.240
Like I'm going to get,
not,
I'm going to get knocked out by if I fight like this.

1008
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:34.800
But then I believe in that training and I believe what he says and it worked out

1009
00:54:34.801 --> 00:54:35.011
good.

1010
00:54:35.011 --> 00:54:38.910
And I could tell there was some relief off of Matt shorter after effect because

1011
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.860
we know how it came in like that.

1012
00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:44.610
And we know Dotson has a power for one shot once it lands,
it's like,

1013
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:49.200
well he's knocked out Tj Dillashaw.
Yeah,
I mean you watch that fight.
God Damn,

1014
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:52.860
he threw some fucking combinations in a fight when he knocked out Dillashaw to

1015
00:54:52.861 --> 00:54:56.250
win the ultimate fighter at one 35 he was in position,

1016
00:54:56.251 --> 00:55:00.090
he was at the angle as teacher was getting up to,

1017
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:03.420
to finish him off.
And that's where it's like dots is dangerous.

1018
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:07.740
I like a lot of people don't give him the credit he deserves.
I mean,

1019
00:55:07.741 --> 00:55:09.750
I give him all the credit he deserves.
That's why after the fight I was like,

1020
00:55:09.751 --> 00:55:14.010
dude,
good job of being a father.
If you're the champ,
he would be the champ.

1021
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:19.110
Absolutely.
Or,
or,
or,
or,
or those too.
So,

1022
00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:19.880
and I think what,

1023
00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:24.000
that's what Garth went 35 I think it's a good thing for the young and upcoming

1024
00:55:24.001 --> 00:55:28.620
contenders because I don't know,
they probably could get through him,

1025
00:55:28.621 --> 00:55:32.370
but from what I've seen in how I fought Dodson and how he brings it,

1026
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:37.020
I can tell that he would be just like just how just he's been all the
contenders.

1027
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:40.710
I also think that at one 35 he'll probably be a bit more healthy.
Yes,

1028
00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.980
I totally agree.
Thank he cuts too much weight and I probably,

1029
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:47.010
I think that it's just,
there's a lot of guys that just,
they never fight at the,

1030
00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:48.930
they're not at their optimum,

1031
00:55:48.931 --> 00:55:52.890
they're just so drained and dehydrated that they just always feel like the flat.

1032
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:54.860
Yup.
When they compete and I,

1033
00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:00.040
and I don't necessarily think that I've seen the him flat at one 25 but I think

1034
00:56:00.811 --> 00:56:04.590
he was even more dynamic at 35 I agree.
Because like you said,
he's not,

1035
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.730
you're not drained.
Right.
Here's a muscular dude,
you know,
it's a lot of weight.

1036
00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.610
Like,
he's not as,
I mean I think I maybe got,
they'll get myself an inch.

1037
00:56:11.611 --> 00:56:14.190
I think I've got an answer on them.
Um,
but he's,

1038
00:56:14.191 --> 00:56:18.090
he's way bigger physically than I am.
And he's said a word.

1039
00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:21.600
I just made it up as a 15.

1040
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:24.940
Put it in the book.

1041
00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.780
Linacre would have been interesting if he could make that weight.

1042
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:32.280
He just seems to be like very on disciplined,
very undisciplined,
um,

1043
00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.470
in NASA thing to do.
He's not like a very big dude.
And then once again,

1044
00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:37.600
you're starting to see them.
I remember just on discipline,

1045
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.820
I remember we were fighting that USC one 91,

1046
00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:43.630
and my wife sitting there and she goes,
hey,
isn't that linear?
Go over there.

1047
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:44.770
And I was like,
yeah,
so don't again.
I was like,

1048
00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.900
why the fuck are you eating pancakes wage tomorrow?

1049
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:52.870
He was eating pancakes the day before the Williams all mark one 35.

1050
00:56:52.871 --> 00:56:55.780
So he can do that when a dog,
but he was eating hay.

1051
00:56:55.781 --> 00:56:58.870
He fucking went out there and destroyed a Cisco Rivera.

1052
00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:01.900
They got an extra edge and obviously he was a crazy fight.

1053
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:04.510
Why the fuck did Rivera fight like that?
I Dunno.

1054
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:07.510
I just don't understand that fight.
Like Rivera's talented.

1055
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:09.960
He went through rounds.
Well,

1056
00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:13.030
what two rounds where you write a faber mixing it up,
keeping a distance

1057
00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:18.490
and that's the thing.
But,
but you get,
can you get rewarded for fights like that?

1058
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:22.780
They got extra 50 can you give more?
It didn't make any sense.
Why not do it?

1059
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:27.190
You got an extra $50,000 I think it was also because [inaudible] was known as a

1060
00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:30.250
knockout artist at 25 and it's like,
you come up to my weight class,

1061
00:57:30.251 --> 00:57:34.240
I'm going to fuck you up.
No,
no,
no.
That fucking dude,
his

1062
00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:41.050
heart,
he hits hard.
He's,
he's built weird.
You're going to hit harder.

1063
00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:45.670
You throw from the hips.
Like the great example is Artem love the guy.

1064
00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.490
Very good guy.
But when I see him fight and I'm like,
Oh,

1065
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.420
you're talking about kilter five glory.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1066
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:55.900
We're talking about kind of rigorous where Artem Artem and ultimate fighter.
Oh,

1067
00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:00.950
he fights.
He fights here.
Yes.
We're going to hit fucking hard right from the fix.

1068
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:01.900
I'm like,
okay.

1069
00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:04.300
The per person would be him is the guy who throws from the chamber.

1070
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:08.230
You can wrestle and lake kick that's going to be like him versus Anthony Pettis

1071
00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:11.470
is Pettis Rotarian all day.
He killed him just because it's south of us.

1072
00:58:11.471 --> 00:58:14.230
He hits hard because you're talking from your hips.
Right.

1073
00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:18.010
And he definitely hits hard,
but it's hit me,
it's sneaky.
Don't fuck.

1074
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.420
Don't see those punches coming.

1075
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:22.570
Absolutely can be a problem for a lot of guys because as he's moving in,

1076
00:58:22.571 --> 00:58:24.730
like they're coming at weird angles.
You cannot predict them.

1077
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:27.370
And with the small gloves,
they get in there and they find their home.

1078
00:58:27.371 --> 00:58:29.850
You get hit right here,
you can't block here.
You get knocked up.

1079
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.970
And that's where I'm like,
like Co uh,
John Lineker,
he hits hard,

1080
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:39.010
but once he starts,
once those,
he's coming,
he goes boom,
wham,
wham,
wham,

1081
00:58:39.011 --> 00:58:42.130
wham,
wham.
So someone who's going to somebody to beat him,
it's going to be,

1082
00:58:42.131 --> 00:58:46.480
have to be very technical.
Very disciplined.
Yeah.
Who is this?
A Louis Squid.

1083
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:51.250
Not choked him out.
So he kind of talks from the chamber.
Um,
I dunno,

1084
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:54.460
I just think we have style.
Will you make,
if you want to say sat in the fight,

1085
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:58.330
can't even put a brawler,
gets a brawler and put a brawler gets technician.

1086
00:58:58.331 --> 00:59:01.360
People are gonna think it's boring.
It's like a warrior Mcdonald.

1087
00:59:01.361 --> 00:59:06.190
I think he's one of the greatest technician.
Welter weight.
Very,
he stays here,

1088
00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.710
crosses distance as a cure,
what the fans think he goes.

1089
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.750
And then the day my job is to win this fight.

1090
00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:14.440
I'm gonna do it very technically and systematically.

1091
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:17.800
But the Robbie Lawler fight did turn out to be abroad.

1092
00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:22.070
Robbie sort of forced it into a brawl.
One of the first ones.
Second one,
the

1093
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.880
<v 0>thing that I felt bad for,
I didn't felt bad for Robert Warren Mcdonald.</v>

1094
00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:30.620
But Robbie is a southpaw and Rory is Orthodox,
if I'm correct.

1095
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:35.750
And he kept circling into his power like he would circle.
He was sort like this.

1096
00:59:35.751 --> 00:59:37.790
I'm like,
dude,
what are you doing?
You're,
you're,
you're,

1097
00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:40.400
you're not buying the correct real estate,
my friend.

1098
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:42.950
You need to buy the real estate outside to get your punch line up.

1099
00:59:42.951 --> 00:59:45.980
So he just had the exchange.
He won there,
the better exchange,

1100
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:47.840
which ended up being his downfall.

1101
00:59:47.841 --> 00:59:50.510
But that's why I thought it was crazy how the judges had him winning the fight.

1102
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:52.680
Yeah.
I don't understand that either.
I guess it was the,

1103
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:55.700
the round before the stop is where you head kicked.
Oh yeah.

1104
00:59:56.090 --> 01:00:00.700
He had Robert Pretty hurt.
Yeah.
But God damn.
What a good fight that was.
Whew.

1105
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.950
Yeah.
That's one of those fights where you know,
just,
you know,

1106
01:00:03.951 --> 01:00:06.110
you watch it and you go,
wow,
what a fight,

1107
01:00:06.111 --> 01:00:11.030
but what damage those guys took.
I might allow us,

1108
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:12.260
and I was in the stands and I was,

1109
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:15.140
I think it was at that fight and I'll sit in there.
Yeah,

1110
01:00:15.141 --> 01:00:18.230
that sounds was the Connor and Connor chat fight,
right?
He was one of the night,

1111
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:21.200
I'll sit down.
I was like,
you know what?
I truly hope they take care of him.

1112
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:23.300
Like I treat the hope they get taken care of,

1113
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.630
especially where Mcdonald for all that damn curious.

1114
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:30.480
Not enough money in the world for me to risk my brain damage.
Like,
yeah,

1115
01:00:30.481 --> 01:00:31.880
I know I'm fighting right now.
And they're like,
well,

1116
01:00:31.881 --> 01:00:35.300
why the fuck are you fighting?
Um,
that's why,
you know,
Matt,
he will,

1117
01:00:35.301 --> 01:00:38.030
he'll look at me and there's one time I just fucking brought it.
I was like,

1118
01:00:38.031 --> 01:00:41.720
I'm fucking go.
I'm just going to let my hands go.
I'm gonna take shots,
get shots,

1119
01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.220
had vertigo.
And that was like,
what the fuck were you doing?

1120
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.270
That was the Ian Mccall for it,
right?
The first thing we'll call fight,

1121
01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.420
Matt was like,
what are you doing?
I was like,
I'm going to stand it.
Bang.
You know,

1122
01:00:50.421 --> 01:00:55.220
I want to do the whole thing.
He,
he goes,
no,

1123
01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.230
no,
no.
He goes,
your talents are your get it.
You can,

1124
01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:03.260
you can switch from aspects of mixed martial arts without,

1125
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:06.890
without missing a beat.
That is your gift,
your gift,
this be fast.

1126
01:01:06.891 --> 01:01:09.530
And that led people to hit you.
That's,
that's what you,
that's what you have.

1127
01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.960
You do it better than I do and you do better in their bad days.

1128
01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.370
So we need to harness that.
And then when he told me that and I was like,
fuck,

1129
01:01:16.371 --> 01:01:18.470
you're right.
And so that's what I've been doing ever since.

1130
01:01:18.471 --> 01:01:21.890
And that's why you've had not seen me yet.
You know,

1131
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:26.480
obviously the first thoughts fight.
I got fucked up and I was like,
all right,

1132
01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:30.310
let's fix this.
Do you feel like you're still growing?
You're still filling,

1133
01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.280
you're still getting better.
Yup.
Um,

1134
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:37.100
the reason why I say that is because this is the first time out of my camps.

1135
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:40.580
Usually I'll,
I'll let myself,
I don't want to let myself go.

1136
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:45.140
I felt like I got fat between camps,
but this is the first time between,
uh,
camps.

1137
01:01:45.141 --> 01:01:47.930
I'm actually lifting heavy.
Um,

1138
01:01:47.931 --> 01:01:52.130
I'm still learning and I'm maturing as an athlete in it as a competitor.
Um,

1139
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:55.100
I think my last fight is Dotson was the first time I wanted to fight.

1140
01:01:55.101 --> 01:01:58.850
Now it was like,
okay,
but see happens.
I shoot,

1141
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.800
there was no part in the game plan to me.

1142
01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:04.280
Pick his leg up and walk them through the cage and punch him and elbow him.

1143
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:04.790
There was,

1144
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:08.750
we'd never trained that at all or me doing these spinning back elbow and hitting

1145
01:02:08.751 --> 01:02:09.470
him.

1146
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:13.760
That stuff I'd dug up maybe two years ago that mats taught me and so Matt is

1147
01:02:13.761 --> 01:02:18.350
still teaching me stuff back and using my fights and I'm able to implement it in

1148
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:21.340
my fighting style.
So each time when I look at it,

1149
01:02:21.341 --> 01:02:25.560
if I go camp by a fighting this person,
I'll get in here and I feel the distance,

1150
01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:28.160
I'll test it and then I'll be like,
okay,
let me dig up my toolbox.
Did Do,

1151
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:31.950
do you mean,
okay,
this can take care of this.
I use it and I try to apply it.

1152
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:36.260
If it doesn't work,
can move for one second.
Meet,
dig in there and bring it back.

1153
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.900
Oh,
this is working.
Oh me.
See what?
Oh,

1154
01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:42.090
so that was just complete improvisation in complete improvisation of skill that

1155
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:45.420
you hadn't really worked on it a long time.
Yup.
Wow,
that's crazy.

1156
01:02:45.421 --> 01:02:48.420
To do that a title fight,
that's what shows you how comfortable you are too.

1157
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.980
And that's Eh,

1158
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.410
me becoming more mature and trusting my skills.
Like Matt says,

1159
01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:56.370
my biggest opponent is me because he goes,
dude,

1160
01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:59.330
you could put people on the fucking matrix.
You realize that right now?

1161
01:02:59.331 --> 01:03:02.880
I was like,
really?
He goes,
yes.
He was like,
you do it in your all the time.

1162
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:05.680
You can do it.
Just do it in a fight.
And that's when I was fighting.
Um,

1163
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.710
it was all about him.
He goes,
put them in the Matrix,

1164
01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:11.520
put them into matrix and I'm like,
I want them little ass gloves.

1165
01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:15.930
I'm not comfortable doing it yet because you get knocked out and then next thing

1166
01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:18.030
you know your paychecks less.
And it was like,
oh great,

1167
01:03:18.031 --> 01:03:20.290
now I've got to swipe all this.
So,
um,

1168
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:24.450
I'm hoping one day I can get to that point to where you guys can see where it's

1169
01:03:24.451 --> 01:03:26.670
like,
oh,
that's the fucking matrix.

1170
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:31.200
Does it frustrate you when you look at what you're capable of doing and you look

1171
01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:31.650
at it,

1172
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:33.900
I'm not the only one that thinks you're the best pound for pound fighter in the

1173
01:03:33.901 --> 01:03:34.560
world.

1174
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.100
But then you see other people that are fighting that don't have maybe the skill

1175
01:03:39.101 --> 01:03:44.070
set that you have that just get all this hype and all this attention and the

1176
01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:47.220
more pay per view buys.
And did you do look at that and go,
fuck,

1177
01:03:47.221 --> 01:03:49.920
what do I have to do here?
Don't,
I'm not gonna lie.

1178
01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:52.260
There comes a point in time to where you get pissed off by it.
It's like,

1179
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:56.400
not just me,
but I think people around me who believe in my skill set.
Um,

1180
01:03:56.490 --> 01:04:01.410
but you can't,
you can't let that detour you off your goals.

1181
01:04:01.411 --> 01:04:04.470
Like always make fun of people.
Always make fun of myself.
I was like,

1182
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:06.840
you know what,
if I ended up breaking Anderson Silva's record,

1183
01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.270
half the fucking world won't even know who I am.

1184
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:12.540
And I always call myself the redheaded stepchild from the UFC where it's like,

1185
01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:14.730
they'll be like,
if people the day they're like,

1186
01:04:14.731 --> 01:04:16.640
they're coming to see Dan went like Dana White,
we're interested,
you know,

1187
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.750
you know,
pushing your company,
you know,
you know,

1188
01:04:18.751 --> 01:04:20.760
can you tell me some of your great athletes?
And he'll be like,
oh,
you know,

1189
01:04:20.761 --> 01:04:23.850
we have a,
you know,
Anna Civil,
Conor McGregor and all these kinds of like,

1190
01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.080
they were like,
who is,
ah,

1191
01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:30.720
Demetrius Johns Johnson is his name.
They call him mighty mouse.

1192
01:04:30.721 --> 01:04:35.340
He has 13 consecutive tele fence white thing.
You not mention him at all.

1193
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.400
I don't understand it.
And I'm like,
Oh,
oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1194
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.230
So I mean I always make fun of myself like,
you know,

1195
01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:44.430
on the right stepchild of the UFC because I don't get this act,

1196
01:04:44.431 --> 01:04:46.020
same hype as other people,
which is totally fine.

1197
01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:48.330
I'm not out here looking for hype and all that stuff.

1198
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:52.470
I'm not here to try to prove that the skill set I bring it to the octagon is if

1199
01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:54.930
you're going to go into a bar and you're going to fight,

1200
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.120
you want to bring my shit in there because you're going to fight and we're going

1201
01:04:59.121 --> 01:04:59.241
to be,

1202
01:04:59.241 --> 01:05:01.620
we'll beat this guy up and he's gonna be able to touch you and you don't walk.

1203
01:05:01.621 --> 01:05:04.800
Kind of like officer,
I was not involved in that fight.

1204
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:09.660
I hadn't looked at my face or your knuckles bleeding,
sir.
They're not.

1205
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:14.010
I was cleaning up stuff.
So that's,
that's,
that's why I want to present.

1206
01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:18.010
And it does not translate well over to fans and all that stuff,

1207
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.360
<v 1>which is what you've finished fights.</v>

1208
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:22.360
Like you knocked out Benevidez and the first round you finished horror Gucci

1209
01:05:22.361 --> 01:05:26.470
with one second to go in the last round of fight,
you were dominating.

1210
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.260
You Finish Dodson the same,
not Dodson.

1211
01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:33.010
Moraga in the same situation of fight where you were dominating,

1212
01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:36.550
you still went for the finish and finish them,
but you have exciting finishes.

1213
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:37.650
Okay,

1214
01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:40.430
<v 0>you're preaching to the choir,
my friend dude,
I ain't got it.
I don't get it.
Like,</v>

1215
01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.340
and you know,
and that's the thing too.
It's like eventually,
you know,

1216
01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:46.710
it's almost like eventually they have to eventually,

1217
01:05:46.711 --> 01:05:50.750
hopefully they will jump on board and she's,
hopefully
you don't have,

1218
01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.650
if it doesn't happen,
you know what I'll keep on,

1219
01:05:52.651 --> 01:05:56.670
I'll keep doing my best and winning and,
and that's the thing too,

1220
01:05:56.671 --> 01:05:58.920
like east summit and it could be my personality,

1221
01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:03.450
like when I come into fights or like sodium is Johnson,
um,
uh,
uh,

1222
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:05.460
what do you think about this fight?
I'm like,
you know,

1223
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:08.520
I think my point is a great fight,
a great guy.
And you know,

1224
01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:10.710
whether I win or lose the outcome,
that's not change.

1225
01:06:10.711 --> 01:06:12.930
I've never touched the outcome.
I of my fights.

1226
01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:16.550
And when I say that is that when I went against John Dodson,

1227
01:06:16.551 --> 01:06:20.980
I wasn't out there like call man,
we're gonna ah Oh God,
I was a great fight.
Mint.

1228
01:06:20.981 --> 01:06:24.370
Oh,
you know,
Oh hey,
hey,
you're not my wife.
Hey,
you doing baby?
Hey,
let me see you.

1229
01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:28.840
[inaudible] that's not how it goes.
Or if I went over,
if I lose it,

1230
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.810
that's not how it goes.
Like after I win my fights,
I go home,
I relaxed,

1231
01:06:32.811 --> 01:06:37.060
I spent time,
my wife and my children,
and then I call,
I call it Sharsheret.

1232
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.770
I was like,
okay,
what's next?
So you're still you,
no matter what,
no matter what,

1233
01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.500
it doesn't get too high and doesn't get too low.
Exactly.

1234
01:06:43.501 --> 01:06:46.920
Because it in a day I'm to,
there's gonna come a point in time,
I'm going to lose.

1235
01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.620
There's gonna come a point in time to where you're not going to call me the best

1236
01:06:49.621 --> 01:06:53.310
fire fighter in the world.
Like it's just,
it's reality.
I mean,
I hope you do,

1237
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:57.450
honestly.
You hope you do,
but forever,
forever you're like,

1238
01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.460
you're like bathe,
make sure my tooth and you put the greatest fighter ever,

1239
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:06.110
Demetrius Johnson.
But it's reality.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's going to happen.

1240
01:07:06.111 --> 01:07:08.460
There's going to be better.
Do you Ms. Johnson?
Um,

1241
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.890
maybe 10 or 15 years down the road.
So for me,

1242
01:07:10.891 --> 01:07:15.420
I keep that in my mind that it keeps me calm me,
keeps me grounded,

1243
01:07:15.421 --> 01:07:16.710
keeps me humble that way.

1244
01:07:16.711 --> 01:07:20.550
When I got in a fight in your not might on this super high and you know,

1245
01:07:20.551 --> 01:07:23.790
if I lose my title and I come back to Seattle in her like,
you get your ass over.

1246
01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.600
I was like,
yeah,
I did.
I lost it.
Fucking happens.
My friend.
Yeah,

1247
01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.350
it's called sports competitiveness.
I don't know if that's a word or not,

1248
01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:33.980
but I just made it out.
Yes,
competitiveness is a word.
Get,
get,
get.

1249
01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.060
I don't know about that other one though.
What was the other one?

1250
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.550
Fit the category.
There's a gallery is a word physically.

1251
01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:45.470
Physically.
There it is.
Hey,
see you didn't use it.
You be like Joe Rogan.

1252
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:50.460
He's by the same,
I meet the physically see,
I feel like he dominated.
Exactly.

1253
01:07:50.461 --> 01:07:53.610
So it was a physique Lee contest.
Yeah.
Hey.

1254
01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.390
So that just keeps me grounded.
It keeps me humble.

1255
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:59.760
<v 1>Well that's,
that's a very good attitude.
It's a very healthy attitude to take.</v>

1256
01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:04.290
And I think when the highs are very high,
the lows,
you know,
when you,

1257
01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:06.580
when you don't get those highs,
the lows are devastating.

1258
01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.640
<v 0>Absolutely.
No,
I think you see it a lot.</v>

1259
01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:13.730
I try to learn from they champions of the past and you mean the present when

1260
01:08:14.431 --> 01:08:19.431
they lose their belt and there I remember of spires that we're at a w welcome to

1261
01:08:20.751 --> 01:08:23.870
the show,
um,
press conference and I see her,

1262
01:08:23.871 --> 01:08:26.810
she's holding the belt like this cause she just got it.

1263
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:30.260
And I'm sitting there and are about to scare us off and like the,

1264
01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.930
the fucking UFC belts heavy and a Spec to secure everywhere.
I,
I,

1265
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.530
I see people like Daniel Cormay.

1266
01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:39.920
He brings his boat around and shows it all silver used to go to bars with it.

1267
01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:43.100
Yeah,
exactly right.
I'm at the press covers.
I'm like,
fuck this.

1268
01:08:43.101 --> 01:08:46.400
I just throw my belt.
And they're like,
she's like,
oh my,
I can't.
Well you did.

1269
01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:47.540
I was like,
honey,
let me tell you something.

1270
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:50.210
The first year is that bell gets chance to leave you is going to leave your ass.

1271
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:53.240
I mean,
sure enough,
she lost to Georgia tech and I was like,

1272
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:57.720
<v 1>I should.
But I said to her,
well,
that was a bad fight for her.
Yeah.</v>

1273
01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:00.770
Because she won the title because she won the ultimate fighter.

1274
01:09:00.771 --> 01:09:04.340
And I love the ultimate fighter.
It's a fun show.

1275
01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:08.120
It's a great showcase for up and coming talent.
But the problem is

1276
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.040
there's just not enough talent.
Yeah.

1277
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:17.030
And so a lot of the people that you see fight on the ultimate fighter.
Yup.

1278
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.910
They really shouldn't be there.
Yeah.
No,
I totally agree with you.

1279
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:22.790
I told you I watched some of those guys.
I'm like,
Oh,
fucking Christ.

1280
01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:27.530
Who led him on the show?
Dana?
I don't know,
man.

1281
01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:30.500
I'm not a promoter.
No,
no,
I'm the wrong guy for,
I mean,

1282
01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:33.940
I guess I kind of am in a way when I do those countdown shows,
a hype things.
I'm,

1283
01:09:33.941 --> 01:09:36.130
I'm,
I'm a hype man in a way,
but I don't know you,

1284
01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:40.210
you're very knowledgeable in this sport.
That's why I'm iris.
I respect your,

1285
01:09:40.211 --> 01:09:44.450
your insight on fights and even,
uh,
Matt Hume dies.
Even my Brad Curtain,
Dez,
I,

1286
01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:47.030
I think,
um,
you're not giving yourself enough praise,

1287
01:09:47.031 --> 01:09:51.440
my friend and my job was pretty fucking easy.
I just watch it and talk about it.

1288
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:53.120
I don't even have to be in shape.

1289
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:56.900
I don't have to get up early fights don't start till four.

1290
01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:01.600
I've done the UFC hung over on multiple occasions in the past.
It's not hard.

1291
01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:02.450
<v 0>Well,
well you,</v>

1292
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:06.650
you do an amazing job bringing in a fight and you're knowledgeable.

1293
01:10:06.651 --> 01:10:10.340
It's very hard to find knowledge when people in this sport who break it down and

1294
01:10:10.341 --> 01:10:12.950
you're one of them and you have great charisma when you do it.

1295
01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.460
So when you bring up the perfect example about the ultimate fighter,

1296
01:10:16.461 --> 01:10:19.930
how the talent there isn't there,
like,
and that's a thing like it's,

1297
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:23.270
it's become a more of a show too where it's like this guy's got hands.

1298
01:10:23.271 --> 01:10:27.200
I was like,
Bro,
you take that boy into a fucking actual like legitimate fight.

1299
01:10:27.201 --> 01:10:30.950
A guy who throws on the chamber who can mix it up right here.
You're boasting,

1300
01:10:30.951 --> 01:10:34.670
get fucking sink,
roll fast,
cash,
cash and go.
He's exciting.
Yes,
absolutely.

1301
01:10:34.671 --> 01:10:38.150
But mixed martial arts,
you think Bruce Lee was pushing that?

1302
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:41.970
The aspect of being exciting and just getting away?

1303
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:46.810
<v 1>No,
he was,
he was trying to push that.
I'll take two to give one bro.
Yeah,</v>

1304
01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:50.460
exactly.
To where he's going to,
he's gonna use,
he's,

1305
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:54.830
he sees his technical ability to,
to beat you and beef Vanessa about it.

1306
01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:59.330
Well ultimately the way I always described MMA is that what it is is high level

1307
01:10:59.331 --> 01:11:04.220
problem solving with dire physical consequences.
Yup.
And the,

1308
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:09.050
the best guys are guys like you that don't take on those physical consequences.

1309
01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.470
He's produced,
solve the problem and you don't,
you,
you do damage.

1310
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.020
Like at the end of the fied,
Dotson was busted up,
his face was all swollen.

1311
01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:20.300
You look fine.
You,
you,
you saw of in a motherfucker.
Yeah.
Yes,
exactly.

1312
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:22.890
That's what you said.
You solve the problem.
I mean,

1313
01:11:22.891 --> 01:11:27.120
and it's a very complex problem and it's so difficult to do because it's

1314
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:30.900
improvisational.
You're dealing with incredibly fast people,

1315
01:11:30.901 --> 01:11:32.310
especially at your weight class.

1316
01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.960
You're dealing with the fastest people in all of them in May,
and you're,

1317
01:11:35.961 --> 01:11:40.710
you're dealing with all these different possibilities.
There's so many variables.

1318
01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:44.430
There's takedowns and kicks and punches and elbows and clinches and you don't

1319
01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:47.130
know what he's going to do while you're trying to do what you're gonna do.

1320
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:48.980
You're trying to push the pace and you,

1321
01:11:48.981 --> 01:11:52.380
you got to cut angles and you've got to get the fuck away from him and you have

1322
01:11:52.381 --> 01:11:56.370
to have all this knowledge in your head of what to do.
Oh,
he's doing this.

1323
01:11:56.371 --> 01:11:59.440
That means that's coming next.
I'm not going to be there.
Fuck that.

1324
01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:06.660
It's like you have to have a fucking,
just gigantic database of knowledge.

1325
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:09.540
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's not easy.
I'll tell you that right now.

1326
01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:11.950
So when you see these guys fight on tough,
I'm like,

1327
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.700
I'm going to go out there and I'm going to bang like,
Oh God,
you're like,

1328
01:12:14.701 --> 01:12:19.080
this is white belt shit.
This is
a guy he fought.

1329
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:19.960
Um,

1330
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:24.330
<v 0>he five juicy j and he was like,
and he went up,
he ended up on,
uh,</v>

1331
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:28.990
do you see tonight show?
And he was sitting there and he was like,
yeah,
you know,

1332
01:12:28.991 --> 01:12:31.630
I don't like the wider guys.
They just,
they don't,
they don't,

1333
01:12:31.631 --> 01:12:34.230
they don't do for me.
They just do this.
And he goes,
I like to Benalla.

1334
01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.940
And I was sitting there and my couch,
I was like,
Whoa,
my friend,

1335
01:12:36.941 --> 01:12:39.910
you're going to have our very fucking short career.
I had a really weird,
yeah,

1336
01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:43.190
<v 1>the end of your life.
Yeah.
You don't know where your keys are.</v>

1337
01:12:43.191 --> 01:12:46.640
You don't know who your wife is.
This is my house.
I'm not a chore

1338
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.640
<v 0>editing the day.
I would like,
you know what,
you might,</v>

1339
01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:52.760
you might bonus maybe 10 times.
You might have you,
you know,

1340
01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:54.830
you might make more money than me.
At the end of the day,

1341
01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.070
just because you went out there and you sold Schillo tickets and you get fight

1342
01:12:58.071 --> 01:13:00.620
at night every single night and all that stuff.
But you know what?

1343
01:13:00.621 --> 01:13:04.550
I want people that will,
you know when I die and they look,
they dig up,

1344
01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:07.010
you know all DVD tapes in AC.

1345
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:09.740
They've stumbled across to me and they see me moving.
I was like,
oh,

1346
01:13:09.741 --> 01:13:13.100
they know I want them to go sit down.
I'm like,
Holy Shit,
this guy's moving fast.

1347
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:16.040
He,
he's,
he's on the other side of the other upon,
he's on,

1348
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:18.740
he's on the other side of the shoulder and he's,
he's landed combinations.

1349
01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:23.450
Holy Shit.
He can wrestle too.
He just saw fucking arm bar.
I'm like,
Whoa,

1350
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.490
who is this person?
What was his background like?

1351
01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.450
You look at Matt Hume and you try to find out who,
who was Matt Hume's coach?

1352
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:32.970
<v 1>Who was Matt Hume's coach?
I don't know.
I honestly don't know.</v>

1353
01:13:32.971 --> 01:13:34.560
I'm a Matt Hume Fan.
I don't even know who's calling

1354
01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:38.980
<v 0>exactly.
And that's,
I don't even know who,
I know one of his coaches,</v>

1355
01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.020
but you know,
he ha he,
he's a great wrestler.
He has a very long list.

1356
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:44.650
St Kickboxing,
you know,

1357
01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:48.370
and when you look up that stuff and you look how good he fought,
when he,
uh,

1358
01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.700
fired,
uh,
not Pat Miletich,
uh,
what's it guy,

1359
01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:55.810
Josh Burnett's coach now,
um,
Eric Paulson,
Eric Paulson,

1360
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:59.500
that fight and Matt Hume self-consciously,
he tells all the time he goes,

1361
01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:00.640
I had to cut him.

1362
01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:05.220
I knew he was not going to stop because I hit him so hard that I knew self

1363
01:14:05.221 --> 01:14:08.320
conscious,
I need to cut this band to have this man stop coming at me.

1364
01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:11.920
And sure enough he did a knee cut him right there and they're like back in the

1365
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.100
day they

1366
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.630
<v 2>cut when there's blood cause they didn't have,
you know,
control of all the uh,
uh,</v>

1367
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:17.950
fully commissioned aesthetic condition in the diseases and stuff.

1368
01:14:17.951 --> 01:14:21.730
And they're like,
oh,
the face down.
And Matt was like,
good,
he's finished.

1369
01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:24.520
And I want people to look back on my,
in my career be like,

1370
01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.610
this guy was fucking good.
He can do it all.
And so when he said that,

1371
01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:29.950
when he goes,
I just don't let the little guys,
they just don't do it.
I'm like,

1372
01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:33.790
whatever,
Bro.
Well,
people like to say stupid shit like that,

1373
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:36.550
but there's also people that are just dumb because people that like,
you know,

1374
01:14:36.551 --> 01:14:37.840
I don't like fun cuisine.

1375
01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:41.120
I like Mcdonald's is a lot of people that love McDonald's fries.

1376
01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.310
My favorite food bro.

1377
01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.130
My head against the wall.
Yep.

1378
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:50.800
There's just going to be always going to be people that have shitty taste.
Yup.

1379
01:14:50.890 --> 01:14:55.120
I know him.
Like you,
my friend have shitty tastes.

1380
01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:59.070
It's true.
I mean if you can't appreciate a virtual,
oh,

1381
01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:03.190
so the most dangerous sport,
you can appreciate that because you know,

1382
01:15:03.191 --> 01:15:07.170
you just want guys to stand and bang.
That's ridiculous.
And don't get me wrong,

1383
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.720
I can bang,
like if I needed to bang a fight and drag it out,

1384
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:14.890
I can absolutely do that.
Am I going to appreciate it the next day?

1385
01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:19.490
Abso-Fucking-Lutely not because I've done it and I'm like,
what day is it bad?
No,

1386
01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:23.760
it never got the worst shit ever said that.
But there's times I'm like,
you know,

1387
01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:27.190
I'm like,
Dad,
can you come watch my ass?
I can't look.
I can't,
I can't,
you know,

1388
01:15:27.191 --> 01:15:31.270
because I've had surgery multiple times in my right hand.
I've had,
you know,

1389
01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.350
labor in surgery,

1390
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:35.790
and that's just from where Terry and hitting the opponent or the wrong way.

1391
01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:40.120
He hit him under the skull to where it sucks.
It sucks to be in a cast.

1392
01:15:40.121 --> 01:15:42.700
Like I remember Cub Swanson,
I remember he told me that he,

1393
01:15:42.701 --> 01:15:45.510
he's broken his jaw and multiple times and after when he's,

1394
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:47.350
I think it was a freaking mess hall where he lost,

1395
01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:50.430
he broke his jaw in that fight to Barclays bond that,
uh,
I remember,
uh,

1396
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:52.090
the free Gig or fight.
And he was like,
you know,

1397
01:15:52.091 --> 01:15:54.790
I wasn't even going out when he hit me in the choke in the end.
And I was like,

1398
01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:58.210
you know what?
I had it broken job before.
I don't want it again.

1399
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:01.300
So I fucking tapped.
And I was like,
dude,
Kudos to you,
my friend.

1400
01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.260
You're not have to worry about having your jaw wired shut for six months because

1401
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:09.070
you don't want to tap,
I think until you finished whore Gucci.

1402
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:13.870
That was the latest stoppage by submission ever.
Yup.
Yeah.
I think what you got,

1403
01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:14.500
I mean,

1404
01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:19.500
how the fuck is anybody gonna beat yours unless I go six each time it goes five

1405
01:16:19.931 --> 01:16:22.720
fives.
And they're like,
oh.
And I hear that they're clapping.

1406
01:16:22.721 --> 01:16:26.340
I hear people that are in the,
they start running.
I'm like,
no,
no,
don't,

1407
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:32.290
don't tie them April.
It was a great fight.
The good fight.

1408
01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.930
What,
you know when you see boxing and boxing,

1409
01:16:34.931 --> 01:16:39.530
which is not nearly as exhausting as MMA,
but they fight three minutes.
Yep.

1410
01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:42.850
And then,
and then they fight five minutes.
Like what do you think about that?

1411
01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:46.960
It's definitely different.
Um,
because we have a box on our jam and he,

1412
01:16:46.961 --> 01:16:49.510
he just likes boxing.
I'm like,
dude,
you should come to mixed martial arts.

1413
01:16:49.511 --> 01:16:52.300
Like your hands are that good,
but he can't wrestle or anything like that.

1414
01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:56.830
And the stamina,
he has to throw so many punches when we spar,

1415
01:16:57.250 --> 01:16:59.980
it's incredible.
But when he hits me,

1416
01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:02.590
it's totally different because when I hit him,
I mean even with my body,

1417
01:17:02.591 --> 01:17:06.130
instead of him just like pop up,
like it's not,
it's not the same.

1418
01:17:06.131 --> 01:17:10.010
She's an amateur boxer.
So he's an,
so he's trying to score.
I mean,

1419
01:17:10.011 --> 01:17:12.830
he's trying to finish,
but like when I hit,
I'm hitting with my body.

1420
01:17:12.831 --> 01:17:13.970
I'm ready to do that sport science,

1421
01:17:13.971 --> 01:17:17.810
like who hits harder or boxer or MMA fighter to regenerate from our legs.

1422
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:21.930
And they are too,
but we're trying to,
you know,
it's just different.
So when,

1423
01:17:21.931 --> 01:17:26.390
when I'm spine him,
I'm you,
I'm a spawn them like,
uh,
a mixed martial artists.

1424
01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:29.030
Like I'm moving my legs,
I'm switching.
I'm not to throw a kick.

1425
01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.440
I'm loading my hips up.

1426
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:33.770
It's hard for me to break that habit because I'm been trained that way.

1427
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:35.600
Like when I came in the mixed martial arts,
it wasn't like,
hey,

1428
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:39.120
you're going to learn how to box.
Hi,
I'm your boxing coach.
Hey,
hey,
Joe Garcia is,

1429
01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:43.040
I am your Jujitsu coach.
Hey,
I'm uh,
you know,
silver or hey,

1430
01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:46.170
I'm your new tech coach.
He was like,
I'm that Hume.
Um,

1431
01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:48.680
well you got real lucky in that regard.
Real lucky.
Yeah.

1432
01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.340
So not a lot of guys out there that are qualified to do that.

1433
01:17:51.341 --> 01:17:54.370
That all encompassing game plan.
God.
Yeah.

1434
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:56.270
And so now when I do my boxing sparring,

1435
01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:59.720
it's harder for me to do it because I can do it at night and I can get the upper

1436
01:17:59.721 --> 01:17:59.961
edge,

1437
01:17:59.961 --> 01:18:04.280
but it's like I'm gonna fucking tired because we're boxing and I'm just throwing

1438
01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:07.550
punches.
I need to throw some kicks.
Right.
To mix it up to mixed up.

1439
01:18:07.551 --> 01:18:11.450
I need to get you on my clinch too.
Right.
And so it's hard,
but I mean,

1440
01:18:11.451 --> 01:18:13.910
three rounds,
I mean,
three minutes,
three minute.

1441
01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.620
How many rounds they go 12 rounds in a world title fight.
All right.
That's,

1442
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.950
that's a lot of rounds.
I mean,
it's a lot around.

1443
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:21.290
It is definitely a lot of rounds,

1444
01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:24.110
but it's interesting that they only fight three minutes and it's not nearly as

1445
01:18:24.111 --> 01:18:28.200
tiring,
you know,
MMA.
Yeah.
You see guys coming to the corner,
you know,
flow.

1446
01:18:28.201 --> 01:18:31.610
We'll sit down and he goes,
I love you dad.
Remember you taught me,
you know,

1447
01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:33.200
he was,
he was like,

1448
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:37.010
he's the best at not getting hit ever in the history of boxing,

1449
01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:38.173
the name of the Games,

1450
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:41.270
that's the name of the game and mixed martial arts to hit and not to be hit

1451
01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:46.430
submit somebody with and that to be submitted.
What w w when somebody,

1452
01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:49.910
his idea was like,
I need to get fucking hit to be exciting.
Well,
you know,

1453
01:18:49.911 --> 01:18:53.540
I think it came from the ultimate fighter came from Forrest Griffin and Stephan

1454
01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:57.290
Bonner.
Yup.
That fucking fight was awesome.
Awesome.
But yeah,

1455
01:18:57.350 --> 01:19:01.900
not for either one of those guys.
I mean,
Forrest is broken up right now.
I mean,

1456
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:06.530
his body's a mess.
He had a wild,
crazy,
exciting career.

1457
01:19:06.531 --> 01:19:10.340
But ultimately you're,
you can't use your body like a battering ram.

1458
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:12.710
Like if you have a car and it's an awesome race car,

1459
01:19:12.711 --> 01:19:14.930
but you want to enter a demolition derby with it,

1460
01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:17.690
but fucking car is not going to laugh.
No,
it's not.
It's just,

1461
01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:21.020
there's no way around it.
There's no way around it.
And I think,
I think,

1462
01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.070
I think a lot of people are seeing the altar and it,

1463
01:19:25.071 --> 01:19:28.790
and they're good and that they're getting that view of this is with somebody.

1464
01:19:28.791 --> 01:19:31.610
The other day they said,
those are fighter raise digressing this sport.

1465
01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:36.530
And I was like,
I'm not gonna give you his name.
Pass that on the bottle opener.

1466
01:19:36.531 --> 01:19:39.530
Mau.
Cool.
Thank you.
Um,

1467
01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:44.820
he said that the ultimate fighter is the dressing.
I ain't finish this.
It's,
it's,

1468
01:19:44.821 --> 01:19:49.530
it's,
we're such deep thought in conversation and I can't even really deep civic.

1469
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:54.200
But he said the ultimate fighter is degress in the sport.
And I was like,
really?

1470
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:58.850
I was like,
Donald word.
Degress is that,
I'm not sure that's a word.

1471
01:20:00.490 --> 01:20:04.350
It's depressing.
It's aggressive.
It's going behind.
Yes.
It's the guy.

1472
01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:08.080
Aggressing okay.
Regressing.
Regressing word.
Jimmy looked

1473
01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.990
<v 0>that shit up.
Google it.
My friends dress.
Degress well,
the sport is,</v>

1474
01:20:12.991 --> 01:20:15.150
I understand what you to understand exactly what you're going.
There you go.

1475
01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:19.650
So today it is a word than Dannis.
Physicality wise.
No,

1476
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:23.640
physically.
Degression degression is a word.
Okay.
Well,

1477
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:27.670
I just do a little mighty spice into it.
So I get it.
The aggression,

1478
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:33.090
it's going backwards in and people are like,
and I said and I was all ears.

1479
01:20:33.091 --> 01:20:35.970
I was like explain herself.
I'm like,
what makes you say that?
And he goes,

1480
01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:40.320
well you think people are being on national television in on ultimate fighter

1481
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:45.620
and they're fighting to get a contract and they have holes in their game and

1482
01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:49.980
they're not fixing those holes before going into the house instead of if,
if,

1483
01:20:49.981 --> 01:20:50.790
if I,

1484
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:52.800
that was one of the things I would have a hard time coaching with her fighter

1485
01:20:52.801 --> 01:20:56.820
cause I'll,
I'll look at our,
you know,
dissector person I'm like,
and I'll be like,

1486
01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:59.660
Kaitlin,
let me see you fighting me.
I'm going to go with you and I'm okay.

1487
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:00.930
You have a hole here,
a hole here.

1488
01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:06.030
So are you looking just to fight to make two paychecks,
three paychecks?
If so,

1489
01:21:06.031 --> 01:21:08.730
then I guess you're in the right area.

1490
01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.800
But if you're looking to be a role champion,

1491
01:21:10.801 --> 01:21:13.170
if you're looking to be able to provide for your family,
I mean,

1492
01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.620
I always tell y'all all the time when I was in the UFC,

1493
01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:18.720
when I fought for the world championship at one 35 I also work on a fucking

1494
01:21:18.721 --> 01:21:21.450
fulltime job and they'll be like,
you fight for world championship,

1495
01:21:21.451 --> 01:21:25.920
you shouldn't be working.
I was like,
uh,
yeah,
because what have you,

1496
01:21:25.921 --> 01:21:30.810
I've lost a fight.
So now I,
I made what,
$14,000?

1497
01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:34.470
That's how much she made to fight for the world title at one 35 yes.
That's,
well,

1498
01:21:34.471 --> 01:21:38.280
it's,
it's,
it's all public record.
So God damn,
and then that's why I pressing,

1499
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:42.150
so that's why I was still working.
Even when I fight Kiana,
Modo,
I mean,

1500
01:21:42.151 --> 01:21:43.710
I made my money then I was like cake.

1501
01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:46.980
Every single fight I had in the UFC up to the dominant crew,

1502
01:21:46.981 --> 01:21:50.400
spite when I broke my leg and to go towards,
I was like,

1503
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:54.450
I was in Vegas.
It was almost like a vacation for me.
You know when Dana,

1504
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.390
when Matt will call me,
goes,
hey,
uh,

1505
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:58.770
the UFC wants to know if you wanna fight kick,
I'm going where I was like,

1506
01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:01.290
I'll like,
uh,
can I call you right back?

1507
01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:03.360
I need to call work to see if I could stay off please.

1508
01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:07.770
And I will call my boss people hockey now.
[inaudible] um,
so UFC called,

1509
01:22:07.771 --> 01:22:08.581
they want to know is your job,

1510
01:22:08.581 --> 01:22:12.150
what were you doing for them and are working at Papermill and construction.

1511
01:22:12.151 --> 01:22:16.800
So we built,
uh,
basically sonic tubes.
So,
um,
and we also built V board.

1512
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.580
So if this,
uh,
microphone came to you and it was in protection,

1513
01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:23.790
it would be like a v board that would protect it.

1514
01:22:23.850 --> 01:22:26.100
And that's where I was the guy who made it.

1515
01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.650
And let's say you needed two and a half inches or three inches,
four inches,

1516
01:22:28.651 --> 01:22:31.260
five inches,
whatever.
I would take it,
do the math,

1517
01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.220
put it in the computer and sit there and it would go to Juju,
Juju,
and I'll go,

1518
01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:38.220
one,
two,
three,
four.
Okay,

1519
01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:41.420
there's 10 and there you go and do that all day.
And then when I,

1520
01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.910
and not have my phone on me and that will call me,
he goes,
hey doc,

1521
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.010
when somebody want to fight,
and I'm like,
I'll run into the bathroom and like,

1522
01:22:47.011 --> 01:22:48.570
Hey,
what's up man?
He goes,
hey,
you know,

1523
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:53.270
you really want you to fight gear moto on February 5th my debut in UFC 211 I'll

1524
01:22:53.271 --> 01:22:56.450
say,
hey,
let me see if I could day off from work.
I go into my office and I say,

1525
01:22:56.451 --> 01:22:59.190
Hey,
Pete,
what's gone on?
And he goes,
what's up DJ?
And I'm like,
Hey,

1526
01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:03.750
do you think I can have a week off to go fight in Vegas?
He goes,
uh,
yeah,

1527
01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:06.520
let me see if I can work it out.
And I'm like,
all right now to come out as,
hey,

1528
01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.790
I don't know.
Don't say yes.
I don't know.
I don't know yet.
Okay.
And he goes,

1529
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:12.580
I would just let me know.
Okay.
And then sure enough on Bustos.
Yeah,

1530
01:23:12.581 --> 01:23:14.650
you get a week off.
And I was like,
Hey,
I can go.
And he goes,
all right,

1531
01:23:14.651 --> 01:23:17.080
I'll let Sean Shelby,
no,
you could fight.
That's how it was.

1532
01:23:17.150 --> 01:23:20.640
Are you still friends with your boss?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We still hang out with you.
Happy.

1533
01:23:20.890 --> 01:23:24.570
Oh yeah,
he's now,
well,
he said,
he said he would fire me before I quit,
uh,

1534
01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:28.210
fighting and doing a real job because in reality that's what's pay my fucking

1535
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:30.370
bills.
They check was coming every single week.

1536
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:32.440
It would keeping the lights on fighting was not.

1537
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:34.900
So that's why I tell kids all the time,
like,
man,
it would be just like her.

1538
01:23:34.901 --> 01:23:37.540
I was like,
no,
my friend be better than he.
Go to college,
get an education.

1539
01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:41.830
Don't try to put yourself in a,
in a boat to where this is all you have to do.

1540
01:23:41.831 --> 01:23:45.280
You,
you have,
you know,
now it's worked out for me where I can,
I'm starting to,

1541
01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:47.470
you know,
branch out and,
and try to do other things.

1542
01:23:47.471 --> 01:23:51.580
But that's how the reality was.
And so that's why I worked full time.
Well,

1543
01:23:51.581 --> 01:23:54.640
a lot of people believe that if you have a safety net,
you will fall.

1544
01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:59.320
A lot of people think that it's best to not have anything to back up on.

1545
01:23:59.690 --> 01:24:04.340
You need,
you need to fuck a safety net in this sport.
Even in football.
Right.

1546
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:07.990
You see all the time,
you know,
like,
let's look at,
let's say good example.

1547
01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.510
Colin Kaepernick,
he started out amazing.

1548
01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:14.140
At what point in time him a Russell considered,
I don't know who he is.

1549
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.820
Colin Kaepernick keys a,
the San Francisco 40 niners a quarterback very fast.

1550
01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:21.880
He,
at one point in time in his career,
he was up,

1551
01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:25.240
he was talking about the greats with a Russell Wilson.
You know who that is,

1552
01:24:25.241 --> 01:24:27.570
right?
I don't know anybody.
Okay.
Well Russell,

1553
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:30.400
the way I know of a football players,
if they get arrested,
oh,
okay.

1554
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:32.470
Well unfortunately,
so that's totally fine.

1555
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.280
What does it become like so famous like the,

1556
01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:38.410
the somehow or another surpass the sport.
They,
you know,

1557
01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:43.840
you know what I mean?
So a good example,
uh,
uh,
they have to eclipse the sport.

1558
01:24:43.841 --> 01:24:45.130
They have to be like,

1559
01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:49.210
you have to be like an hour and a half or so for me to know who you are or Colby

1560
01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:53.800
Bryant damn is so hard to use it because I got so basically this guy,

1561
01:24:53.801 --> 01:24:57.100
he was really good at one point in his career,
he was fucking killing it,

1562
01:24:57.101 --> 01:24:57.934
running fast.

1563
01:24:57.950 --> 01:25:02.620
I running people trying to get him down and then now he's not doing as well.

1564
01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:07.570
And so let's say he made his money in NFL and let's say he's done,
they kind of,

1565
01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:12.520
you're done.
And he didn't have a college education and he was a smart,

1566
01:25:12.521 --> 01:25:15.100
there's money.
He would basically become a bum if he wasn't smart with his money.

1567
01:25:15.101 --> 01:25:18.670
So that's why I always tell people it's good to come into mixed martial arts

1568
01:25:18.671 --> 01:25:23.671
with a great college education or southern because 90 10 times it might not work

1569
01:25:24.581 --> 01:25:27.430
out for you.
Right.
And that's why I like just tell me what that like people,

1570
01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:31.030
they get discouraged and my,
my,
my,
you know,
promoters are like,
do you,
can't you,

1571
01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:34.210
you need to say this is the view that you want to be like to Ms. Johnson.

1572
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:35.830
You want to fight like me.
Absolutely.

1573
01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:38.860
But you want to make sure you have a college education as something to fall back

1574
01:25:38.861 --> 01:25:41.620
on because,
and that's what Matt told me when I lost the title Dominick Cruz,

1575
01:25:41.621 --> 01:25:45.010
he was like,
I think it might be time for you to go to school,
get the education.

1576
01:25:45.011 --> 01:25:47.410
And I said,
hey man,
I'm tell you straight up bro,

1577
01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:50.680
I'll fucking die in a warehouse if I go back to school.
And he goes,
all right,

1578
01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.910
as long as we're clear at that,
because [inaudible] a warehouse,

1579
01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:55.890
if you go back to school,

1580
01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:59.440
I remember the dying where rather die in and we'd go back to school because

1581
01:25:59.441 --> 01:26:02.620
school wasn't my thing.
I just didn't like school.
I believe in that.

1582
01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:04.070
If I put 10 years in

1583
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:09.070
<v 2>this job that I should be well compensated and you can spend four or five years</v>

1584
01:26:09.111 --> 01:26:10.340
in a college education,

1585
01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:14.060
get your college degree and you go out and try to find job and they're like,
no,

1586
01:26:14.061 --> 01:26:18.290
you're not.
You're not a,
I like the Starbucks effect,
the Starbucks thing.

1587
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:19.880
And have you heard it?
No.

1588
01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:24.860
So some shitty coffee and push out local shops.

1589
01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.790
So it's like if,
uh,
if you,
if me,

1590
01:26:28.791 --> 01:26:31.790
you both went to a cup of Starbucks and if me,

1591
01:26:31.791 --> 01:26:33.170
you apply for a job and you're like,

1592
01:26:33.171 --> 01:26:35.690
I'm Joe Rogan and I have 15 years as a Barista.

1593
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.020
I know how to make coffee from your Cappuccino,
did trouble Shabba,
whatever.

1594
01:26:39.021 --> 01:26:41.870
And I'm like,
I have no coffee spirits whatsoever.
They'll be like,

1595
01:26:42.190 --> 01:26:44.180
I'm gonna take you to meets Johnson.
And people are like,

1596
01:26:44.181 --> 01:26:46.520
why don't you take Joe Rogan has 15 years?
And it's like,
well,

1597
01:26:46.521 --> 01:26:49.670
I had to break his fucking bad habits.
He's not making Starbucks coffee.

1598
01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:54.600
He's not making Starbucks coffee the way I wanted to taste fucking habits.
Yeah.

1599
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:57.260
Talking about brain surgery here,
people,

1600
01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:01.360
Jesus Christ think we have fucking freak.

1601
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.580
So,
but that's the Starbucks.
But,
and I believe in that.

1602
01:27:04.581 --> 01:27:07.130
Like I believe that if a person does his,

1603
01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:10.670
he puts his time in that he should be well compensated to where that's not how

1604
01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:13.610
it is in the world now days.
Hmm.
Maybe what you're saying.

1605
01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:16.820
I see what you're saying.
So,
um,
for you,

1606
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:19.970
the idea of going to school and putting in all that effort without a definite

1607
01:27:19.971 --> 01:27:23.720
reward just wasn't exciting.
And my time and day,
yes.
Right.

1608
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:28.100
But what if there was something that you wanted to do that you had to get

1609
01:27:28.101 --> 01:27:28.934
educated in?

1610
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.590
Like say if you want it to be a journalist or an instance or engineer?
Yeah.

1611
01:27:33.730 --> 01:27:36.630
Where are you literally had to get an education then?
It,

1612
01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:40.220
what was the point in time?
Any seem interesting to me that I would have done it.

1613
01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:44.030
But like I went to school and when I was in high school,
I was doing,
um,

1614
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:47.560
architectural drawing.
I drew up for plans and you know,
if I see it for a,

1615
01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:51.380
I can see,
you know,
the foundation and the j plate and all that stuff.

1616
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:54.860
And I was good at an Ivy Ivy,
Mike,
you know what my final waste for that class?

1617
01:27:54.861 --> 01:27:57.860
I pulled a strip club,
I call it chicken strips and my friend chicken shrimp,

1618
01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.200
chicken strips,
chickens,
Trump.

1619
01:27:59.210 --> 01:28:01.940
You get all the chicken strips you want and give lap dances at the same time.

1620
01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.810
So you free chicken strips?
No,
no,
no,
no shit ain't free.
You got to pay for that.

1621
01:28:05.811 --> 01:28:09.380
Pay for the chicken strips or you can eat chicken strips.

1622
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:11.510
And I had got a strip club.

1623
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:14.330
I had the polls right on slaughterhouse connected to it.

1624
01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:18.890
Where you get your chicken.
No,
no,
but that's not much move.

1625
01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.230
No,
but that was,
that was my,
uh,
that was my thing.

1626
01:28:21.231 --> 01:28:24.850
That was my kind of like my niche,
you know,
I love drawing up floor plans.

1627
01:28:24.851 --> 01:28:29.240
So for strip clubs for that was the final,
now I would have made,

1628
01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:32.450
if I make millions dollars,
if kind of area he might want to invest in this,

1629
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.600
it can mean blow the roof off with it.
What year was this?

1630
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.630
This was in 2005 I think today.

1631
01:28:38.631 --> 01:28:41.060
You probably wouldn't be able to do that in college cause the social justice

1632
01:28:41.061 --> 01:28:44.990
warriors come down on you for wanting to subjugate women.

1633
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:47.600
Horrible establishment.
Oh,

1634
01:28:47.601 --> 01:28:52.310
the patriarchy continues to matress Johnson.
What's to keep women prisoner?

1635
01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.860
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
They get to go home.
Oh yeah.

1636
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.420
Show you a pussy all day for daddy and then you can go home.
I see what's up.

1637
01:28:59.890 --> 01:29:02.580
I see how you work at.
It was very comfortable.
Okay.

1638
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:06.960
It was a comfortable environment with fried chicken or a lot of chicken.

1639
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:10.650
Absolutely.
So what's the piece of paper,
man?
What do you got here?
Oh,
here we go.

1640
01:29:10.651 --> 01:29:13.910
So obviously one of the new things I've been doing,
um,

1641
01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:17.640
is I stream on twitch now and you stream your video games,
right?

1642
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So I have a contract with Xbox one till Reebok came along and fucked everything

1643
01:29:24.841 --> 01:29:29.190
up.
All right,
let me,
yeah,
so yeah,
that,
that,
that was going on.
Um,

1644
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:33.540
obviously you didn't the Reebok,
they'll came in.
So we obviously Xbox,

1645
01:29:33.541 --> 01:29:37.500
they didn't want to be part of,
you know,
there was,
they wanted it,

1646
01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:40.260
that prime spot on paper view or you have fox,

1647
01:29:40.261 --> 01:29:43.480
they actually preferred Fox over pay per view because boxes,
we weren't peers,

1648
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:46.530
millions of these people.
So when that came in they're like,
you know,

1649
01:29:46.531 --> 01:29:49.770
my buddy was like,
well I think this comes across where my,
and I was like,
dude,

1650
01:29:49.890 --> 01:29:52.410
I told her,
understand.
So that's,
that's when they left.

1651
01:29:52.411 --> 01:29:54.330
But I'm still cold to the guy.
I actually just talked to him.

1652
01:29:54.331 --> 01:29:56.820
He's actually gonna be down here,
um,
tonight.
Possibly.

1653
01:29:56.821 --> 01:29:58.790
So you see the latest Reebok fuck up.

1654
01:29:59.510 --> 01:30:03.330
They made her Sanderson all the tee shirts and they wrote Anthony Pettis his

1655
01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:06.600
nickname as the mauler.
Oh,
are you serious?
Yes.
I swear to God,

1656
01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:09.720
it feels like someone inside of Reebok is trying to sabotage the company.

1657
01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:15.480
It's so retarded that the mistakes are so frequent.
And so bad,

1658
01:30:15.481 --> 01:30:18.930
the misspellings of the names over and over and over again.
It's like,

1659
01:30:18.970 --> 01:30:22.650
do you have a single person?
It's paying attention to them there.

1660
01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:24.900
There's a lot of people,
but I understand there could have one person,

1661
01:30:24.901 --> 01:30:27.150
like your job is to make sure before the product goes out,

1662
01:30:27.151 --> 01:30:29.700
you checked the fucking name of the fuck is that guy that said yes to any of

1663
01:30:29.701 --> 01:30:32.580
those shirts.
How about that guy?
Who's that guy?

1664
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:34.610
Who's that guy that looked at those kits?
Who's,

1665
01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:37.020
who's the guy that told them they should wear white shorts?

1666
01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:40.530
Do you know there's blood and dirt and all kinds of shit.
And then hey,

1667
01:30:40.531 --> 01:30:43.200
that's why rock the black,
my frame black.
And it's a good mood.
It's very good.

1668
01:30:43.201 --> 01:30:47.820
It is.
But the whole thing.
So yeah,
that happened with the extra shitty design.

1669
01:30:47.970 --> 01:30:51.510
All the above,
right?
It happens to me.
God dammit.
Um,

1670
01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:54.660
but then when it came to,
uh,
the Xbox healed,

1671
01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:58.850
that kind of fell out and then the Reebok Dale came.
And so now that I'm in,

1672
01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:02.460
I feel like I'm in this point in my career to where people are like,
man,

1673
01:31:02.461 --> 01:31:05.670
you should,
you should make your shirt.
You should do this.
So I was like,

1674
01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:10.110
is that a mighty mouse mighty mouse shirt I've ever done?
I'm always polite.
Dope.

1675
01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:13.460
I like it.
Can I get one of them bitches in a large or an XL?

1676
01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:17.580
They're in production right now,
so we'll get it,
we'll take care of it.
Um,

1677
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:21.480
but now I feel like I'm in a point in my career to where I live.
People say,
oh,

1678
01:31:21.481 --> 01:31:25.520
he's boring.
Um,
he doesn't let it open to open himself up to the fans.

1679
01:31:25.521 --> 01:31:27.120
It's all I like,
you know what?
All right.

1680
01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:30.750
I started streaming a couple of times on twitch and then things went well at

1681
01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:34.440
twitch.
And so now when people are like,
oh,
you don't open it yourself,
friends.

1682
01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:36.270
Like,
Bro,
I post on Twitter,

1683
01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:39.780
will you come ask me any fucking question you want live on twitch?

1684
01:31:39.781 --> 01:31:42.510
And we can talk and make money on twitch.
Right?
Absolutely you can.

1685
01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:45.460
If you get enough subscribers and you get an a followers,
you know,

1686
01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:49.110
average handle so we can get some subscribers.
Twitch handle is a mighty mass,

1687
01:31:49.111 --> 01:31:53.400
Ufc one 25 so you have to be simple.
Yeah,
pretty simple.
So that's it.

1688
01:31:53.401 --> 01:31:56.550
But if you don't know how to do it,
w.
Dot.
Twitch.
Dot.

1689
01:31:56.551 --> 01:32:00.190
TV slash mighty mouse,
UFC one 25

1690
01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:03.460
<v 1>but so that's like my kind of like my side Gig that I like to do,</v>

1691
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.470
interact with my fans,
my fans,

1692
01:32:05.471 --> 01:32:07.930
because I've always played video games with him between training sessions

1693
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:13.300
leading up to Datsun fight second.
That's a you?
I play all types of Shit.

1694
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:18.570
I played dark souls two I play Dota two I play Dota Dota two it's mobile.

1695
01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:23.380
It's a Maudsley online battle arena.
It's crossed fucking weird.
It's,

1696
01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:27.250
I guess when I found twitch I was running my son asleep and I was like,

1697
01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:29.920
this is good.
I was like,
I don't watch TV.

1698
01:32:29.921 --> 01:32:32.020
I watch video games and I started reading.
I was like,

1699
01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.690
watch video games while walking my son asleep.
I'm like,
okay,

1700
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:37.480
now we'll start watching people play video games.
And that's how I fell into it.

1701
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:40.320
Oddly enjoyable watching people play video.
You know what?
I'm not going lie.

1702
01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:44.710
It is,
it is,
it is.
I used to watch people play quake all the time.
I loved it.

1703
01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:49.540
Yeah.
You see,
I mean I think it's a taste.
You have to have a taste for it.
So,
uh,

1704
01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:54.460
but this,
this is from the mighty squad.
My boy is mighty squad.
I,

1705
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:56.800
you know,
my subscribers,
I have to give them perks,
you know,

1706
01:32:56.801 --> 01:33:00.370
to be able to ask the wonderful Joe Rogan sort of questions.
So,
um,

1707
01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:04.890
we already kind of hit hit on this already,
but um,
you,
the first one was,

1708
01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:08.500
starts on the ivy band.
You gave your perspective of it already.
I don't like it,

1709
01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:12.180
but I don't like people cutting too much weight either.
No,

1710
01:33:12.190 --> 01:33:15.430
I don't like either one.
I think you should be able to fight it.
Your own weight.

1711
01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:18.100
I feel like what,
what,
like what do you weigh now?

1712
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:22.270
I weigh one 4,141 is what are you weighing when you're in perfect shape?

1713
01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:24.190
One 41 okay.

1714
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:28.720
I think that's what you should find that and I think everybody should fight at

1715
01:33:28.721 --> 01:33:30.340
the weight that they're in perfect shape.

1716
01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:35.290
I think the weight cut is contrary to what MMA and martial arts should be about

1717
01:33:35.291 --> 01:33:39.640
in the first place.
It shouldn't be about having this.
It's,
it's,
it's like,

1718
01:33:39.670 --> 01:33:42.610
it's like legal cheating.
That's really what it is.

1719
01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:47.470
It's like you're pretending you're 155 pounds when you're really one 75 yep,

1720
01:33:47.530 --> 01:33:51.250
absolutely.
It really is like cheating.
I don't like it.
I think it's dangerous.

1721
01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:54.730
I think it's bad and I also think it's stupid because everyone's doing it.

1722
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:58.210
That's what makes it stupid because like if you were the only one,

1723
01:33:58.211 --> 01:34:02.350
if you really weighed one 75 you were cutting down to one 55 like and everybody

1724
01:34:02.351 --> 01:34:04.590
else was just a natural one 50 fiver for whole,

1725
01:34:04.591 --> 01:34:08.290
you'd have a crazy advantage because you get to balloon up to one 75 fucking,

1726
01:34:08.291 --> 01:34:10.750
everybody's doing it,
so there's zero advantage.

1727
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:14.680
Everybody's just weakening themselves the day before they fight in a fucking

1728
01:34:14.681 --> 01:34:19.300
cage.
To me,
that is so counterintuitive and so stupid,

1729
01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.340
but I don't know how to stop it at this point in time.

1730
01:34:21.341 --> 01:34:22.900
I literally don't think you can.

1731
01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:26.740
I think the only way to stop it is to tell fighters,

1732
01:34:26.741 --> 01:34:30.420
tell everyone to get in shape and have like a massive summit and yeah,

1733
01:34:30.421 --> 01:34:34.060
it was a massive summit and you have everybody have all the fighters.

1734
01:34:34.061 --> 01:34:35.830
You got to pay him to do this too,
by the way.

1735
01:34:35.831 --> 01:34:38.980
You should fucking pay them to do this.
Get him,
you got everybody in shape.

1736
01:34:38.981 --> 01:34:41.950
Give him a paycheck.
Say,
I want you guys to all come to Vegas.

1737
01:34:41.951 --> 01:34:45.340
We're going to measure your water.
We're going to measure your body fat.

1738
01:34:45.370 --> 01:34:47.980
We're gonna measure your actual weight and champions.

1739
01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:50.440
We're going to give you a pass.
We're going to give you every,

1740
01:34:50.441 --> 01:34:53.680
every champion number.
This is the past.
You were still the world title.

1741
01:34:53.681 --> 01:34:58.590
Like say if you're the world title holder at one 25 if you weigh one one,
you,

1742
01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:02.930
you still will go into that fight as the world flyweight champion.

1743
01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:08.180
Okay.
And you will compete against people who were also naturally at that weight

1744
01:35:08.181 --> 01:35:10.580
class.
And I assume it'd be everybody in that weight class.

1745
01:35:10.581 --> 01:35:14.090
I assume it'd be guys like Linacre and Ian Mccall and they'd be a lot of guys

1746
01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.600
that are very similar to you when they're at their optimum weight class,

1747
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:18.320
you know,
uh,

1748
01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.380
obviously between five and six pounds or whatever the hell the difference is.

1749
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:26.620
And then make the weight classes like that and take all these guys and whoever

1750
01:35:27.711 --> 01:35:28.640
it is like Weidman,

1751
01:35:28.641 --> 01:35:31.940
like why been apparently is getting down to like in the one nineties now.

1752
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:35.810
Really that's what I do eight weeks out.
Nobody's cleaned out,
the no boozing,

1753
01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:38.750
cleaned up his diet and he's been really light for this fight.

1754
01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:44.150
Apparently it cut out boozing that 93 [inaudible] 94 was really crazy for a guy

1755
01:35:44.631 --> 01:35:48.710
that has been like well over 200 pounds.
And I think that if,

1756
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:53.570
if this was done and done correctly where you really monitor that people made

1757
01:35:53.571 --> 01:35:56.660
sure there was no cheating and say,
look,
you know Tyron Woodley,

1758
01:35:56.661 --> 01:35:59.120
this is the way you should be fighting at Matt Brown.

1759
01:35:59.121 --> 01:36:03.240
This is the way you should be finding out.
Yup.
And much more weight classes.
Yup.

1760
01:36:03.370 --> 01:36:04.160
And much more.

1761
01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:07.470
And I think they did it with a high school wrestling because they uh,

1762
01:36:07.670 --> 01:36:11.840
they did the hydration test cut.
And I think another thing they could do is,

1763
01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:14.280
you know what you Wayne,
you Wayne and you fighting the same day.

1764
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:17.150
The problem with that though is the guys are still going to cheat.

1765
01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:19.310
They're still going to cut weight and get that ass whooped and then they're

1766
01:36:19.311 --> 01:36:23.210
going to die.
That's her fault.
I was gonna say,
that's our fucking fun.

1767
01:36:24.130 --> 01:36:26.920
It's simple.
It's simple.
It's like when someone's like,
oh,
I didn't make,

1768
01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:30.200
I was like,
dude,
as a fighter we have two jobs and fucking make weight and fight.

1769
01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.960
But if you can't do one of them,
then you shouldn't be able to do the second one.

1770
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:35.240
Right.
So that's why I'm like,
I agree with you.

1771
01:36:35.241 --> 01:36:38.390
I think if they did the hydration test and like,
but I think a lot of people,

1772
01:36:38.391 --> 01:36:40.790
if there was no money on the line,
if you were still going to get paid,

1773
01:36:40.791 --> 01:36:45.500
I think they will be more excited for that.
Yeah,

1774
01:36:45.501 --> 01:36:48.560
I think that it's,
it's really counterintuitive to performance.

1775
01:36:48.561 --> 01:36:51.590
I think when you're asking guys to fight at their best,

1776
01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:55.430
the idea of dehydrating the shit out of yourself the day before the fight,

1777
01:36:55.431 --> 01:36:58.520
like Connor,
before you fought Chad Mendez,
he looked like an aids patient.

1778
01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.020
He looked like a guy who had been like on a ship floating in the ocean for a

1779
01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:06.990
month,
just say eating his own toenails.
Fucking horrible.
It was terrible.
Yeah.

1780
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:12.070
I think that the best way to accomplish that would be too,
you know the hat,

1781
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:14.420
like they have this UFC campus at their building.

1782
01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:20.540
They need to have like the need to have a comprehensive approach to stopping

1783
01:37:20.541 --> 01:37:21.620
weight cutting in the sport.

1784
01:37:21.621 --> 01:37:25.010
And I think one of the best ways to do that is to give guys a lot more options.

1785
01:37:25.011 --> 01:37:26.660
I think Dana doesn't want to do that.

1786
01:37:26.661 --> 01:37:28.490
It thinks the amount of champions they have is not,

1787
01:37:28.491 --> 01:37:31.730
but I wholeheartedly disagree with that.
Well,

1788
01:37:31.731 --> 01:37:35.100
I think they're going to come in more times of how many people you're going to

1789
01:37:35.101 --> 01:37:38.700
sell the moneywise and all that stuff because man,
the paper,

1790
01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:41.720
you're going to be good if the fights are good.
Oh,
that's true.
Yeah.

1791
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:45.170
Fights are good.
Paper views are good,
but people like watching fights.

1792
01:37:45.171 --> 01:37:48.140
They don't give a fuck if there's who's who it was a Buddha.

1793
01:37:48.150 --> 01:37:52.670
When you're the Chirp,
shut the fuck up.
It's good when there's fights,

1794
01:37:52.730 --> 01:37:56.010
the fights are good.
Yeah.
You know it doesn't matter.
Weight class,

1795
01:37:56.011 --> 01:37:59.670
and when you have 85 to two oh five you got a fucking problem.

1796
01:37:59.671 --> 01:38:04.230
When you have two oh five to two 65 days,
he got a giant problem.
That's a g.

1797
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:08.940
Those are two giant problems right there.
20 fucking pounds is 20 t bone stakes.

1798
01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.820
Yeah.
They got 20 teeth on steaks.
You,
you,
you,

1799
01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:13.710
that's the difference in you and the next guy.

1800
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:17.580
Whether you shrivel it out of your body or the pack and on your body.

1801
01:38:17.581 --> 01:38:19.290
That's crazy.
It's crazy.

1802
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.040
This should be every 10 pounds minimum minimum.
Is that,

1803
01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:24.450
how does inboxing more?

1804
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:29.630
Seven like 47 to 54 so there's there and then there's 54 to 60 that's another

1805
01:38:30.181 --> 01:38:33.900
six the 60 to 68 that's eight you know,

1806
01:38:33.930 --> 01:38:36.540
they don't seem to have some 80 75 that's seven.

1807
01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:39.120
I mean there's a lot of fucking weight classes in boxing

1808
01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:40.190
<v 0>sing man,
that happened.</v>

1809
01:38:40.191 --> 01:38:43.640
I'd be fucking two time champion cause I'll go up and to fight it at like one 31

1810
01:38:43.641 --> 01:38:48.130
37 or 38 would be healthy.
When you went 3,130

1811
01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:51.610
<v 1>and you,
they would weigh you,
they would check you that you would be healthy.</v>

1812
01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:55.900
And I think there's a,
there can be a way to cut it out of the sport,

1813
01:38:55.901 --> 01:39:00.250
but I think extreme weight cutting was brought into the sport by wrestling and

1814
01:39:00.251 --> 01:39:03.280
wrestling is figured out how to cut it down substantially.

1815
01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:05.200
I think MMA should try to do the same.

1816
01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:07.730
<v 0>Yeah,
Russell and we can fucking play.
I remember one of my buddies,</v>

1817
01:39:07.731 --> 01:39:11.420
he was like his,
he was in high school and he goes,
I'm doing my hydration test.

1818
01:39:11.421 --> 01:39:12.110
I'm going to,

1819
01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:14.810
I'm going to super hydrate and I'm gonna cut myself and with doctrine are like,

1820
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:15.410
nope,

1821
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:18.590
go back home and fucking cut me and hydrated and we'll let you know that he came

1822
01:39:18.591 --> 01:39:22.970
in and test him and like,
Hey,
you can lose three pounds.
I think you can lose.

1823
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.240
Then you have to rustle up a different weight class at New Year because you just

1824
01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:30.410
get a pan allowance at the new year because they taking consideration of a the

1825
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:33.560
holidays.
But I like your insights.
I agree with you.
All right.
Second question.

1826
01:39:34.190 --> 01:39:37.280
How long do you see yourself commentating?
Uh,
for the UFC?

1827
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:42.270
<v 1>I Dunno.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
My contract is up in August.</v>

1828
01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.230
I might leave in August.
Oh sure.
It's possible.
I don't,
I like,

1829
01:39:46.650 --> 01:39:49.680
I like doing shit that scares me.
Yeah,
he's awesome.
He goes,

1830
01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:54.120
I'm in fucking fun of kind of Greg and kill me right now.
No,
I mean I like,

1831
01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:55.410
I like doing stuff to like,

1832
01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:59.130
I like taking chances in that like I like walking away from things I liked.

1833
01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:00.053
I liked doing that.

1834
01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:03.540
I like experiencing new things are going to think you open up new doors,

1835
01:40:03.541 --> 01:40:05.520
your mind starts with firing a different way.

1836
01:40:05.521 --> 01:40:09.030
I'm not a big fan of doing the same shit over and over and over again.

1837
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:11.850
Like when I do stand up comedy I have to go to different places.

1838
01:40:11.851 --> 01:40:15.210
I like I have the comedy store that's like my main spot but I like to go to like

1839
01:40:15.211 --> 01:40:16.080
weird spots.

1840
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.260
I like to do like I'll do a weird open mic night in the middle of fucking

1841
01:40:19.261 --> 01:40:22.080
nowhere.
I I I think it's really important.

1842
01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:26.630
I like to go to new places.
I like to travel.
I like to,
uh,

1843
01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:30.330
I like to just get in my car and drive places cause you get out of my car and

1844
01:40:30.331 --> 01:40:32.280
walk around and check out places.

1845
01:40:32.281 --> 01:40:36.630
I think you got to experience different things in life and I like to plan those

1846
01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:40.200
things out and I've been doing the UFC for a long time.

1847
01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:45.030
I will never stop being a UFC fan.
Oh that's,
that's not going to happen.

1848
01:40:45.031 --> 01:40:45.870
I love the sport,

1849
01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:49.020
but this is probably going to come a time where I don't do commentary anymore

1850
01:40:49.021 --> 01:40:52.470
and it might be sooner than later or I might not be in August.
My role around,

1851
01:40:52.471 --> 01:40:55.540
and I might say,
know Amanda,
I fucking love this.
Let's just keep doing this.

1852
01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:59.500
But it might not too.
He might not show to UC one 94.
You were like,
fuck it baby.

1853
01:40:59.501 --> 01:41:03.070
I'm saying home.
I definitely,
definitely,
that's not going to happen.

1854
01:41:03.071 --> 01:41:05.560
I'm going to be there for that.
I'm 100%.
I love it,
man.

1855
01:41:05.730 --> 01:41:06.850
It's not that I don't love it.

1856
01:41:06.851 --> 01:41:10.650
It's just that I like doing a lot of other shit too.
Yeah,
absolutely.
I,
I'm a,

1857
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:13.030
I probably have something wrong with me.

1858
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:17.830
Like I probably have like some OCD or add or something,
whatever,
you know,

1859
01:41:17.831 --> 01:41:22.240
if I was a kid they'd probably put me on some shit.
But,
um,
I think that,
uh,

1860
01:41:22.241 --> 01:41:24.250
I just like experiencing different things.

1861
01:41:24.251 --> 01:41:28.300
I'm constantly trying to absorb new information.
Um,

1862
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:32.200
I'm always watching documentaries and reading books and reading things.

1863
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:34.300
Like I like new stuff all the time,

1864
01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:38.320
so I don't think that my love for MMA will ever die off,

1865
01:41:38.650 --> 01:41:42.700
but it's very possible that I won't want to do it as a career sometime in the

1866
01:41:42.701 --> 01:41:45.610
future.
All right.
Okay.
And that's,
that's good.
That's the answer.
All right.

1867
01:41:45.611 --> 01:41:49.810
Third one.
What is your favorite memory in the UFC?
I don't have one.

1868
01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:53.620
I definitely don't have one.
I have too many awesome memories.
There's too many.

1869
01:41:53.621 --> 01:41:58.621
It's an to be able to do that for the past 13 yeah,

1870
01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:03.040
I guess 13 years.
It's been amazing.
It's a,
it's a great job,
man.

1871
01:42:03.041 --> 01:42:06.430
It's incredible to go there and watch the all time,

1872
01:42:06.431 --> 01:42:11.290
best combat sports athletes in the world,
in mixed martial arts,

1873
01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:12.124
compete,

1874
01:42:12.190 --> 01:42:16.780
and to be right there for most of the best fights ever and to call them,

1875
01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:20.110
you know,
I mean,
I'm,
I'm extremely honored,

1876
01:42:20.170 --> 01:42:23.770
so I don't have any one perfect memory.

1877
01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:26.110
I just have a lot of great ones.
Okay.
All right.

1878
01:42:27.370 --> 01:42:29.800
What is your favorite NNA fight to call?

1879
01:42:29.890 --> 01:42:33.220
What has been your best MMA fight to call when you,
again,
I don't,

1880
01:42:33.221 --> 01:42:36.250
I don't think I have one.
I'm sorry I even ask that fucking question,

1881
01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:39.220
but it's all right.
I just don't,
I don't think I have one.

1882
01:42:39.221 --> 01:42:44.190
There's been some amazing ones,
man,
like Dan Henderson versus Shogun,
but,

1883
01:42:44.410 --> 01:42:46.450
but that's for all the wrong reasons.

1884
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:51.460
They're just beating the fuck out of each other where it's like your fight

1885
01:42:51.461 --> 01:42:54.490
against Dodson was like for all the right reasons,
you know?

1886
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:58.110
I think I like both of those kinds of fights.
Yeah.
If I'm going to be the look,

1887
01:42:58.111 --> 01:43:01.360
they're going to do that shit.
Whether I'm there or not,
you know,
I'm not the dad.

1888
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:05.620
I'm not the boss.
I'm not the fucking King of the world.
They're going to do it.

1889
01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:08.080
I can't stop them because some asshole wants to jump over.

1890
01:43:08.081 --> 01:43:12.310
The Grand Canyon is fucking dirt bike and I'm there.
I'm going to watch.

1891
01:43:12.311 --> 01:43:15.910
I'm not going to go.
I'm out of here.
This is stupid.
I'm going to go,
let me see.

1892
01:43:15.911 --> 01:43:19.750
This dude lands on his head.
I'm going to watch.
I don't necessarily

1893
01:43:21.650 --> 01:43:26.050
see it.
I don't want to hear the crunch of his skull.
He didn't get overhang,

1894
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:30.760
you know,
when he misses the third flip.
But I don't,
you know,
I can't,

1895
01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:36.240
I can't stop someone from fighting like Chico Riveras and John Linacre when,

1896
01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:38.050
yeah.
When,
um,

1897
01:43:38.650 --> 01:43:43.180
when Francisco Rivera fought Jon Linacre and those guys went to pardon me,

1898
01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.560
was because I really like for instance,
go,
I wanted to go,
what the fuck are you?

1899
01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:52.030
Don't do that man.
Don't do that.
Move,
kick his legs.

1900
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:56.660
He'll throw combinations.
Catch him with his hands down,
winging from the hips.

1901
01:43:56.870 --> 01:44:01.190
Don't stand right in front of him and do his shit.
But the other part of me goes,

1902
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:05.060
oh shit,
this is crazy.
I mean,

1903
01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:08.710
part of me loves it.
Part of me loves it.
And pardon me,
the,
the,

1904
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:12.020
the part who appreciates an artist like yourself.

1905
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:15.740
I don't like it because I don't want more people to emulate that because I don't

1906
01:44:15.741 --> 01:44:20.290
want to see more people all fucked up.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Alright.
Uh,

1907
01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:25.310
favor versus Tj Dillashaw faber versus Tj Dillashaw.
Man,

1908
01:44:25.311 --> 01:44:29.330
there's a lot of emotions involved with those two fight,
Huh?
I don't know.

1909
01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:36.420
I,
I have,
I have very,
I'm very torn on that.

1910
01:44:36.450 --> 01:44:37.740
I like both of those guys,

1911
01:44:37.741 --> 01:44:42.741
but I'm a big fan of loyalty and I do not like when someone just gets up and

1912
01:44:45.691 --> 01:44:48.660
leaves a camp that has been so good to them,

1913
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:53.130
like Alpha male has been.
But I also,

1914
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:56.730
I also feel like with a guy like Tj,

1915
01:44:56.970 --> 01:45:00.430
he had this deep connection to Duane Ludwig.
Yeah.

1916
01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.800
And Duane Ludwig has done some incredible shit for his career without a doubt.

1917
01:45:04.801 --> 01:45:06.480
No doubt about it.
And I think Dwayne,

1918
01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.550
I've worked with Dwayne before and I've watched Dwayne,

1919
01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:12.090
a trained fighter watch drain.
Dwayne train TJ.

1920
01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:14.280
I've watched him work with Brendan Schaub.

1921
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:18.720
He's held pads for me and gone over his philosophy because I was like,
well,

1922
01:45:18.721 --> 01:45:21.870
tell me what you teach guys.
How do you do this?
How do you set things up?

1923
01:45:21.871 --> 01:45:26.130
And I'm very impressed with his,
he's completely fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1924
01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:29.160
But in the best way for a trainer,
because he's obsessed.

1925
01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:34.190
Like the day that TJ fought Barao I had lunch with Dwayne and it was hilarious

1926
01:45:34.441 --> 01:45:38.250
because it was me and a bunch of my friends were all sitting down in,
um,

1927
01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:40.980
I don't know what's the MGM or Mandalay Bay,
whichever one.

1928
01:45:41.130 --> 01:45:43.560
We're all sitting down having lunch and uh,

1929
01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:47.160
Tj didn't give up or a Duane Dingo fuck who else was at the table.

1930
01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:49.800
All he was like,
it was like,
basically what's going to happen,

1931
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:52.110
this is to fight the waste his way.
He's going to grow down.
He's like,

1932
01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:54.590
Brown always has a tendency to lean to his left as soon as you leave just to

1933
01:45:54.591 --> 01:45:56.510
have teachers,
I'm gonna be there,
he's going to be the right,
but blah,
blah,
blah,

1934
01:45:56.511 --> 01:45:57.090
blah,
blah,
blah.

1935
01:45:57.090 --> 01:45:59.370
He's going to do the overhead rate is going to be big kid fight and he's like,

1936
01:45:59.371 --> 01:46:02.610
he's rattling off things.
I could have been,
I'm trying to keep up with them.

1937
01:46:02.850 --> 01:46:06.000
I'm like drinking coffee just to keep up with his words.

1938
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:10.440
But he's obsessed.
He's obsessed with making guys better.

1939
01:46:10.590 --> 01:46:14.940
And I think TJ recognizes that and I think that personality wise,

1940
01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:19.830
Dwayne and Faber just did not,
it just clashed.

1941
01:46:19.831 --> 01:46:23.760
It didn't work out.
Depends on,
I mean I don't,
I like what you're rye a lot.

1942
01:46:23.761 --> 01:46:27.210
I think you're right is awesome.
I love him as a person and I like Duane a lot,

1943
01:46:27.211 --> 01:46:30.000
so I don't know who the fuck is.
Right.
And who the fuck is wrong?

1944
01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:33.990
I literally have no idea.
Right?
So I don't know what really went down,

1945
01:46:34.110 --> 01:46:38.280
but I know it didn't work out.
But I know that for a Danny Castillo,

1946
01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:40.440
and I know for a Tj,

1947
01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:43.740
having Duane coach them has been a huge benefit.

1948
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:46.380
I don't like that Tj took off,

1949
01:46:46.381 --> 01:46:50.190
but I don't know the specifics and I don't also don't know what farm is offering

1950
01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:53.830
them.
Muscle farm.
I don't understand muscle farm.

1951
01:46:54.930 --> 01:46:57.240
This is what an understand those fucking dudes,

1952
01:46:57.241 --> 01:47:01.140
if you look at the financial reports,
those guys are hemorrhaging money.

1953
01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:05.040
They're hemorrhaging money.
So I don't,
I'm not sure what's going on there.

1954
01:47:05.041 --> 01:47:08.820
It might be some rich dude like that dynamic fastener guy that was like

1955
01:47:08.821 --> 01:47:09.421
sponsoring.

1956
01:47:09.421 --> 01:47:14.110
Everybody might be some dude who owns muscle farm that just loves MMA.

1957
01:47:14.111 --> 01:47:16.880
I mean maybe their products are awesome and they're just like,

1958
01:47:16.890 --> 01:47:19.800
they really believe in them and they're building up the company and this is part

1959
01:47:19.801 --> 01:47:21.360
of their strategy.
I don't know.

1960
01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:24.900
But they're throwing a lot of fucking money at a lot of really good fighters.

1961
01:47:24.901 --> 01:47:28.430
They got Matt Brown's over there,
he's moved the whole family out there.
Yup.

1962
01:47:28.710 --> 01:47:33.370
And I hope they don't go under,
you know,
cause when it,
you know,

1963
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:35.760
we've looked,
cause I am a part owner of on it.

1964
01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.940
So we've looked at the muscle farm business model and we're like,
um,

1965
01:47:40.150 --> 01:47:42.390
nothing like what the fuck is going on here?

1966
01:47:42.391 --> 01:47:45.780
I mean maybe we're not seeing something.
I mean maybe I'm missing something.

1967
01:47:45.781 --> 01:47:48.210
Maybe there's some revenue that we're not aware of,

1968
01:47:48.211 --> 01:47:51.670
but as it's been explained to me there,
they've made a sec,

1969
01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:53.580
let's just put it this way.
In a positive spin,

1970
01:47:53.730 --> 01:47:58.020
they've made a significant investment in that gym and significant investment in

1971
01:47:58.021 --> 01:48:01.920
MMA and a significant investment in their company that I don't,

1972
01:48:01.921 --> 01:48:04.380
I don't know necessarily whether,
or not us,
but profitable yet.

1973
01:48:04.410 --> 01:48:06.900
I'm obviously talking out of my ass because I'm not a financial guy,

1974
01:48:07.230 --> 01:48:10.080
but I like what they're doing and,
and his terms of,

1975
01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:14.550
in terms of building this giant team in terms of putting together this world

1976
01:48:14.551 --> 01:48:17.910
class facility and their facility is super impressive.
I mean,

1977
01:48:17.911 --> 01:48:21.060
I've seen the gym that they put together and he's fucking amazing man.

1978
01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:24.530
It's awesome.
I have a dream of doing something like that some day.

1979
01:48:24.531 --> 01:48:28.560
I think that would be great if I do ever leave,
uh,
commentating for the UFC.

1980
01:48:28.770 --> 01:48:33.770
One of the things fucking for sure I want to do is open up a big gym with guys

1981
01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:38.670
like Eddie Bravo and get in some,
you know,
great striking coaches and you know,

1982
01:48:38.671 --> 01:48:42.300
and just do it for the enjoyment.
[inaudible] UFC,
you're like,
all right,
come on.

1983
01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:45.380
Come on.
They didn't got,
there you go.
You're off.
Wanted people see I don't,

1984
01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:49.560
I maybe,
but I doubt it.
I will be watching from the sidelines,
you know,

1985
01:48:49.710 --> 01:48:54.100
as one of the hardest things for me is to commentate on people that I like.
Yeah.

1986
01:48:54.450 --> 01:48:57.180
Like Rhonda.
Rhonda is a friend of mine and Rhonda,

1987
01:48:57.181 --> 01:49:00.360
when she got fucked up by Holly,
you know,
I,
I coach,

1988
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:02.670
I commentated that fight just like I would people,

1989
01:49:02.671 --> 01:49:06.330
I don't even know you're doing your job,
but I,
but I do know her,
you know,

1990
01:49:06.331 --> 01:49:10.040
and I like her a lot and when she got head kicked I was like,
Ooh,

1991
01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.570
you're a piece.
Afterwards I was like,
well,
you know,
the best part about it,

1992
01:49:15.571 --> 01:49:19.930
that was filmed by John Wayne Parr who was a multiple time world Moy Thai

1993
01:49:19.931 --> 01:49:21.960
champion is at 10 time world Muay Thai champion.

1994
01:49:21.961 --> 01:49:25.530
He's a good buddy of mine who's with his young daughter,
who's also a fighter,

1995
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:28.350
is young daughters,
a fighter.
And she's a huge Ronda fan.
And I,

1996
01:49:28.530 --> 01:49:30.310
not only did I get them tickets,
I,

1997
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:34.920
I pulled them from their seats and had them sit behind me in the production

1998
01:49:34.921 --> 01:49:39.720
seats.
So they get quite there.
So when when she got head kicked,

1999
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:43.100
I turned to look at John and John's got his iPhone,
apple,
my,

2000
01:49:43.130 --> 01:49:47.640
Oh and that video has got like fucking millions of hits because it's,

2001
01:49:47.641 --> 01:49:48.160
it's so

2002
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.000
<v 2>crazy to watch that reaction right after that kick.</v>

2003
01:49:52.001 --> 01:49:57.001
But that was a hard one man because I care about her a lot and I also don't

2004
01:49:57.251 --> 01:50:02.160
agree with a lot of like her training and their coaching and all that stuff.

2005
01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:05.860
I like if I,
if I,
I mean who knows when the dust settles,

2006
01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:08.800
I would tell him to go to Matt Hume.
There's two people.

2007
01:50:08.801 --> 01:50:12.820
I told her go to mad humor for Rasa Hobby.
Those are the two guys Hofeld cord.

2008
01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:15.550
Daryl was very good.
And then that must be close to her.
Yes.

2009
01:50:15.551 --> 01:50:16.750
Matt speaks very highly of him.

2010
01:50:16.751 --> 01:50:19.750
He was like me and like me and my friends always talk about like if we,

2011
01:50:19.751 --> 01:50:23.620
if that was like,
hey guys,
I'm done.
I'm done coaching.
He,
we were like,

2012
01:50:23.621 --> 01:50:26.380
where would you go?
And I was like,
you know what,
that might be rifle could there.

2013
01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:29.400
I heard they sparked pretty hard there so they got to stay to yourself.
But I do.

2014
01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:33.730
I was like,
hey guys,
can I just train her?
I don't want to spar hard.
I told you,

2015
01:50:33.731 --> 01:50:35.440
I was like,
dude,
I don't need any spa hard.
I was like,

2016
01:50:35.441 --> 01:50:37.810
I'm pretty sure when I get in the octagon and pull the fucking trigger,

2017
01:50:37.811 --> 01:50:39.550
you ain't got to worry about that.
Don't worry about that.

2018
01:50:39.551 --> 01:50:43.750
You've been pulling the trigger for a long time.
But it's like,

2019
01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:47.710
you know that's that old shoot to buck style.
Those old habits die hard.

2020
01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:50.380
Those guys used to beat the fuck out of each other for copies.

2021
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:55.360
You ever heard that story?
I did with Silva,
Shogun Shogun and Vandelay Silva.

2022
01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:58.270
They brought over a puppy and whoever could not go out,

2023
01:50:58.271 --> 01:51:02.500
like shogun apparently had a puppy for sale and Vandelay didn't want to pay as

2024
01:51:02.501 --> 01:51:04.960
much as show wanted for it.
So Vangelis said,

2025
01:51:04.961 --> 01:51:08.260
if I knock you out I don't have to pay,
but if you knock me out I'll pay.

2026
01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.380
And Vandelay knocked him out when when Shogun woke up,

2027
01:51:11.381 --> 01:51:15.640
Vandelay was holding a puppy.
You seeing my friend,
that's some cold shit.

2028
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.600
But I'd also think there was a lot of ignorance involved.
Yeah.

2029
01:51:18.650 --> 01:51:21.410
I don't think they understood head trauma,
you know?

2030
01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:25.450
And I think there was a point in time to where now I think everybody's trying to

2031
01:51:25.451 --> 01:51:29.230
understand like x thing,
but she had shot thing.
I totally respect what he did,

2032
01:51:29.231 --> 01:51:29.741
where he was like,

2033
01:51:29.741 --> 01:51:33.850
I need to go to beat with somebody who's going to put 110% into me.

2034
01:51:33.851 --> 01:51:37.510
And that's when Wayne Ludwig team,
apple,
they've done an amazing job and,
and,

2035
01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:42.100
and still doing a good job.
Try to keep that team together.
But at the same time,

2036
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:43.210
this is a business.

2037
01:51:43.210 --> 01:51:45.890
We're all trying to make money and then a day you're right favor,

2038
01:51:45.891 --> 01:51:48.570
he's take care of.
We're going to see if you ever becomes a champion or not.
He,

2039
01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:51.610
he's done did it.
He's,
I told you right from in the spring,
I was like,
dude,

2040
01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:55.030
you might never be the champion but you will probably be the most lucrative

2041
01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:59.470
successful one 35 pound there to walk this earth.
But he's a very smart guy.

2042
01:51:59.471 --> 01:52:03.400
Business wants to,
he's really good at flipping houses.
You know,
he's a,
he's,

2043
01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:07.930
he owns a a few houses,
buys them and sells them.
He's a smart dude.
Very,

2044
01:52:07.931 --> 01:52:12.280
very clever guy.
Then I think with Tj he saw that if he went with Duane Ludwig,

2045
01:52:13.090 --> 01:52:13.871
what she shit,

2046
01:52:13.871 --> 01:52:18.430
cause Dominick Cruz ain't no fucking joke that he is going to be able to keep on

2047
01:52:18.431 --> 01:52:22.770
being five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine,
10 town made.

2048
01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:27.250
Here's the counter to that was like how much of how good he got was sparring

2049
01:52:27.251 --> 01:52:29.350
with Joseph Benevidez Pharma,
Chad Mendez,

2050
01:52:29.351 --> 01:52:33.030
sparring with lance Parmer sparring with Cody Garbrandt,
you know,

2051
01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:36.940
being in the gym with those fucking monsters that are his weight class every
day.

2052
01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:39.190
Yeah.
That's also a big factor.
That's true.

2053
01:52:39.191 --> 01:52:43.180
I think the combination of Duane and them was substance.
You can show that,

2054
01:52:43.630 --> 01:52:45.600
try those tools out on them.
Um,

2055
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:50.270
<v 1>don't think fucking man,
whatever the reason,
they couldn't work well,
you know,</v>

2056
01:52:50.271 --> 01:52:52.280
there's nothing perfect in this world,
you know,

2057
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:55.950
but I have to say my favorite quote by t you go shop.
I was like,
Shit,
team up.
No.

2058
01:52:55.951 --> 01:52:58.550
Then you've got a fucking physical therapist.
I was like,

2059
01:52:58.850 --> 01:53:03.770
I don't have a physical therapist.
Mussel farms tickets to the next level.

2060
01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:08.480
All right,
number six.
How did you get into broadcasts for the UFC?

2061
01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:13.910
Dana White.
Talk me into it.
No desire.
Really zero czar.
He's like,
dude,

2062
01:53:13.911 --> 01:53:18.020
how much people eat shit for a living?
Before that I worked for the UFC.

2063
01:53:18.021 --> 01:53:19.520
I worked for the UFC in 97.

2064
01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:23.040
I worked for the 90 UFC in 2000 and uh,

2065
01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:26.960
well 90 1997 UFC 12.
Okay.
Not 2012,
uh,

2066
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:29.960
1997 in Dothan,
Alabama.

2067
01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:34.070
It was the first UFC where they were supposed to be in New York.

2068
01:53:34.071 --> 01:53:37.760
There's supposed to be in buffalo and they moved it down to a,
to Dothan.

2069
01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:40.370
So I did that and I did it for about two years.

2070
01:53:40.371 --> 01:53:44.320
Then I decided to quit and when I decided to quit and,
um,

2071
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:49.280
I was very content not doing it and I was excited when zoo for purchased it.

2072
01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:52.730
And so then they had their big pay per view event.

2073
01:53:52.731 --> 01:53:56.540
Longbow I was before I started working for them where Tito Ortiz fought Vladimir

2074
01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:58.430
Matt,
you Shango was right after September 11th.

2075
01:53:58.431 --> 01:54:00.500
It was a big event in Vegas and I'm,

2076
01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:05.210
me and Eddie Bravo went down for it and I became friends with Dana White and uh,

2077
01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:06.350
you know,
Dana and I,

2078
01:54:06.351 --> 01:54:09.170
we just talked about fights we would get together and you know,

2079
01:54:09.230 --> 01:54:11.400
he knew me from fear factor and that's how he,

2080
01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:14.780
they were trying to get celebrities to come to the fights and so they would give

2081
01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:17.270
you tickets and shit like that.
And I was just telling them like,

2082
01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.430
what about this guy you know about this guy?
What about that guy?

2083
01:54:19.431 --> 01:54:22.210
You ever see this guy fighting?
You never see shadow.
You ever watch Trudeau,

2084
01:54:22.370 --> 01:54:25.320
you know,
started rattling off all this different shit.
He was like,
I need it.

2085
01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:28.580
So he started going,
why don't you do commentary?
And it was like,
fuck dude,

2086
01:54:28.581 --> 01:54:33.300
I don't want to do commerce busy,
man.
I heard you stand up.
I'm,
I'm very,
um,
I was,

2087
01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:36.990
I had two gigs back then too.
I was doing the UFC or I was doing,
um,

2088
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:40.640
fear factor and I was hosting the man show and I was doing standup comedy.

2089
01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:43.590
So I've always done like our gang of different Shit,
you know,

2090
01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:46.850
I was always just try to,
I just don't know.
There's the OCD part.

2091
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:51.410
I was just really,
and so then Dana asked me to do it.
So UFC 37 and a half,

2092
01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:53.300
which was I think at 2002,

2093
01:54:53.660 --> 01:54:58.450
that was my first ever UFC that accommodated on his chocolate Dell versus

2094
01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:02.630
Vituro.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
And it was on a best damn sports show.

2095
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:06.670
Remember Best Damn sports show.
I do.
Yeah.
They had it.
Uh,
they,
they,

2096
01:55:06.710 --> 01:55:11.090
they aired the UFC on best damn sports show.
And so I watched a,

2097
01:55:11.091 --> 01:55:13.600
I commentated on that.
And then,
uh,

2098
01:55:13.730 --> 01:55:18.620
Dana tried to get me to do all of them.
And then I said,
no,
listen man.

2099
01:55:18.621 --> 01:55:23.300
I go,
you know,
how about this?
I go,
I'll,
I'll do,
I'll do,
I'll do some commentary.

2100
01:55:23.301 --> 01:55:25.820
I go,
just get my friends tickets to the fights and I'll do commentary.

2101
01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:30.560
So that's what we'd like to first.
I think like 10 or 15 shows.

2102
01:55:30.561 --> 01:55:33.530
I didn't get paid at all.
Wow.
I didn't even ask for money.
That's good.

2103
01:55:33.531 --> 01:55:37.030
Like I didn't want any money.
I go,
that's fucking skip.
Fly me out there.

2104
01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:40.110
Get my friends tickets.
So you know,
like Eddie and a couple of other,

2105
01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:43.170
my buddies from Jujitsu,
we'd come and they were fans.
We'd,

2106
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:46.020
they would sit in the front row and watch the fights and then afterward we go

2107
01:55:46.021 --> 01:55:50.090
eat steak and relax and take time to take care of my book.

2108
01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:54.030
This is fun.
We had a good time and I was like,
this is great.
To be able to was,

2109
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:55.500
we were always big UFC fans.

2110
01:55:55.501 --> 01:55:59.610
One of the things we would always says what the UFC really needs is some crazy

2111
01:55:59.611 --> 01:56:04.380
millionaires who have all this money in the world who are willing to spend a ton

2112
01:56:04.381 --> 01:56:08.250
of money to promote the sport.
And if they did that,
man,
the sport is so exciting.

2113
01:56:08.251 --> 01:56:11.970
It could really be huge.
And so that was our thought process behind it.

2114
01:56:11.971 --> 01:56:16.670
And it's almost like we manifested the Fertittas and the Fertittas out of

2115
01:56:16.671 --> 01:56:21.540
nowhere became these guys that were these like super millionaire billionaire

2116
01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:26.250
characters that were fans of the sport.
And so from 2002 on,

2117
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:30.180
but I've been doing it.
Nice,
man.
Love it.
Love it.
That you're there.
All right.

2118
01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:36.090
Have you ever commentated hi.
No.
Oh,
there you go.

2119
01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:40.650
That's probably per like a little lingering.
I go,

2120
01:56:40.651 --> 01:56:44.220
I wouldn't have passed the test,
but um,

2121
01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:49.380
I never do now.
Um,
maybe that was like really early on,
but um,

2122
01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:53.940
like in the early two thousands,
but no,
I'm sober for all of them.
Good.
Good.

2123
01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:57.390
All right.
Here it is in the hangover thing.
I've never hung over anymore.

2124
01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:00.260
That was early,
early,
early,
early days.
Yeah.

2125
01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:04.140
And only a couple of times I remember my brain just wasn't firing that good.

2126
01:57:04.141 --> 01:57:07.290
I was like,
Ooh,
this is not good.
Mike's like,
Joe,
you're all right.
He goes,
yeah,

2127
01:57:07.291 --> 01:57:10.520
yeah,
yeah.
Just,
he never says that.
It's always me and him.

2128
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:15.710
Okay.
Look,
I don't know,
Joe,
you're not fired.
Um,

2129
01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:20.400
this one is kind of two part,
uh,
thoughts that people are going to bellow,

2130
01:57:20.401 --> 01:57:23.370
tour and testing the free,
uh,
free agency market.

2131
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:28.140
I think we need more competition and I think it'd be great if bell becomes
giant.

2132
01:57:28.141 --> 01:57:31.710
The first thing it should ditch that stupid fucking name.
I think Bella to it.

2133
01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:35.250
What's it?
What is a bellatore tracks planning.
That's your fucking gardener.

2134
01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:40.580
Try to explain that to your boss or what's tour it's I may.

2135
01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:45.150
What does like what does that mean?
What does MMA,
it's like the UFC.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.

2136
01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:47.640
Nobody else's the fuck that means they should call it spike TV.

2137
01:57:47.641 --> 01:57:49.260
Mixed martial arts.
If they were smart,

2138
01:57:49.590 --> 01:57:51.870
they would just call it mixed martial arts.
When you watch boxing,

2139
01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.390
he don't give a fuck if it's don king or Bob Arum are golden boy boxing.

2140
01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:59.550
It's boxing and that's what MMA should be.
I mean,
what,

2141
01:57:59.551 --> 01:58:03.450
right now we've got this NFL situation where like when you watch football,

2142
01:58:03.570 --> 01:58:05.940
you're really watching the NFL.
There's no other options.

2143
01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:10.020
You got Canadian football,
which is fucking ridiculous war.

2144
01:58:10.050 --> 01:58:12.120
You've got the NFL.
That's it.
Yup.

2145
01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:15.360
And that's the situation right now we have with MMA,

2146
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:17.970
even though I worked with you,
I've seen I love the UFC.

2147
01:58:17.971 --> 01:58:20.160
I don't think that is a good model.

2148
01:58:20.370 --> 01:58:22.170
I don't think it's a good model for the athletes.

2149
01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:25.530
I think the best model for the athletes is the model that boxing has.

2150
01:58:25.770 --> 01:58:30.450
And that's why when you look at how much money the top boxers make,

2151
01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:35.160
um,
the difference between how much the promotion makes and how much the athletes

2152
01:58:35.161 --> 01:58:36.110
make theirs,

2153
01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:40.470
it's sided more towards the athletes in boxing than it is in MMA.

2154
01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:44.890
And think with a company like Bella tour,
you know,

2155
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:47.470
they're backed by Viacom.
Yeah.

2156
01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:52.540
I think the good thing about something like Viacom is at Viacom is this

2157
01:58:53.230 --> 01:58:55.450
multibillion dollar huge multimedia company.

2158
01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:59.350
The bad thing about it is there a business and they're not in the business of

2159
01:58:59.351 --> 01:59:01.090
MMA.
The UFC,

2160
01:59:01.091 --> 01:59:05.650
Dana white and the Fertittas are huge mix martial arts fans.

2161
01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:10.680
They love the fights and they have no plans on bailing on the UFC.

2162
01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:13.900
It's a very profitable venture.
They make tons of money.

2163
01:59:13.901 --> 01:59:17.260
It's a huge success and they built it to be that giant success.

2164
01:59:17.261 --> 01:59:20.890
So they deserve everything.
They get.
Viacom's does not feel that way.

2165
01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:22.690
Viacom is in it to win it.

2166
01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:25.450
They're in it to make money and the moment it stops making money,

2167
01:59:25.451 --> 01:59:27.670
they're going to cast it aside the same way they did glory.

2168
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:32.530
They got rid of glass.
Right?
That's right.
That was a huge fuck up on their part.

2169
01:59:32.770 --> 01:59:36.640
That was a gigantic fuck up because first of all,

2170
01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:40.760
high level kickboxing is some of the most exciting shit you could ever watch it.

2171
01:59:40.761 --> 01:59:45.010
It's super,
super exciting.
And for them to bail on that,

2172
01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:47.290
I just think it's ridiculous.
I just think it doesn't do,

2173
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:50.500
it's so short sighted and I think their promotions sucked.

2174
01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:54.160
I don't think they did a good job of,
of getting people excited about it.

2175
01:59:54.161 --> 01:59:58.150
I don't think the promotion like the uh,
the actual,
um,
uh,

2176
01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:00.280
the,
the actual,

2177
02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:03.850
the way was produced to production of it was that good.

2178
02:00:03.851 --> 02:00:07.570
It's just like what you have is an amazing product.
You've got Nikki hold skin,

2179
02:00:07.571 --> 02:00:11.590
you got,
you know Joseph Vaults Illini,
you got Raymond Daniels,

2180
02:00:11.591 --> 02:00:14.470
you've got all these wild ass kickboxers,
you've got Rico Verhoeven,

2181
02:00:14.471 --> 02:00:16.570
you've got amazing,
amazing talent.

2182
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:19.450
You just got to figure out how to promote and put the fucking money and make

2183
02:00:19.451 --> 02:00:22.030
that money,
put the money in and get the return.

2184
02:00:22.210 --> 02:00:23.500
That's not the business they're in.

2185
02:00:23.650 --> 02:00:27.850
They're in the business of profitable promotions,
profitable television shows,

2186
02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:32.590
profitable productions,
whatever they put together,
they want it to make money.

2187
02:00:32.830 --> 02:00:37.510
And when you start seeing those 200,000 views,
300,000 views,
they're like,

2188
02:00:37.511 --> 02:00:40.450
fuck this.
And they tried that one paper view,

2189
02:00:40.451 --> 02:00:44.560
which is an extreme disaster ever.
That was so poorly planned,

2190
02:00:44.590 --> 02:00:46.360
so poorly planned.
First of all,

2191
02:00:46.361 --> 02:00:51.361
you don't have a fucking paper view where you show them hours of free shit first

2192
02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:56.740
and then you make them watch the paper view.
It's like that's what the UFC does,

2193
02:00:56.741 --> 02:00:59.980
dummy.
But the UFC is an established brand.
You fucking idiots.

2194
02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:02.410
When the UFC does it,
it's a,
it's an appetizer.

2195
02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:05.770
They're building it up to getting your lips wet and you're like,
fuck it.

2196
02:01:05.771 --> 02:01:07.300
We're in all that.
We are ordering pizza,

2197
02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:10.660
we'll get the beer out if you can do with this all night.
Yup.

2198
02:01:11.170 --> 02:01:14.500
I think they tried to emulate that model and it's not smart.

2199
02:01:14.501 --> 02:01:15.880
Boxing doesn't do it that way.

2200
02:01:16.030 --> 02:01:19.000
Nobody else does it that way and I don't think they should have done it that
way.

2201
02:01:19.001 --> 02:01:21.040
And I definitely don't think they were ready for pay per view.

2202
02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:23.470
I think that cost them a lot of money and you know,

2203
02:01:23.471 --> 02:01:27.790
they started going deeper and deeper into the red,
you know?
Yeah.
I agree.
I agree.

2204
02:01:27.791 --> 02:01:31.300
I was thinking it's good to have a good competition because it makes people

2205
02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:36.300
decide after their contract with the UFC or Bellator or uh,

2206
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:38.980
other places,
then they can decide on a,

2207
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:43.430
like what give her is he tested the market for Bella tour and from the word and

2208
02:01:43.431 --> 02:01:46.190
the streets that he got a good deal with the UFC.
So,
um,

2209
02:01:46.250 --> 02:01:48.620
I think it's good competition.
I think it is good competition.

2210
02:01:48.621 --> 02:01:51.980
I also think that it would be,
it'd be great for everybody,
including the UFC.

2211
02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:53.460
I think that if the,
the,

2212
02:01:53.461 --> 02:01:57.320
the bell tour promotion really kicked it into gear and started putting on really

2213
02:01:57.321 --> 02:02:00.530
high quality shows with guys who you look at them like save.

2214
02:02:00.531 --> 02:02:02.010
John Jones was over in Beltour.

2215
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:06.620
Jon Jones left and went to bell at good fucking googly Mooglie starts smashing

2216
02:02:06.621 --> 02:02:10.310
people and then Gustafson went over.
There are a couple other guys go to it.

2217
02:02:10.311 --> 02:02:15.170
That would be GI and it would force everybody to rise up.
O enforces everybody.

2218
02:02:15.410 --> 02:02:16.610
Even if glow over,
you know,

2219
02:02:16.611 --> 02:02:20.990
someone who's like a real top 10 contemporary Glover to sharer or Ben Henderson,

2220
02:02:21.010 --> 02:02:24.910
he,
he might look Ben,
ask her and to this day I,
I'm pissed at Ben asked her,

2221
02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:27.140
it was never signed by the UFC.
I think that's a disaster.

2222
02:02:27.141 --> 02:02:29.480
Well Dana white rather watch two dogs,
two flights,

2223
02:02:29.481 --> 02:02:32.990
fuck over shit than a watch him wrestle.
I don't understand that.

2224
02:02:33.230 --> 02:02:37.670
That's not how I look at it.
The way I look at it,
it's like you've got the sport,

2225
02:02:37.671 --> 02:02:40.970
which again I call high level problem solved,
right?

2226
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.260
That's what MMA is and then you got this guy who was just this giant problem.

2227
02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:49.940
He's such a wicked grappler.
He's so good.
And people go,
oh,
he's boring.

2228
02:02:49.941 --> 02:02:54.010
Like not to me,
not to me.
How do you solve this problem?
When I watch firearm,

2229
02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:58.190
like,
Oh damn,
you sit back and watch this again.
But how about this?

2230
02:02:58.430 --> 02:03:02.990
Watch baseball.
That shit is so fucking boring.

2231
02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:08.090
Millions of people watching,
uh,
suites,
unlimited drinks,

2232
02:03:08.091 --> 02:03:10.130
Elena food.
You know what?
I know what I did.
I fuck it.

2233
02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:14.120
I fell asleep and he knew he was right next to me sleeping.
Joseph Benevidez,

2234
02:03:14.121 --> 02:03:18.380
my friend who were out in Toronto,
of course,

2235
02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:19.960
like you guys are tired from training.

2236
02:03:19.961 --> 02:03:24.160
Like why would I waste my valuable mental and physical resources staying awake

2237
02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:28.580
for this shit,
but I can just recover.
Fuck this.
And you'll look over at him.

2238
02:03:28.581 --> 02:03:32.020
He's sleeping.
I'm asleep too actually.
Yeah,
I got to get a couple of stuff.

2239
02:03:32.021 --> 02:03:35.840
He's a great dad.
I'm going to bed.
Got a couple of selfies with him.
Blacked out.

2240
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:40.760
Yeah.
I think that,
um,
I think MMA,
it should be pure.

2241
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.630
That's what I think.
And I think that a guy like Ben ass grin,

2242
02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:49.960
he presents a pure problem and that problem is he's got a very strong skill and

2243
02:03:52.041 --> 02:03:56.480
he's incredibly gifted and talented in one aspect of MMA.

2244
02:03:56.690 --> 02:03:58.850
And I want to see a guy like that.

2245
02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:02.270
I want to see you throw that guy in with everybody.

2246
02:04:02.271 --> 02:04:05.440
I want to see what can they do to Carlos condit maybe takes Carlos condit downs.

2247
02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:08.690
Carlos can't do shit to them.
That's why I like you.
People are like,

2248
02:04:09.110 --> 02:04:12.380
people are like,
aw man,
sage Northcutt he's too young.
Fuck that.

2249
02:04:12.381 --> 02:04:14.210
I want to see him fight Anthony Pettis.
Fuck yeah.

2250
02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:16.040
I want to see his athletic ability.

2251
02:04:16.041 --> 02:04:20.240
It gets somebody who's just as athletic and skillful.
Yes,
I understand.

2252
02:04:20.241 --> 02:04:25.060
Building them up rising to the occasion.
Who Cares?
Yeah.
He lost.
Who Cares?
Right.

2253
02:04:25.130 --> 02:04:29.530
He'll come back.
He's young.
He can do better.
Get better.
Well,
let's not,
you know,

2254
02:04:30.050 --> 02:04:33.740
am I saying they're pampered her right now?
A lot of ice for,
you know,

2255
02:04:33.741 --> 02:04:36.980
a lot eyes after I like all y'all,
he's,
this is one of the,
it pisses me off.

2256
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:38.070
We were like,
he's not

2257
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:41.880
<v 2>ready for that fight.
He's not ready for that fight.
How do you know?
Well,</v>

2258
02:04:41.881 --> 02:04:46.050
this is it though.
Here's,
here's my opinion.
When you come to the UFC,
this is,

2259
02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:47.970
this is the fucking Hippie,
that the right thing.

2260
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:53.250
My amateur crew were so long that Matt,
what did they make sure?
When I got into,

2261
02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:56.400
when I,
when he called me,
when Sean Shipley called him though,
he goes,
hey,

2262
02:04:56.670 --> 02:04:58.920
we got a fiber gummies Johnson and we want to,
we want to sign him.

2263
02:04:58.921 --> 02:05:02.040
After I knocked that Jesse,
Brockton,
Alaska and that,
I was like,
okay,

2264
02:05:02.041 --> 02:05:05.880
who do you want him to fight?
And he goes,
uh,
Brad ticket,
right?

2265
02:05:07.050 --> 02:05:09.240
Any other culture?
Be like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2266
02:05:09.241 --> 02:05:12.570
I don't want him to fight Brad Pickett.
Brad pickets tough.
He,
he's good.

2267
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:14.880
You know what Matt said?
Absolutely.
Let's do it.

2268
02:05:15.210 --> 02:05:17.100
I believed you mean you'd be anybody out there.

2269
02:05:17.550 --> 02:05:18.780
I went out there and I found my ass.

2270
02:05:18.781 --> 02:05:23.010
I broke my hand and lost the fight and was mad,
upset.
No,
he wasn't upset at all.

2271
02:05:23.011 --> 02:05:25.080
He goes,
dude,
that was your first fight in the big show.

2272
02:05:25.170 --> 02:05:26.370
You went out there and fight your ass off.

2273
02:05:26.371 --> 02:05:31.370
You performed way more than my expectations,
so why not?
Why not?
Let's go sage.

2274
02:05:31.410 --> 02:05:35.700
Northcutt uh,
against,
uh,
who,
who,
who do you think would be good fight?
Well,

2275
02:05:35.701 --> 02:05:39.080
I don't know,
but I mean,
here's a counterpoint to that.
The counterpoint to,

2276
02:05:39.090 --> 02:05:42.390
as you look at a guy like Mayweather who was an Olympic star,

2277
02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:46.320
went from that to enter to MMA,
was slowly built up.

2278
02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:50.280
Now here he is 49 and,
oh,
oh,
supposedly retired.

2279
02:05:50.281 --> 02:05:51.990
But we both know that that's what he should have fucked me up,
man.

2280
02:05:51.991 --> 02:05:54.600
I'll be back in April when they build that huge stadium in Vegas.

2281
02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:57.180
That's what I guarantee you.
I'm a predictor right now.

2282
02:05:57.870 --> 02:06:01.830
He's going to be back in April and he's going to fight Manny Pacquiao after

2283
02:06:01.831 --> 02:06:02.401
Manny Pacquiao,

2284
02:06:02.401 --> 02:06:05.790
recovering from shoulder surgery and it will be the biggest fucking fight ever

2285
02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:07.950
next to the last fight,
which was the biggest fight ever.

2286
02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:11.730
It's not going to pass up on it.
And he's still young.
He's still awesome.

2287
02:06:11.810 --> 02:06:14.910
He's like,
why?
Why would you tell your record with another person?

2288
02:06:14.911 --> 02:06:19.680
We can have the record.
Fuck Rocky Marciano Kinda went down.

2289
02:06:19.681 --> 02:06:22.800
I think rocky Marciano fought his brother more than once.
Really?
Yeah.

2290
02:06:22.801 --> 02:06:26.880
That's the rumor.
Rumor is rocky Marciano father's brother at least once,

2291
02:06:26.881 --> 02:06:31.830
maybe more than once.
So his record might really be like fort.
Unquestionably.

2292
02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:36.570
Rocky Marciano was one of the greatest boxers of all time.
A nasty brawler.

2293
02:06:36.690 --> 02:06:41.650
You Watch his victory over like Jersey.
Joe Walcott,
that nasty Nakia fucking bro.

2294
02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:44.370
Man.
He was all 189 pounds.

2295
02:06:45.210 --> 02:06:49.950
He was five and nine and a,
I mean,
it's incredible.

2296
02:06:49.951 --> 02:06:53.640
I mean,
he might've been five 10 I mean,
I don't know,
but it wasn't a big God.

2297
02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:57.210
It's a different world back then people,
it was hard to get food,
you know,

2298
02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:00.740
which was,
it was hard for people to get big.
Yeah.

2299
02:07:00.850 --> 02:07:04.740
The average person during World War Two,
the average man or not World War II,

2300
02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:09.900
the civil war,
the average man was like 130 pounds.
There you go.
Right here.

2301
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:13.410
There's no food.
I mean there were,
there were no giants back then.

2302
02:07:13.411 --> 02:07:16.920
It was really difficult.
Like when a guy like Jack Johnson came along,

2303
02:07:16.921 --> 02:07:20.490
everybody was like,
what the fuck?
Cause he was a legit heavyweight,

2304
02:07:20.850 --> 02:07:24.780
but they called him,
they called him a giant and a,
I mean,

2305
02:07:24.781 --> 02:07:28.910
what was he like six to I think,
I think Jack Johnson was six too.
You know,

2306
02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:32.400
that's what I think,
you know,
I don't,
I don't think people were big back then.

2307
02:07:32.401 --> 02:07:36.100
I think it was a totally different world.
But,
um,
how

2308
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:40.600
<v 1>tall was he,
Jamie?
Six TOC.
Bitch.
I know my shit.
Um,</v>

2309
02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:43.340
what was the original question?
What the hell?
How do we get to that?

2310
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:45.100
I'm talking about,
uh,

2311
02:07:45.790 --> 02:07:50.680
what was it where we start from,
oh,
sage Northcutt yes.
Fighting.

2312
02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:56.200
Yeah.
We were like all of sage.
My student,

2313
02:07:56.230 --> 02:07:59.530
if he was my student,
I would test the waters.
I would,
I,

2314
02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:04.330
I the first fight that he fought a true,
who's the guy who fought,

2315
02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:08.710
I forget the gentleman's name,
but it was a really quick stoppage.

2316
02:08:08.711 --> 02:08:12.730
We don't know anything other than the fact that he's explosive and fast and he

2317
02:08:12.731 --> 02:08:15.520
took advantage of an opportunity to stop the fight quickly.

2318
02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:19.210
I think that if time goes on,
um,

2319
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:20.980
he is going to,

2320
02:08:21.010 --> 02:08:24.470
he's got a lot of potential and he's got a lot of marketing potential and you

2321
02:08:24.471 --> 02:08:27.040
got to look at it as a massive investment and I think that you would,

2322
02:08:27.190 --> 02:08:28.840
you would start to build him up,

2323
02:08:29.110 --> 02:08:31.840
give him some tougher and tougher fights and then,
you know,

2324
02:08:31.841 --> 02:08:36.841
maybe when he's 2021 then 19 2021 I'm like fuck,

2325
02:08:38.051 --> 02:08:42.670
I didn't get to USC.
I was,
what,
24 24 still the perfect.

2326
02:08:42.671 --> 02:08:43.510
I think you,

2327
02:08:43.570 --> 02:08:48.570
I think Matt Hume is a like one of the best and smartest trainers and

2328
02:08:49.271 --> 02:08:49.931
strategists.

2329
02:08:49.931 --> 02:08:54.340
So I think his movement of you and getting you into position was perfectly

2330
02:08:54.341 --> 02:08:55.174
orchestrated.

2331
02:08:55.330 --> 02:08:59.860
I think a guy like sage needs someone like that to be in his corner.
You know,

2332
02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:01.990
Rhonda obviously didn't have that,
you know,

2333
02:09:02.090 --> 02:09:05.350
obviously she didn't have someone who was covering all the bases and a,

2334
02:09:05.351 --> 02:09:07.270
I think you need someone who covers all the basis.

2335
02:09:07.690 --> 02:09:10.000
We don't know how good is this kid on the ground.
I mean,

2336
02:09:10.001 --> 02:09:11.970
how good is this kids wrestling,
you know,

2337
02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:15.370
what does it look like if he gets in there with a guy who can take them down at

2338
02:09:15.371 --> 02:09:16.290
will and you know,

2339
02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:19.150
have him spar with a guy like ask her and let's see what happens.

2340
02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:22.050
Let's see what happens if he wrestles with a guy like asking and ask him to

2341
02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:26.080
break him,
eh?
Yeah,
exactly.

2342
02:09:26.081 --> 02:09:28.570
I call this the smell of my balls.
When I fucking ride your face,

2343
02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.340
what are you going to do?
And tried to get me off.

2344
02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:34.210
And I think that's get me off of you.
I should say

2345
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.680
like,

2346
02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:43.480
I think you need to be exposed to all these different styles to find out where

2347
02:09:43.481 --> 02:09:46.280
are the holes,
where's the holes in your game and uh,

2348
02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:49.810
we'll wait till you get to that big championship.
Right.

2349
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:53.980
And then you've got a head kick.
Shit happens.
Exactly.
It happens.

2350
02:09:54.010 --> 02:09:58.740
But it happened the first time she fought a real kickboxer.
Yes.
You know,

2351
02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:00.370
until they agree.
That makes more sense.

2352
02:10:00.371 --> 02:10:02.290
When you may not remember admin telling me that he,
you know,

2353
02:10:02.291 --> 02:10:04.440
he had a background and talk one doe and you know,

2354
02:10:04.450 --> 02:10:07.050
he can't kick Rhonda and no one's going to be able to kick around and was like,

2355
02:10:09.210 --> 02:10:12.700
he's like,
I'm sorry.
Okay.
And then what the fuck happened?
You say,

2356
02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:17.440
I'm just from him saying that.
I was like,
okay,
what can I just see you kick,

2357
02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:20.080
I'll see what his background looks like.
Like,

2358
02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:25.340
is it just a goddamn giant difference between Anthony Pettis and you?

2359
02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:29.950
Let's just be realistic,
you know?
Absolutely.
Those guys,
I mean,
Anthony Pettis,

2360
02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:33.980
he's,
you know,
when you get like these worldclass kickers,

2361
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:38.590
<v 2>you know,
like,
yeah,
there's a difference between a trainer like an Edmonton and,</v>

2362
02:10:38.591 --> 02:10:42.650
uh,
Anthony Pettis.
I rather get punched in the face and they get fucking kick.

2363
02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:46.050
Oh fuck.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

2364
02:10:46.051 --> 02:10:48.310
My dream was one day to meet Cro cop.
I'm like,
dude,

2365
02:10:48.311 --> 02:10:50.630
I want you just kicked me in the fucking lake.
Him.
And now though,

2366
02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:53.120
like when I first met,
when I like,
I love that.
Oh,

2367
02:10:53.130 --> 02:10:56.690
he was like my biggest inspiration,
like a cro cop.

2368
02:10:56.810 --> 02:11:01.190
Aandra Laskey and Josie Aldo were my biggest inspirations.
And I was like,

2369
02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:05.060
when I met,
uh,
Aldo,
I don't speak Portuguese.
I was like,
dude,

2370
02:11:05.061 --> 02:11:08.030
just fucking kick now.
I want to just,
I just want to,
because that's like,

2371
02:11:08.290 --> 02:11:09.111
I just want to feel it.

2372
02:11:09.111 --> 02:11:12.880
I just want to fucking feel like what makes people like d like the lead.

2373
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:16.190
I was like,
just fucking kicked me just once and I'm not going to,
I don't have,

2374
02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:20.240
I would speak Portuguese.
So,
or even,

2375
02:11:20.241 --> 02:11:22.790
or even a cro cop,
like I the whole him before,

2376
02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:25.280
you don't want that guy kicking in.
I just was like,
dude,
just give me,
but Matt,

2377
02:11:25.281 --> 02:11:28.960
Matt was like,
dude,
it's easy for Cro.
Cop Kick keyways fucking,
he,
he's,

2378
02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:31.460
he fights a heavyweight.
He goes,
Hey,
wait,
can kick.

2379
02:11:31.490 --> 02:11:35.590
They just gotta throw their fucking leg kicking.
So those were always my thing.

2380
02:11:35.630 --> 02:11:36.830
Like,
I want to get fucking kicked.

2381
02:11:36.831 --> 02:11:41.090
All those guys highlight reel of chaos that left high kick.

2382
02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:44.930
It's like no one else ever.
Nope.
That Vandelay one.
Oh,

2383
02:11:44.931 --> 02:11:48.770
he flatlined Vandelay virtually just collapsed in the hump.
Yeah.

2384
02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:52.730
Oh my gosh.
God Damn.
He was bad ass and his day.

2385
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:57.860
So,
um,
I don't know if fringe real question was,
that's my answer.

2386
02:11:59.710 --> 02:12:04.580
I love it.
I love it.
Um,
was,

2387
02:12:04.610 --> 02:12:06.890
is that it does that all the questions that has all the questions,

2388
02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:10.720
they had us on a jackass questions and I'm not about bringing jackass.

2389
02:12:17.250 --> 02:12:22.100
If you want the bottom of the ocean,
someone's do contain the hooks and June,
who,

2390
02:12:24.650 --> 02:12:27.490
who would it suck to get out there?
We'll do it.
Yeah.

2391
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:32.240
There's the Internet is amazing in that anybody can talk,

2392
02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:37.050
oh,
this is the pros and the cons of it,
but ultimately the,

2393
02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:40.490
it's pro,
there's,
there's been times I had just went to,
it's actually,

2394
02:12:40.491 --> 02:12:42.890
I've gotten a lot better.
Like I wouldn't even go in MMA.

2395
02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:47.640
I won't go any MMA sites anymore.
Just,
just won't.
I'm like,
don't read somebody.

2396
02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:50.730
Go on Twitter is if I'm looking for something or if I'm going to post something

2397
02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:54.320
about me coming down here or,
or stream or anything like that.

2398
02:12:54.321 --> 02:12:58.310
Because a lot of people that just talk shit like stop talking,

2399
02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:02.960
stop talking shit.
Just I have to think about it this way.

2400
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:06.710
And they should probably think about this way too.
Like what are you doing?

2401
02:13:06.711 --> 02:13:09.690
Like if you're,
if you're going online,
like I'll look at somebody.

2402
02:13:09.710 --> 02:13:12.650
Sometimes someone will talk shit to me and I'll go to their Twitter account and

2403
02:13:12.651 --> 02:13:16.100
I realize that's all they do.
It's all they do is talk shit to me.

2404
02:13:16.340 --> 02:13:20.490
I look at a Twitter kind of like this.
You need to get someone's help.
Yeah.
He,

2405
02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:24.080
someone needs to talk to you like you're fucking whole.
Twitter feed is me.

2406
02:13:24.630 --> 02:13:26.030
You're telling me I'm a loser,

2407
02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:29.180
but I didn't even know you existed until two seconds ago and apparently you've

2408
02:13:29.181 --> 02:13:31.980
been tweeting me for a year.
But that's pretty fucking

2409
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.290
<v 1>crazy.
And that's not healthy man.
But I just found you a,
sorry,</v>

2410
02:13:36.291 --> 02:13:40.220
it took me this long to say someone's not shit like to go to your Twitter for to

2411
02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:43.480
be true shows you had shown him he loves you.
But what about you bitch?
Yeah.

2412
02:13:43.490 --> 02:13:47.160
You know me.
I don't even know who you are.
And even a person,
you're an egg.

2413
02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:51.540
There's an egg shaped avatar on Twitter with a fake name and you're thinking

2414
02:13:51.541 --> 02:13:53.840
about me.
Why are you thinking about,

2415
02:13:53.860 --> 02:13:57.410
because I've actually gone out and done something.
Absolutely no,
and that's,

2416
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:59.040
that's what these people don't understand.

2417
02:13:59.041 --> 02:14:02.320
When they're talking shit to you and they're,
they're attacking you and,
and,

2418
02:14:02.321 --> 02:14:04.470
and trying to get your attention like you,

2419
02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:09.770
what you're doing is you're showing the flaws in your plan of life.

2420
02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:15.390
Your plan of life is to shit on successful people and not become successful.

2421
02:14:15.390 --> 02:14:20.070
You've taken all this energy and turn it into hate and just hoping someone
falls,

2422
02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:22.590
hoping someone gets Ronda rouseyed.
You know,

2423
02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:27.560
I knew it.
I mean,

2424
02:14:27.570 --> 02:14:32.010
there's so many people that love that they love when someone falls and what they

2425
02:14:32.011 --> 02:14:37.011
really love is someone that no longer makes them feel like shit because of their

2426
02:14:38.131 --> 02:14:41.970
accomplishments.
That's what they really love.
When they watched someone fail,

2427
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:44.070
they don't necessarily love failure.

2428
02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:48.750
What they love is they have been alleviated of that feeling of inadequacy,

2429
02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:52.710
inadequacy.
That's what they really love and they get to attack.

2430
02:14:52.711 --> 02:14:57.360
Yay.
Now I get the green light.
Yay.

2431
02:14:57.660 --> 02:14:59.550
It's like when someone loses,
when they get knocked out,

2432
02:14:59.551 --> 02:15:01.940
it's like a starter's pistol for cons.
Pow.

2433
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:06.660
Go look and go,
man,
they just run and start,

2434
02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:10.680
but they don't understand that it's bad for you.
It's bad for them like you.

2435
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:13.740
It's not good for you.
It's not healthy.
It's not smart.

2436
02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.460
You wasting all that time hating on people and shitting on people.

2437
02:15:18.210 --> 02:15:22.800
Like I saw this guy the other day who was shitting on this fighter and a I went

2438
02:15:22.801 --> 02:15:27.780
to is I went to his Twitter page and it's Twitter page was completely dedicated.

2439
02:15:27.781 --> 02:15:31.260
Like the name of the Twitter page is dedicated shitting on this fighter and all

2440
02:15:31.261 --> 02:15:34.680
the tweets and like someone called him a troll.
He was like,
I'm not a troll.

2441
02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:38.970
Trolls hit and run.
I'm here for the long run.
You're going to get fucked up.

2442
02:15:38.971 --> 02:15:43.920
Like that guy who Josh neer did.
That's what my hand or Deontay wilder,

2443
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:47.670
you ever see that?
Ah,
John J Walder beat the fuck out of some guy.

2444
02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:51.630
Some guy came to his gym and a Deontae beat the fuck out of,

2445
02:15:51.631 --> 02:15:54.780
knocked him down and hit him when he was down.
It'd be,
I mean,
this guy was like,

2446
02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:57.400
not even a big guy and he's in their sparring with Eh,

2447
02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:01.090
I think he hadn't won the heavyweight title yet,
but I mean,
he,

2448
02:16:01.130 --> 02:16:03.510
he's the heavyweight boxing champion,

2449
02:16:03.511 --> 02:16:07.230
one of the heavyweight boxing champions next to Tyson fury.
I don't know what,

2450
02:16:07.610 --> 02:16:07.880
you know,

2451
02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:11.760
that's the other problem with boxing is it's so fractioned because there's so

2452
02:16:11.761 --> 02:16:13.530
many different,
like,
you know,
like Bella tour,

2453
02:16:13.531 --> 02:16:16.620
we'll say the bell tour world title.
Well,
you know,

2454
02:16:16.621 --> 02:16:20.430
for a fact of Beltour puts on 125 pound title fight.

2455
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:24.960
That shit is not for the world title,
right?
There's one world.

2456
02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:26.580
What do you got there?
Oh,
go ahead.

2457
02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:34.960
He's holding it in so bad.
He's limping.
That's hilarious.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2458
02:16:35.170 --> 02:16:38.440
Mighty Mouse Johnson,
he wrote on a piece of paper I need to Piss.

2459
02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:43.480
We're going to auction that off on Ebay if you like to get in on that.
Um,

2460
02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:49.000
why he's pen.
Let me tell you about some shit's coming up next Wednesday.

2461
02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:53.160
There's a show at the ice house,
our magical,
uh,

2462
02:16:53.570 --> 02:16:56.820
Tony Hinchcliffe,
Greg Fitzsimmons and probably more,
uh,

2463
02:16:56.860 --> 02:16:58.360
these shows sell out pretty quick.

2464
02:16:58.570 --> 02:17:02.650
It's a 10:00 PM show and it's 15 bucks and it's next Wednesday at the Ice House

2465
02:17:02.651 --> 02:17:05.720
in Pasadena.
Then December 11th,

2466
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:10.750
there's a big show in Vegas at the car theater with Joey Diaz and me and Joey

2467
02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:14.950
Diaz is on fire.
He's on fire last night.

2468
02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:19.390
I've never seen anybody finding our last night.
People were crying like tears.

2469
02:17:19.690 --> 02:17:23.230
He's got,
I don't even say what the bits about,
but God damn he's got this bit,

2470
02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:27.610
I'll say it's about eggs because,
but it's not,
it's about life.

2471
02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:31.180
Um,
I got a bunch of other shit coming up too.

2472
02:17:31.181 --> 02:17:35.710
I'm at the Beacon Theater on January 29th in New York City tickets.

2473
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:40.480
The presale went on sale today and then,
um,
Boston,

2474
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:44.100
we just added a third show today.
I do two shows,

2475
02:17:44.101 --> 02:17:48.820
sold out the Wilbur on Friday and Saturday night we add a late show on Friday

2476
02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:52.360
night.
We'll probably add a,
a late show on Saturday night too,

2477
02:17:52.630 --> 02:17:55.000
cause that's my hometown and he's back.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2478
02:17:55.001 --> 02:17:59.590
we are at time filling refresh.
So here's actually bladder,
man.

2479
02:17:59.591 --> 02:18:03.370
I can't even pee right now.
I can hang in there.
It's you go hunting.
That's why.

2480
02:18:03.390 --> 02:18:05.920
No,
it's because doing this podcast,
that's what it is.

2481
02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:10.960
It's just my bladder grew from doing this podcast from six years of doing three

2482
02:18:10.961 --> 02:18:15.310
hour conversations.
That's amazing.
By the way.
I just,
uh,
just keep two beers.

2483
02:18:15.311 --> 02:18:20.030
I had a coffee before I got here.
Um,
here's a quick question.
Uh,
your,

2484
02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:22.690
what are your thoughts on if do you think Ronda Rousey,

2485
02:18:22.691 --> 02:18:25.810
she did the rematch with my home right now?
No.
Who Do you think she's fine now,

2486
02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:28.360
but just don't tissue to do the rematch right now because of her head.

2487
02:18:29.230 --> 02:18:32.320
She experienced some significant head trauma in that fight.
And I think anybody,

2488
02:18:32.321 --> 02:18:36.460
anybody that says any differently is an asshole.
That's what I think.
I really do.

2489
02:18:36.550 --> 02:18:41.230
I think traumatic brain injury is something that it's gotten me more and more

2490
02:18:41.231 --> 02:18:46.030
concerned over the last few years because we're talking to doctors.
I've had,

2491
02:18:46.031 --> 02:18:50.230
um,
this one doctor,
Dr. Mark Gordon,
who works with a lot of soldiers,

2492
02:18:50.350 --> 02:18:51.760
football players.
Um,

2493
02:18:52.270 --> 02:18:55.520
he's worked with some combat sports athletes as well and where,

2494
02:18:55.550 --> 02:18:58.660
where he relays the issues with traumatic brain injury,

2495
02:18:58.661 --> 02:19:01.930
the damage to the pituitary gland,
the damage to your bill,

2496
02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:06.760
your body's ability to produce hormones and depression and all the issues that

2497
02:19:06.761 --> 02:19:11.140
come along with concussions and how those are exacerbated by ignoring them or by

2498
02:19:11.141 --> 02:19:15.920
trying to work through them or by getting injured again,
uh,

2499
02:19:16.180 --> 02:19:19.360
close to the concussion,
which makes it way,
way worse.

2500
02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:23.110
When I look at guys that have had to exit the sport,
like Tj Grant,

2501
02:19:23.290 --> 02:19:26.560
who was about to fight for the title and had to get out of the sport,

2502
02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:30.920
like he works,
he's in a mine now.
He works for a mine in,
in Canada.

2503
02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:36.170
And I just think that traumatic brain injury,
although I love the sport,
is a,
is,

2504
02:19:36.171 --> 02:19:39.350
is,
is one of the most overlooked and more dangerous aspects.

2505
02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:43.910
Now you don't hear guys like Dana and talk about it and you rarely hear people

2506
02:19:43.911 --> 02:19:46.060
talk about it outside of,
of,

2507
02:19:46.110 --> 02:19:50.870
of someone like me because they're promoters and because that's there,

2508
02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:55.640
that's about it.
I can't,
I can't do that because for me,

2509
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:59.500
my,
my bread and butter is me being honest.
Yeah.

2510
02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:01.610
That's my business.
My business is,

2511
02:20:01.611 --> 02:20:05.240
I got to say what I really think and what I really think is she needs a

2512
02:20:05.241 --> 02:20:09.650
comprehensive overall like overhaul of her game,

2513
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:11.160
of our MMA game.
Yeah.

2514
02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:16.570
I think she needs to look at like how she's preparing and she needs to take into

2515
02:20:17.241 --> 02:20:21.620
consideration all the problems that were exposed in that fight and she needs to

2516
02:20:21.621 --> 02:20:23.300
re reassess and readdress.

2517
02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:26.420
And I also think she has too many fucking distractions.

2518
02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:29.620
I think she has too much going on.
She's doing a roadhouse movies,

2519
02:20:29.621 --> 02:20:33.020
she's rude and she did the entourage movie she's doing,
you know,

2520
02:20:33.021 --> 02:20:36.590
who knows what fucking movie contracts and scripts and her phone's probably

2521
02:20:36.591 --> 02:20:40.060
blowing up all day.
That's all fine when you're fighting.
Batchko Heyo

2522
02:20:42.310 --> 02:20:43.060
nothing.

2523
02:20:43.060 --> 02:20:48.060
Nothing to take away from vechicle hey vechicle heyah she's like a mechanical or

2524
02:20:48.171 --> 02:20:52.700
robotic sort of a puncher.
She kicks,
you know,
kind of robotic.

2525
02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:57.590
There's no,
no real threat of explosion.
There's no real submission threat,

2526
02:20:57.620 --> 02:21:00.740
you know,
I'm not saying that batch camp eventually put that in our game,

2527
02:21:00.890 --> 02:21:04.700
but as right now when I look at her like when she fucked Shannon Blades,
Baylor,

2528
02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:09.290
I'm looking at like a robot fighter know.
It's funny.
It's so robotic.

2529
02:21:09.291 --> 02:21:10.970
You're laughing.
I think.

2530
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:14.390
I think she needs to really look at the hope.

2531
02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:18.920
I mean like we said,
MMA is problem solving.
Right.

2532
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:20.000
And we will,

2533
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:24.050
there was obviously a bunch of new problems that were exposed in that fund and

2534
02:21:24.051 --> 02:21:26.990
one of the big ones is the difference between hitting Mitts,

2535
02:21:27.350 --> 02:21:32.270
sparring with people that aren't really strikers and fighting a 19 time world

2536
02:21:32.271 --> 02:21:33.430
boxing champion.
Yeah.

2537
02:21:33.650 --> 02:21:37.930
Who is also an outstanding kickboxer who's also an outstanding athlete who's

2538
02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:39.500
also incredibly mentally tough,

2539
02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:44.620
who also has a fantastic real professional MMA camp filled with champions,

2540
02:21:45.801 --> 02:21:48.800
potential champions,
worldclass contenders.

2541
02:21:48.980 --> 02:21:52.550
Mike Winkeljohn is one of the best fucking striking coaches in the world.

2542
02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:53.630
Greg Jackson,

2543
02:21:53.631 --> 02:21:57.560
who is a master strategist and they've gone over this with a fine tooth comb.

2544
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:58.790
There's no yes men.

2545
02:21:59.660 --> 02:22:03.110
<v 0>There is no unique.
Yeah.
When you hear,
uh,
and that's the thing too.</v>

2546
02:22:03.111 --> 02:22:05.470
I guess when you hit,
when you heard how the homestead,

2547
02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:09.000
like there was of times I've gone into the gym and I would just cry,
just cry on,

2548
02:22:09.070 --> 02:22:11.600
that's sending women,
that's not going to win me the world championship.

2549
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:13.770
And then she'll come back and I might seem,

2550
02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:16.880
I don't know if Rhonda Rousey has ever felt that way,
if she's like,

2551
02:22:16.881 --> 02:22:19.820
I'm not gonna build that soundly beat Holly home.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2552
02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.760
But it's almost like when you bring up how many people she's been training with

2553
02:22:22.761 --> 02:22:26.280
Ricoh John [inaudible] in the different aspect of miss [inaudible].
She has

2554
02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:29.700
<v 1>different types of fighter there.
John doxins there,
Carlos condit,</v>

2555
02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:33.090
Jon Jones has been there.
So she's,
she's surrounded by other fighters.

2556
02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:36.210
That's all these fighters do.
You know,
with Rhonda,

2557
02:22:36.211 --> 02:22:39.420
she's being able to expand her brand.
He'd go into movies and all that stuff.

2558
02:22:39.421 --> 02:22:42.420
The hand that,
uh,
that income coming in to where,

2559
02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:47.010
I don't know if anybody else around her is still on that have that hunger.
Like,

2560
02:22:47.011 --> 02:22:49.260
no,
this is what you gotta do.
This is the,
this is the goal.

2561
02:22:49.261 --> 02:22:53.460
That's what pays the bills.
Yeah.
And that money is so great from those movies.

2562
02:22:53.461 --> 02:22:55.110
And there's salt.
Then she's got agents.

2563
02:22:55.111 --> 02:22:57.360
Her agents were out there in Melbourne with her.

2564
02:22:57.990 --> 02:23:02.680
Yeah man movie agents.
No,

2565
02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:03.690
look ma'am,

2566
02:23:03.690 --> 02:23:08.690
I go back to the days when Mike Tyson had that fucking down jacket on and he was

2567
02:23:09.421 --> 02:23:13.410
running a five o'clock in the morning and it was 19 years old and they asked
him,

2568
02:23:13.411 --> 02:23:16.110
why do you run a five o'clock in the morning?
And he was like,

2569
02:23:16.111 --> 02:23:19.290
I want it five o'clock in the morning cause I believe that my opponent is in bed

2570
02:23:19.291 --> 02:23:23.990
and I believe it gives me an edge.
He's not,
he's not getting movie scripts.

2571
02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:25.141
He's not,
you know,

2572
02:23:25.141 --> 02:23:29.000
he's not thinking about writing a book or dodging some fucking,
you know,

2573
02:23:29.001 --> 02:23:33.600
a Paparazzi.
He's,
he's an animal.
He's out there being Jack Dempsey.

2574
02:23:33.601 --> 02:23:36.150
He's being the best he can be.

2575
02:23:36.151 --> 02:23:39.150
He's out there with a singular drive.

2576
02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:43.650
I think you have to be obsessed with fighting and it has to be your overwhelming

2577
02:23:43.651 --> 02:23:44.970
consuming passion.

2578
02:23:45.210 --> 02:23:48.180
And I think as soon as you start giving up little pieces of real estate,

2579
02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:52.590
you know,
you start making little subdivisions in your brain.
Well,
you know what,

2580
02:23:52.591 --> 02:23:55.980
I'll just put a little side for,
uh,
uh,
my fucking,
uh,

2581
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:59.430
my little TV show that I'm gonna work on and I'm going to start my own

2582
02:23:59.431 --> 02:24:01.650
production company.
I'm looking to the future.

2583
02:24:01.830 --> 02:24:05.490
Look at the future as a fucking hill left high kick.
All right?
That's the future.

2584
02:24:05.730 --> 02:24:09.240
That's what you need to be preparing for.
Fuck all this roadhouse bullshit,

2585
02:24:09.370 --> 02:24:11.550
because that movie is going to come and go and you're not going to notice

2586
02:24:11.551 --> 02:24:12.384
whether or not,
look,

2587
02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:16.170
Rhonda made some insane amount of money in the last couple of years,
right?

2588
02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:19.710
So some insane amount of money.
I mean,
depending on who you ask,

2589
02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:23.880
it's between she made between six and $10 million over the last couple of years.

2590
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:27.320
I'll be like,
so let's just stop right there and look at that.
You,

2591
02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:30.990
if you make 1 million bucks for roadhouse or 2 million about it,

2592
02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.840
you're not going to know that.
You're not going to notice that.
Well,
no,
no.

2593
02:24:34.850 --> 02:24:35.401
That's what I'm saying.

2594
02:24:35.401 --> 02:24:39.690
Like you don't know the difference between six and 8 million.
Yeah,
it doesn't,

2595
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:41.700
it doesn't mean Gotcha.
Gotcha.
If you'll look,

2596
02:24:41.701 --> 02:24:44.490
unless you're a crazy person who constantly needs to buy things.

2597
02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:47.750
When you have a certain amount of money,
everything becomes free.
Yeah,

2598
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:51.180
that's what it is.
It's like you want to go buy a laptop?
We'll go buy a laptop.

2599
02:24:51.181 --> 02:24:52.260
You just fucking give him the credit card.

2600
02:24:52.261 --> 02:24:55.260
You don't even think about it when you're broke.
You go,
how much is the laptop?

2601
02:24:55.261 --> 02:24:59.580
2000 bucks.
Shit,
Shit.
I still fucking do it now.
Well,
you're smart.

2602
02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:03.540
You're smart,
you're frugal.
But when you've got $10 million in the bank,

2603
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:06.630
what you're supposed to do is realize,
okay,

2604
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:10.720
well now I know money is not an issue.

2605
02:25:10.721 --> 02:25:11.830
It's not essential anymore.

2606
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:15.210
So why would I want to go out and try to search with these new ventures instead

2607
02:25:15.211 --> 02:25:18.590
of k right now I'm fighting right now.
This is what I'm going to put my eggs in.

2608
02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:20.160
All my focus on,

2609
02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:24.010
and there's no reason why I need to go out and do this movie,

2610
02:25:24.011 --> 02:25:28.420
but it might be telling me maybe some reason.
The problem is you fucking you.

2611
02:25:28.421 --> 02:25:32.070
You left the door open to the vampires,
the agents like,

2612
02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:38.080
and they come in
the door.

2613
02:25:38.290 --> 02:25:43.180
Then you let the door open to the vampires and they,
they slide into your house.

2614
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:47.470
So much money on the table that so much money.

2615
02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:51.400
Why not films entourage?

2616
02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:55.870
If you fucking spent a moment of your life preparing for that piece of shit,

2617
02:25:55.990 --> 02:26:00.850
movie moment wasted.
It's a fact.
You're doing the most noble,

2618
02:26:00.851 --> 02:26:01.631
courageous,

2619
02:26:01.631 --> 02:26:06.310
terrifying thing in all of sports who becoming the most dominant and

2620
02:26:06.311 --> 02:26:11.311
recognizable female champion of all time to spend any time away from that doing

2621
02:26:11.981 --> 02:26:13.150
some shitty movie,

2622
02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:17.440
some nonsense agent created catastrophe of,
of,

2623
02:26:17.441 --> 02:26:21.760
of culture.
That's a waste.
It's a waste,
but there's a lot of money in that way.

2624
02:26:21.761 --> 02:26:24.910
She might make a half a million bucks,
my mega million.
Who knows what you make.

2625
02:26:25.630 --> 02:26:30.630
The point is that all that stuff came about because of her fighting and because

2626
02:26:31.661 --> 02:26:33.760
of our success and because of her dominance,

2627
02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:36.610
and as soon as that success and dominance goes away,

2628
02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:40.630
then all that money roads away see you open the door to the vampires.

2629
02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:43.930
Vampires suck your blood and you left.
They're dehydrated.

2630
02:26:43.931 --> 02:26:46.750
An amazing like [inaudible] you opened the door,

2631
02:26:47.170 --> 02:26:48.790
you open the door and he let them in.

2632
02:26:49.180 --> 02:26:53.260
And I don't necessarily think anybody other than her mother who's a,
just a,

2633
02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:55.180
a bad ass herself.

2634
02:26:55.390 --> 02:26:58.420
I don't think there's a lot of people that are going to tell her that,
you know?

2635
02:26:58.421 --> 02:27:01.990
So what would you say that,
so here's a good example.
So this,

2636
02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:04.840
that's Ron and leave that door closed and be,
you know what?
No,
I'm,

2637
02:27:04.940 --> 02:27:06.520
I'll focus on fighting them a little bit.
Like,
well,

2638
02:27:06.521 --> 02:27:09.730
the stores are going to be opened again and let's say she only way that doors

2639
02:27:09.731 --> 02:27:14.380
really open now,
honestly,
is if she wins right now.
That door's not open anymore.

2640
02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:15.940
No,
I mean,
I'm saying though,
like let's say,

2641
02:27:16.210 --> 02:27:20.020
let's say after the bachelor hair fight,
she never did.
She never did entourage.

2642
02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:21.640
She never did fascinate for your seven.

2643
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:24.100
She just kept on fighting and kept on fighting,
kept on fighting,

2644
02:27:24.101 --> 02:27:26.890
kept on fighting.
And let's say she's the greatest.

2645
02:27:26.891 --> 02:27:28.270
She beat Anderson Silva's record.

2646
02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:33.460
She's defendant had a 50 times and let's say she missed arbitrary to open that

2647
02:27:33.461 --> 02:27:36.310
door,
that door with money she's made on fighting.

2648
02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:39.990
Just the money she's made on fighting will be insane.
Well yeah,

2649
02:27:39.991 --> 02:27:41.840
cause she skipped over here.
So yeah,
she's,
she's,

2650
02:27:42.020 --> 02:27:45.910
and she's in a different stratosphere because there's never been a woman that's

2651
02:27:45.911 --> 02:27:47.410
been dominant like that.

2652
02:27:47.410 --> 02:27:52.410
That's been a world class fighter that's appeared like in all these metro pcs

2653
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:54.700
commercials.
Like all that shit's fine.

2654
02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:59.080
It's when you start going off into who else has been like her?

2655
02:27:59.081 --> 02:28:01.540
There's no one,
no one's been like her.
Right.

2656
02:28:01.630 --> 02:28:04.300
So she's made all that money just from fighting.
Yeah.

2657
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:07.240
I think when you stretch out,
he'd get greedy.

2658
02:28:07.390 --> 02:28:10.590
You start going for all that other stuff.
Look,
there's some cool shit.
Like,

2659
02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:12.280
I love the idea of the roadhouse movie,

2660
02:28:12.430 --> 02:28:14.200
but the roadhouse movie doesn't work anymore.

2661
02:28:14.410 --> 02:28:17.960
The roadhouse movie only works when she's the bad ass.
Yeah.
As soon as got,

2662
02:28:18.020 --> 02:28:20.980
Gotcha.
You want Holly Holm to be the fucking bouncer?
That'd be there.

2663
02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:25.850
How the home shows walks in the door like,
oh yeah.
Oh,
Rhonda,
for a moment,

2664
02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:30.140
the fucking vampires,
or I'll pull her aside,
you know?
Well,

2665
02:28:30.141 --> 02:28:33.140
we've looked at your Q rating.
You know,
there's like a Q rating thing.

2666
02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:35.870
There's like this fucking guy that I know who is an actor.
He's a nice guy,

2667
02:28:35.871 --> 02:28:40.260
but he's a fucking idiot.
But he,
uh,
he goes,
do you ever look at your Q rating?

2668
02:28:40.350 --> 02:28:43.160
Are we talking about there's a website you can go to?
You find out?
Well,

2669
02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:44.240
we're obsessed with it.

2670
02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:47.920
Sometimes a more famous and sometimes I'm not like I closed his laptop.
My,

2671
02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:51.740
what the fuck are you doing?
Get away from that.
You know,
this is poison.

2672
02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:55.910
This is occupying your thoughts.
You have children,
okay.
You have hobbies.

2673
02:28:55.911 --> 02:28:56.840
You have things you like to do.

2674
02:28:57.050 --> 02:28:59.900
Do those things concentrate on being the best you can be.

2675
02:29:00.050 --> 02:29:05.030
Concentrating on this random algorithm that decides how famous you are in any

2676
02:29:05.031 --> 02:29:08.720
given moment.
That's insanity,
man.
Go take a yoga class.
You know,

2677
02:29:08.721 --> 02:29:11.520
you need to do some mushrooms.
Go out in the forest and fire yourself.

2678
02:29:12.050 --> 02:29:15.680
Do you need me to take him?
That's he's too hard.
Too much.

2679
02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:18.350
He's got a lot of Jesus in his head to this,

2680
02:29:18.351 --> 02:29:21.470
a lot going on with this one particular dude.
But the,

2681
02:29:21.471 --> 02:29:26.471
but this idea that you concentrate on what got you to the dance and what got

2682
02:29:27.861 --> 02:29:31.460
rotten to the dance is a singular focus that she hadn't judo,

2683
02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:34.960
which made her this dominant judo fighter.
Right.

2684
02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:38.870
And then she enters into MMA and there was no grappler that could fuck with her

2685
02:29:38.871 --> 02:29:42.380
man.
She's hip toss and bitches.
She's throwing them on their heads.
I mean,

2686
02:29:42.381 --> 02:29:44.660
she was just so spectacular with their arm bars,

2687
02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:50.420
but she found someone that had the kind of potential and that had the kind of

2688
02:29:50.421 --> 02:29:53.000
talent that she did in a singular discipline.

2689
02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:55.130
But it was a singular discipline that she didn't have.

2690
02:29:55.130 --> 02:29:58.850
That discipline was kickboxing and boxing striking,

2691
02:29:58.851 --> 02:30:02.460
which is not her strong suit.
I see.
The thing I always like,

2692
02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:07.030
I always have to try be uh,
open with all the fighters.
You know,

2693
02:30:07.060 --> 02:30:09.380
I asked him like,
you know,
how you feel about spying on stuff?

2694
02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:12.740
I'll have to ask her like,
how much kickboxing you do on a daily basis.
Like just,

2695
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:15.680
do you ever do any kickboxing?
I still take classes.
Uh,

2696
02:30:15.681 --> 02:30:19.480
you know when there's classes going to AMC,
I take Muay Thai classes and

2697
02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:24.530
always feel that there's something I could still learn who we know how many

2698
02:30:24.531 --> 02:30:27.590
fights I already visited Jujitsu,
I just put on an Aggie.

2699
02:30:27.890 --> 02:30:32.330
So I wonder like how much kickboxing do you do leading up to training camp.

2700
02:30:32.331 --> 02:30:33.780
But then again you bring up,
you know,

2701
02:30:33.781 --> 02:30:35.750
the open the door or in the deem is where it's like,

2702
02:30:35.751 --> 02:30:37.940
hey we're in a Guinea and get this workout in and then I got to go do this

2703
02:30:37.941 --> 02:30:42.620
interview and I'm going to display.
But at the same time,
you know,
the UFC model,

2704
02:30:42.621 --> 02:30:45.620
they pushed that because they need to have her main stream to go to open up

2705
02:30:45.621 --> 02:30:47.840
doors.
The cell that pay per view revenues,

2706
02:30:47.841 --> 02:30:51.350
they do all that stuff so that he's almost like do,
but they don't,

2707
02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:53.480
it's like how much of that do you really need?

2708
02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:55.220
How much of that is really beneficial?

2709
02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:59.300
Like what is the difference between like what Rhonda brings to the table and if

2710
02:30:59.301 --> 02:31:02.640
all that stuff was so beneficial.
Well,
how come,
you know,

2711
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:06.560
how come other fighters to do the same amount of work don't get the same amount

2712
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:09.140
of,
of reaction to it?
Well,

2713
02:31:09.141 --> 02:31:13.590
it's because the results inside the octagon or w or what's most important.
Yeah.

2714
02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:16.970
Oh yeah.
Absolutely.
You all those interviews and that don't mean shit.
Yeah.

2715
02:31:17.070 --> 02:31:21.990
That's boring.
You if you,
if you can't make it happen,

2716
02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:25.120
if like you watched your skills and I'm like,
oh my God,

2717
02:31:25.121 --> 02:31:28.770
this is like clunky and there's nothing,
nothing good here.
Yeah.

2718
02:31:29.050 --> 02:31:31.470
You're not going to,
it's not going to be worth it.
Yeah.

2719
02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:36.210
And the only way to take clunky and make it better as to singular focus,

2720
02:31:36.211 --> 02:31:40.800
you have to be driven and it has to be only what you think of you.
It has to be,

2721
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:43.860
you have to be obsessed.
It'd be crazy.
I mean,
you know it.

2722
02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:46.460
<v 0>Oh yeah,
no,
no,
dude.
Yeah.</v>

2723
02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:49.400
Can't wait to the lights go off so we can talk a little bit more behind scenes.

2724
02:31:49.401 --> 02:31:51.720
Dude,
I'm sure I don't like it.

2725
02:31:51.820 --> 02:31:52.710
<v 1>The model.
Yeah.</v>

2726
02:31:52.750 --> 02:31:56.260
I don't like the model of these athletes having to do all these interviews.

2727
02:31:56.410 --> 02:31:58.180
I don't like the training being interrupted.

2728
02:31:58.181 --> 02:32:01.200
I don't like the rest being interrupted.
I don't want any of these things.
Yeah,

2729
02:32:01.430 --> 02:32:03.190
I don't,
I think these things are counterintuitive.

2730
02:32:03.250 --> 02:32:06.640
I think those same result that you get out of that,

2731
02:32:06.641 --> 02:32:10.630
it could be gotten with a narrator like they do on those showtime things when

2732
02:32:10.631 --> 02:32:14.620
they get,
what's his name?
Lafe uh,
what the fuck is that guy's name?

2733
02:32:14.621 --> 02:32:18.850
The guy who was in,
um,
yeah.
Liev Schreiber.
Right?
That guy's a bad motherfucker.

2734
02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:21.700
He's a great narrator.
Like,
or you know,
you get,

2735
02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:23.500
what was the other guy from pulp fiction?

2736
02:32:24.100 --> 02:32:27.670
Ving Rhames ving Rhames is good at that shit too.
Like you got a good narrator,

2737
02:32:27.730 --> 02:32:31.330
he show training footage and you have the occasional interview.
Yeah.

2738
02:32:31.470 --> 02:32:32.303
Maybe you have one.
Yeah.

2739
02:32:32.420 --> 02:32:34.450
<v 0>Will you eat that way?
You get you,
you,
you,</v>

2740
02:32:34.770 --> 02:32:39.770
it's almost at this point in time to where I saw so much of Connor or Rhonda and

2741
02:32:39.841 --> 02:32:42.280
I was like,
I was,
I was like,
okay,
I'm getting a little,
uh,
I,

2742
02:32:42.360 --> 02:32:44.970
and I love Canterbury,
right?
Deb,
I,
you gotta get in there,

2743
02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:50.040
get you the easy to get a good [inaudible] on the couch.
Just laugh.
It was like,

2744
02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:53.730
ah,
I can watch this all fucking day.
[inaudible] had panties on.
Yeah,
we,
yeah,

2745
02:32:53.731 --> 02:32:57.990
we made it.
But then it came a point in time to where like every single time I,

2746
02:32:58.160 --> 02:33:01.390
we watched something and I was see him over.
No,
no.
I was like,
no,
no,
I'll get it.

2747
02:33:01.580 --> 02:33:05.400
[inaudible] had to change the fucking channel,
but then he went away for awhile.

2748
02:33:05.520 --> 02:33:08.370
Then he started doing something and I was like,
go on.

2749
02:33:11.320 --> 02:33:15.200
But yeah,
I told the I can elusive girlfriend.
Yeah.

2750
02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:19.650
Where are you been texting you all day?
I miss the fuck Outta here.

2751
02:33:20.270 --> 02:33:23.580
That's what it's like if a girl was texting you all day like Nah,

2752
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.990
it's a halo working out.
Yeah,
but then you,
you never,
it's,
that's the thing.

2753
02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.550
You can never find the right recipe to do it because you've only had so many,

2754
02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:36.810
so many athletes be able to come into multi-platform stars.

2755
02:33:37.170 --> 02:33:41.340
And I think as me as a fighter,
I want to get to that point to where I can make,

2756
02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:46.140
I wish I had,
I wish I can make $10 million if I,
if I had $2 million in the bank.

2757
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:49.800
Oh fuck.
I'll tell you what right now it will just,
well,

2758
02:33:49.801 --> 02:33:53.870
my focus has always been mixed martial arts,
but yeah,
I don't fucking know.

2759
02:33:53.890 --> 02:33:56.370
By Dewey you mean you have fight anymore?
Do we going to call it?

2760
02:33:56.371 --> 02:33:58.680
We won't call it a shot.
Come on.
We should be train on.
Call the shot.

2761
02:33:58.710 --> 02:34:03.680
You think it would stop you stop competing.
I fucking love it.
I used it as much.

2762
02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:08.070
But you wouldn't do any interviews.
My phone broke.
No,
no.

2763
02:34:08.071 --> 02:34:12.960
I still would teach.
It keeps breaking his phone.
No,

2764
02:34:12.961 --> 02:34:13.650
I still would.

2765
02:34:13.650 --> 02:34:18.220
I think you know a reality when I tell people when I jumped in sport,
it was not,

2766
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:22.780
it was not to make money.
It was not too,
there was no one 25.

2767
02:34:22.781 --> 02:34:26.590
There was no one 35 or 45 or 55.
I didn't even know about,
uh,

2768
02:34:26.780 --> 02:34:30.120
the UFC when I first did it.
I saw delta were fighter,
but it was one,

2769
02:34:30.170 --> 02:34:33.430
it was Forrest Griffin and I'm Rashad Evans and those guys working out.

2770
02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:37.600
So there was no little guy whenever I didn't even know even know about Japan.

2771
02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:41.080
But for the longest time one 55 was the lightest weight class for the longest

2772
02:34:41.081 --> 02:34:41.680
time.

2773
02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:46.680
Remember when we didn't even have a one 55 70 Sean sherk fighting GSP.

2774
02:34:48.010 --> 02:34:49.870
So there was no,
there was no way.

2775
02:34:49.871 --> 02:34:53.540
Like there wasn't even a 55 yeah it was recently.

2776
02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:55.690
But now you have people like they get to high school,

2777
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:59.020
I'm going to be a professional fighter,
motherfucker,
you nobody that takes,

2778
02:34:59.021 --> 02:35:02.170
you know,
how much money are you going to make?
You know,
you know homeboy had,

2779
02:35:02.171 --> 02:35:04.420
Mcdonald's is making more money than you and you consider yourself a

2780
02:35:04.450 --> 02:35:07.720
professional fighter and that's where like I didn't have that.

2781
02:35:07.721 --> 02:35:12.490
So that's why I think like my outside on like my insight on like,
oh,

2782
02:35:12.491 --> 02:35:15.670
am I going to win or lose?
I think that helps me to her.
Now.

2783
02:35:15.671 --> 02:35:18.820
They built this model too,
where it's like you can be ultimate for,

2784
02:35:18.821 --> 02:35:22.200
you can be a UFC fighter,
professional fighter,
and a,

2785
02:35:22.540 --> 02:35:24.850
you can do all these great things,
which is absolutely amazing.

2786
02:35:24.850 --> 02:35:28.840
I'm not bagging on that Maura ed are because it's given me the opportunity to

2787
02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:31.490
sit here in front of you and I have this conversation and for me and my wife to

2788
02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:32.860
be able to travel the world and see things.

2789
02:35:32.861 --> 02:35:37.861
But I think that people really need to look at it and dissect it before they

2790
02:35:39.461 --> 02:35:41.230
jumped all into it.
Yeah.

2791
02:35:41.231 --> 02:35:44.770
And I think one of the more devastating things about this Reebok situation is

2792
02:35:44.771 --> 02:35:48.960
that fighters can't make money outside of their paycheck.
I want to,
I want to,

2793
02:35:49.770 --> 02:35:53.440
uh,
elaborate on that.
Here's my piece.
Even though you didn't fucking ask for it.

2794
02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:57.220
Please do.
I think the Reebok deal is good.
How dare you?
Uh,
um,

2795
02:35:57.410 --> 02:35:59.020
I'm gonna keep it fucking real.
I'm keep it real.

2796
02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:03.370
There's been times where I find I never got paid,
you know.
Um,

2797
02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:08.170
there's been times where we were going in negotiating about,
uh,
sponsors,

2798
02:36:08.230 --> 02:36:12.220
sponsors one time.
There was a point in time where Xbox and told me,
I'm like,

2799
02:36:12.221 --> 02:36:16.200
dude,
we have nothing for you.
I mean we have,
you know,
there's nothing we can uh,

2800
02:36:16.210 --> 02:36:20.560
give,
give it to you.
And I was like,
all right,
well,
ah,

2801
02:36:20.710 --> 02:36:24.130
Xbox,
Xbox,
this is after you were already had a contract with them.

2802
02:36:24.550 --> 02:36:25.930
I never had a contract with those guys.

2803
02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:29.680
So they would just pay you fight the fight.
Fight to fight.
Yeah.
It was a,

2804
02:36:29.690 --> 02:36:32.260
and that's the thing,
people think when we have the Xbox sponsorship,

2805
02:36:32.261 --> 02:36:34.240
you are directly working with fucking Bill Gates.
You're now,

2806
02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:39.310
so that'd be fucking dope.
Like what are you out by?
Like Bill Nikia style,

2807
02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:40.233
where are going to bill?

2808
02:36:42.910 --> 02:36:47.110
You have to fight the Xbox slower.
Yeah.
So there'll be times where,

2809
02:36:47.410 --> 02:36:49.000
um,
you know,
uh,

2810
02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:51.730
if there's not something coming up there where they can advertise or anything,

2811
02:36:51.731 --> 02:36:54.070
but there was point times where I take her into a fight in,

2812
02:36:54.610 --> 02:36:57.670
I got no sponsorship money whatsoever and I went there and I destroyed my

2813
02:36:57.671 --> 02:37:01.120
opponent and people were like,
how could you do that?
How could you do that?

2814
02:37:01.121 --> 02:37:03.850
But in a day I take a step back and look at it like this is fighting.

2815
02:37:03.851 --> 02:37:05.710
I done this to become,

2816
02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:10.690
to show myself to be the best fighter in the world and I would do it because I'm

2817
02:37:10.691 --> 02:37:13.090
fishing.
I'm hoping that one day they were like,
do we want to,

2818
02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:16.100
we want to set you up and get you taken care of and all that

2819
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:20.060
<v 2>stuff and it just shows you that I'm a type of fighter to go out there and snoop</v>

2820
02:37:20.061 --> 02:37:23.360
around and try like,
hey,
hey,
hey,
hey you,
you,
you want to respond to me?

2821
02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:27.380
That's where some managers come and play,
right?
Absolutely.
They come into play,

2822
02:37:27.381 --> 02:37:31.880
but I think the integrity that I had as as a human being and as an athlete,

2823
02:37:31.881 --> 02:37:32.571
that was like,
you know what?

2824
02:37:32.571 --> 02:37:35.960
I've been rocking Xbox the whole entire time and why am I going to run off and

2825
02:37:35.961 --> 02:37:38.170
go throw this person on my,

2826
02:37:38.190 --> 02:37:43.190
my shorts because they're going to throw me $60,000 and I was about $60,000 but

2827
02:37:44.390 --> 02:37:47.600
I have to go out there for Nigga what that person would.
You shouldn't have to.

2828
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:50.030
That's,
I see what you're saying.
I know that.

2829
02:37:50.031 --> 02:37:53.930
But the last thing I want to do is have my manager,
um,
do that.
Um,

2830
02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:55.180
because the only person who,
who,

2831
02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:58.820
who there's me and there's Matt Hume and there's everybody else.

2832
02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:03.740
That's my manager,
my trainer,
my soul.
That's,
he does all that stuff.

2833
02:38:03.770 --> 02:38:05.360
Well that's interesting because that's rare.

2834
02:38:05.390 --> 02:38:10.190
Most guys have like a a manager man or a lot of guns manager.
Manager,

2835
02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:14.390
yeah.
Yeah.
But Matt is a trainer as well as a manager as well as,

2836
02:38:14.391 --> 02:38:17.210
you know what I mean?
He's like,
he's kind of like an all encompassing.

2837
02:38:17.220 --> 02:38:20.070
You just have a very fortunate situation.
Yeah.
Well,
and I just,

2838
02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:22.070
I like it that way because I trust him.

2839
02:38:22.071 --> 02:38:25.970
He wants the best for Demetrius Johnson and I want the best for Matt Hume.

2840
02:38:26.270 --> 02:38:27.710
And so the last thing I want doing,

2841
02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:30.710
it's having fucking Matt running around town trying to scheme me.

2842
02:38:30.740 --> 02:38:33.020
Totally understand that.
Now with Rebekah,
we don't have,

2843
02:38:33.050 --> 02:38:34.520
we don't have to worry about that,
right or wrong.

2844
02:38:34.521 --> 02:38:36.890
It is fucked up for somebody to have their first professional fight,

2845
02:38:36.891 --> 02:38:37.910
maybe $2,500.

2846
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:43.150
They can make more money from fucking Mcdonald's sponsorship for a chicken

2847
02:38:43.401 --> 02:38:45.530
nuggets that they have a dollar special going on.
Well,

2848
02:38:45.531 --> 02:38:49.370
it's guys like Brendan Schaub that we're making more than a hundred thousand

2849
02:38:49.370 --> 02:38:53.410
dollars a fight,
a paycheck for that.
Alex saw it.
I saw his financials.

2850
02:38:53.570 --> 02:38:57.020
We're there.
We go.
Because he was telling me this and I said,
well,
please,

2851
02:38:57.230 --> 02:39:01.920
I can't say that I know that you did this unless you give me all your
financials.

2852
02:39:02.730 --> 02:39:07.330
He sent me all his financials.
He made 140 for one of his fights as sponsors.

2853
02:39:07.550 --> 02:39:11.510
Hundred 40 on tour Man v Tours losing millions.
Really?

2854
02:39:11.511 --> 02:39:12.710
According to his wife,

2855
02:39:12.980 --> 02:39:16.160
who I have no reason to doubt he's losing millions of dollars.

2856
02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:18.990
That's why they should come out straight up were like,
dude,
you're not.

2857
02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:21.830
When Reebok deal first came out,
like,
like I said,

2858
02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:24.650
the one thing I love about the reorg though is that I don't have to run around

2859
02:39:24.651 --> 02:39:27.140
and try to finagle with anybody.
I appreciate it though.

2860
02:39:27.180 --> 02:39:32.180
If I was making millions and millions of dollars as sponsorship,

2861
02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:36.640
I would fucking come on,
but like,
you can't hate it.
Hey didn't wait.

2862
02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:41.120
I know you got the sports being all you know great and stuff,

2863
02:39:41.121 --> 02:39:45.230
but I'm making $2 million on sponsorships.
You don't fucking believe me.

2864
02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:46.190
Here's the paycheck.

2865
02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:49.400
I'll post this bitch online to show the whole world that yes,

2866
02:39:49.401 --> 02:39:50.360
Reebok's all good and stuff,

2867
02:39:50.361 --> 02:39:55.040
but I'm missing $2 million so you tell me what's right for the fighters and

2868
02:39:55.041 --> 02:39:57.080
what's right for the sport.
And in all honesty,

2869
02:39:57.081 --> 02:40:00.170
I don't think the UFC knew how much fighters from making was one of the reasons

2870
02:40:00.171 --> 02:40:02.210
why Dana was saying that Brendan Schaub was a liar.

2871
02:40:02.450 --> 02:40:05.780
I don't think he knew I showed out.
Well he knows.

2872
02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:08.570
I mean I just don't,
I don't think they knew.

2873
02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:13.190
I think they made a mistake in that regard and I think that,
you know,

2874
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:17.640
their idea was that this is a gigantic sponsor that's going to up the profile of

2875
02:40:17.641 --> 02:40:18.474
the sport.

2876
02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:24.020
I honestly true Harley bleed that when the UFC wouldn't it d or even Reebok

2877
02:40:24.901 --> 02:40:28.770
wouldn't have to deal with Reebok.
When you se in Reebok shook hands.

2878
02:40:29.100 --> 02:40:32.700
I think it was for the better.
The sport,
better for this,
for the fighters.

2879
02:40:32.701 --> 02:40:33.810
I don't think that anyone,
I was like,

2880
02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:41.340
oh well if he did,
he'd probably way more paranoid.
Well,
I dunno.
Trust me.

2881
02:40:42.830 --> 02:40:47.400
I feel that when they went into that they were hoping for the best for both

2882
02:40:47.401 --> 02:40:51.510
sides,
for the fighters and the UFC and the sport itself.
No,

2883
02:40:51.511 --> 02:40:54.330
I don't think they would ever do something that I thought would hurt the UFC or

2884
02:40:54.331 --> 02:40:56.950
hurt the fighters.
I just think that,
uh,

2885
02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:00.570
it probably should have been investigated a little bit more for thoroughly and

2886
02:41:00.571 --> 02:41:01.560
it probably should have been,

2887
02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:06.900
it should have been handled a little bit more competently then you wouldn't have

2888
02:41:06.901 --> 02:41:08.550
Anderson Aldo tee shirts.

2889
02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:12.240
You wouldn't have Anthony Pettis being called the fucking Mauler on their

2890
02:41:12.250 --> 02:41:15.580
website.
Hey,
somebody just found out that I had shirts on there,
so some good,

2891
02:41:15.581 --> 02:41:18.650
it was like,
dude,
I can't fight your touching.
I was like,
uh,
I dunno.

2892
02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:20.640
The nights like I looked at,
I was like,
oh,
here they are.
He goes,

2893
02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:22.860
I've been looking all fucking day and I couldn't find him.

2894
02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:25.910
Shop won't even sign the deal.
They keep coming to him to sign the deal.

2895
02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:28.440
He's like,
not interested.
I just had any deal.
Yeah,

2896
02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:31.140
well they won't send his stuff.

2897
02:41:31.290 --> 02:41:34.020
They won't sell his stuff unless he signs a deal and he just won't do it.

2898
02:41:34.050 --> 02:41:37.170
It'd get for him and he's just put most likely going to retire anyway.

2899
02:41:37.171 --> 02:41:42.110
But he did retired.
Any sort of kind of,
I'm,
I'm at the point in my career,

2900
02:41:42.111 --> 02:41:46.200
do I know that?
I have to ask Daniel.
Daniel has told me this from day one.

2901
02:41:46.201 --> 02:41:48.360
I remember the UFC fighter Sam's,
he should do,
he's like,

2902
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:52.030
you guys have to use the platform that we're providing you guys to build a

2903
02:41:52.031 --> 02:41:52.864
market yourself.

2904
02:41:53.070 --> 02:41:56.880
And I had never realized what he was saying until now I'm in this point of my

2905
02:41:56.881 --> 02:42:01.620
career,
like I've had,
I,
you know,
I had defended my title seven times and

2906
02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:06.560
I always refer to myself as the redheaded stepchild that I don't,

2907
02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:11.340
I don't get the same type of publicity as other fighters do,

2908
02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:12.690
which I'm totally fine with it.
Well,

2909
02:42:12.691 --> 02:42:15.870
what's interesting is like a guy like Conor is only 20 pounds heavier than you.

2910
02:42:16.230 --> 02:42:19.000
Yeah.
It's not a,
not a size difference.
I mean there's,

2911
02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:22.590
there's a big fucking size different.
I've stood next to the man.

2912
02:42:22.591 --> 02:42:25.230
He's fucking towering over me.
He can see the ball top of it.

2913
02:42:25.231 --> 02:42:27.570
He probably see his reflection and this shiny bald head,
my friend.

2914
02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:31.200
Isn't it weird though?
That's only 20 pounds.
Yeah,
it's true.
It's only 20 pounds,

2915
02:42:31.410 --> 02:42:35.850
but it's,
it's,
you know,
it's,
it's the way life is.
As somebody told me,

2916
02:42:36.570 --> 02:42:38.640
people like to see bigger people fight.
Okay,

2917
02:42:38.670 --> 02:42:41.100
but how come Tj Dillashaw gets a ton of press?

2918
02:42:41.370 --> 02:42:44.490
He's only 10 pounds heavier than you.
I don't know.
There you go.
Right?

2919
02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:48.270
You think it's because I'm black?
I don't know.
Cause you're black.
No.

2920
02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:53.200
Could that be it?
Jesus said no,
I never thought about that until just now.
No,

2921
02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:54.180
I don't know what it is,
man.

2922
02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:58.770
I think there's something about like flyweights there's something about like the

2923
02:42:58.771 --> 02:43:03.420
lightest weight that for whatever reason,
people don't appreciate someone who,

2924
02:43:03.450 --> 02:43:06.510
even when you knock guys out at that weight class,

2925
02:43:06.511 --> 02:43:09.720
I don't know what the fuck it is,
man.
I don't know what it is.
It's that good.

2926
02:43:09.721 --> 02:43:11.950
I sparked a guy the other day.
He's in,
he comes to,

2927
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:16.630
<v 0>he comes to train with us cause he's a,
he kept his training and he does a,</v>

2928
02:43:16.690 --> 02:43:19.930
like he's a huge gambler,
a professional poker player.

2929
02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:22.870
And he kept bars and he comes to spar.

2930
02:43:22.871 --> 02:43:25.630
He comes to get ready because I shouldn't be good for your brain.
No,
no,
no,
no.

2931
02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:29.380
I don't have enough brain.
But he,
uh,
he does,

2932
02:43:29.381 --> 02:43:34.360
I'm betting it gets other poker players and he has a gamble going on that he's

2933
02:43:34.361 --> 02:43:37.960
going to fight somebody for,
I think it was,
if he wins,
he gets $270,000.

2934
02:43:37.961 --> 02:43:41.380
So the guy backs out,
he gets like 190,000.
Whoa.
He comes,

2935
02:43:41.381 --> 02:43:45.190
he comes to AMC to get ready for his fights and uh,

2936
02:43:45.250 --> 02:43:48.310
he's way bigger than me.
Right.
And then were sparring and like mouths,

2937
02:43:48.311 --> 02:43:51.850
like you're gonna Spark Demetrius Johnson and we're sparring.
And uh,

2938
02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:53.410
I hit him in his stump,
I'll,
you know,

2939
02:43:53.411 --> 02:43:55.950
I was doing my thing and booboo and when we hit him in the liver and he goes,
Oh,

2940
02:43:56.580 --> 02:44:01.290
oh,
ah,
yeah.
And then I start hitting him in the face.
I was like,
I don't,

2941
02:44:01.570 --> 02:44:04.630
I'm very nice.
I tell all my spar partners before,
if I say,

2942
02:44:04.631 --> 02:44:06.940
I promise you I will never hurt you,
I might,

2943
02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:09.820
it might feel like fucking shit and hell by guarantee.

2944
02:44:09.821 --> 02:44:12.520
You'll be able to go to work on Monday because a lot of my training partners,

2945
02:44:12.521 --> 02:44:16.390
when I get with my fights,
they have normal nine to five jobs and so I hit,

2946
02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:17.680
I was sitting in the face.
I was like,
oh,

2947
02:44:17.681 --> 02:44:20.920
isn't it amazing how the body just reacts when he gets hit in the liver?

2948
02:44:21.070 --> 02:44:24.570
You don't even care.
I'm hitting the face right now.
These are Britney spears.

2949
02:44:24.580 --> 02:44:28.040
Heigel Wham,
right?
And somebody goes,
okay,
I got to take a break about,
it's like,

2950
02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:31.630
give him a break.
We'll kick Dj.
But it's like,
it's,

2951
02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:34.270
if a person is all you were too small,
too small.
If I,
and I was like,
dude,

2952
02:44:34.271 --> 02:44:36.370
we can spar him when we can see how it's going to go.
Like,

2953
02:44:36.371 --> 02:44:37.790
I'm not going to be dig or a hope,

2954
02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:42.170
but I'm going to use my skillset that Matt has provided me with to this

2955
02:44:42.260 --> 02:44:46.000
dismantle to you and show you you need to respect me as a,

2956
02:44:46.030 --> 02:44:50.020
as a smaller person I guess.
I mean,
I don't know how it was.
No,

2957
02:44:50.021 --> 02:44:51.970
I know what you're saying.
I know,
I know exactly what you're saying.

2958
02:44:51.971 --> 02:44:54.340
I think it's a perception issue.
When you,

2959
02:44:54.341 --> 02:44:58.060
when Matt structures or training camp,
he does the whole thing.

2960
02:44:58.061 --> 02:45:00.310
He does strength and conditioning.
He does your kickboxing,

2961
02:45:00.311 --> 02:45:03.190
wrestling every decides what you do on any given day.

2962
02:45:03.340 --> 02:45:06.820
There's days I'll come in and I'm like,
I'll be mentally prepared because,

2963
02:45:07.060 --> 02:45:09.670
you know,
I always love that.
How you say,
um,

2964
02:45:09.850 --> 02:45:13.660
I want to see his fucking a shrift conditioner program and if you saw you'd be

2965
02:45:13.661 --> 02:45:15.370
like,
what the fuck are you doing my friend?

2966
02:45:18.830 --> 02:45:21.110
You just have to come watch it.
Like it's just,

2967
02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:25.600
it's just random shit.
Like it's just crazy.
It's just crazy.

2968
02:45:25.601 --> 02:45:29.070
Like it's always structured.
Totally different.
Like,
you know,

2969
02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:30.820
I'll come and physically like trust me,

2970
02:45:30.821 --> 02:45:33.190
it beats the hell out of me where I come in Monday night,

2971
02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:36.100
like I'll do our Monday morning practice.
I call,
I'm like,
Hey Babe,

2972
02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:39.550
I'm gonna go get some food.
I eat the same thing every single day.
I wake up,

2973
02:45:39.610 --> 02:45:43.120
have the same food.
You eat the same thing every day,
every fucking day.

2974
02:45:43.180 --> 02:45:45.880
What do you eat?
So in the morning when it's training camp time,

2975
02:45:45.881 --> 02:45:50.590
I have maybe three eggs and toast with cheese on it with Tabasco sauce.

2976
02:45:50.980 --> 02:45:53.740
Then that's all I have for breakfast and I have a little glass of wine when she

2977
02:45:53.741 --> 02:45:57.040
was not alive.
I like that.
Don't like the one she was sugar sugar?
Yeah,

2978
02:45:57.340 --> 02:45:58.173
they got to the gym.

2979
02:45:58.390 --> 02:46:01.720
I do my heart attempts in interval whole day and it might be depending on where

2980
02:46:01.721 --> 02:46:02.860
we're at and training camp.

2981
02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:08.700
Typically the ones I do I fucking hate is the power explosion because I'm

2982
02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:13.070
throwing up.
I don't like lifting weights.
Like I like lifting weights,

2983
02:46:13.071 --> 02:46:15.340
but I don't like them weights when it comes to just strictly fight it.

2984
02:46:15.350 --> 02:46:17.390
I don't like what the weights because the person had to let,

2985
02:46:17.391 --> 02:46:19.820
that was 125 fucking pounds.
Well supposedly.

2986
02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:24.140
So we do that and then I take a break.
I go to Teryaki madness.

2987
02:46:24.141 --> 02:46:27.350
I have teriyaki with brown rice and cucumbers.
I eat that.

2988
02:46:27.380 --> 02:46:31.640
Then I go across the street and get my PCC.
I have an apple PC,

2989
02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:34.640
it's like a whole foods in Seattle.
I have an apple,

2990
02:46:34.790 --> 02:46:37.940
maybe a banana and some type of nuts and I felt my gallon of water again.

2991
02:46:38.210 --> 02:46:42.050
Then I sit there and I play video games until five o'clock or five 30 or six go

2992
02:46:42.051 --> 02:46:47.051
across to go cross walk next door doing Muay Thai pads and then we'll,

2993
02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:51.740
I'll do a hard grappling or we'll break down video and drill and then next day I

2994
02:46:51.741 --> 02:46:56.260
do the exact same thing.
Wednesday I do exact same thing,
Thursdays off,
right?

2995
02:46:56.261 --> 02:46:59.000
I do the exact same thing.
Saturday I got mint sparring.
That's it.

2996
02:46:59.180 --> 02:47:02.570
So when people are like,
when I look at fighting,
this is my full time job.

2997
02:47:02.571 --> 02:47:06.110
So when people are like,
I love dating wise comment,
people,
you know,
champions.

2998
02:47:06.111 --> 02:47:09.440
They can't take the pressure of being a champion,
being the fucking champions.

2999
02:47:09.441 --> 02:47:12.530
If you ask me,
I'll have dudes go out there fucking fight and they'd wait.

3000
02:47:12.650 --> 02:47:13.910
Literally,
that's all I had to do.

3001
02:47:14.210 --> 02:47:18.170
I don't let any distractions get into my way of my fighting.
Like if somebody,

3002
02:47:18.171 --> 02:47:21.620
if someone's like,
you know,
Matt,
I'll talk about,
I was like,
Matt,
you know,

3003
02:47:21.621 --> 02:47:24.350
my goal is I want to do movies.
I want to be able to do something.

3004
02:47:24.610 --> 02:47:25.820
I want to go fight for so long.

3005
02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:30.410
Like when I start making those 2 million or three more formally,
if,

3006
02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:34.760
if I ever make that from fighting,
then I won't worry about doing fucking movies.

3007
02:47:34.761 --> 02:47:38.510
I'm worried I'm trying to do movies now because I'm not making that because I

3008
02:47:38.511 --> 02:47:40.820
want to go fight for so long and so,

3009
02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:43.010
but if I made five or $6 million in the bank,

3010
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:44.870
I wouldn't even worry about anything else.

3011
02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:47.810
So that's why I put on my heart and soul into fighting because hopefully one day

3012
02:47:48.050 --> 02:47:49.060
it opens those doors,

3013
02:47:49.061 --> 02:47:53.230
a little vampires and pay time,

3014
02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:56.200
five times fight that fight time.
So

3015
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:02.540
porn vampires are going to come in.
But that's like,

3016
02:48:02.570 --> 02:48:06.770
so when I say I do the same thing every single day for eight weeks to 10 weeks,

3017
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:10.700
I live,
breathe,
eat training.
That's all I do.

3018
02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:12.860
So you take Thursdays off every week,
every week,

3019
02:48:12.861 --> 02:48:15.300
Thursdays and Sundays off two days a week.
Oh yeah.

3020
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:20.060
And Wednesday is only a morning session and Saturday is only a morning session.

3021
02:48:20.061 --> 02:48:24.530
So I typically take Wednesday night off,
Thursday off Friday,

3022
02:48:24.531 --> 02:48:27.920
double Saturday.
Would you come to this from trial and error?

3023
02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:32.970
Trial and error with Matt because I told him,
I was like,
dude,
because uh,

3024
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:35.750
the beginning of it,
um,
I would train Monday,

3025
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:39.020
Tuesday a double and then Wednesday night our train.

3026
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:41.720
So I will rest all day morning,
Wednesday.

3027
02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:45.380
And then within that we were trained and then I felt like Thursday was almost

3028
02:48:45.381 --> 02:48:46.580
like a recovery day.

3029
02:48:47.060 --> 02:48:50.150
And then on Friday I didn't feel as good because I was so beat down.

3030
02:48:50.151 --> 02:48:52.640
And so I was like,
Matt,
let's try Monday.
Tuesday.

3031
02:48:52.650 --> 02:48:56.660
My Body's is to shit on by Wednesday and I was like,

3032
02:48:56.661 --> 02:48:58.130
let's just go with hammer it through Wednesday.

3033
02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:02.420
Then I get Wednesday night off to relax.
Then I get Thursday off to relax.

3034
02:49:02.690 --> 02:49:07.380
Then my Friday,
my mind mentally I'm like fresh,
refocused bodies,
fresh,

3035
02:49:07.381 --> 02:49:11.820
refocused.
We hammered Friday,
then Saturday morning to becoming hard,
hard spine,

3036
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:15.840
MMA I then Saturday night I'm off Sunday,
I'm off Monday start again.

3037
02:49:16.230 --> 02:49:18.750
I'm like refresh and we don't get it.
Why don't we start our week?

3038
02:49:18.751 --> 02:49:20.940
We don't get into like hard sparring.
We spar,

3039
02:49:21.230 --> 02:49:26.040
I'm going be spar twice a week and maybe one maybe one week.

3040
02:49:26.041 --> 02:49:26.874
Super Hard,

3041
02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:31.020
but I don't wear headgear when I sparked because we were not a big believers of

3042
02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:34.650
hitting people in the head.
Heart.
That's so smart man.
It's so smart.

3043
02:49:34.651 --> 02:49:38.310
You're the idea of taking those rest periods to cause a lot of people don't want

3044
02:49:38.311 --> 02:49:41.460
to do that.
They don't want to take those days off.
I never wanted to do.

3045
02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:45.620
I never wanted to do it before.
But then when I thought one time,
hours,

3046
02:49:45.710 --> 02:49:49.140
well rested,
like when I fought Dodson the second time,

3047
02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:53.820
like after the fight was that I was like,
Joe Rogan,
you son of a bitch,

3048
02:49:53.821 --> 02:49:56.520
you look pretty with it.
Never go ahead.
What we want to talk about it.

3049
02:49:56.730 --> 02:49:59.700
I felt rested.
Like I thought,
why wouldn't you go another six,
seven rounds?

3050
02:49:59.701 --> 02:50:02.370
Even though I had that cause you weren't overtrained wasn't overtrained.

3051
02:50:02.371 --> 02:50:05.760
I was very well rested and sometimes there was sat and mental capacity to where,

3052
02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:08.790
you know,
there's times I was like,
Okay Matt,
Matt's okay.
He'd be like,

3053
02:50:08.820 --> 02:50:11.850
you're done for today.
I'll be like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I want to get it back.

3054
02:50:11.851 --> 02:50:13.470
I'm going to get some of my Miguel Cotto rounds.

3055
02:50:13.471 --> 02:50:16.320
I'm going to hit the bat like a box.
And he goes,
no,
you're good.

3056
02:50:16.350 --> 02:50:19.290
There's no point because you have many more years to come to.

3057
02:50:19.291 --> 02:50:23.670
We're going to put those arms to you so you're done for the day.
Go home.

3058
02:50:23.790 --> 02:50:26.580
And he would tell me to go home,
it sounded like.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
go ahead.

3059
02:50:26.581 --> 02:50:29.990
Go ahead.
You need to do more rounds of the day.
It's so smart,
man.
And that's,

3060
02:50:29.991 --> 02:50:34.080
that's,
that's the fucking results speaks for itself.
Yeah,
yeah,
absolutely.

3061
02:50:34.081 --> 02:50:38.520
And that's why like now,
like I'm,
I'm,
I'm fucking itch and I'm scratching.

3062
02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:41.220
I'm just,
I'm at the point now where I'm just like,
fuck,

3063
02:50:41.250 --> 02:50:44.100
I'm just waiting for the UFC to,
of like,
Hey,
this is who you're fighting next.

3064
02:50:44.101 --> 02:50:47.070
This is the date.
So you don't know who your next opponent is.
Do not know.

3065
02:50:47.071 --> 02:50:49.720
Who Do you think will be?
They see they see it.
It pops the hearing.
Pseudo.

3066
02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:53.000
But I never get,
I never get married to that,

3067
02:50:53.001 --> 02:50:57.150
that opponent because at any day it could be Henry Su Hutto six weeks into camp

3068
02:50:57.151 --> 02:50:59.420
he can get injured and then they give me somebody else.
Here's,

3069
02:50:59.470 --> 02:51:02.940
isn't it crazy Joe?
So who knows.
Only had a few fights in the UFC and already,

3070
02:51:02.941 --> 02:51:06.570
I mean that's the business.
How many easy he three fights at flight.

3071
02:51:08.410 --> 02:51:12.100
Four oh five he fought dusted creamer.
That was at one third of vacancy.
Miss.

3072
02:51:12.101 --> 02:51:15.150
Wait,
no,
he fired.
I don't know.
He was supposed to fight Scott Georgeson.

3073
02:51:15.151 --> 02:51:16.200
Are we supposed to firefly?
Wait,

3074
02:51:16.410 --> 02:51:19.950
he missed weight wasn't the first time he missed weight and then cheering for me

3075
02:51:19.951 --> 02:51:24.840
goes his last fight.
The last fight.
Yeah.
And then he finds his opponent who yeah,

3076
02:51:24.841 --> 02:51:27.810
he is good.
That was good fun.
Yeah,
he was good faith.

3077
02:51:29.430 --> 02:51:32.940
We'll talk later.
We'll talk later.
Um,
when he,

3078
02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:34.480
in fact that's tomorrow at one 30,

3079
02:51:34.481 --> 02:51:38.580
if I beat him and then he went down and one to 25 again and then he fired a
shot.

3080
02:51:38.580 --> 02:51:41.730
I can't remember what he thought.
Ah.

3081
02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:45.570
Chris Curry also beat him.
Chill came as beat him.

3082
02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:50.080
Jucier for mega beat him.
So he's on a four fight win streak.
Three friends.

3083
02:51:50.580 --> 02:51:53.550
Did he fight Chico at 35 or 25?
22 came.

3084
02:51:53.570 --> 02:51:58.530
Mrs Chico was a good fucking fight.
She goes craft.
Yeah.
He,

3085
02:51:58.650 --> 02:52:02.340
for him not being arrested,
he has the best a take down a fence for wrestling.

3086
02:52:02.370 --> 02:52:05.590
But it's very slow,
but it's only,
that's the thing I was of you.
I was like,

3087
02:52:05.620 --> 02:52:08.780
yes he has.
People are like,
oh man.
Do you think you that you could take it out?

3088
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:09.460
I was like,

3089
02:52:09.460 --> 02:52:12.490
probably because my fighting style is totally different from Chico Caymus Chico

3090
02:52:12.491 --> 02:52:13.210
came.
Yes,

3091
02:52:13.210 --> 02:52:16.990
he likes you defend takedowns and he's 100% successful at defending because he's

3092
02:52:16.991 --> 02:52:18.580
only defendant when I'm at is Finna take down,

3093
02:52:18.790 --> 02:52:20.110
I'm going to be looking at the fucking elbow,

3094
02:52:20.111 --> 02:52:23.890
you and [inaudible] and a [inaudible],
which is going to give up my hips.

3095
02:52:24.040 --> 02:52:27.610
So there's a like,
like people are like,
one of the things I love about Matt,

3096
02:52:27.611 --> 02:52:32.000
he says,
you're going to make mistakes in a fight.
Demetrius or DJ.
He goes,
me,
Dj,

3097
02:52:32.290 --> 02:52:34.390
you're going to make fight,
make mistakes in the fights,

3098
02:52:34.630 --> 02:52:37.060
but it's about how you were covered for them.

3099
02:52:37.210 --> 02:52:41.350
Mistakes will makes a huge difference.
So if I get taken down,
I'm like,
ah,

3100
02:52:41.640 --> 02:52:44.980
I've got to take it down and fuck I'm,
I'm screwed on.
I gotta get off my back.

3101
02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:50.050
That takedown was humongous in the scorecards and in the judge's eyes.

3102
02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:52.960
But if I get taken down,
I'm like,
okay,
I gotta take it now.
Perfect.
You got me?

3103
02:52:52.961 --> 02:52:56.050
Okay.
I'm pushing your head down.
Okay,
I'm getting up.
Skewing your hips way.
Okay.

3104
02:52:56.051 --> 02:52:58.780
That's what you're pushing me on back on my feet.
There's a need to liver.
Okay,

3105
02:52:58.781 --> 02:53:01.390
there's an elbow.
You're backing up.
Oh,
can come forward.
I'm a switch of Sapa.

3106
02:53:01.510 --> 02:53:03.970
Here's a body kick on back to Orthodox.
Here's this,
this,

3107
02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:09.280
that takedown mean nothing.
Nothing at all.
Right,
and so that's my mind.

3108
02:53:09.281 --> 02:53:12.700
Don't give in to that tape.
Don't give half the fuck are we going to do?

3109
02:53:12.750 --> 02:53:16.840
Granted me,
you're not gonna knock me out that way.
It's just the way that I see.

3110
02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:19.420
I view fighting from the judges to where the judges are like,

3111
02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:26.450
<v 1>well,
the judges,
who knows what the fuck they're doing.
Yeah.
Like half the time,</v>

3112
02:53:27.210 --> 02:53:30.540
50% of them are completely incompetent.
No chocolate.

3113
02:53:30.541 --> 02:53:33.090
Dell told me this once is a really interesting thing.
He said,

3114
02:53:33.091 --> 02:53:36.360
one of the most important things is if you get taken down the moment you feel

3115
02:53:36.361 --> 02:53:40.290
your back touch the ground,
you have to explode.
Yeah.
He goes,
guys,
rest.
They go,

3116
02:53:40.291 --> 02:53:43.740
fuck.
The guy took me down and they just worked from there.
He goes,

3117
02:53:43.741 --> 02:53:46.320
you can't do that.
The moment your back touches the ground,

3118
02:53:46.321 --> 02:53:49.890
you have to immediately,
they trying to pummel,
get that under hook,

3119
02:53:49.950 --> 02:53:52.470
get back up to your feet.
He goes,
you can't wait.
You can't wait.

3120
02:53:52.471 --> 02:53:55.890
It's those split second moment is the difference between taking a breath and

3121
02:53:55.891 --> 02:54:00.120
then now the guy's pinned down on you side controller and half the weight.
Yeah.

3122
02:54:00.220 --> 02:54:02.260
<v 0>Wait,
sorry.
Sound.
I remember the first time I fought Brad Pigott.</v>

3123
02:54:02.530 --> 02:54:03.610
Well not the first time.

3124
02:54:03.611 --> 02:54:08.080
The only time I felt bad take it and I was holding him like this,

3125
02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:11.350
holding her in.
That and Matt,
when we got back home from uh,

3126
02:54:11.830 --> 02:54:14.830
the fight in app are my heat,
my broken and healed and Hebrew nor the fight.

3127
02:54:14.831 --> 02:54:19.480
When he goes,
we'll watch on the funding goes garbage,
garbage,

3128
02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:22.400
garbage.
What are you doing there?

3129
02:54:22.401 --> 02:54:24.850
Are you going to get up or are you just holding it to your chest garbage?

3130
02:54:25.150 --> 02:54:29.110
And so that,
that,
that's how I was raised.
Like almost see like people were like,

3131
02:54:29.130 --> 02:54:32.650
dude,
the other day someone was like,
do you have a college education?
I'm like,

3132
02:54:32.651 --> 02:54:35.510
yes,
I do.
I have a college education in a university of AMC,

3133
02:54:35.610 --> 02:54:39.790
a school of hard knocks because that's how it was like,
yeah,
Matt would like,

3134
02:54:39.820 --> 02:54:43.030
I would when my amateur fights and that will just,
and in the,
uh,
in the gym,

3135
02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:46.120
I'll come in.
He would just beat them.
He'd beat me up.
He would like,
dude,

3136
02:54:46.121 --> 02:54:48.250
we're going to,
and we were sparring.
He'll loop beat me up man.

3137
02:54:48.251 --> 02:54:49.990
One point I was like,
I think he's mad at me.

3138
02:54:50.020 --> 02:54:53.440
Like I thought that I do something wrong.
And then like when I,

3139
02:54:53.620 --> 02:54:57.990
when I got knee WC in the UFC,
like I want to get his key out motto.
Then he,
oh,

3140
02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:01.300
come back to the gym and we'll fight it.
You beat the hell.
I'm like,
the fuck.

3141
02:55:01.301 --> 02:55:04.040
I'll come over like,
babe,
I think Matt's met him,
that post anything.

3142
02:55:05.830 --> 02:55:09.410
I'll look at my tweets.
I'm like,
everything was good.
I didn't Kasserine I'm good.

3143
02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:12.710
He just wants to keep you hungry.
He keeps me home in humble.
He goes,
he goes,

3144
02:55:12.711 --> 02:55:14.060
you're on top of the world right now.
He goes,

3145
02:55:14.330 --> 02:55:16.910
I need you to break you back there and let you know you don't know shit about

3146
02:55:16.911 --> 02:55:20.210
the fight,
dude.
Seriously.
That's how it was.
He goes,

3147
02:55:20.211 --> 02:55:23.840
you don't know shit and what does he say?
No,
like after the Dodson fight,

3148
02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:25.520
good job.
When I get back to work,

3149
02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:30.350
he's just good job in nurse things when you work and I'm way worse than he is

3150
02:55:30.351 --> 02:55:33.140
now.
He's like,
dude,
you need to be excited.
You need some of your face.
I'm like,

3151
02:55:33.350 --> 02:55:37.970
Nah,
I should have fucking finished him.
I had the gas tank,
I have to cardio.

3152
02:55:37.971 --> 02:55:41.480
I had the skill set to finish them and I didn't get the job done and he goes,

3153
02:55:41.481 --> 02:55:45.370
yes,
I know.
I know because I like that.
When I was after a fight,

3154
02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:47.720
I broke a tooth off.
I was walking and I was like,
that fight was shit.

3155
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:51.560
That was a shitty ass fight and I'm walking in here.
It's like,
yeah,

3156
02:55:51.561 --> 02:55:55.730
do we just come on,
come on,
I'm,
and I'm just like fucking fight with shitty.

3157
02:55:55.730 --> 02:55:59.030
I don't to fucking know.
It says Matt Goes,
you need to celebrate your fans.

3158
02:55:59.031 --> 02:56:02.900
You need,
you need to be happy.
He won't like that.
Just being with us,
I was like,

3159
02:56:03.410 --> 02:56:08.410
I was like,
hmm,
that took too long.
And,
and that's how it should be.
Like I'm,
I'm,

3160
02:56:08.411 --> 02:56:12.260
I'm,
I'm,
I,
I am my worst critic because I know what I am capable of love.

3161
02:56:12.261 --> 02:56:15.290
And I know how hard I trained in that knows hard,
harder training.

3162
02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:19.850
But so now it's kind of vice versa.
He's beat me down so much to her now.

3163
02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:20.870
Like my wife's like,

3164
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:23.060
you're such a Debbie Downer even though you fucking just wine,

3165
02:56:23.061 --> 02:56:26.000
like you don't even know how to celebrate.
I'm like,
sorry.

3166
02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:30.770
She don't sound like no in real life.
She does like that.
Um,
but that's how it is.

3167
02:56:30.771 --> 02:56:33.350
And so that's why I'm always,
I'm just,
I'm just a humble guy.

3168
02:56:33.350 --> 02:56:35.870
So that's why I always want to strive for better.
Like even at the dots a fight.

3169
02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:37.400
I was happy,
don't get me wrong,

3170
02:56:37.401 --> 02:56:41.420
cause I know how dangerous it was and how much shit he was talking and how the

3171
02:56:41.421 --> 02:56:44.430
youth,
like when,
uh,
I saw the preview,
the,

3172
02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:47.960
the higher ups showed me the preview and then showed that and dropping me and

3173
02:56:47.961 --> 02:56:52.550
I'm all falling back like this.
Like I had no chance.
And I go,
okay guys,

3174
02:56:52.551 --> 02:56:55.370
I love,
I love it.
I love what you're trying to do here.
Trying to sell the fight.

3175
02:56:55.371 --> 02:56:59.780
But why the fuck he gets Sean back to drop me three times.
He goes,
do we make it,

3176
02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:04.550
make it,
show the public that you have a chance to lose her?
I was like,
yeah,

3177
02:57:04.551 --> 02:57:07.400
I'm about that model guys.
I'm going to,
yeah,

3178
02:57:07.401 --> 02:57:08.840
I'm not a big fan of your guys' trailer.

3179
02:57:09.070 --> 02:57:11.990
And I told her straight up and they're like,
well they don't tell you.

3180
02:57:11.991 --> 02:57:14.240
So after that fight I was very happy,

3181
02:57:14.270 --> 02:57:19.220
very confident where my skill set is in my,
in my head and physically.

3182
02:57:20.210 --> 02:57:22.780
Well,
the results speak for themselves,
man.
I mean that,

3183
02:57:22.810 --> 02:57:25.790
that displeasure in even your great performances,

3184
02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:28.580
like constant striving for perfection.

3185
02:57:29.030 --> 02:57:31.640
That's what's made you the best pound for pound fighter in the world,
man.

3186
02:57:31.970 --> 02:57:34.880
Keep it up.
No I don't.
I'm,
I'm just waiting.

3187
02:57:34.881 --> 02:57:38.780
I told him that and the hardest thing you find is that as I get older,

3188
02:57:38.781 --> 02:57:42.110
I'm 29 and I don't try to take any supplements at all because you didn't get,

3189
02:57:42.111 --> 02:57:46.100
never tell with them what's in them.
What is,

3190
02:57:46.101 --> 02:57:49.550
what is code like Chelsea,
I said,
I don't have a fucking list.
What's in,

3191
02:57:49.610 --> 02:57:54.460
what's being Usada but we had Jeff,
no Wicki and we went over the list.
Oh,

3192
02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:58.730
of all the stuff that's that they've sell it like GNC that turns out to be

3193
02:57:58.731 --> 02:58:01.360
steroids,
have the shit was probably everything.

3194
02:58:01.710 --> 02:58:03.840
He's incredible and we'll do it like,
oh man,

3195
02:58:03.841 --> 02:58:04.680
why didn't you don't want to Instagram?

3196
02:58:04.770 --> 02:58:09.110
Oh this fucking pure Overgaard Scott pre workout shits got roids in a bitch.

3197
02:58:09.150 --> 02:58:09.540
I was like,

3198
02:58:09.540 --> 02:58:12.520
I don't even know where people work out is those hard dick pills they sell at

3199
02:58:12.521 --> 02:58:14.820
gas stations.
While those are steroids too.

3200
02:58:14.821 --> 02:58:17.100
It turns out a lot of steroids out there.

3201
02:58:17.170 --> 02:58:21.060
And so because they can just sell them and then they get pulled off the shelves

3202
02:58:21.061 --> 02:58:24.210
and they just come back with a new company name and sell some more shit.

3203
02:58:24.420 --> 02:58:28.650
And that's why I try not,
I,
I don't take no protein at all.

3204
02:58:28.830 --> 02:58:33.420
And so you get all your supplements from food,
food,
food,
food,
food,
food.

3205
02:58:33.421 --> 02:58:35.730
That's it.
Again,
the results speak for themselves,
man.

3206
02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:38.430
And then when it comes time to,
uh,
as I get older,

3207
02:58:38.431 --> 02:58:43.431
I'm trying to find ways to preserve my body longer to where I met in the gym.

3208
02:58:44.011 --> 02:58:45.210
I'm in the gym learning,

3209
02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:48.660
so I'm at the gym like two days a week trying to learn and drill and do all the

3210
02:58:48.661 --> 02:58:53.310
stuff because I already put the time in if learning so much training with Matt,

3211
02:58:54.210 --> 02:58:57.000
excuse me,
and my amateur days and my Jujitsu days to where now I'm like,

3212
02:58:57.270 --> 02:58:58.230
when it comes to fight time,

3213
02:58:58.260 --> 02:59:01.410
I actually learned more when I'm giving me for my fights because I'm in a gym

3214
02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:03.870
eight weeks straight,
just training,
training.

3215
02:59:03.871 --> 02:59:07.350
You can go so much over your next opponent there where it's like,
fuck,

3216
02:59:07.351 --> 02:59:09.630
let's work on some new,
um,
to,

3217
02:59:09.670 --> 02:59:12.690
whereas now I'm at the point where I'm trying to figure out how do I preserve my

3218
02:59:12.691 --> 02:59:16.380
body to when it comes time for camp,
it's like,
okay,
we're going to start camp.

3219
02:59:16.380 --> 02:59:20.640
What's your weight at one fucking 41 he goes,
that's pretty low.
And I'm like,

3220
02:59:20.641 --> 02:59:24.030
well that's,
I'm not at home getting in fathom working out,

3221
02:59:24.031 --> 02:59:26.340
let them work on my strength.
So that's,

3222
02:59:26.341 --> 02:59:29.640
that's the hardest part I'm finding in my career to where it's like I have to

3223
02:59:29.641 --> 02:59:33.000
wait on somebody else to be successful in this sport,

3224
02:59:33.001 --> 02:59:37.770
for me to build a fight again.
Wow.
That's crazy.
That's a sign of success.
Well,
no,

3225
02:59:37.771 --> 02:59:41.990
it's not waiting.
You're waiting for people to catch up.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

3226
02:59:42.670 --> 02:59:45.430
You're,
you're twisted.
I don't know know it.
Oh,
my own interview.

3227
02:59:45.480 --> 02:59:48.300
That's your point of view.
My point of view is like I'm I,
I'm like,

3228
02:59:48.510 --> 02:59:52.770
I'm like itching and you know my call,
my call,
my calm and I'm like,
ah,

3229
02:59:52.771 --> 02:59:55.920
I don't want to fight there or this or that,
but it's,
it's,

3230
02:59:56.010 --> 02:59:59.220
it's getting that point where I'm like,
like I'm always hungry.

3231
02:59:59.220 --> 03:00:01.950
I'm always this how I pay my bills.
So I put diapers on the baby's butt,

3232
03:00:01.980 --> 03:00:05.730
but I'm just waiting like,
come on.
When is it going to be?
And I want to be,

3233
03:00:06.080 --> 03:00:10.380
I want it if it's on record,
I wanna fight February six and Vegas,

3235
