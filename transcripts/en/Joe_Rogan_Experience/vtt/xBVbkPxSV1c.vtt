1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go live in five,</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.670
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3
00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:07.671
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me about your feminist.</v>

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I got it here.</v>

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl logic.</v>

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.890
<v Speaker 2>It was the difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 2>the genius and the absurdity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between girl logic</v>

8
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:22.660
<v Speaker 2>and boy logic or do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't know,</v>

9
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you exactly the way men </v>
<v Speaker 1>think because I think if I did that it'd</v>

10
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:31.251
<v Speaker 1>be like slow your roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book is about me sort of noticing </v>

11
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>that women are always called crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>psycho psychopaths psycho bitch,</v>

12
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like oh she's insane.</v>

13
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>We always write off women as crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women are expected to be so many things </v>

14
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.101
<v Speaker 1>to so many people at once and if these </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations that sort of we have to </v>

15
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>take into account all of this and we try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be so many things at once and we have</v>

16
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>to take in so much stimuli to process </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this.</v>

17
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:59.031
<v Speaker 1>So our logic is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of this like circumlocutions </v>

18
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking that seems insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slow that word down.</v>

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>What was that circle like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>like going around in circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at work was say it again,</v>

21
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>circle the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this big bird or whatever like that.</v>

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

23
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never heard of the mad cow thing.</v>

24
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>You were telling me that earlier and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

25
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we on?</v>

26
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you were talking about,</v>

27
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please don't make me look stupid.</v>

28
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about El Kevin Crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains,</v>

29
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>but I just the base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boiler plate example is,</v>

30
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say to a girl what do you want to </v>

31
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

32
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's always an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this common trope,</v>

33
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>like my wife couldn't ever figure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

34
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 1>but it has less to do with women wanting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be difficult and more pressure on </v>

35
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>just that one decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I say pizza,</v>

36
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>am I doing a diet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I have to be in a bathing suit later?</v>

37
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:45.501
<v Speaker 1>Did I go to the gym already?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I expected to be thin in this </v>

38
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:45.501
<v Speaker 1>society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we take all of this into account for</v>

39
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:50.451
<v Speaker 1>every micro decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all about processing how we </v>

40
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:53.961
<v Speaker 1>don't let everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including ourselves down and all the </v>

41
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:53.961
<v Speaker 1>thought that goes into it.</v>

42
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is used specifically,</v>

43
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.990
<v Speaker 2>like obviously you're not speaking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>all women,</v>

44
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but I actually got the title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the rights to it,</v>

45
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I pulled 10 women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

46
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I need is honoring the fact that we </v>

47
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.381
<v Speaker 1>get painted with these broad brush </v>
<v Speaker 1>strokes and there's so many and there's </v>

48
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:17.251
<v Speaker 1>just so much that goes into the littlest</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because we have to take into </v>

49
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:18.700
<v Speaker 1>account how other people feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy to say,</v>

50
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be yourself,</v>

51
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but when you're a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's perceptions of you can </v>

52
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 1>have detrimental effects on your future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your safety,</v>

53
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.350
<v Speaker 1>on your health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She seemed slutty so she deserved it.</v>

54
00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 1>She seems like a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give her a chance,</v>

55
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our perception versus the way that we</v>

56
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

57
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:38.020
<v Speaker 1>we're constantly wrestling with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>two sort of realities.</v>

58
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:46.381
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often wondered like if you could </v>

60
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that one day they're going to </v>

61
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 2>be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

62
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 2>today we have transgender people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

63
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.700
<v Speaker 2>We have people who decide to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>operations decided to take hormones,</v>

64
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.910
<v Speaker 2>but I think one day they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to literally a person into a woman </v>

65
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>with a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not with some sort of treatment.</v>

67
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like it sounds crazy to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>today people say,</v>

68
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't change your chromosomes.</v>

69
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Well today you can't change your </v>
<v Speaker 2>chromosomes,</v>

70
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 2>but 200 years ago the idea of sending a </v>
<v Speaker 2>video to someone in Australia,</v>

71
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>it'd be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

72
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 2>So like what we've been able to do just </v>
<v Speaker 2>over a short period of time,</v>

73
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:25.051
<v Speaker 2>relatively is pretty staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at like what they're </v>

74
00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 2>doing with Crispr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what Crispr is?</v>

75
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.230
<v Speaker 2>It's gene editing tools that they keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolving there.</v>

76
00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:35.231
<v Speaker 2>They've gotten them to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to work on human </v>

77
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:35.990
<v Speaker 2>embryos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>non-viable human embryos in there.</v>

78
00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:38.540
<v Speaker 2>They're changing the expression of </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain genes has changed.</v>

79
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Genes got stopping genes for certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases and there's.</v>

80
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like this chair.</v>

81
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can drop if you want to make it </v>

82
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 2>lower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Close to my heart.</v>

83
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

84
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

85
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to like make designer people.</v>

86
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

87
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is less,</v>

88
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>you're a woman obviously with by </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics and your Genitalia,</v>

90
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:10.411
<v Speaker 1>but this book is all about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences and this is more societal </v>

91
00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is less about what you're born as.</v>

92
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.830
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was going to say.</v>

93
00:04:12.831 --> 00:04:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I was like I was saying if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could like I,</v>

94
00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I've wondered if that was a possibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could reverse it.</v>

95
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.000
<v Speaker 2>What I want to be a woman for like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

96
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a week,</v>

97
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.360
<v Speaker 1>but let me see it just to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to play with them.</v>

98
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Just stick stuff up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that like we don't,</v>

99
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.040
<v Speaker 2>we don't know about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the closest you come to understanding a </v>

100
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 2>man or a woman if you're a man or if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the opposite.</v>

101
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Sex I think is living with one or having</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or having one.</v>

102
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big one for me was having </v>

103
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.620
<v Speaker 2>daughters and just seeing how they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact.</v>

104
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.650
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From the time they're one until you </v>

105
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.650
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're older.</v>

106
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.650
<v Speaker 2>It's some of its biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

107
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole,</v>

108
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

109
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.780
<v Speaker 1>and I've talked about or know of someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

110
00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:58.610
<v Speaker 1>but still the sort of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what women excluding other women.</v>

111
00:04:58.611 --> 00:05:01.140
<v Speaker 1>So this goes back to when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters and gatherers.</v>

112
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.290
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't want someone to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd turn your back on them and you </v>

113
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.200
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't share information and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your offspring will die.</v>

114
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some you see this,</v>

115
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:14.571
<v Speaker 1>a little girls like they're mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're mean to each other and as you </v>

116
00:05:14.571 --> 00:05:14.571
<v Speaker 1>get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:05:14.571 --> 00:05:17.250
<v Speaker 1>you're taking in all of this stimuli </v>
<v Speaker 1>from society,</v>

118
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:21.570
<v Speaker 1>all the messages and we have to process </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things and then eventually you get</v>

119
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 1>old enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

120
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:23.580
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it my own way.</v>

121
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
<v Speaker 1>But there's still expectations place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of them are conflicting like </v>

122
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.680
<v Speaker 1>polar opposites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to be sexy but also </v>

123
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.680
<v Speaker 1>demure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outgoing,</v>

124
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.300
<v Speaker 1>but don't be too pushy and too pushy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>outgoing.</v>

125
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.540
<v Speaker 1>They're relative depending on who's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your path,</v>

126
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women have to take these things into</v>

127
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 1>account because we got to do everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

128
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.410
<v Speaker 1>We didn't create professional sports or </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>

129
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.330
<v Speaker 1>We're late to the game for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a man's world and you do have to</v>

130
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.880
<v Speaker 1>take into account those rules and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucks,</v>

131
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.350
<v Speaker 1>but these are all the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to factor in when we're making </v>

132
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.350
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

133
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 2>Then there's always going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of resentment if someone </v>

134
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.100
<v Speaker 2>tries to do it a woman's way rather than</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man's what?</v>

135
00:06:06.101 --> 00:06:08.310
<v Speaker 2>You need a tissue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never going to stop running.</v>

136
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.850
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

137
00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:09.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have allergies.</v>

138
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My nose just always runs a little bit </v>

139
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.120
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate.</v>

140
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.770
<v Speaker 2>I hate when people do so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows it's so little.</v>

141
00:06:16.771 --> 00:06:19.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you get coke up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have coke rocks that we get stuck in</v>

142
00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.450
<v Speaker 2>your nose holes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still stuck up there.</v>

143
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Keep it like I've wondered like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work right.</v>

144
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real job and I haven't had one in a </v>

145
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

146
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 2>So the idea of like having a boss is </v>
<v Speaker 2>alien to me and had a female boss is </v>

147
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 2>even more annoying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

148
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to someone who has a woman </v>

149
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 2>boss and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

150
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.010
<v Speaker 2>we were saying that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting thing that happens where a </v>

151
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.830
<v Speaker 2>woman can do the exact same thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a bitch.</v>

152
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if the guy does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's stern,</v>

153
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 2>he's a hard ass or no,</v>

154
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all this,</v>

155
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.880
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:06:56.881 --> 00:07:01.881
<v Speaker 1>as women age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their gross and men are austere or the </v>

157
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:01.881
<v Speaker 1>regal intersects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

158
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:04.680
<v Speaker 1>And those are kind of basic examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

159
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we're moving away from that.</v>

160
00:07:06.721 --> 00:07:11.721
<v Speaker 1>It's more nuanced things I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really can't identify with workplace</v>

161
00:07:12.241 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to some friends of mine,</v>

162
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.640
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that I have to dumb things down </v>

163
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.000
<v Speaker 1>or people express and in my domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I worked very hard to be the one in</v>

164
00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:24.990
<v Speaker 1>charge and men don't speak to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way because they're opening for me.</v>

165
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

166
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.590
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>

167
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're the manager of the club or </v>

168
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.340
<v Speaker 1>you got to pay me anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

169
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that I don't have a </v>

170
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.741
<v Speaker 1>sort of sympathy for that and that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand what it feels like to </v>

171
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:41.040
<v Speaker 1>be discounted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as long as time you had a job job,</v>

172
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.270
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>

173
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.590
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>job was probably 2004,</v>

174
00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.320
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six relatively recently,</v>

175
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.960
<v Speaker 1>12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago.</v>

176
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.810
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't mentally present that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

177
00:07:54.811 --> 00:07:56.280
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't like I wasn't trying to </v>

179
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>get ahead at that job.</v>

180
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.890
<v Speaker 2>It was 2006.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 11 years ago.</v>

181
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.260
<v Speaker 2>That's like a base of maybe seven years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

182
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 2007.</v>

183
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 2>So 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 or whatever it is that you're like a </v>

184
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 2>different human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

185
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.700
<v Speaker 2>You're so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember it very well?</v>

186
00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Like what was the job?</v>

187
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I was the last job I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an assistant in the marketing </v>

188
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.670
<v Speaker 1>department of a large company that dealt</v>
<v Speaker 1>with like Black Jack.</v>

189
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.800
<v Speaker 1>It was like a black Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a new kind of interesting </v>

190
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.830
<v Speaker 1>and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this Nice Jewish guy hired me and I </v>

191
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.680
<v Speaker 1>was just there to answer the phone if </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone ever called,</v>

192
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.950
<v Speaker 1>make some press kits like it was monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and you were obviously doing </v>

193
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.470
<v Speaker 1>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing standup at night and I would</v>

194
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.560
<v Speaker 1>spend the days sort of like soliciting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people if I could get a spot on their </v>

195
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:43.870
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making flyers,</v>

196
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:48.871
<v Speaker 1>like I just use it as my own office and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have also the environment like </v>

197
00:08:48.871 --> 00:08:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I could wear pajamas to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no one ever came to.</v>

198
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Our office was barely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely a regular job.</v>

199
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely.</v>

200
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't like in the workforce now </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening</v>

201
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.760
<v Speaker 2>regular jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's obviously a huge problem with </v>

202
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 2>the dynamic that men and women have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular jobs,</v>

203
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 2>but there's a problem with men and men </v>
<v Speaker 2>in regular jobs like pee.</v>

204
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that it's normal for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to be working on top of each </v>

205
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 2>other doing something they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do for long stretches of time.</v>

206
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:15.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very difficult to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

207
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.180
<v Speaker 2>You have all these restrictions on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>language and the way you're allowed to </v>

208
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 2>communicate with each other and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're obviously doing something all day</v>

209
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 2>that you would rather not be doing.</v>

210
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.660
<v Speaker 1>So I have two thoughts on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

211
00:09:26.661 --> 00:09:31.661
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because we have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate structure which is really </v>

212
00:09:31.661 --> 00:09:34.490
<v Speaker 1>designed to minimize suing and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimize issues,</v>

213
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.460
<v Speaker 1>but since humans aren't meant to be put </v>
<v Speaker 1>in these boxes,</v>

214
00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it perhaps creates more problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>were too confined,</v>

215
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I opened a lot of my snaps on snapchat </v>

216
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:45.920
<v Speaker 1>and you'll always get ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

217
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:51.010
<v Speaker 1>ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 49 can for the state of database </v>

218
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:51.010
<v Speaker 1>over hate work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to go into work.</v>

219
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>It's all about hating your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't understand because I.</v>

220
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I love my job and I worked very hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a job that I enjoy,</v>

221
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.910
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if everybody I talk in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my book about,</v>

222
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your passion and finding it and whenever</v>

223
00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:04.190
<v Speaker 1>you can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody's meant for greatness.</v>

224
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody's meant to be happy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are dumb and I know this </v>

225
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.240
<v Speaker 1>sounds terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm designing some master plan,</v>

226
00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:14.510
<v Speaker 1>but some people need to just go and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shitty job.</v>

227
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:19.240
<v Speaker 1>You're not contributing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody is meant like this is like</v>

228
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:24.250
<v Speaker 1>some Hitler Eugenic Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make my fucking phone be quiet because </v>

229
00:10:24.681 --> 00:10:26.780
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you talked to,</v>

230
00:10:26.781 --> 00:10:30.860
<v Speaker 1>like some people are not bright and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the mental wherewithal to</v>

231
00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:32.270
<v Speaker 1>carve out your own happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

232
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.500
<v Speaker 2>that's a genetic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd always had an environmental thing.</v>

233
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a religious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

234
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

235
00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>It just takes all kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

236
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>It does take all,</v>

237
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.890
<v Speaker 2>but I will always wonder like is it what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've experienced in their life?</v>

238
00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Is it the family environment that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up in?</v>

239
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.050
<v Speaker 2>Is it just straight raw genetics?</v>

240
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Some people are just dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's nature versus </v>

241
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.300
<v Speaker 1>nurture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fix that.</v>

242
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will tell you this.</v>

243
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I do think it's more nurture than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything because I go and I read to kids</v>

244
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.050
<v Speaker 1>at at this elementary school and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all Latino.</v>

245
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.260
<v Speaker 1>They all speak Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a blonde kid in the group </v>

246
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:12.260
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's very easy to write off </v>
<v Speaker 1>minorities,</v>

247
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:17.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't speak English as their </v>

248
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:18.441
<v Speaker 1>parents don't speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever and the kids are so fucking </v>

249
00:11:18.441 --> 00:11:21.801
<v Speaker 1>smart and like they're like four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old and they're reading and they're </v>

250
00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:25.581
<v Speaker 1>guessing things and they speak two </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages and you get chills because </v>

251
00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:26.220
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're going to have the</v>

252
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:31.221
<v Speaker 1>opportunities I had and that kills me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can see that you're smart and </v>

253
00:11:31.221 --> 00:11:35.970
<v Speaker 1>you want to like take one which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal and like put them in a good </v>

254
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.201
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean that's just the way of the </v>

255
00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:39.201
<v Speaker 1>world as opposed</v>

256
00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:43.960
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think diet is a huge part of it is a </v>

257
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.250
<v Speaker 2>huge part in the way a child's mind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>body develop.</v>

258
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this article,</v>

259
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was in the Atlantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was about sort of the language </v>

260
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 1>surrounding and running clean</v>

261
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.160
<v Speaker 3>eating and how that term shames people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are poor because you're suggesting </v>

262
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 3>that their food is dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it is to an extent,</v>

263
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 3>but it how clean eating is just for rich</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

264
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 3>That's a silly way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

265
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.930
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what it means.</v>

266
00:12:08.931 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 3>It means there's a lack of preservatives</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bullshit,</v>

267
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:16.771
<v Speaker 3>but that's all in and twinkies are </v>
<v Speaker 3>affordable and they're filled with </v>

268
00:12:16.771 --> 00:12:16.771
<v Speaker 3>garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

269
00:12:16.771 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 3>but let us is affordable too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not expensive to eat queen.</v>

270
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.960
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In terms of.</v>

271
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to go to whole foods,</v>

272
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:27.130
<v Speaker 3>but you have to define.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean clean to everyone is different.</v>

273
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.230
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird term and is just one </v>

274
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.230
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just one take on it.</v>

275
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I totally agree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I did the.</v>

276
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.110
<v Speaker 3>I started doing the Ketogenic Diet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>my father isn't doing it,</v>

277
00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 3>but he takes these exogenous Kita Jens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

278
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:41.680
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mind is sharp.</v>

279
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm focused and I think there was a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a power of suggestion,</v>

280
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:50.461
<v Speaker 3>but I definitely don't have an energy </v>
<v Speaker 3>dip and I feel like my body's burning </v>

281
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:52.030
<v Speaker 3>clean fields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very legit.</v>

282
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of science behind it.</v>

283
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:59.011
<v Speaker 3>There's a podcast that I did pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently with a guy named Dom </v>

284
00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:02.910
<v Speaker 3>D'agostino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a scientist and does a lot of </v>

285
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:03.060
<v Speaker 3>clinical research on kidogenic diet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>

286
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.460
<v Speaker 3>He can give you like real raw hard data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's A.</v>

287
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 3>There's a big issue with your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>burning off carbohydrates,</v>

288
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 3>especially in particularly refined </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates and then spikes of insulin</v>

289
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:19.261
<v Speaker 3>and then the dips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just feel terrible and you need a </v>

290
00:13:19.261 --> 00:13:22.111
<v Speaker 3>nap in the middle of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been operating that way for so </v>

291
00:13:22.111 --> 00:13:25.321
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I'm enlightened now and </v>

292
00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:25.321
<v Speaker 3>this will be it forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

293
00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:25.321
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just take a nap.</v>

294
00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:25.990
<v Speaker 3>President takes a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

295
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:31.020
<v Speaker 3>most of Europe takes an APP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take a nap and I started doing this </v>

296
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.441
<v Speaker 3>and I was just on this press tour and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went into it and this is sometimes just </v>

297
00:13:34.441 --> 00:13:36.640
<v Speaker 3>knowing that it changes possible is </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost more important than the outcome.</v>

298
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 3>I went onto this thing in New York and </v>
<v Speaker 3>every time you do press it's like you're</v>

299
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:41.020
<v Speaker 3>up at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>AM,</v>

300
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.380
<v Speaker 3>you're done at 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM and it's a gauntlet and I always feel</v>

301
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 3>disgusting and tired and bloated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this time I was like,</v>

302
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:52.351
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do the ketogenic diet </v>

303
00:13:52.351 --> 00:13:52.351
<v Speaker 3>throughout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I never needed a nap.</v>

304
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.480
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel like I outgrew my clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I felt like a human and I felt </v>

305
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.020
<v Speaker 3>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is such a weird thing,</v>

306
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:04.021
<v Speaker 3>but like there's nothing worse than </v>
<v Speaker 3>being bloated as a girl and it's got to </v>

307
00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:07.321
<v Speaker 3>be the Diet because you're burning clean</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuel and there's no dips and if you </v>

308
00:14:07.321 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 3>think about every time you reach for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>snack,</v>

309
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 3>which is so easy or a piece of candy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Green Room,</v>

310
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
<v Speaker 3>you're doing that to your body that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spikes and that's exhausting and that's </v>

311
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 3>why you're napping at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>

312
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

313
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.500
<v Speaker 3>it's not good for you and we're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>designed to consume food like that.</v>

314
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not all these refined </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates.</v>

315
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.570
<v Speaker 3>It's a massive part of the modern diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

316
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Speaker 3>it's really recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last few hundred years.</v>

317
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Humans have had it in the last hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

318
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:32.200
<v Speaker 3>has changed pretty radically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I um,</v>

319
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.010
<v Speaker 3>I went to this thing called the summit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is Kinda like a giant Ted talk and</v>

320
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.060
<v Speaker 3>I did some stand up there and just end </v>
<v Speaker 3>up at it.</v>

321
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 3>I just went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people did stand up there?</v>

322
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 3>It just meat Bengali.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've invited me.</v>

323
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.700
<v Speaker 3>And so I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

324
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.280
<v Speaker 3>what has been doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did some stand up before and uh,</v>

325
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 3>so I did it and then after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

326
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 3>it fosters this environment</v>

327
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.890
<v Speaker 1>of sort of open mindedness and just talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can just talk to people.</v>

328
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the first week of the Diet,</v>

329
00:14:57.441 --> 00:15:02.441
<v Speaker 1>so I had the Keto flu and I had to leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedy store one night I had a </v>

330
00:15:02.441 --> 00:15:07.181
<v Speaker 1>second show and I was talking to Steve </v>
<v Speaker 1>Simone about cheese and I almost threw </v>

331
00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:11.111
<v Speaker 1>up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to go home because my own diet </v>

332
00:15:11.111 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 1>was making me so nauseous because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>

333
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.800
<v Speaker 1>You get sick at the beginning I never </v>
<v Speaker 1>got the,</v>

334
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I just got tired to the point where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was fucking with my workouts so my </v>

335
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.201
<v Speaker 1>workouts folds flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But exoticness ketones are the way to </v>

336
00:15:23.201 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 1>kill that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was taking those two.</v>

337
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.820
<v Speaker 1>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kinda like you're reading stuff </v>

338
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.121
<v Speaker 1>and you're kind of sussing out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>works for you and trying to find the </v>

339
00:15:31.121 --> 00:15:31.121
<v Speaker 1>right balance.</v>

340
00:15:31.121 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not feeling well,</v>

341
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:33.890
<v Speaker 1>but I was talking to everyone about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

342
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could not be more La.</v>

343
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

344
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm Eliza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a diet.</v>

345
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like on the Keto Diet,</v>

346
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.750
<v Speaker 1>the Keto Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's big La.</v>

347
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.850
<v Speaker 1>And it's also like an intense thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're changing everything.</v>

348
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.210
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so when you say you have a diet,</v>

349
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 1>people want to tell you what's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

350
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.860
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite part of a diet is people </v>

351
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.571
<v Speaker 1>telling me how wrong I am for spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this money and doing this and this </v>

352
00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 1>one guy came up and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Vegan.</v>

353
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

354
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 1>And he starts explaining why he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a better person.</v>

355
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your shoes are leather so fuck you.</v>

356
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

357
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.010
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're impacting the world in a negative</v>

358
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:07.250
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

359
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

360
00:16:08.031 --> 00:16:09.240
<v Speaker 1>but do you recycle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

361
00:16:09.241 --> 00:16:11.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we all do what we can.</v>

362
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.610
<v Speaker 1>And you're not a better person just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you happen to eat only herbs and</v>

363
00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:21.611
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't drive a prius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who knows where you're making your </v>

364
00:16:21.611 --> 00:16:23.030
<v Speaker 1>shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The desire to project that on people.</v>

365
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like this.</v>

366
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't say I'm not telling anyone to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

367
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:31.361
<v Speaker 1>I was just saying what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to mean you're not saying </v>

368
00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:33.701
<v Speaker 1>you're a better person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but him saying he's a better person for </v>

369
00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:33.701
<v Speaker 1>that or he didn't say he was acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

370
00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:38.441
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why people do </v>

371
00:16:38.441 --> 00:16:38.441
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This moral high ground that they take.</v>

372
00:16:38.441 --> 00:16:38.530
<v Speaker 1>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that being said,</v>

373
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.330
<v Speaker 1>when I see people eating garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do feel superior.</v>

374
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

375
00:16:42.631 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 1>you realize they're doing something bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>or their body.</v>

376
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 1>It's way I feel when I see someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking cigarettes,</v>

377
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to say something to </v>

378
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.601
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should walk up to them and start </v>

379
00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:54.601
<v Speaker 1>coughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

380
00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at starbucks the other day and I </v>

381
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.731
<v Speaker 1>just was running in to grab an espresso </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot because I have one every time I </v>

382
00:17:00.731 --> 00:17:02.640
<v Speaker 1>work out and I go in and there's a girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and were comic.</v>

383
00:17:02.641 --> 00:17:05.570
<v Speaker 1>So a big part of our job is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scanning people,</v>

384
00:17:05.571 --> 00:17:08.060
<v Speaker 1>identifying what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making assumptions because we're usually</v>

385
00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:13.061
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this girl in front of me and she's </v>

386
00:17:13.061 --> 00:17:13.360
<v Speaker 1>standing there holding a snack because </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually we're usually right.</v>

387
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're successful and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding her snacks and,</v>

388
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.310
<v Speaker 1>and I can see that she's Kinda weighing </v>
<v Speaker 1>her options and I see you're putting out</v>

389
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>and I see her grab a banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>

390
00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 1>for the most part when women do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is about a dietary thing.</v>

391
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.810
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looked like she was maybe going to </v>

392
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:31.810
<v Speaker 1>the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

393
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>So just trying to be a good girl to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another girl.</v>

394
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I thought she was making like a </v>

395
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.511
<v Speaker 1>sugar based decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go bananas full of sugar just because </v>

396
00:17:40.511 --> 00:17:44.051
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that I did it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone told that to me because you </v>

397
00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 1>always think of bananas healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put it in a smoothie shake.</v>

398
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know so much sugar so I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>said it just as a like,</v>

399

<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you just catch someone.</v>

442
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Like I've always described it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like most people all day long,</v>

443
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:26.121
<v Speaker 2>if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are at like a two or a three out </v>

444
00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:28.581
<v Speaker 2>of 10 on the outrage scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you might run into someone who's at </v>

445
00:19:28.581 --> 00:19:28.581
<v Speaker 2>a nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>which I doubt it because you don't seem </v>

452
00:19:46.751 --> 00:19:46.751
<v Speaker 1>like the kind of person that wants to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened,</v>

453
00:19:46.751 --> 00:19:48.410
<v Speaker 1>but if you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a good apology.</v>

454

<v Speaker 2>Knows about cancer and hair dye and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what she wanted to tell you.</v>

457
00:19:57.491 --> 00:19:58.490
<v Speaker 2>it causes cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

458
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if I offended you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

459
00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Banana Lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Banana ladies.</v>

460
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you need a hug?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

461
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.210
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does hair dye actually caused cancer?</v>

462
00:20:07.211 --> 00:20:09.730
<v Speaker 2>I've never read that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't like,</v>

463
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.930
<v Speaker 2>doesn't involve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

464
00:20:10.931 --> 00:20:13.720
<v Speaker 2>living in a city causes cancer for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

465
00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.900
<v Speaker 2>It's got a big time for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say they say they say that living </v>

466
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.490
<v Speaker 2>near a highway I give you live within a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain distance of a highway.</v>

467
00:20:21.491 --> 00:20:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Can Shave 10 years off your life.</v>

468
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.050
<v Speaker 1>I believe that not just from small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anxiety.</v>

469
00:20:27.051 --> 00:20:32.051
<v Speaker 1>I believe twitter is slowly killing us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to really do twitter and I have a foil </v>

470
00:20:32.051 --> 00:20:36.200
<v Speaker 1>helmet to prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I the amount of anxiety it causes.</v>

471
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I think the bad far outweighs the good.</v>

472
00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you like read comments and talk back </v>

473
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.150
<v Speaker 2>to people and have conversation now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation at the improv where</v>

474
00:20:46.151 --> 00:20:51.151
<v Speaker 2>you were frantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a year ago you were </v>

475
00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 2>getting into it with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit,</v>

476
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could remember what it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

477
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:58.891
<v Speaker 2>but you are fucking pissed and you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>frantic and you had been going at it </v>

478
00:20:58.891 --> 00:21:00.510
<v Speaker 2>with all these people and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed at you.</v>

479
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember</v>

480
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.580
<v Speaker 1>the make America great again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thing that I went through,</v>

481
00:21:03.581 --> 00:21:08.581
<v Speaker 1>which was horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could have been something about </v>

482
00:21:08.581 --> 00:21:11.821
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like my running with Hashtag </v>

483
00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:11.821
<v Speaker 1>Maga.</v>

484
00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were in the front of the Improv </v>

485
00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.171
<v Speaker 2>and you were so fucking frantic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry and frustrated and I said it was </v>

486
00:21:18.241 --> 00:21:20.910
<v Speaker 2>just don't read that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't.</v>

487
00:21:20.911 --> 00:21:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't engage.</v>

488
00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Like you wouldn't engage with those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in real life.</v>

489
00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:24.810
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

490
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.690
<v Speaker 2>but I have to fucking tell them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they say this.</v>

491
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I can genuinely tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave it up.</v>

492
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I had like my own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this interview and some girls got </v>

493
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 1>like butthurt over something and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>then that I was just like,</v>

494
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

495
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm done reading all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll skim it once in a while for like</v>

496
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:49.380
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a retweet about something or if </v>

497
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:49.380
<v Speaker 1>someone's posting something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

498
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.280
<v Speaker 1>if you look at my tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all just sort of self </v>

499
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.280
<v Speaker 1>generating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Vr,</v>

500
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.730
<v Speaker 1>there's no responses anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just decided like you're following </v>

501
00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:57.480
<v Speaker 1>me for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I say is the,</v>

502
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:02.580
<v Speaker 1>is what I'm saying and I don't need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>backtrack and that's just the stance </v>

503
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.450
<v Speaker 1>that I've taken because it really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like screaming into a pillow.</v>

504
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.790
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with all and by the way,</v>

505
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.820
<v Speaker 2>but don't you find interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find interesting things and then </v>

506
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:13.820
<v Speaker 2>tweet them out to people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I will retweet people's things if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think someone's brilliant.</v>

509
00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.800
<v Speaker 1>There's this girl just to whack who I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't stop talking about,</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's just so good and I just believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something's good,</v>

516
00:22:33.291 --> 00:22:35.630
<v Speaker 1>perpetuating it and putting it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

517
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.300
<v Speaker 1>So I retweet hers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

519
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.020
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't answer people.</v>

520
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Dew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>W e,</v>

521
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.960
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k dot just get ready for a boost.</v>

522
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just hot fire.</v>

523
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.540
<v Speaker 1>But she does a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like to retweet it.</v>

524
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.720
<v Speaker 1>The dweck is her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her name,</v>

525
00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.200
<v Speaker 1>she was on a show I did last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a women only invite show and she </v>

526
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.890
<v Speaker 1>did a women only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could I go if I wore drag?</v>

527
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not allowed to know because I'd be </v>

528
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.950
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I identify as a woman?</v>

529
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.470
<v Speaker 1>So people ask that and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can come,</v>

530
00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.680
<v Speaker 1>but no one did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

531
00:23:15.681 --> 00:23:18.380
<v Speaker 1>you can come if you identify as a trans </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

532
00:23:18.381 --> 00:23:23.381
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be the one to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just figured it out like five </v>

533
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:26.141
<v Speaker 1>minutes before the show here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's why you can't because it's about </v>

534
00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:28.730
<v Speaker 1>a lifetime as a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were always a man,</v>

535
00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you probably just aren't going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same things that a woman who's a </v>

536
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:34.790
<v Speaker 1>woman was born a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can come.</v>

537
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be the one to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

538
00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.360
<v Speaker 1>what's your stance on Trans racialism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

539
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

540
00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:41.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

541
00:23:41.541 --> 00:23:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get the with the like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

542
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.520
<v Speaker 1>the Rachel dolezal person.</v>

543
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't be another race.</v>

544
00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you be a woman then?</v>

545
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.970
<v Speaker 2>How can a man be a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you really aren't hockey?</v>

546
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:59.130
<v Speaker 2>If a man feels like he's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that different than a man feeling</v>

547
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.410
<v Speaker 2>like he's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one I tweeted yesterday,</v>

548
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.260
<v Speaker 2>a guy who believes he's Filipino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was born.</v>

549
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.680
<v Speaker 2>I think he's transgender as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got both things going on.</v>

550
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's people that just don't like</v>

551
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.060
<v Speaker 2>who they are and they feel like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical shift.</v>

552
00:24:13.061 --> 00:24:16.570
<v Speaker 2>There is transracial man born white says</v>
<v Speaker 2>he feels Filipino.</v>

553
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.490
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes it into USA Today.</v>

554
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Is he a nurse news?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's why he feels that scrubs.</v>

555
00:24:22.451 --> 00:24:24.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like tie dye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like scrubs a.</v>

556
00:24:24.611 --> 00:24:28.810
<v Speaker 3>This is where he has purple highlights </v>
<v Speaker 3>in his hair or can I just say that?</v>

557
00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.370
<v Speaker 3>It seems to be the issue is when white </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to be another color,</v>

558
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:37.600
<v Speaker 3>everybody has been forced to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>take on white characteristics.</v>

559
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Black girls flattened their hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nose jobs.</v>

560
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.700
<v Speaker 3>Do you know about Sammy Sosa?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

561
00:24:42.701 --> 00:24:44.440
<v Speaker 3>And getting lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what he looks like now?</v>

562
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

563
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Because he looks like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks just like 10.</v>

564
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 3>He knows he doesn't have a tiny nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he has like literally your color </v>

565
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:53.090
<v Speaker 3>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my best friend,</v>

566
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:58.260
<v Speaker 3>her wife is Dominican and she posted a </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture of it and she was like,</v>

567
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.780
<v Speaker 3>this is not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so sad that he feels that he has to</v>

568
00:25:01.781 --> 00:25:02.200
<v Speaker 3>do this.</v>

569
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.750
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just look at that.</v>

570
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.930
<v Speaker 3>He's a fat white concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Gerber baby,</v>

571
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:14.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess he got it off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids and that's when his body sort </v>

572
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.670
<v Speaker 3>of started getting fucked up and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't work out anymore.</v>

573
00:25:15.671 --> 00:25:20.671
<v Speaker 3>So he's big now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the white is outraged when you try </v>

574
00:25:20.671 --> 00:25:24.181
<v Speaker 3>to be white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people of color get angry when </v>

575
00:25:24.181 --> 00:25:24.181
<v Speaker 3>it goes the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

576
00:25:24.181 --> 00:25:28.200
<v Speaker 3>Because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to just take on our look </v>

577
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.600
<v Speaker 3>as a costume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I think that's the social issue.</v>

578
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not for sure.</v>

579
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:30.970
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

580
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's my only answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

581
00:25:32.501 --> 00:25:35.350
<v Speaker 3>But what if that's what you really feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you would be happy?</v>

582
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.430
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it to a privately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>privately where,</v>

583
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Dominican Day parade costume under </v>

584
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:44.560
<v Speaker 3>your overcoat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can get away with some of it.</v>

585
00:25:44.561 --> 00:25:46.210
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like affectations,</v>

586
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:51.211
<v Speaker 3>like you can get away with like if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a rapper you could sort of talk </v>

587
00:25:51.211 --> 00:25:54.420
<v Speaker 3>or MC search.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like teetering on that </v>

588
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:54.490
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's MC search?</v>

589
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.230
<v Speaker 3>You don't remember the third base.</v>

590
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.640
<v Speaker 2>He used to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

591
00:25:57.641 --> 00:26:02.641
<v Speaker 2>a TV show and it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a talk show,</v>

592
00:26:03.001 --> 00:26:05.400
<v Speaker 2>but he was going to keep it real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was.</v>

593
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so bad that opie and anthony used</v>

594
00:26:07.651 --> 00:26:11.970
<v Speaker 2>to play clips from MC search show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

595
00:26:11.971 --> 00:26:13.410
<v Speaker 2>That's him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is He Jewish?</v>

596
00:26:13.411 --> 00:26:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Because we do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We love hip hop.</v>

597
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

598
00:26:16.471 --> 00:26:19.710
<v Speaker 2>that's from back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a big fan of third base.</v>

599
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I love them as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a band,</v>

600
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.650
<v Speaker 2>but his show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

601
00:26:22.651 --> 00:26:27.651
<v Speaker 2>you know what his show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the difference between his show </v>

602
00:26:27.651 --> 00:26:29.360
<v Speaker 2>and what his show could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

603
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's awful,</v>

604
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.730
<v Speaker 2>but he thinks he's being choked out by </v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was all.</v>

605
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.940
<v Speaker 2>He was also wearing makeup and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>also being,</v>

606
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure produced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be yourself and you can't be </v>

607
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.970
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're on a fucking network,</v>

608

<v Speaker 3>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Figure out a way to sell you like,</v>

611
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.510

<v Speaker 3>You're going to be the.</v>

<v Speaker 3>we need you to say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep it 100.</v>

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you say that for me?</v>

616
00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.460

<v Speaker 3>Nobody says that you stupid.</v>

618
00:27:01.171 --> 00:27:02.400
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a while ago,</v>

619
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.650
<v Speaker 3>but this is how dumb they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People write that.</v>

620
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.570
<v Speaker 3>They don't fucking say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one says,</v>

623
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.910
<v Speaker 3>But it's always that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always watched TV.</v>

624
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Advertising is always one step removed </v>
<v Speaker 3>from what's cool now because by the time</v>

625
00:27:20.581 --> 00:27:22.990
<v Speaker 3>they push it through corporate too late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

626
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.260
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's saying it anymore.</v>

627
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember was up.</v>

628
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Remember that one guy that had that </v>
<v Speaker 3>great video where it was like him </v>

629
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.160

<v Speaker 3>Like was.</v>

630
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 3>It was a hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like the nineties,</v>

631
00:27:35.101 --> 00:27:40.101
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's another one that bothers me when </v>

632
00:27:40.101 --> 00:27:40.101
<v Speaker 3>people say I almost threw up in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>

633
00:27:40.101 --> 00:27:40.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't invent it.</v>

634
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Stop using it in commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

635
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.100
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bad.</v>

636
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of those that they use.</v>

637
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 3>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>able to sell more things.</v>

639
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst is when like exact SCO.</v>

<v Speaker 3>binge it just because you put all your </v>

<v Speaker 3>content out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You binged things because you decide </v>

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you be in that industry and keep</v>

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:32.230
<v Speaker 3>Dab It on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure she's dabbing or she just </v>

657
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.230
<v Speaker 3>doing Tai Chi in the park?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

658
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.230
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Says it on her shirt,</v>

659
00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.530
<v Speaker 3>on a shirt that she doesn't know she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing.</v>

660
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.270
<v Speaker 3>She didn't realize that she can't read </v>
<v Speaker 3>the no 150,000</v>

661
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:40.980
<v Speaker 3>years old later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just keep pounding.</v>

662
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

663
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.940
<v Speaker 3>We think it's so funny when old people </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk as if they were ever young and </v>

664
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.180
<v Speaker 3>fucking like as if they've never had </v>
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>

665
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:53.380
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that lady probably at one point in </v>

666
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:53.640
<v Speaker 3>time was a connoisseur when she's out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there in the park,</v>

667
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.580
<v Speaker 3>not knowing what the fuck she's wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dinosaur in the park.</v>

668
00:28:56.581 --> 00:28:59.250
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the best place probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be sampling Dick.</v>

669
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Probably hard to get a good one though </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're at that age.</v>

670
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.300
<v Speaker 3>Probably real tough because it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>about enthusiasm.</v>

671
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 3>I feel like dudes are pretty down with </v>
<v Speaker 3>old ladies.</v>

672
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Like old dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

673
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's an issue.</v>

674
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:18.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm a friend of mine go on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of his buddies worked at a old folks</v>

675
00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:23.751
<v Speaker 3>home and said that one of the big issues</v>
<v Speaker 3>was these old guys would get Viagra.</v>

676
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these old ladies,</v>

677
00:29:25.891 --> 00:29:29.190
<v Speaker 3>they didn't give a fuck and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them are on antidepressants,</v>

678
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:30.380
<v Speaker 3>so they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

679
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Allah who gives a shit.</v>

680
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Like they're on Xanax and getting stds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That will.</v>

681
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something that I heard about,</v>

682
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.720
<v Speaker 3>like it's rampant because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

683
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 3>That's probably really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're old,</v>

684
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:44.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like your body doesn't heal so good.</v>

685
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.830
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 98.</v>

686
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Herpes is like an attack on your immune </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

687
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.740
<v Speaker 3>There it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The new erotic frontier,</v>

688
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.350
<v Speaker 3>sex in nursing homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until recently,</v>

689
00:29:56.351 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 3>nursing homes frowned on sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now increasingly they smile.</v>

690
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that makes sense.</v>

691
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why shouldn't we have fun?</v>

692
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Aubrey Davidson age,</v>

693
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:11.730
<v Speaker 3>85 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>special guy at the Hebrew home in </v>

694
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Riverdale in the Bronx,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York,</v>

695
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.380
<v Speaker 3>they did more than sit next to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other in the dining room.</v>

696
00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:19.660
<v Speaker 3>Then he invited her to his room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They hung a do not disturb sign on the </v>

697
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.380
<v Speaker 3>door and at breakfast the next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they both supported broad smiles,</v>

698
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.730
<v Speaker 3>terrible writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also calling it.</v>

699
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.180
<v Speaker 3>What are the top say the you see the new</v>
<v Speaker 3>erotic frontier.</v>

700
00:30:31.181 --> 00:30:31.570
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

701
00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:33.310
<v Speaker 3>and it's like sex and nursing homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

702
00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there goes the boner.</v>

703
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounded so hot.</v>

704
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not.</v>

705
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:43.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not exciting for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a whole category on Youporn </v>

706
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.520
<v Speaker 3>so old people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

707
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.230
<v Speaker 3>Some people do like watching old people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

708
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.480
<v Speaker 3>You know what I watched the other day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not proud of it,</v>

709
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:52.260
<v Speaker 3>but I will admit it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched an old thing,</v>

710
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:52.910
<v Speaker 3>my special.</v>

711
00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:01.380
<v Speaker 3>I watched an old porn stars still at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what he provides.</v>

712
00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:06.631
<v Speaker 3>Exercise and at the time of life when </v>
<v Speaker 3>many elderly feel cold sleeping as a </v>

713
00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:08.590
<v Speaker 3>payer provides warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

714
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.330
<v Speaker 3>that's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this though,</v>

715
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:15.470
<v Speaker 3>like killed back to the relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make people happier and that happiness </v>

716
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.710
<v Speaker 3>reduces stress and irritability and </v>
<v Speaker 3>improves mood,</v>

717
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.060
<v Speaker 3>appetite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep,</v>

718
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.610
<v Speaker 3>sociability and immune function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to plants.</v>

719
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Read that first day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

720
00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 3>how dare you read the first sentence </v>
<v Speaker 3>says the Hebrew home.</v>

721
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.360
<v Speaker 3>That first one at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hebrew home does more than tolerate </v>

722
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 3>resident nookie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The faculty hope.</v>

723
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Probably someone who works with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hebrew home propaganda.</v>

724
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.850
<v Speaker 3>The faculty holds regular happy hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dances,</v>

725
00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 3>and even organized a dating service for </v>
<v Speaker 3>residents.</v>

726
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Gy Date,</v>
<v Speaker 3>g four grandparents.</v>

727
00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.680
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

728
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's getting hurt.</v>

729
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cares.</v>

730
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.570
<v Speaker 3>And they're enjoying themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fought for our country.</v>

731
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Some of them probably did let him fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like an age,</v>

732
00:31:55.571 --> 00:31:58.060
<v Speaker 3>like might have been a few draft dodgers</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Vietnam in that mix.</v>

733
00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.000
<v Speaker 3>What about Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But by the way,</v>

734
00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.350
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needed one of those wars,</v>

735
00:32:02.351 --> 00:32:03.790
<v Speaker 3>but they're really fighting for our </v>
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>

736
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.530
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they still went.</v>

737
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:09.460
<v Speaker 3>They still went to Vietnam was a draft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a horrible thing,</v>

738
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:11.260
<v Speaker 3>but they still went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still went.</v>

739
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not their fault.</v>

740
00:32:14.231 --> 00:32:16.320
<v Speaker 3>It was a bullshit war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a bullshit for sure,</v>

741
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was the most bullshit war?</v>

742
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.230
<v Speaker 3>The most bullshit war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the most bullshit war?</v>

743
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Because it was literally founded on </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

744
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Do you know about the Gulf of Tonkin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know talking to them a,</v>

745
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a false flag that caught us into </v>

746
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam has never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This Gulf,</v>

747
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.370
<v Speaker 3>the Gulf of Tonkin incident as it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take a step further.</v>

748
00:32:33.371 --> 00:32:38.371
<v Speaker 3>I think the threat of communism is </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that we like to do to scare </v>

749
00:32:38.371 --> 00:32:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Americans and the poor Laotians got </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught in the middle of all of this.</v>

750
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I went to Vietnam and they still have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

751
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I went to Cambodia and they still have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like active minds because they dropped,</v>

752
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:51.220
<v Speaker 1>we dropped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think more bombs was.</v>

753
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.680
<v Speaker 1>It was several million or something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still an active thing,</v>

754
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 1>like people are still losing body parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this.</v>

755
00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Farmers.</v>

756
00:32:57.891 --> 00:32:58.790
<v Speaker 1>So we're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oops,</v>

757
00:32:58.791 --> 00:32:59.870
<v Speaker 1>a daisy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

758
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.730
<v Speaker 1>And they're not an angry people.</v>

759
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:06.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the threat of communism </v>
<v Speaker 2>was perceived as real because I think if</v>

760
00:33:07.391 --> 00:33:12.391
<v Speaker 2>you look at the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were obviously in conflict with </v>

761
00:33:12.391 --> 00:33:12.391
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were worried about China,</v>

762
00:33:12.391 --> 00:33:16.950
<v Speaker 2>the Marxism and Mao and all the various </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues that people have overcome.</v>

763
00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.620
<v Speaker 2>I think they were worried that communism</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to spread.</v>

764
00:33:20.621 --> 00:33:25.621
<v Speaker 2>I think it just one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>where once a witch hunt starts like the </v>

765
00:33:25.621 --> 00:33:27.290
<v Speaker 2>mccarthyism area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

766
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:32.310
<v Speaker 2>that's really fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit where they were going after </v>

767
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.220
<v Speaker 2>people and ruining their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd went to a meeting.</v>

768
00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you went to a communist meeting,</v>

769
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean we definitely blacklisting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

770
00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:40.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

771
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a fine line because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're Americans,</v>

772
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.210
<v Speaker 1>you have these rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>

773
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:49.211
<v Speaker 1>who's deciding that line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if we're kind of getting into </v>

774
00:33:49.211 --> 00:33:52.001
<v Speaker 1>that now with what we're able to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>online with the whole sexual Predator </v>

775
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which if you want to talk about draining</v>

776
00:33:55.011 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 1>a swamp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's great what's happening now,</v>

777
00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.630
<v Speaker 1>but then you're going to get guys who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>

778
00:33:59.631 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I never did anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

779
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:01.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

780
00:34:01.311 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 1>now no one wants to work with you.</v>

781
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that are absolutely </v>

782
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:08.420
<v Speaker 2>guilty that are getting caught and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people for sure they're going to</v>

783
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 2>get accused by people who really just </v>
<v Speaker 2>want attention.</v>

784
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:16.870
<v Speaker 2>You can have that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you're going to have way </v>

785
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:16.870
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

786
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I think you're gonna have less of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think the stakes are so high </v>

787
00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.170
<v Speaker 1>that for you to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to be the type of person that </v>

788
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:22.810
<v Speaker 1>accuses someone just for your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal gain.</v>

789
00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's not going to happen as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much just because it's such a serious </v>

790
00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:28.260
<v Speaker 1>thing right now.</v>

791
00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a serious thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much weirdness to elect </v>

792
00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.360
<v Speaker 2>George Sekai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy says he grabbed his dick in 1981.</v>

793
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Hey Dude.</v>

794
00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.630
<v Speaker 1>You let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walk it off.</v>

795
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Walk it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

796
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.530
<v Speaker 1>It's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as damaging as it is when a man</v>

797
00:34:40.531 --> 00:34:42.150
<v Speaker 1>does it to a young woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Percent.</v>

798
00:34:42.151 --> 00:34:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for saying that.</v>

799
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:49.240
<v Speaker 2>That's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying this on stage and I </v>

800
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:49.240
<v Speaker 2>have a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

801
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.460
<v Speaker 2>I want to reveal it here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

802
00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:54.140
<v Speaker 2>there's a big difference between being </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened for your life,</v>

803
00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:57.140
<v Speaker 2>like if you're dealing with a situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

804
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.130
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not the throw Louis ck under the</v>

805
00:35:01.131 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 2>bus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone was saying like,</v>

806
00:35:02.931 --> 00:35:04.730
<v Speaker 2>what's the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone masturbating in front of you?</v>

807
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.800
<v Speaker 2>This is what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I said.</v>

808
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.870
<v Speaker 2>They've never had it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a man.</v>

809
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

810
00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:11.690
<v Speaker 2>And if a woman was masturbating in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of me,</v>

811
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I would not be worried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not threatened for your safety.</v>

812
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.010
<v Speaker 2>I would exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be like,</v>

813
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to do that?</v>

814
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.940
<v Speaker 2>But if a man is doing it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocking the door and it's a man that,</v>

815
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.970
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the green room,</v>

816
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 2>not the green room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The um,</v>

817
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bar area,</v>

818
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:29.380
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

819
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.540
<v Speaker 2>that little narrow pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy walked by,</v>

820
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.380
<v Speaker 2>it was about three months ago and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>six foot seven,</v>

821
00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 2>300 plus pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

822
00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:41.550
<v Speaker 2>when he walked by me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just looked at him.</v>

823
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:43.530
<v Speaker 2>He looked at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got physically nervous,</v>

824
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 2>physically nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was thinking,</v>

825
00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:48.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this guy decided he was going to kill</v>

826
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:50.100
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was going to smash me.</v>

827
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.550
<v Speaker 2>There's almost nothing I can do about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so much bigger than me.</v>

828
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:58.260
<v Speaker 2>That is how almost every woman feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>around a large man.</v>

829
00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:02.900
<v Speaker 1>This is the thesis for my last special </v>
<v Speaker 1>for confirmed kills your thesis.</v>

830
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's added at length.</v>

831
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.840
<v Speaker 1>How it all goes back to the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the suppression,</v>

832
00:36:08.841 --> 00:36:11.540
<v Speaker 1>all of your nervousness as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it goes back to the fact that men</v>

833
00:36:11.541 --> 00:36:15.860
<v Speaker 1>are physically stronger than women in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole joke is if we were stronger,</v>

834
00:36:15.861 --> 00:36:18.170
<v Speaker 1>if women were stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have waited for the right to</v>

835
00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:20.740
<v Speaker 1>vote would have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to the polls out of the way.</v>

836
00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Jeddah diet like it just went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it all goes back to that and I think </v>

837
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:30.101
<v Speaker 1>for some guys it's hard to grasp what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that feels like to feel physically </v>

838
00:36:30.101 --> 00:36:32.180
<v Speaker 1>inferior because it's not mental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally inferior.</v>

839
00:36:32.181 --> 00:36:37.181
<v Speaker 1>It's not someone's funnier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life is threatened when a guy </v>

840
00:36:37.181 --> 00:36:37.570
<v Speaker 1>blocks the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a guys in your weight,</v>

841
00:36:37.571 --> 00:36:40.030
<v Speaker 1>when you're in some guy's home and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to hear it.</v>

842
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can kill you.</v>

843
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:47.540
<v Speaker 1>That's all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even a guy that's not that much bigger </v>

844
00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.781
<v Speaker 1>than me is still exponentially stronger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than me and that's just the way we're </v>

845
00:36:49.781 --> 00:36:50.660
<v Speaker 1>designed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not every woman is not every man,</v>

846
00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.990
<v Speaker 1>but women live with that fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's so insane.</v>

847
00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

848
00:36:55.071 --> 00:36:57.710
<v Speaker 1>he jerked off in front of them and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

849
00:36:57.711 --> 00:36:59.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very valid thing.</v>

850
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Like at the time I didn't know what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening because your brain isn't </v>

851
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.330
<v Speaker 1>designed to handle like a famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians masturbating in front of me.</v>

852
00:37:05.331 --> 00:37:06.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll file this away.</v>

853
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

854
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.070
<v Speaker 2>how about it comes out of the blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about,</v>

855
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:12.830
<v Speaker 2>how about you process it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I are friends.</v>

856
00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:17.980
<v Speaker 2>We've been friends for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we were in some hotel room somewhere </v>

857
00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.500
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I jerk off in front of you?</v>

858
00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.550
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

859
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably wouldn't eat.</v>

860
00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:24.380
<v Speaker 2>This is not like a rational request.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

861
00:37:24.381 --> 00:37:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to get some food?</v>

862
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's let's go to the bar.</v>

863
00:37:28.701 --> 00:37:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no neurological path to this.</v>

864
00:37:30.801 --> 00:37:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

865
00:37:31.251 --> 00:37:34.730
<v Speaker 2>we'll go to the food bar and get food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just opened a door and dropped off a</v>

866
00:37:34.731 --> 00:37:35.240
<v Speaker 2>cliff</v>

867
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.590
<v Speaker 1>and you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're grabbing onto anything.</v>

868
00:37:38.591 --> 00:37:43.591
<v Speaker 1>So they giggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They laugh because that's a natural </v>

869
00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:43.591
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

870
00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:44.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe it's happening.</v>

871
00:37:44.051 --> 00:37:46.060
<v Speaker 1>A lot of girls like Ali reisman just </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out,</v>

872
00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:47.670
<v Speaker 1>the gymnast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

873
00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:51.430
<v Speaker 1>the Olympic doctor was molesting her and</v>
<v Speaker 1>another girl as well,</v>

874
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and the guy's already in prison for </v>
<v Speaker 1>child porn,</v>

875
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:58.720
<v Speaker 1>which is so insane I think at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're younger.</v>

876
00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:04.140
<v Speaker 1>I have good friends who were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was basically raped or assaulted and </v>

877
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.690
<v Speaker 1>at the time you're laughing and going </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with it because you don't know,</v>

878
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.710
<v Speaker 1>like your brain is like almost shutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

879
00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.750
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know</v>

880
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:12.350
<v Speaker 2>that it's not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

881
00:38:12.351 --> 00:38:14.000
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're really young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

882
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

883
00:38:15.231 --> 00:38:20.231
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a young kid and you're not </v>

884
00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:20.231
<v Speaker 2>exactly sure you don't have a context </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this action,</v>

885
00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.010
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sudden it's happening.</v>

886
00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't,</v>

887
00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:29.220
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I almost got scooped up by a child </v>

888
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.080
<v Speaker 2>molester once when I was really young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

889
00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was like eight or nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the library and I was looking </v>

890
00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.450
<v Speaker 2>at these books and this guy came up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and I was looking at.</v>

891
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I was always in a monster books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like monster movies and this guy came up</v>

892
00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:41.860
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

893
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:43.330
<v Speaker 2>you're a monster books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

894
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:44.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

895
00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.540
<v Speaker 2>I've got some monster books in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to see him?</v>

896
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a monster in my pants.</v>

897
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.890
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know any better and know I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking eight years old or whatever.</v>

898
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:56.520
<v Speaker 2>So I start walking out to his car in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>librarian sees him and me and start </v>

899
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.490
<v Speaker 2>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

900
00:38:57.491 --> 00:38:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Joseph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep away from that man.</v>

901
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:00.770
<v Speaker 2>He just got out of jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

902
00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:03.010
<v Speaker 2>I was crying and I ran to her and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy ran away.</v>

903
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.790
<v Speaker 2>But I think to myself like I had no </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

904
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what a child molester was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

905
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand.</v>

906
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if he tried to touch you,</v>

907
00:39:12.131 --> 00:39:13.450
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this feels weird.</v>

908
00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I know I don't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just such a gray area and our,</v>

909
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.790
<v Speaker 1>our sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

910
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:23.791
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a doctor to like abuse and you </v>

911
00:39:23.791 --> 00:39:23.791
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

912
00:39:23.791 --> 00:39:23.791
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's touching me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needs to be doing that.</v>

913
00:39:23.791 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what went on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your sexuality,</v>

914
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:29.050
<v Speaker 1>especially as you're younger is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>

915
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to fuck up a girl's </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

916
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:36.240
<v Speaker 1>all you gotta do is go over and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>grab her boobs as an adult and like </v>

917
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.960
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go up and grab some young kids Dick</v>

918
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.720
<v Speaker 1>or like touch a woman's vagina and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>

919
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Like it's such of precious vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

920
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 1>The fact that any of us get out </v>
<v Speaker 1>unscathed is America.</v>

921
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I had another one when I was 14.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No 13 wasn't in high school yet,</v>

922
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.320
<v Speaker 2>so it was like the year before high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school I used to go fishing at this lake</v>

923
00:39:54.321 --> 00:39:56.330
<v Speaker 2>and there was this old dude that used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come by the lake.</v>

924
00:39:56.331 --> 00:40:01.331
<v Speaker 2>He was jogging all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and my buddies would fish there and </v>

925
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:03.710
<v Speaker 2>he was a former professor and he Kumbaya</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talked to us.</v>

926
00:40:03.711 --> 00:40:08.711
<v Speaker 2>He was always like really smart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate and interesting to talk to </v>

927
00:40:08.711 --> 00:40:10.370
<v Speaker 2>and it would sit with us while we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fishing and talk to us.</v>

928
00:40:10.371 --> 00:40:11.930
<v Speaker 2>It was always super friendly and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>drove up,</v>

929
00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.960
<v Speaker 2>drive off or run off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then one day I went over his house </v>

930
00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.610
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't think anything of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'd been around the sky all the </v>

931
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:22.630
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He um,</v>

932
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:27.650
<v Speaker 2>he watched me pee in the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't think anything of that either,</v>

933
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.750
<v Speaker 2>like grown man watching me.</v>

934
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:34.750
<v Speaker 2>P is like normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like maybe a week later he </v>

935
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:39.551
<v Speaker 2>showed up at the pond where we would </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish and he was drunk and he told me he </v>

936
00:40:40.881 --> 00:40:44.520
<v Speaker 2>loved me and I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

937
00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

938
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I like you too because I'm fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the time it was like,</v>

939
00:40:48.681 --> 00:40:52.910
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this guy going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're in a weird area of the pond.</v>

940
00:40:52.911 --> 00:40:57.911
<v Speaker 2>There was like no one around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like a lot of trees and </v>

941
00:40:57.911 --> 00:40:58.040
<v Speaker 2>bushes and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

942
00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.730
<v Speaker 2>it was sketchy and our memory said this </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

943
00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 2>said something about something along the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines of you can't have love without </v>

944
00:41:05.901 --> 00:41:07.940
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just out of the blue.</v>

945
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his opening.</v>

946
00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he loved me and he said,</v>

947
00:41:11.181 --> 00:41:13.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there can't be any love without sex.</v>

948
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

949
00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.300
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had a knife and I remember I had a</v>

950
00:41:17.301 --> 00:41:21.170
<v Speaker 2>knife and I put my hand in my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a little folding knife and I held</v>

951
00:41:21.171 --> 00:41:26.171
<v Speaker 2>onto it in my pocket and I told him he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to get away from me and then I'm </v>

952
00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:29.330
<v Speaker 2>leaving and he told me I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>overreacting and I reeled in my line and</v>

953
00:41:29.331 --> 00:41:30.230
<v Speaker 2>got out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

954
00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.930
<v Speaker 2>this guy wants to do something to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

955
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.150
<v Speaker 2>I can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

956
00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:37.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe I might be able to stab them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

957
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely,</v>

958
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:41.690
<v Speaker 2>I think about that because</v>

959
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.690
<v Speaker 1>especially as a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hate to keep saying that,</v>

960
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 1>but it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

961
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:47.450
<v Speaker 1>it does affect us the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

962
00:41:47.451 --> 00:41:48.800
<v Speaker 1>you get in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber's like,</v>

963
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:50.480
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get in with this dude,</v>

964
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:55.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get in this cab and hope that </v>

965
00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:55.540
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to snap today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

966
00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.900
<v Speaker 1>even a cab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a guy's actual car,</v>

967
00:41:56.901 --> 00:42:01.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's even more intimate or just </v>

968
00:42:01.901 --> 00:42:01.901
<v Speaker 1>walking or it's basically your app,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

969
00:42:01.901 --> 00:42:04.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be vigilant about it because</v>

970
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:09.431
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody just decides this is what </v>

971
00:42:09.431 --> 00:42:09.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do and we're all vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Greece.</v>

972
00:42:09.431 --> 00:42:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Some guy decides to take out an AK 47 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive his car into a group.</v>

973
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.220
<v Speaker 1>We're all just sitting ducks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

974
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.300
<v Speaker 1>and all the preparation in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't fight a gun with your fist.</v>

975
00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:22.190
<v Speaker 1>You can't outweigh a man with your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass as a woman was a real big girl.</v>

976
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

977
00:42:24.471 --> 00:42:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about those things.</v>

978
00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why it's tough when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking in,</v>

979
00:42:29.151 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 1>you're a girl and some guys like smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

980
00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to fucking survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget the smile thing.</v>

981
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.990
<v Speaker 2>That's such a bully move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because those guys who do that,</v>

982
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.540
<v Speaker 2>they're only doing that because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger and stronger than you.</v>

983
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

984
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.010
<v Speaker 2>smiling causes wrinkles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrinkles.</v>

985
00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.570
<v Speaker 2>What if you have done like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even smile.</v>

986
00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you like,</v>

987
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.400
<v Speaker 2>the reason why a guy will do that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he can like,</v>

988
00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.530
<v Speaker 2>a guy's not going to do that to a bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

989
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.180
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a bigger man walks by,</v>

990
00:42:54.181 --> 00:42:54.870
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smile.</v>

991
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

992
00:42:55.610 --> 00:43:00.610
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're ordering someone to do </v>

993
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:00.630
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But moreover</v>

994
00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting on a face just saying I </v>

995
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.640
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be bothered because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared and I'm trying to get from point </v>

996
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.870
<v Speaker 1>a to point B and you're praying on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability thinking that I want that.</v>

997
00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:12.610
<v Speaker 1>If I want to see your Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

998
00:43:12.611 --> 00:43:13.680
<v Speaker 1>if I want to talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll look.</v>

999
00:43:13.681 --> 00:43:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1000
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.820
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking that you want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing is they're realizing </v>

1001
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:18.890
<v Speaker 2>that you don't want to have anything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with them.</v>

1002
00:43:18.891 --> 00:43:22.490
<v Speaker 2>And by saying that they have this power </v>
<v Speaker 2>to affect you,</v>

1003
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:27.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what scary watch smile wouldn't look </v>

1004
00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:27.580
<v Speaker 2>like such a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1005
00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:31.810
<v Speaker 1>And what's scary is then if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what wrath that's going to </v>

1006
00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:36.371
<v Speaker 1>incur when I say fuck off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better put them on the other side of </v>

1007
00:43:36.371 --> 00:43:36.480
<v Speaker 1>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1008
00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:41.940
<v Speaker 1>And what's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I and I talked about it in the </v>

1009
00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:41.940
<v Speaker 1>specialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to do a bit.</v>

1010
00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.430
<v Speaker 1>This is such a common conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this thing where a guy says </v>

1011
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.430
<v Speaker 1>something to him who sweetheart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

1012
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:46.460
<v Speaker 1>fuck off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get tough.</v>

1013
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Immediately followed by what if he kills</v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

1014
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.880
<v Speaker 1>It's always our thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1015
00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:51.260
<v Speaker 1>please don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't follow me.</v>

1016
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1017
00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.470
<v Speaker 1>We came out of this show last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl's night in show,</v>

1018
00:43:55.471 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 1>and everybody was feeling great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We walk outside and it's like,</v>

1019
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.810
<v Speaker 1>dude walks up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boat to go to the loader.</v>

1020
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.320
<v Speaker 1>You're walking into a group of five </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls having a lively conversation.</v>

1021
00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:06.290
<v Speaker 1>You put yourself in the middle and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked where I go ill,</v>

1022
00:44:06.291 --> 00:44:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he like started chirping at me.</v>

1023
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:13.990
<v Speaker 1>What's your problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was a lawyer and my fucking dumb </v>

1024
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:13.990
<v Speaker 1>friends like I think I do sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

1025
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:16.190
<v Speaker 1>this is not the time to demonstrate how </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate you are.</v>

1026
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give him a lighter.</v>

1027
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no reason to go anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1028
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:22.670
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously a crazy person,</v>

1029
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:25.530
<v Speaker 2>but that's another incidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are instance where other,</v>

1030
00:44:25.531 --> 00:44:28.940
<v Speaker 2>where a guy will do that because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger because he can get away with.</v>

1031
00:44:28.941 --> 00:44:30.910
<v Speaker 2>That guy's not going to do that to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of guys know.</v>

1032
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.540
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this.</v>

1033
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.670
<v Speaker 2>The reason why he's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing it because he's as imposing </v>

1034
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.670
<v Speaker 2>like he's a big dog walking to a room</v>

1035
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:42.640
<v Speaker 1>in this and sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for shows like I have security </v>

1036
00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 1>thereafter and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1037
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:45.510
<v Speaker 1>not beyond say it's not like people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing themselves at me,</v>

1038
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:50.511
<v Speaker 1>but I found just having a large man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a friend of mine standing </v>

1039
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:52.530
<v Speaker 1>next to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>detours,</v>

1040
00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:57.531
<v Speaker 1>even the beginnings of even the inklings</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a let me step to her and see what's </v>

1041
00:44:57.531 --> 00:44:58.650
<v Speaker 1>going to happen just for having one </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1042
00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's got to be a thing with girls </v>

1043
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:04.310
<v Speaker 2>that's different with like God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get obsessed with people.</v>

1044
00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Guys get obsessed with girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls get obsessed with guys.</v>

1045
00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:12.220
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are unstable and they lock onto someone </v>

1046
00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:12.220
<v Speaker 2>that get obsessed with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1047
00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.990
<v Speaker 2>But if a man gets obsessed with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually,</v>

1048
00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.940
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a giant issue</v>

1049
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:22.210
<v Speaker 1>and there is no separation by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just be obsessed with me </v>

1050
00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:22.210
<v Speaker 1>because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1051
00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was brilliant and I'm totally normal</v>

1052
00:45:23.331 --> 00:45:25.850
<v Speaker 1>like relationship with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1053
00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Had that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a stalker.</v>

1054
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:32.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1055
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I did a show in Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it Michigan?</v>

1056
00:45:36.951 --> 00:45:41.951
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was university of Delaware and I was </v>

1057
00:45:41.951 --> 00:45:41.951
<v Speaker 1>going to Michigan the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1058
00:45:41.951 --> 00:45:44.250
<v Speaker 1>and the idea of college obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the woman working there,</v>

1059
00:45:44.251 --> 00:45:45.020
<v Speaker 1>she comes up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

1060
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.980
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy here.</v>

1061
00:45:45.981 --> 00:45:46.820
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's your cousin?</v>

1062
00:45:46.821 --> 00:45:48.500
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a cousin in Delaware.</v>

1063
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.000
<v Speaker 1>So she leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she comes back,</v>

1064
00:45:50.001 --> 00:45:52.610
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says he's a comic from La.</v>

1065
00:45:52.611 --> 00:45:57.611
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any comes from Delaware </v>

1066
00:45:57.611 --> 00:45:57.611
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she leaves,</v>

1067
00:45:57.611 --> 00:45:57.611
<v Speaker 1>she comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>

1068
00:45:57.611 --> 00:45:57.611
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1069
00:45:57.611 --> 00:45:58.910
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop coming back to me.</v>

1070
00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:04.210
<v Speaker 1>This is obviously like several attempts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now security has to walk me out to </v>

1071
00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:05.120
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we do that.</v>

1072
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And so I had it kind of in my mind like </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody did something.</v>

1073
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.340
<v Speaker 1>So I've go to Michigan and I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michigan,</v>

1074
00:46:10.341 --> 00:46:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm there for a festival the next day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the secure.</v>

1075
00:46:13.491 --> 00:46:15.470
<v Speaker 1>And I mentioned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just kind of mentioned.</v>

1076
00:46:15.471 --> 00:46:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened yesterday and the security</v>

1077
00:46:17.421 --> 00:46:18.440
<v Speaker 1>guard comes over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

1078
00:46:18.441 --> 00:46:23.441
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy waiting in the hallway </v>

1079
00:46:23.441 --> 00:46:25.511
<v Speaker 1>after we cleared it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I talked to him he kind of ran </v>

1080
00:46:25.511 --> 00:46:26.750
<v Speaker 1>away and I kind of got his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he likes his ID for a second.</v>

1081
00:46:26.751 --> 00:46:31.751
<v Speaker 1>The guy was like trying to get in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was creepy enough that security </v>

1082
00:46:31.751 --> 00:46:35.290
<v Speaker 1>like caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they showed me the surveillance </v>

1083
00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:37.661
<v Speaker 1>tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see nothing but a grainy face and </v>

1084
00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:38.450
<v Speaker 1>like a black leather jacket and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought his name was.</v>

1085
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:42.170
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of weeks later I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to play south by southwest,</v>

1086
00:46:42.171 --> 00:46:45.830
<v Speaker 1>so I told my manager about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she tells security there,</v>

1087
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:47.410
<v Speaker 1>my buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna,</v>

1088
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:52.430
<v Speaker 1>say his name because he's very shy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is ex army ranger and works for the </v>

1089
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:58.240
<v Speaker 1>contracts with the government and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>told him so he called the FBI and they </v>

1090
00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.771
<v Speaker 1>gave him with just the grainy photo and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we thought his name was and they </v>

1091
00:47:02.771 --> 00:47:05.960
<v Speaker 1>found who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just some nut who of course has guns and</v>

1092
00:47:05.961 --> 00:47:10.430
<v Speaker 1>has a record and lives off his family </v>
<v Speaker 1>money somewhere in rural whatever.</v>

1093
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:16.270
<v Speaker 1>And I was at south by southwest and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had given and I felt bad and this goes </v>

1094
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:17.960
<v Speaker 1>to women feeling bad for taking up </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

1095
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.330
<v Speaker 1>There were way more famous people there </v>
<v Speaker 1>than me.</v>

1096
00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.490
<v Speaker 1>But here I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't pick up my badge.</v>

1097
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.220
<v Speaker 1>I had to go talk to the police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had to have an escort everywhere.</v>

1098
00:47:25.221 --> 00:47:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing like a bar show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1099
00:47:27.351 --> 00:47:32.351
<v Speaker 1>I'm just there to hang out with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and I had to have to all three </v>

1100
00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:32.351
<v Speaker 1>shows</v>

1101
00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:35.730
<v Speaker 3>and I felt embarrassed because I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>this police escort and like huge movie </v>

1102
00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 3>stars are there and they don't even have</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and I didn't want anyone to look at</v>

1103
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:43.351
<v Speaker 3>me like who does she think she is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was scared and he had and so it </v>

1104
00:47:43.351 --> 00:47:47.461
<v Speaker 3>was the last show and I thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the clear and I go and I do my set </v>

1105
00:47:47.461 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 3>and one of the cops comes over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

1106
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:53.221
<v Speaker 3>he showed up and we caught him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but had they not been there and they </v>

1107
00:47:53.221 --> 00:47:57.541
<v Speaker 3>talked to them and I guess they put the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fear of God in him because they were </v>

1108
00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:57.541
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't want to talk to you.</v>

1109
00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:57.541
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1110
00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:02.221
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hurt her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm thinking your version of hurt </v>

1111
00:48:02.221 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 3>and mine are very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I need my skin.</v>

1112
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:05.170
<v Speaker 3>You probably don't think it hurts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take it off of me.</v>

1113
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:07.930
<v Speaker 3>How about you don't want to talk to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

1114
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Like he didn't want to hurt her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I need to talk to her.</v>

1115
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:12.000
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never need,</v>

1116
00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:15.620
<v Speaker 3>you don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's Texas cops so they love,</v>

1117
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:20.730
<v Speaker 3>they get super hard for you in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking desert and they scared them off </v>

1118
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:24.331
<v Speaker 3>and I've never had to deal with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for months at the Improv at the </v>

1119
00:48:24.331 --> 00:48:24.331
<v Speaker 3>customer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had this guy's picture up,</v>

1120
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.320
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ and I did nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1121
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you decide like he goes,</v>

1122
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 3>she's communicates with me through </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation and Kabbalah.</v>

1123
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1124
00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:36.500
<v Speaker 3>let them in Jewish meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1125
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.590
<v Speaker 3>I think a Madonna was doing that for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

1126
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Jewish mysticism wasn't madonna like she</v>
<v Speaker 3>was into which all these people that are</v>

1127
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:49.171
<v Speaker 3>like kabbalists that have studied it </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever and she's trying to like hack </v>

1128
00:48:49.171 --> 00:48:49.900
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is Madonna.</v>

1129
00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:53.110
<v Speaker 3>She gets a velvet rope to the front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the line.</v>

1130
00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.910
<v Speaker 3>That was Janet Jackson's tore the velvet</v>
<v Speaker 3>rope tour.</v>

1131
00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Thought you're making like a pop </v>
<v Speaker 3>reference.</v>

1132
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.220
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saying like she gets VIP to the Kabbalah</v>

1133
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Registering in the water.</v>

1134
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.580
<v Speaker 3>What is Caballo like w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you know?</v>

1135
00:49:03.581 --> 00:49:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Anything about the study of Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 3>mysticism.</v>

1136
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 3>So Judaism is actually a very ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of mystical,</v>

1137
00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:15.420
<v Speaker 3>spiritual religion and this Kinda goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of back to its roots and its </v>

1138
00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:18.300
<v Speaker 3>something that you can't because I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>always been interested in,</v>

1139
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.580
<v Speaker 3>you can't just pick up a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's a lot of studying,</v>

1140
00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.120
<v Speaker 3>a lot of like deep seated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissecting Hebrew numbers,</v>

1141
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:30.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not something you just decide </v>

1142
00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.731
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know much about it other </v>

1143
00:49:32.731 --> 00:49:33.660
<v Speaker 3>than it from ancient Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ancient like it's.</v>

1144
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1145
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird language.</v>

1146
00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:42.690
<v Speaker 3>I would love to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I love looking at old </v>

1147
00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.781
<v Speaker 3>languages because you're looking at like</v>
<v Speaker 3>some weird art form and that way it was </v>

1148
00:49:45.781 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 3>the first forms of communication.</v>

1149
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.790
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1150
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.840
<v Speaker 3>ancient Hebrew or ancient Arabic or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Aramaic or something like that.</v>

1151
00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:57.841
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the way those things are </v>

1152
00:49:57.841 --> 00:49:59.251
<v Speaker 3>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the sentence is written out of </v>

1153
00:49:59.251 --> 00:49:59.251
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1154
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.640
<v Speaker 3>it's several hundred years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a Thai Bible.</v>

1155
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's on my wall,</v>

1156
00:50:05.621 --> 00:50:07.960
<v Speaker 3>like I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's written on these,</v>

1157
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:13.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>palm the palm would and flattened it out</v>

1158
00:50:13.391 --> 00:50:16.690
<v Speaker 3>and painted it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like this really like artistic,</v>

1159
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:19.620
<v Speaker 3>weird thing that's framed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just go buy it.</v>

1160
00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.500
<v Speaker 3>I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1161
00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:22.630
<v Speaker 3>this is like I have no idea what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it says,</v>

1162
00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's just cool to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1163
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:30.390
<v Speaker 3>Weird way of of writing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating these people had was also </v>

1164
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:33.821
<v Speaker 3>fascinating because like they had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>urge that we do to record everything.</v>

1165
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.140
<v Speaker 3>People are going to look at ours in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years and be like,</v>

1166
00:50:36.141 --> 00:50:37.820
<v Speaker 3>why are there all these eggplant emojis?</v>

1167
00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Why does everything have eggplant and </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirting water?</v>

1168
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Why is everyone yellow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they had to say,</v>

1169
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I always wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did they have.</v>

1170
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:47.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously they didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same advancements,</v>

1171
00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:52.961
<v Speaker 3>but like ancient Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like did they have like what were young </v>

1172
00:50:52.961 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 3>people doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like was it,</v>

1173
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:56.630
<v Speaker 3>what was your fun besides vomiting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't vomitorium in wrestling?</v>

1174
00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I would just love to be a fly on </v>

1175
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:02.280
<v Speaker 3>the wall back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1176
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.160
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking about people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>had very little understanding of how the</v>

1177
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:07.850
<v Speaker 3>universe worked or the rudimentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of science,</v>

1178
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:13.030
<v Speaker 3>just to hear the wisest the wise amongst</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and try to figure out what makes </v>

1179
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:14.720
<v Speaker 3>everything tick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking about how acne is the devil.</v>

1180
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.540
<v Speaker 3>We want to talk about how women were </v>
<v Speaker 3>treated.</v>

1181
00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Then that's what's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like women have always been treated</v>

1182
00:51:20.901 --> 00:51:25.901
<v Speaker 3>like shit always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always been some weird sort of </v>

1183
00:51:25.901 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 3>relationship between men and women </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can get away with it.</v>

1184
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.330
<v Speaker 3>That's really the bottom line about at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1185
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:34.331
<v Speaker 3>It's like what's happening today I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that because of the ability to </v>

1186
00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:40.691
<v Speaker 3>express now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's almost like something could </v>

1187
00:51:40.691 --> 00:51:44.030
<v Speaker 3>happen to you in a bad way and no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>could know about it.</v>

1188
00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now everyone can know about it if </v>

1189
00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:49.120
<v Speaker 3>you express it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you express it,</v>

1190
00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.510
<v Speaker 3>everyone can know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone can know.</v>

1191
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:56.440
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now everybody's realizing that and </v>

1192
00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.490
<v Speaker 3>there's like a shift where everybody's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when black lives matter really</v>

1193
00:51:58.491 --> 00:51:59.630
<v Speaker 3>came to the forefront,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1194
00:51:59.631 --> 00:52:01.340
<v Speaker 3>And all these white people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1195
00:52:01.341 --> 00:52:03.380
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize America was racist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>black people are like,</v>

1196
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we did.</v>

1197
00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.890
<v Speaker 3>So all these women now are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1198
00:52:06.891 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 3>this shit goes on all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I even think about in comedy,</v>

1199
00:52:10.671 --> 00:52:15.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I went on a twitter rant the other </v>

1200
00:52:15.671 --> 00:52:15.671
<v Speaker 3>day about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea,</v>

1201
00:52:15.671 --> 00:52:19.550
<v Speaker 3>it's an art comedy as art and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel ownership over it.</v>

1202
00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:21.380
<v Speaker 3>So you get these boys clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1203
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:23.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm very lucky in that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1204
00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:28.991
<v Speaker 3>like you get like it's a group of dudes </v>
<v Speaker 3>that run the show and they don't like </v>

1205
00:52:28.991 --> 00:52:31.961
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is or the way a lot of guys </v>

1206
00:52:31.961 --> 00:52:34.271
<v Speaker 3>make women feel and it's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like so because you moved to La a </v>

1207
00:52:34.271 --> 00:52:36.560
<v Speaker 3>year before me and you and your friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote the same jerk-off jokes.</v>

1208
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.600
<v Speaker 3>You somehow think you own this art form </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've always felt a connection to it</v>

1209
00:52:40.601 --> 00:52:43.320
<v Speaker 3>my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because you remember it.</v>

1210
00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.530
<v Speaker 3>Because I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

1211
00:52:45.531 --> 00:52:47.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean you get it,</v>

1212
00:52:47.151 --> 00:52:48.350
<v Speaker 3>like do you understand it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

1213
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:50.140
<v Speaker 3>does it happen to me as it happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1214
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.650
<v Speaker 3>and the truth is I was able to avoid it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of what I did in my career early</v>

1215
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:58.220
<v Speaker 3>on because like winning a show like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you,</v>

1216
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.730
<v Speaker 3>you get to headline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was never respected.</v>

1217
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:06.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not even that as much as I just was</v>
<v Speaker 3>never in the trenches as much because I </v>

1218
00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:08.040
<v Speaker 3>got to headline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is always the goal.</v>

1219
00:53:08.041 --> 00:53:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Like I just had a different path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much,</v>

1220
00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:15.610
<v Speaker 3>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many years were you doing standup </v>

1221
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:15.610
<v Speaker 3>before you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One last comic standing.</v>

1222
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

1223
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me,</v>

1224
00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:20.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm even more firmly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess planted in my,</v>

1225
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 3>in my convictions about sympathizing or </v>
<v Speaker 3>empathizing with women who didn't</v>

1226
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.400
<v Speaker 1>have the same advantage and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1227
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:30.860
<v Speaker 1>or anyone being bullied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've see it,</v>

1228
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at clubs that we do.</v>

1229
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:34.290
<v Speaker 1>And these are my home clubs and I love </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1230
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Coming up the last 10 years I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched.</v>

1231
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good guy.</v>

1232
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:43.701

<v Speaker 1>like daily harasses women and all the </v>

1233
00:53:43.701 --> 00:53:44.010
<v Speaker 1>guys like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's front,</v>

1235
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:46.740
<v Speaker 1>we're friends with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1236
00:53:46.741 --> 00:53:48.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like you've seen the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that.</v>

1237
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna say names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are people who go out of their</v>

1238
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:55.881
<v Speaker 1>way to be horrific and I never see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys around us and these are all </v>

1239
00:53:55.881 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 1>contemporaries say anything because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like now he's a good guy.</v>

1240
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:03.120
<v Speaker 1>He's our friend and women will dm me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Female comics will send me messages.</v>

1241
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 1>This is happening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said this to me,</v>

1242
00:54:05.731 --> 00:54:06.930
<v Speaker 1>what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1243
00:54:06.931 --> 00:54:11.931
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do is be kind work on your </v>

1244
00:54:11.931 --> 00:54:11.931
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that guy doesn't mean anything,</v>

1245
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 1>but it is a thing.</v>

1246
00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Does mean something psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have to go to the club and then </v>

1247
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:18.890
<v Speaker 2>you see that guy and if you see him </v>
<v Speaker 2>right before you have a set.</v>

1248

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1249
00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1250
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:22.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreements.</v>

1251
00:54:22.721 --> 00:54:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I was nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't you.</v>

1252
00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.240
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you and I had the,</v>

1253
00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.420
<v Speaker 1>the thing about your phone number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1254
00:54:28.421 --> 00:54:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to run into Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so afraid of Joe.</v>

1255
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's someone who's a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

1256
00:54:32.951 --> 00:54:34.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already such a weird thing to go to</v>

1257
00:54:34.961 --> 00:54:36.760
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the girls who were like,</v>

1258
00:54:36.761 --> 00:54:37.440
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1259
00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:40.030
<v Speaker 1>he told me I wasn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told me I was a slut.</v>

1260
00:54:40.031 --> 00:54:41.790
<v Speaker 1>He told me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me I was to x,</v>

1261
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:46.791
<v Speaker 1>Y,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Z to this and just as if the guy owns </v>

1262
00:54:46.791 --> 00:54:49.951
<v Speaker 1>the art form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when what breaks my heart is like real </v>

1263
00:54:49.951 --> 00:54:53.221
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you are like Sebastian or like </v>

1264
00:54:53.221 --> 00:54:56.071
<v Speaker 1>people that I or Mark Mayer and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that I look up to that I think are </v>

1265
00:54:56.071 --> 00:54:58.891
<v Speaker 1>so brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have time to sit there and </v>

1266
00:54:58.891 --> 00:54:59.890
<v Speaker 1>get in the head of some girl who's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make 15 bucks.</v>

1267
00:54:59.891 --> 00:55:01.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not your emo.</v>

1268
00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:03.030
<v Speaker 1>It's only loser.</v>

1269
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always feel that we're all in the same</v>

1270
00:55:06.961 --> 00:55:10.590
<v Speaker 2>boat together and that if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vagina and I have a penis,</v>

1271
00:55:10.591 --> 00:55:12.510
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all comics.</v>

1272
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Like I think the really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's got.</v>

1273
00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:20.080
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like even to be sincere sounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>like such horseshit and this weird day </v>

1274
00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.140
<v Speaker 2>and age because you feel like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to cover up and try.</v>

1275
00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1276
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that Harvey Weinstein Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm different.</v>

1277
00:55:26.491 --> 00:55:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1278
00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could sleep on the couch together.</v>

1279
00:55:29.951 --> 00:55:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I mean,</v>

1280
00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:37.530
<v Speaker 2>like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's very important that all</v>

1281
00:55:37.531 --> 00:55:40.560
<v Speaker 2>of us that work together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1282
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I could learn shit from comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from you,</v>

1283
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.140
<v Speaker 2>I can learn shit from anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1284
00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.970
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people do do standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've seen me do stand up.</v>

1285
00:55:50.971 --> 00:55:53.130
<v Speaker 2>They do it different than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talk.</v>

1286
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:55.340
<v Speaker 2>You've got a different method than I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1287
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.390
<v Speaker 2>There might be something you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>

1288
00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:01.230
<v Speaker 2>we're all peers and we're pairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

1289
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that with friends and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that with peers in a field like </v>

1290
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.470
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Within it,</v>

1291
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:11.090
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you gotta be open and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not open you're going to miss </v>

1292
00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:11.160
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1293
00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:15.820
<v Speaker 1>You're also very secure and I really do </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that insecurity,</v>

1294
00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:17.830
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a woman hating another </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

1295
00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.410
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a dude trying to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>step to another guy,</v>

1296
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:25.440
<v Speaker 1>it all comes from insecurity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're run the show with my </v>

1297
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.290
<v Speaker 1>buddies or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing it three years,</v>

1298
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm old the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're told that you're,</v>

1299
00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:29.330
<v Speaker 1>that you're owed more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1300
00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Or concrete job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have more.</v>

1301
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:36.210
<v Speaker 1>It comes from this insecurity of if she </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets something that I deserve and it </v>

1302
00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:37.450
<v Speaker 1>comes from this place of you think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve something.</v>

1303
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was a big thing for me after I </v>

1304
00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.061
<v Speaker 1>did the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The men that I had to tour with were </v>

1305
00:56:45.061 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 1>horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mental scars,</v>

1306
00:56:45.671 --> 00:56:48.400
<v Speaker 1>indelible marks on my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific.</v>

1307
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Because there was this entitlement like </v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare she take that,</v>

1308
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:52.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you,</v>

1309
00:56:52.751 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 1>when the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you not roll over and die.</v>

1310
00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.950
<v Speaker 1>But so I see that and I don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with it as much.</v>

1311
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1312
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:04.540
<v Speaker 1>my heart breaks because I wish that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these girls five years later could look,</v>

1313
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:07.450
<v Speaker 1>could realize from like a bird's eye </v>
<v Speaker 1>view when it's happening.</v>

1314
00:57:07.451 --> 00:57:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's got nothing.</v>

1315
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Like if you really are going to be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean to a fellow comic,</v>

1316
00:57:12.191 --> 00:57:12.950
<v Speaker 1>you obviously hate</v>

1317
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.040
<v Speaker 2>yourself so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't see that.</v>

1318
00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Like I wouldn't see that if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>hated me,</v>

1319
00:57:16.751 --> 00:57:18.970
<v Speaker 2>even if there were a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone hates you,</v>

1320
00:57:18.971 --> 00:57:19.590
<v Speaker 2>it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1321
00:57:19.591 --> 00:57:20.320
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hate yourself.</v>

1322
00:57:20.321 --> 00:57:25.321
<v Speaker 2>Hates them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're gonna have someone hates </v>

1323
00:57:25.321 --> 00:57:25.321
<v Speaker 2>on you because they saw themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>

1324
00:57:25.321 --> 00:57:25.321
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1325
00:57:25.321 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy when I started I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>these like comedy contest and like </v>

1326
00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Orange County,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were a total racket,</v>

1327
00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:35.620
<v Speaker 1>but I don't even know the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was another comic and he was </v>

1328
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:38.621
<v Speaker 1>like a middle aged dad and he would on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weekly basis write me hate email calling</v>

1329
00:57:39.741 --> 00:57:41.420
<v Speaker 1>me names that I had never been called in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my.</v>

1330
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I was like 23 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were fucking bitch,</v>

1331
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:48.490
<v Speaker 1>like just railing on me and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone jerking off very.</v>

1332
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:53.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how to handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one I've ever even had a woman be </v>

1333
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:53.840
<v Speaker 1>that mean to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

1334
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I took it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote back a couple times like what's </v>

1335
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.230
<v Speaker 1>your problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just,</v>

1336
00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:02.741
<v Speaker 1>he was just a crazy person firing off at</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone and a year later he wrote me an </v>

1337
00:58:02.811 --> 00:58:04.340
<v Speaker 1>email to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Rehab now.</v>

1338
00:58:04.341 --> 00:58:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a wife,</v>

1339
00:58:06.261 --> 00:58:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I've got kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you enter into this art form and into</v>

1340
00:58:09.771 --> 00:58:14.771
<v Speaker 1>the city with the best of intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to keep your soul as clean as </v>

1341
00:58:14.771 --> 00:58:18.761
<v Speaker 1>possible and you have no control over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy that's going to be in your </v>

1342
00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:19.850
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only have control over how you heal</v>

1343
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think every comic is crazy in a </v>

1344
00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:25.860
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just no way around it.</v>

1345
00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:30.930
<v Speaker 2>If you're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never met a single funny one that </v>

1346
00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:30.940
<v Speaker 2>wasn't fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all crazy.</v>

1347
00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:33.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just everyone's crazy as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1348
00:58:33.161 --> 00:58:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1349
00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Well here's the other side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get women and and my whole thing </v>

1350
00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:43.191
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be fired from your job for </v>

1351
00:58:43.191 --> 00:58:45.411
<v Speaker 1>not being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not because you didn't like fuck </v>

1352
00:58:45.411 --> 00:58:45.411
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1353
00:58:45.411 --> 00:58:45.480
<v Speaker 1>But I think some people take it a step </v>
<v Speaker 1>further.</v>

1354
00:58:45.481 --> 00:58:46.740
<v Speaker 1>They're like more for women and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1355
00:58:46.741 --> 00:58:46.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1356
00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:49.860
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do the jokes be funny.</v>

1357
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.110
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't get the gauges because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a girl.</v>

1358
00:58:52.111 --> 00:58:55.140
<v Speaker 1>You should get a chance and you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a chance to prove yourself.</v>

1359
00:58:55.141 --> 00:58:58.770
<v Speaker 1>And not everyone's standing in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this like more women in comedy.</v>

1360
00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The jokes be fucking funny.</v>

1361
00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will fight for you to get that chance,</v>

1362
00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:04.500
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to hire you</v>

1363
00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.760
<v Speaker 2>a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more women in comedy thing is like,</v>

1364
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I just want humans to be good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want good,</v>

1365
00:59:10.701 --> 00:59:14.360
<v Speaker 2>funny people and I think there are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>women in comedy now than ever before.</v>

1366
00:59:14.361 --> 00:59:16.940
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's more people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy now than ever before.</v>

1367
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:18.920
<v Speaker 2>So saturated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so saturated.</v>

1368
00:59:18.921 --> 00:59:20.810
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of.</v>

1369
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:26.500
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things that bothers me </v>

1370
00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.910
<v Speaker 2>the most about any sort of weird shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes on with Comedians,</v>

1371
00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:31.400
<v Speaker 2>whether it's boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Girl Shit or anything else,</v>

1372
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:36.730
<v Speaker 2>is that there is a comradery that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>share that is very unusual in a fairly </v>

1373
00:59:38.001 --> 00:59:43.001
<v Speaker 2>competitive art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Competitive in that I don't think it's </v>

1374
00:59:43.001 --> 00:59:46.811
<v Speaker 2>as competitive anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I mean by this is that I don't </v>

1375
00:59:46.811 --> 00:59:50.021
<v Speaker 2>think that the idea of like getting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitcom or being the host of the tonight </v>

1376
00:59:50.021 --> 00:59:51.050
<v Speaker 2>show or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1377
00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.450
<v Speaker 2>these limited number of gigs that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>available,</v>

1378
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's where it's at </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1379
00:59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I think there's more people like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are doing netflix specials in me </v>

1380
01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:04.120
<v Speaker 2>and we both do podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that kind of thing I think is way </v>

1381
01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.751
<v Speaker 2>more open to people and it's way easier </v>
<v Speaker 2>for us to all to be supportive of each </v>

1382
01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:11.300
<v Speaker 2>other and supportive of each other in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the art form of standup.</v>

1383
01:00:11.301 --> 01:00:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Like what's important in our world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't steal.</v>

1384
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't be an asshole to your fellow </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian.</v>

1385
01:00:16.681 --> 01:00:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Support each other and I'm going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there for you if you're there.</v>

1386
01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:20.180
<v Speaker 2>For me.</v>

1387
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two things to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1388
01:00:23.371 --> 01:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also easier to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive when someone's undeniable.</v>

1389
01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're first starting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're kind of in the clubs and</v>

1390
01:00:29.521 --> 01:00:34.521
<v Speaker 1>you're all kind of fighting for to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what you have when someone's </v>

1391
01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>genuinely funny man or a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the first one to be like,</v>

1392
01:00:35.521 --> 01:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love that.</v>

1393
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Like I visibly fell over subash and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bring them on stage and I'm sure he </v>

1394
01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't love it,</v>

1395
01:00:41.761 --> 01:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the.</v>

1396
01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you are.</v>

1397
01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds like a,</v>

1398
01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>like I'm stroking your ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>

1399
01:00:48.931 --> 01:00:53.931
<v Speaker 1>Like you single handedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think change the sort of landscape in </v>

1400
01:00:53.931 --> 01:00:58.191
<v Speaker 1>the way that we consume comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have this massive podcast.</v>

1401
01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:03.500
<v Speaker 1>You guys don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a studio that is at least 2 </v>

1402
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>million square feet and there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuffed animals everywhere.</v>

1403
01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Like what ones were not teddy bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's elk horns and there's an </v>

1404
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>interactive dinosaur exhibit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's huge.</v>

1405
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a monster drink fountain.</v>

1406
01:01:11.851 --> 01:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1407
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>having this podcast and then people see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's possible.</v>

1408
01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:22.341
<v Speaker 1>So what's funny is you did this and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>built this sort of podcast empire and </v>

1409
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:26.481
<v Speaker 1>there's other big ones too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is definitely one of the most </v>

1410
01:01:26.481 --> 01:01:30.051
<v Speaker 1>consumed on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then it sort of opens up this new </v>

1411
01:01:30.051 --> 01:01:32.751
<v Speaker 1>avenues and then you get all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics on do podcasts too and not </v>

1412
01:01:32.751 --> 01:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>everybody's equipped to do it and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1413
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 1>I think a glory and being one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>originals because you kind of paved the </v>

1414
01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Speaker 1>way</v>

1415
01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.560
<v Speaker 2>and imitators fucked up a lot in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning and got better at it.</v>

1416
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.010
<v Speaker 2>And I was having a conversation with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good buddy of mine this morning about it</v>

1417
01:01:45.011 --> 01:01:47.620
<v Speaker 2>and he was asking me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>

1418
01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:51.250
<v Speaker 2>We were just talking about conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>about letting figure there's like an art</v>

1419
01:01:51.251 --> 01:01:56.251
<v Speaker 2>form to letting people talk in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's easy to consume for the people </v>

1420
01:01:56.251 --> 01:01:56.251
<v Speaker 2>that are listening.</v>

1421
01:01:56.251 --> 01:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>We are very good listener and I think a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of when I started my podcast I did </v>

1422
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>it so I could work on my listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>

1423
01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I know you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was so nice.</v>

1424
01:02:03.491 --> 01:02:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Talk about support and you did not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

1425
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

1426
01:02:07.481 --> 01:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>and I don't do a lot of podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I begged to do yours.</v>

1427
01:02:11.021 --> 01:02:12.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like you asked me and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1428
01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm busy Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't do a lot of them because not</v>

1429
01:02:14.651 --> 01:02:16.900
<v Speaker 1>every comic is a good listener or </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipped.</v>

1430
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about before the show </v>

1431
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.010
<v Speaker 2>started about some interviews you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

1432
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>

1433
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:26.230
<v Speaker 3>there's always going to beat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you got to want to talk to </v>

1434
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.230
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like.</v>

1435
01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.120
<v Speaker 3>I like talking to people like this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why podcast is a good</v>

1436
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:34.590
<v Speaker 3>fit for me is because I'm curious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're very curious,</v>

1437
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:37.680
<v Speaker 3>very curious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like talking to people.</v>

1438
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.280
<v Speaker 3>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was saying like would I be a</v>

1439
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:46.281
<v Speaker 3>woman for a day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know how the fuck your brain </v>

1440
01:02:46.281 --> 01:02:46.281
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1441
01:02:46.281 --> 01:02:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I know you don't know how mine works and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I don't know how your works.</v>

1442
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:54.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated and I think that we try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure men and women try to figure </v>

1443
01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:58.611
<v Speaker 3>out our interactions with each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>through trial and error and when sexual </v>

1444
01:02:58.611 --> 01:02:59.190
<v Speaker 3>harassment and sexual assault and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

1445
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.440
<v Speaker 3>what's coming out in the news with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvey Weinstein and,</v>

1446
01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 3>and others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even the Kevin Spacey stuff,</v>

1447
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:09.530
<v Speaker 3>what we're starting to see Kevin Spacey </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff not very applicable to what I'm </v>

1448
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:10.980
<v Speaker 3>talking about because it's men doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to men,</v>

1449
01:03:10.981 --> 01:03:15.981
<v Speaker 3>but the Harvey Weinstein thing is it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like here's someone who's not even </v>

1450
01:03:15.981 --> 01:03:17.280
<v Speaker 3>trying to think about how women think.</v>

1451
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was trying to think,</v>

1452
01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:21.580
<v Speaker 3>how can I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can I do this the most?</v>

1453
01:03:21.581 --> 01:03:24.540
<v Speaker 3>He had like a network of people helping </v>
<v Speaker 3>him exact that plan.</v>

1454
01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:25.560
<v Speaker 3>This wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm drunk.</v>

1455
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:30.561
<v Speaker 3>Touch my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was my assistant's going to score </v>

1456
01:03:30.561 --> 01:03:30.561

<v Speaker 3>this up later.</v>

1458
01:03:30.571 --> 01:03:35.571
<v Speaker 3>Like it's maniacal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see that article from 1945 </v>

1459

<v Speaker 3>if this is Hollywood crazy,</v>

1462
01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:46.020

1465
01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:52.960

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goodbye.</v>

1468
01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:01.220
<v Speaker 3>that people were trying to fuck her all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time and she couldn't get any work </v>

1469
01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:01.220
<v Speaker 3>because they said she was cold.</v>

<v Speaker 3>in order to get work I have to like </v>

01:04:29.221 --> 01:04:31.650
<v Speaker 3>I hate to come to work in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm helpless.</v>

1480
01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:36.720
<v Speaker 3>A helpless victim of a Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 3>whispering campaign because I don't let </v>

1481
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.340
<v Speaker 3>the producer and director kiss me every </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning or tell them or let them,</v>

1482
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Paul me and have them spread the words </v>
<v Speaker 3>around town that I'm not a woman,</v>

1483
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.130
<v Speaker 3>that I have a cold piece of marble </v>
<v Speaker 3>statuary.</v>

1484
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Statuary could word.</v>

1485
01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:50.560
<v Speaker 3>I guess Hollywood won't consider me as </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything except a cold hunka marble </v>

1486
01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.350
<v Speaker 3>until I divorced my husband.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My husband gave me baby away and take my</v>

1487
01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:54.360
<v Speaker 3>name and photograph on all the newest </v>
<v Speaker 3>papers.</v>

1488
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:56.370
<v Speaker 3>If that's Hollywood's idea of being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

1489
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:58.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No crazy.</v>

1490
01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.640
<v Speaker 3>How good my accident is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1491
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:02.220
<v Speaker 3>it's very good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but 1945,</v>

1492
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:07.580
<v Speaker 3>but this is what I've always said about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood and this is one of the real </v>

1493
01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.420
<v Speaker 3>problems with the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in the business,</v>

1494
01:05:09.421 --> 01:05:11.610
<v Speaker 3>not just in terms of like the way it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>set up,</v>

1495
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:15.810
<v Speaker 3>but the problems for the person that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

1496
01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:17.740
<v Speaker 3>That's trying to be an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an actress.</v>

1497
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Here's</v>

1498
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:23.220
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to get picked so because you </v>

1499
01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:26.821
<v Speaker 2>have to get picked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go into places like please </v>

1500
01:05:26.821 --> 01:05:26.821
<v Speaker 2>like me and you're already fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>insecure,</v>

1501
01:05:26.821 --> 01:05:28.000
<v Speaker 2>which is why you're an actress in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

1502
01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:33.210
<v Speaker 2>The reason why you're an actor in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place because you want an </v>

1503
01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:33.400
<v Speaker 2>exorbitant amount of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably didn't get it when you were</v>

1504
01:05:33.401 --> 01:05:35.140
<v Speaker 2>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something missing.</v>

1505
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:39.240
<v Speaker 2>People like Daniel Day Lewis or he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different cat male.</v>

1506
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a few of those things out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a few of those.</v>

1507
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Especially Daniel Day Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been working the last two years is </v>

1508
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.430
<v Speaker 2>a cobbler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1509
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:48.580
<v Speaker 2>fucking shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's my favorite.</v>

1510
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:50.500
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a Weirdo.</v>

1511
01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:55.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when you watch him in some </v>

1512
01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:55.790
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1513
01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:55.790
<v Speaker 2>like there will be blood and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1514
01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:55.790
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1515
01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:58.000
<v Speaker 2>This is like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not even really acting.</v>

1516
01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:59.560
<v Speaker 2>You just become new people.</v>

1517
01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is that he becomes the guy on the </v>

1518
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.350
<v Speaker 2>set all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy all day.</v>

1519
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:07.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to spend that much time </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of my body.</v>

1520
01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:12.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem that I faced when I </v>

1521
01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.900
<v Speaker 2>first came here was I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1522
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had zero intention.</v>

1523
01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:22.010
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I started getting these </v>

1524
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:24.871
<v Speaker 2>development deals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on to auditions in my very first,</v>

1525
01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.000
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my early days of being an actor.</v>

1526
01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:30.160
<v Speaker 2>I got both shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1527
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.860
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this show called hardball and then</v>

1528
01:06:32.861 --> 01:06:37.861
<v Speaker 2>I got news radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were the two first two auditions </v>

1529
01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:37.861
<v Speaker 2>that I ever went on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I didn't,</v>

1530
01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I just got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I got his fucking lucky as a </v>

1531
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:46.171
<v Speaker 2>person can get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of it was because I didn't want to </v>

1532
01:06:46.171 --> 01:06:48.520
<v Speaker 2>do acting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't nervous about it and also I was</v>

1533
01:06:48.521 --> 01:06:53.521
<v Speaker 2>coming from fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was used to like really being </v>

1534
01:06:53.521 --> 01:06:53.521
<v Speaker 2>nervous.</v>

1535
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could go in there like,</v>

1536
01:06:56.141 --> 01:06:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

1537
01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.600
<v Speaker 2>How you guys doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fine.</v>

1538
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:59.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a kick in the nose.</v>

1539
01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:00.660
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get a concussion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bleed out of my ears.</v>

1541
01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.060
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this environment where you're always</v>

1542
01:07:07.061 --> 01:07:10.510
<v Speaker 2>wanting to get picked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why everybody out here is fucking</v>

1543
01:07:10.511 --> 01:07:12.220
<v Speaker 2>left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even there.</v>

1544
01:07:12.221 --> 01:07:14.380
<v Speaker 2>They're really left lane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to be.</v>

1545
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:18.550
<v Speaker 2>You have to wear a pink pussy hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to say,</v>

1546
01:07:18.551 --> 01:07:20.860
<v Speaker 2>you know all the things that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

1547
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:25.990
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're literally formulating an act and </v>

1548
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:29.110
<v Speaker 2>you bring that act into auditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You bring that act onto the red carpet.</v>

1549
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:34.260
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're seeing these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Harvey Weinstein who would donate </v>

1550
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:37.291
<v Speaker 2>to the Clinton campaign and do all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What seemed to be like very left wing </v>

1551
01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.120
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1552
01:07:40.121 --> 01:07:42.760
<v Speaker 2>and he was the darling of left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amy's Miramax,</v>

1553
01:07:42.761 --> 01:07:45.370
<v Speaker 2>which is really kind of a progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>studio.</v>

1554
01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:46.870
<v Speaker 2>People will thought me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1555
01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:50.740
<v Speaker 2>this is just a house of sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly,</v>

1556
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:52.900
<v Speaker 2>you can be a total pervert and have good</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

1557
01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:54.160
<v Speaker 2>bad politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

1558
01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:55.510
<v Speaker 2>But that's not a pervert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1559
01:07:55.540 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between what he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a perfect total psychopath predator.</v>

1560
01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's interesting too,</v>

1561
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:04.450
<v Speaker 2>because look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>donald trump's a fucking.</v>

1562
01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.010
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the worst.</v>

1563
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:11.250
<v Speaker 2>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going out and we're attacking </v>

1564
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:11.250
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people like,</v>

1565
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't speak to my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They voted for trump.</v>

1566
01:08:12.551 --> 01:08:13.330
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

1567
01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Well when they're dead you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can rethink</v>

1568
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those four years,</v>

1569
01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we out actors,</v>

1570
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.500
<v Speaker 1>like he's a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1571
01:08:21.501 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1572
01:08:23.301 --> 01:08:24.500
<v Speaker 1>some of them revel in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1573
01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Like James Woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's hilarious.</v>

1574
01:08:26.511 --> 01:08:28.730
<v Speaker 1>He's on twitter all day long fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with liberals,</v>

1575
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:31.520
<v Speaker 1>but he also was not of the best moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

1576
01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Here's something interesting on my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a Weinstein logo.</v>

1577
01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my book is the last one to be published </v>

1578
01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.030
<v Speaker 1>on the back or it's in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on the spine and what I've been </v>

1579
01:08:46.371 --> 01:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>likening to and I feel like the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it's a shit,</v>

1580
01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.020
<v Speaker 1>like they got absorbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein books was only two women.</v>

1581
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:54.020
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like a huge company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never met him or anything.</v>

1582
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I liken it to like when your grandpa </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes back from World War Two and he </v>

1583
01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.070
<v Speaker 1>brings back like a plate with a Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>insignia on it.</v>

1584
01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Like because they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made their own shit,</v>

1585
01:09:03.081 --> 01:09:04.970
<v Speaker 1>like Nazis had like a whole home goods </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

1586
01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he brings that one thing back.</v>

1587
01:09:07.671 --> 01:09:09.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what that book is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the last ones.</v>

1588
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the wwe now they don't have them </v>

1589
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:15.000
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1590
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:15.250
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before this had happened,</v>

1591
01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:19.120
<v Speaker 2>anybody would've done a miramax movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy,</v>

1592
01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fucking movies that they put </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1593
01:09:21.671 --> 01:09:23.560
<v Speaker 2>They put together some of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies of all time.</v>

1594
01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're getting to a place now </v>

1595
01:09:29.230 --> 01:09:29.230
<v Speaker 1>where we're realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1596
01:09:29.230 --> 01:09:33.190
<v Speaker 1>for every everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an upside down every the </v>

1597
01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:34.030
<v Speaker 1>upside down world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole stranger thing.</v>

1598
01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:38.330
<v Speaker 1>There's an underbelly to every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every business you can think of,</v>

1599
01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:41.660
<v Speaker 1>there is a CD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible side of it with horrible people</v>

1600
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:44.090
<v Speaker 1>and most of us choose to live in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>light and thing.</v>

1601
01:09:44.091 --> 01:09:49.091
<v Speaker 1>Things are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every industry has that and we're just </v>

1602
01:09:49.091 --> 01:09:52.991
<v Speaker 1>at a place now where like we're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaking it out and people are coming </v>

1603
01:09:52.991 --> 01:09:55.481
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this has always existed and it's </v>

1604
01:09:55.481 --> 01:09:55.520
<v Speaker 1>rampant in every business.</v>

1605
01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also,</v>

1606
01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:02.460
<v Speaker 2>there's like there's systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1607
01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.940
<v Speaker 2>and system systems of power where </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone gets to a position where they </v>

1608
01:10:08.851 --> 01:10:13.851
<v Speaker 2>have this massive amount of power almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>like royalty and what a guy like Harvey </v>

1609
01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Harvey Weinstein was essentially like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>royal in some ways,</v>

1610
01:10:18.841 --> 01:10:20.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like royalty,</v>

1611
01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.430
<v Speaker 2>massive power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1612
01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Massive money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got All of these people terrified of </v>

1613
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:27.710
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This big booming figure,</v>

1614
01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.640
<v Speaker 2>almost like a kingdom would cut your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head off.</v>

1615
01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you have that kind of power,</v>

1616
01:10:33.121 --> 01:10:38.121
<v Speaker 2>it's such an unrealistic position to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that.</v>

1617
01:10:38.221 --> 01:10:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it's human nature to exploit </v>
<v Speaker 2>those unrealistic positions.</v>

1618
01:10:42.421 --> 01:10:47.421
<v Speaker 2>That's why this Maureen O'hara articles </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating to me because this has </v>

1619
01:10:47.421 --> 01:10:52.371
<v Speaker 2>always been the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these unrealistic positions where </v>

1620
01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:55.521
<v Speaker 2>someone has to get chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one person who has a billion </v>

1621
01:10:55.521 --> 01:10:59.070
<v Speaker 2>dollars and makes 100 movies a year and </v>
<v Speaker 2>every people have to be chosen to be the</v>

1622
01:10:59.071 --> 01:11:02.430
<v Speaker 2>chosen ones to be in those movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a whole ecosystem,</v>

1623
01:11:02.431 --> 01:11:07.431
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have people that are </v>

1624
01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:07.431
<v Speaker 2>depending on that ecosystem for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own survival.</v>

1625
01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they know something wants to say</v>

1626
01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:09.630
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1627
01:11:09.631 --> 01:11:10.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

1628
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:15.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be the first one and then get </v>

1629
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:15.600
<v Speaker 2>fired and then you're fucked.</v>

1630
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:15.600
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're thinking.</v>

1631
01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:17.640
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing.</v>

1632
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.870
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1633
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:22.290
<v Speaker 3>Because rose McGowan was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff forever and they're like,</v>

1634
01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's crazy.</v>

1635
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.440
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for women.</v>

1636
01:11:25.441 --> 01:11:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to listen to that woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And historically,</v>

1637
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:29.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Monica Lewinsky,</v>

1638
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:34.880
<v Speaker 3>her life got wrapped and she was a young</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman with the most powerful man in the </v>

1639
01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.770
<v Speaker 3>world and we love Bill Clinton and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets called a whore.</v>

1640
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:43.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was a paradigm shift where people </v>

1641
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:46.971
<v Speaker 3>are now speaking and in terms of like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about exalting one </v>

1642
01:11:46.971 --> 01:11:48.300
<v Speaker 3>position and someone getting chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's shifting to people are like,</v>

1643
01:11:48.301 --> 01:11:49.380
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a cell phone.</v>

1644
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:53.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't need your movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have 8 billion followers on instagram.</v>

1645
01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:54.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just show my book.</v>

1646
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:59.630
<v Speaker 3>I'll just show my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll just make a video about me </v>

1647
01:11:59.630 --> 01:11:59.630
<v Speaker 3>eating pizza.</v>

1648
01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:01.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm relatable now and so everything is </v>
<v Speaker 3>shifting.</v>

1649
01:12:01.261 --> 01:12:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Everything shaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think this is ever gonna go away</v>

1650
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.570
<v Speaker 3>because if you're the kind of guy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>does that,</v>

1651
01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.940
<v Speaker 3>that's just something you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you're wrong.</v>

1652
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.160
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1653
01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't see how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think you can get away with</v>

1654
01:12:14.191 --> 01:12:15.090
<v Speaker 3>it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1655
01:12:15.091 --> 01:12:20.091
<v Speaker 3>it's for sure going to get watered down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always going to be some amount </v>

1656
01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:25.101
<v Speaker 3>of influence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Powerful people have that are in a </v>

1657
01:12:25.101 --> 01:12:27.770
<v Speaker 3>position where they're choosing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're implying that if you are that</v>

1658
01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.270
<v Speaker 3>kind of crazy where you're assaulting </v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

1659
01:12:30.271 --> 01:12:32.940
<v Speaker 3>that you are choosing good over evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just do.</v>

1660
01:12:32.941 --> 01:12:35.140
<v Speaker 3>If you're a predator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pray on things,</v>

1661
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.160
<v Speaker 3>but he couldn't do that when he was 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't have any money and nobody </v>

1662
01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.480
<v Speaker 3>might've done it a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so he might've been.</v>

1663
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:43.590
<v Speaker 3>It's just who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes it's who you are.</v>

1664
01:12:43.591 --> 01:12:46.380
<v Speaker 3>So this whole I went to rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm apologizing,</v>

1665
01:12:46.381 --> 01:12:47.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to listen.</v>

1666
01:12:47.521 --> 01:12:52.521
<v Speaker 3>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's who you are and you can </v>

1667
01:12:52.521 --> 01:12:52.521
<v Speaker 3>maybe stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that.</v>

1668
01:12:52.521 --> 01:12:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I do believe that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We like to think,</v>

1669
01:12:53.761 --> 01:12:58.761
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just go home and reflect for a </v>

1670
01:12:58.761 --> 01:13:00.201
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that they have a rehab that they </v>

1671
01:13:00.201 --> 01:13:00.810
<v Speaker 3>all go to break for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me a break.</v>

1672
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.520
<v Speaker 3>We can fix you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it Canyon ranch?</v>

1673
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:06.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not Kevin Spacey's there right now.</v>

1674
01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.830
<v Speaker 3>They go for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I will say,</v>

1675
01:13:07.831 --> 01:13:10.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute power corrupts absolutely.</v>

1676
01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:15.600
<v Speaker 3>So Dave becky gave the whole gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote a follow up letter to Lucy ks,</v>

1677
01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:20.630
<v Speaker 3>which I thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounded very genuine and there is </v>

1678
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.990
<v Speaker 3>something to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1679
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.400
<v Speaker 3>we have these levels that you exist on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1680
01:13:23.401 --> 01:13:25.890
<v Speaker 3>and you can't be aware.</v>

1681
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.110
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm going to put my foot in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my mouth,</v>

1682
01:13:28.111 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 3>but you can't be aware of everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going on all the time.</v>

1683
01:13:30.901 --> 01:13:35.901
<v Speaker 3>Some people think he was aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you're dealing with these high </v>

1684
01:13:35.901 --> 01:13:39.411
<v Speaker 3>level deals and you're at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar amount and you're flying high </v>

1685
01:13:39.411 --> 01:13:42.501
<v Speaker 3>above everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you genuinely might not know what's </v>

1686
01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:45.501
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you almost have a responsibility </v>

1687
01:13:45.501 --> 01:13:45.700
<v Speaker 3>when you are that powerful and someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>tells you something about your client to</v>

1688
01:13:45.701 --> 01:13:48.420
<v Speaker 3>like maybe take it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I go on a twitter rant,</v>

1689
01:13:48.421 --> 01:13:49.410
<v Speaker 3>my manager calls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's was like,</v>

1690
01:13:49.411 --> 01:13:50.540
<v Speaker 3>you're acting like a maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1691
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let's,</v>

1692
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.800
<v Speaker 3>let's follow that up then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1693
01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.300
<v Speaker 3>what does one do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1694
01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:55.950
<v Speaker 3>So if someone is a dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>becky,</v>

1695
01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.010
<v Speaker 3>and you think that this woman might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth,</v>

1696
01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:02.010
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know what Louis said today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Becky,</v>

1697
01:14:02.011 --> 01:14:07.011
<v Speaker 3>but we know that Louis told Mark Marin </v>
<v Speaker 3>ally as mark baron talked about it on </v>

1698
01:14:07.261 --> 01:14:09.720
<v Speaker 3>his podcast and he said that he asked </v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

1699
01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:11.130
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you jerk it off girls?</v>

1700
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:11.560
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1701
01:14:11.561 --> 01:14:12.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a rumor.</v>

1702
01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:14.110
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1703
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:16.480
<v Speaker 3>why don't you just talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>rumor?</v>

1704
01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:17.280
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

1705
01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:19.570
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that because then it'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>give it credence.</v>

1706
01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Which I guess I kind of understand if it</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't true,</v>

1707
01:14:25.690 --> 01:14:27.820
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think I have an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1708
01:14:27.821 --> 01:14:29.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't have one either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't.</v>

1709
01:14:29.171 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to seem like I'm going one </v>
<v Speaker 3>side or the other.</v>

1710
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:34.420
<v Speaker 3>It's disgusting and it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also,</v>

1711
01:14:34.421 --> 01:14:37.210
<v Speaker 3>when you hear inklings of rumors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear like little things.</v>

1712
01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Everybody always says like when their </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid ends up killing a bunch of people </v>

1713
01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:42.660
<v Speaker 3>that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

1714
01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.800
<v Speaker 3>And as the public were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you not know he exhibited x,</v>

1715
01:14:44.801 --> 01:14:45.490
<v Speaker 3>Y,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Z,</v>

1716
01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did all this.</v>

1717
01:14:46.601 --> 01:14:49.180
<v Speaker 3>He had a gun in his room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He decapitated rabbits.</v>

1718
01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:50.170
<v Speaker 3>How could you not know?</v>

1719
01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Maybe sometimes we are too close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and you don't want it to be </v>

1720
01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:55.620
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1721
01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:56.620
<v Speaker 3>what about that Vegas shooter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1722
01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:00.010
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy had nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had no criminal background.</v>

1723
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:04.270
<v Speaker 3>No one had any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave his girlfriend $100,000.</v>

1724
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.600
<v Speaker 3>She thought he was breaking up with her </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she thought he was giving her money.</v>

1725
01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:12.660
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just giving her money to get by </v>

1726
01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:14.621
<v Speaker 3>and while he was going to murder 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking people are 58 people and kill </v>

1727
01:15:14.621 --> 01:15:17.990
<v Speaker 3>himself can apply rationale to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrational thing where we don't know.</v>

1728
01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sort of situation like that.</v>

1729
01:15:20.261 --> 01:15:22.920
<v Speaker 3>School shooters.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Can you pull this up?</v>

1732

<v Speaker 3>a gun nut?</v>

1735
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1737
01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:41.350

<v Speaker 3>worth of artillery.</v>

1738
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:44.400
<v Speaker 3>You've got to watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has several shooting ranges.</v>

1739
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Shit burning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wait,</v>

1740
01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:49.450
<v Speaker 3>so his name Bernie is Bernie like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Epstein or something.</v>

1741
01:15:49.451 --> 01:15:51.310
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got tanks.</v>

1742
01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:53.910
<v Speaker 3>He's got tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got blamed for growers.</v>

1743
01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:56.490
<v Speaker 3>But first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1744
01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:58.720
<v Speaker 3>until I do want to partner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go in his house.</v>

1745
01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh good.</v>

1746
01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 3>Three percent of Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>According to a recent study,</v>

1747
01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.700
<v Speaker 3>over 50 percent of guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably fall into that group.</v>

1748
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think so few people have such</v>
<v Speaker 3>a large concentration of weapons?</v>

1749
01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.210
<v Speaker 3>You get addicted to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1750
01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:15.860
<v Speaker 3>it gets you in your blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but driving up my property now and uh,</v>

1751
01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:18.310
<v Speaker 3>there's all kinds of warning signs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you can see.</v>

1752
01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:22.240
<v Speaker 3>If anybody comes on your property and </v>
<v Speaker 3>threatens you with bodily harm,</v>

1753
01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:24.820
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal to shoot from Colorado law.</v>

1754
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.520
<v Speaker 3>They should have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like my dad is.</v>

1755
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:29.990
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the first signs I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One guy was a registered democrat.</v>

1756
01:16:29.991 --> 01:16:34.240
<v Speaker 3>It says he's got old cars laid out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>dolls,</v>

<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The number you want to party with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see.</v>

1761
01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:44.470
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a lot,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Colorado is the wrong place to pull out </v>

1822

<v Speaker 3>a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking everybody's armed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's Got Samurai swords.</v>

1825
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:32.110
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ was like this fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting character.</v>

1826
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people out there like </v>

1827
01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:39.640
<v Speaker 3>that in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas is crazy.</v>

1828
01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:39.920
<v Speaker 3>I grew up shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all the time,</v>

1829
01:19:39.921 --> 01:19:40.730
<v Speaker 3>but we would go.</v>

1830
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.170
<v Speaker 3>My best friend's parents would do these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of not reenactment shootings,</v>

1831
01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:50.171
<v Speaker 3>but they would dress up in period </v>
<v Speaker 3>costumes like late 19th century and we </v>

1832
01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:55.640
<v Speaker 3>would go out to the country and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have these little fake town set up</v>

1833
01:19:55.641 --> 01:20:00.641
<v Speaker 3>and it was like timed event shootings </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they all had names like boy named </v>

1834
01:20:00.641 --> 01:20:04.211
<v Speaker 3>sue and they had like their cowboy names</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'd shoot and you'd win like an </v>

1835
01:20:04.211 --> 01:20:07.450
<v Speaker 3>antique coin or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they would go and Mr Hewitt had all </v>

1836
01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:11.310
<v Speaker 3>the rifles and the guns and shoot at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like targets.</v>

1837
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:16.311
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember one was like just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of outline of like a fake saloon </v>

1838
01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:19.950
<v Speaker 3>town kind of thing and it's time timed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try to get your targets and we would</v>

1839
01:20:19.951 --> 01:20:24.951
<v Speaker 3>just drink dr pepper and watched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because I didn't and I've shot guns </v>

1840
01:20:24.951 --> 01:20:27.300
<v Speaker 3>a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't do much for me so my thing.</v>

1841
01:20:28.150 --> 01:20:30.960
<v Speaker 3>But he had a lot of them don't even like</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting with them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>alongside it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tackle it by the neck and you just punch</v>

1845
01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:40.940
<v Speaker 3>it into submission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1846
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:42.580
<v Speaker 3>you can't even get close to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1847

<v Speaker 3>He's brand new baby.</v>

1851
01:20:52.951 --> 01:20:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Cow Elk.</v>

<v Speaker 3>A baby.</v>

1853
01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A pony is not a baby horse.</v>

1854
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.090
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that crazy?</v>

1855
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.620
<v Speaker 3>What's a baby horse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Colt.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Colt is like a full grown horse.</v>

1858
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:13.140
<v Speaker 3>So pony is like a type of horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's its own kind of horse.</v>

1859
01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:14.510
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1860
01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.140
<v Speaker 3>I always thought a pony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1861
01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:19.080
<v Speaker 3>I should know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love telling people that fact.</v>

1862
01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:23.700
<v Speaker 3>I should know that pony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Babyhood registers.</v>

<v Speaker 3>donkey?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One the same as.</v>

1866
01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:35.180
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them is a hybrid.</v>

1867
01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:38.030
<v Speaker 3>A DM is a hybrid between a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A donkey is a horse and I'm.</v>

1868
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mule,</v>

1869
01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.420
<v Speaker 3>a mule and a donkey at the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1870
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:45.120
<v Speaker 3>one of them is a hybrid and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>non-viable.</v>

1871
01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.010
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean non-viable?</v>

1872
01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Meaning hybrid's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of hybrids can't breed reduced </v>

1873
01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:52.320
<v Speaker 3>when you breed a male donkey with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>female horse.</v>

1874
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1875
01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Notice the mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also an ugly type of shoe.</v>

01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:59.710
<v Speaker 3>A hiney meanwhile is a mules and ugly </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of shoe.</v>

1877
01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.230
<v Speaker 3>For Women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a slip on.</v>

1878
01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.680
<v Speaker 3>Put that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like enough with the folks who,</v>

1879
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:09.950
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many of your fans who like live in </v>

1880
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:12.111
<v Speaker 3>rural areas are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe these people don't know </v>

1881
01:22:12.111 --> 01:22:14.080
<v Speaker 3>the difference in the idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just ugly fat one,</v>

1882
01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:19.090
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you really hot you can pull that </v>

1883
01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:19.090
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys,</v>

1884
01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:19.090
<v Speaker 3>don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't get it.</v>

1885
01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:19.090
<v Speaker 3>But like that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Park goat.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's not even clothing.</v>

1889
01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:28.110
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I know this is because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>got mule.</v>

1890
01:22:28.111 --> 01:22:33.111
<v Speaker 3>Come for fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cheaper to make people drink meal.</v>

1891
01:22:33.361 --> 01:22:38.361
<v Speaker 3>Come [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mule come doesn't really become </v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:50.620
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what got the show canceled </v>

1898
01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.211
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the few people in show </v>

1899
01:22:53.211 --> 01:22:54.300
<v Speaker 3>business that has a show canceled </v>

<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

1902
01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably some behind the scenes </v>

1903
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 3>stuff off camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1910
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:22.770

1912
01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:32.480
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of the girls chose to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the urine because at least we.</v>

1913
01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:35.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a similar beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been there before.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1918
01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill you now.</v>

1919
01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.280
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Urine is nothing.</v>

1920
01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Urine is just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only drink your own urine.</v>

1921
01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I think eight times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that she's got.</v>

1922
01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:58.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like doing the acid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it more than eight times.</v>

1923
01:23:58.601 --> 01:23:59.890
<v Speaker 2>You become insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1926
01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:04.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a fact about drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only drink if you're stranded.</v>

1927
01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.300
<v Speaker 2>You can only drink your urine a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of times before it becomes toxic.</v>

1928
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Did you read about those two women that </v>
<v Speaker 2>got up?</v>

1929
01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:15.510
<v Speaker 2>They got stuck at sea for like five </v>
<v Speaker 2>months with their dog eat the dog.</v>

1930
01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:23.130
<v Speaker 2>They had like a year's supply of food on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boat so that apparently it's falling</v>

1931
01:24:23.741 --> 01:24:27.100
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stories falling apart and now people</v>

1932
01:24:27.101 --> 01:24:30.760
<v Speaker 2>don't even believe they were really </v>
<v Speaker 2>stranded as long as they were like.</v>

1933
01:24:30.761 --> 01:24:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Apparently people were suspicious right </v>
<v Speaker 2>away because they were too well kept.</v>

1934
01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and then now their story would have </v>

1935
01:24:39.150 --> 01:24:42.251
<v Speaker 2>been reading and I should shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really comment on it until I see if he </v>

1936
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:45.301
<v Speaker 2>could find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much of how much it's </v>

1937
01:24:45.301 --> 01:24:46.600
<v Speaker 2>fallen apart because I was reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about how it continues to fall</v>

1938
01:24:46.601 --> 01:24:47.080
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

1939
01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:49.960
<v Speaker 2>The story continues with like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>might've just pretended to be at sea for</v>

1940
01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:53.520
<v Speaker 2>five months because you would eat that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would eat that dog also,</v>

1941
01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:56.470
<v Speaker 2>like you might not if you have a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>supply of food.</v>

1942
01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1943
01:24:57.341 --> 01:25:02.341
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have those like Alex Jones </v>

1944
01:25:02.341 --> 01:25:02.740
<v Speaker 2>supplies those fucking buckets at Jim </v>
<v Speaker 2>Baker pushes.</v>

1945
01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:06.880
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen that at the end time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rescued?</v>

1946
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Stick with their story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would say the same thing.</v>

1947
01:25:10.571 --> 01:25:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1948
01:25:11.561 --> 01:25:14.970
<v Speaker 2>there's an easy way to fact check this </v>
<v Speaker 2>report.</v>

1949
01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Did you leave like who's the last person</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw?</v>

1950
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:23.070
<v Speaker 2>I guess they're having some issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that think it's </v>

1951
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:26.341
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They claimed daily distress calls were </v>

1952
01:25:26.341 --> 01:25:27.550
<v Speaker 2>unanswered and at one point tiger sharks</v>
<v Speaker 2>bumped against the boat.</v>

1953
01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Might be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1954
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.100
<v Speaker 2>you can fact check those distress calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if tiger sharks live in that area.</v>

1955
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.170
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1956
01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:36.320
<v Speaker 2>That's around Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where they were.</v>

1957
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:41.890
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the real problems with Hawaii is </v>

1958
01:25:41.890 --> 01:25:44.641
<v Speaker 2>tiger sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tiger sharks are one of the most </v>

1959
01:25:44.641 --> 01:25:45.610
<v Speaker 2>aggressive of sharks and they get people</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1960
01:25:45.611 --> 01:25:50.611
<v Speaker 2>I think second only to bull sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say indicating that they </v>

1961
01:25:50.611 --> 01:25:54.511
<v Speaker 2>had like an emergency beacon that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have activated it would have </v>

1962
01:25:54.511 --> 01:25:56.260
<v Speaker 2>alerted this coast guard would have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>found really fast,</v>

1963
01:25:56.290 --> 01:25:58.210
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they for some reason didn't,</v>

1964
01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:03.830
<v Speaker 2>didn't know about it necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no storms recorded on </v>

1965
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 2>satellite images that have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess supposedly</v>

1966
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:07.670
<v Speaker 3>also what they said caused their </v>
<v Speaker 3>disappearance.</v>

1967
01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:11.360
<v Speaker 3>Eliza looks to stick up for girls though</v>
<v Speaker 3>and host that.</v>

1968
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:13.070
<v Speaker 3>I have not read this story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just looking at,</v>

1969
01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.650
<v Speaker 3>you know what I was honestly thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1970
01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:20.680
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course the two lesbians have like a </v>

1971
01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.880
<v Speaker 3>giant dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming one of them is like 46.</v>

1972
01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:25.640
<v Speaker 3>One of them is 25,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think they're probably lesbians who</v>

1973
01:26:25.641 --> 01:26:27.020
<v Speaker 3>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like that's such a lesbian,</v>

1974
01:26:27.021 --> 01:26:28.940
<v Speaker 3>like he's a pit mix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we love him.</v>

1975
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:32.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because like the big disparity in age,</v>

1976
01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:37.360
<v Speaker 3>that's like the difference between like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy with a yacht and it's hot </v>

1977
01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:37.360
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

1978
01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's her instructor.</v>

1979
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:40.760
<v Speaker 3>You know what I love most about lesbian </v>
<v Speaker 3>couples?</v>

1980
01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:43.550
<v Speaker 3>There's almost always like a male and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>female.</v>

1981
01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>

1982
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>

1983
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:49.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the time my best friend and her</v>

1984
01:26:49.521 --> 01:26:54.521
<v Speaker 3>wife said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously they're married and so your </v>

1985
01:26:54.521 --> 01:26:54.521
<v Speaker 3>best friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lesbian,</v>

1986
01:26:54.521 --> 01:26:54.521
<v Speaker 3>lesbian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were so diverse,</v>

1987
01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:58.240
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've noticed everything.</v>

1988
01:26:58.290 --> 01:27:02.000
<v Speaker 3>We are three and so she is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a lesbian when she was three.</v>

1989
01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.540
<v Speaker 3>She gave us like the quarterback in high</v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

1990
01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:08.030
<v Speaker 3>That's probably ruined her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she kind of just figured it out.</v>

1991
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was a psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1992
01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:12.500
<v Speaker 3>so they're married and they want to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a baby.</v>

1993
01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:14.030
<v Speaker 3>And Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1994
01:27:14.031 --> 01:27:15.060
<v Speaker 3>Michelle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1995
01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.390
<v Speaker 3>you keep her name up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're both Jewish,</v>

1996
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 3>white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's half my body weight.</v>

1997
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:22.790
<v Speaker 3>She's the tiniest and kind of sickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has like plantar fasciitis.</v>

1998
01:27:22.791 --> 01:27:23.990
<v Speaker 3>She's got her own issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1999
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:27.920
<v Speaker 3>So she wants to carry the baby and her </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife is American,</v>

2000
01:27:27.921 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 3>but Dominican and like strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2001
01:27:30.891 --> 01:27:32.060
<v Speaker 3>but I want to carry the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2002
01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:32.220
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2003
01:27:32.221 --> 01:27:32.570
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2004
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:36.440
<v Speaker 3>Our people have like Tay Sachs and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2005
01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:38.590
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2006
01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:41.990
<v Speaker 3>like just diseases like pass the sec.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a Jewish thing.</v>

2007
01:27:41.991 --> 01:27:45.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like a genetic mutation that only </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish babies get.</v>

2008
01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:47.060
<v Speaker 3>But the point is Jews have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2009
01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:52.061
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her people are given birth left and </v>

2010
01:27:52.061 --> 01:27:52.061
<v Speaker 3>right and going back to work the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2011
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:55.040
<v Speaker 3>They don't carry the baby and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to encourage her.</v>

2012
01:27:55.041 --> 01:27:56.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let let the other one do it.</v>

2013
01:27:56.890 --> 01:27:57.350
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2014
01:27:57.351 --> 01:28:02.351
<v Speaker 3>I just want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go through it because she's </v>

2015
01:28:02.351 --> 01:28:02.351
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess if you had to pick one who's the</v>

2016
01:28:02.351 --> 01:28:03.710
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Michelle wants to do and I'm like,</v>

2017
01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:08.711
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get snapped and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to fit yourself and you're </v>

2018
01:28:08.711 --> 01:28:09.770
<v Speaker 3>going to just be a puddle of Jewish skin</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bones.</v>

2019
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:12.410
<v Speaker 3>Let the other one do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to have babies?</v>

2020
01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:16.190
<v Speaker 3>I thinking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm getting married in May and then I</v>

2021
01:28:16.191 --> 01:28:18.260
<v Speaker 3>was talking to your boyfriend's a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice guy,</v>

2022
01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:19.780
<v Speaker 3>fiance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves you.</v>

2023
01:28:19.781 --> 01:28:20.750
<v Speaker 3>He loves coming to the store.</v>

2024
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:22.370
<v Speaker 3>He's a good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a good guy.</v>

2025
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:23.690
<v Speaker 3>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I was like,</v>

2026
01:28:23.691 --> 01:28:24.710
<v Speaker 3>we'll get married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll go on a honeymoon.</v>

2027
01:28:24.711 --> 01:28:26.930
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess we have those happy when you got</v>

2028
01:28:26.931 --> 01:28:29.240
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like finally one good one.</v>

2029
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:31.400
<v Speaker 3>This one's going to stick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get rid of him,</v>

2030
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:34.510
<v Speaker 3>the Yale story in that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>

2031
01:28:34.511 --> 01:28:36.740
<v Speaker 3>That was so it was like three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was quite awhile ago.</v>

2032
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:39.080
<v Speaker 3>That was a great story though when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought him around.</v>

2033
01:28:39.081 --> 01:28:39.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2034
01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:40.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be too friendly with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2035
01:28:40.971 --> 01:28:43.130
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like war.</v>

2036
01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new guy might get shot,</v>

2037
01:28:45.710 --> 01:28:47.480
<v Speaker 3>but then after a couple months it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2038
01:28:47.481 --> 01:28:48.530
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still here.</v>

2039
01:28:48.531 --> 01:28:53.531
<v Speaker 3>What's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we became more and more </v>

2040
01:28:53.531 --> 01:28:53.531
<v Speaker 3>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2041
01:28:53.531 --> 01:28:54.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be cool to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She might get rid of them.</v>

2042
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Every time I see him a hug him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loves you.</v>

2043
01:28:56.751 --> 01:28:58.690
<v Speaker 3>He loves seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Loves watching all the company.</v>

2044
01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:00.860
<v Speaker 3>He's a fan of comedy anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not in a weird way,</v>

2045
01:29:00.861 --> 01:29:05.861
<v Speaker 3>but like he listened to your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's cool for him and he's super</v>

2046
01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:06.870
<v Speaker 3>supportive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

2047
01:29:06.871 --> 01:29:11.220
<v Speaker 3>I guess we just have a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I guess you do that viable.</v>

2048
01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many more years.</v>

2049
01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 3>Got kind of a quick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2050
01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:16.200
<v Speaker 3>checking my stat card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you get an.</v>

2051
01:29:16.450 --> 01:29:17.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only have one.</v>

2052
01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:18.620
<v Speaker 3>Your eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cook them.</v>

2053
01:29:18.710 --> 01:29:21.210
<v Speaker 3>I have one big egg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One giant one like an ostrich.</v>

2054
01:29:21.211 --> 01:29:24.810
<v Speaker 3>I keep it in the back of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little gladiator baby.</v>

2055
01:29:24.811 --> 01:29:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Like some strong man baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always wanted that.</v>

2056
01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you'll have a boy or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl?</v>

2057
01:29:29.150 --> 01:29:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I say this?</v>

2058
01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:35.060
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't know his job when I was 18 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and which is tiny.</v>

2059
01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:40.190
<v Speaker 3>That's why your nose is so tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you knows you still look like a </v>

2060
01:29:40.190 --> 01:29:44.070
<v Speaker 3>little bit of a bump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was their worst things didn't shrink </v>

2061
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.070
<v Speaker 3>your nostril holes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2062
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I always had small nostril hold down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just got rid of the bump.</v>

2063
01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:48.650
<v Speaker 3>The bump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2064
01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I talk about in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a huge revelation.</v>

2065
01:29:51.150 --> 01:29:52.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we do this,</v>

2066
01:29:52.291 --> 01:29:57.291
<v Speaker 3>but he's half Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half Jewish and he's got a big nose and </v>

2067
01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:57.900
<v Speaker 3>I remember looking at it the other day </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

2068
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:02.930
<v Speaker 3>our kid had better be fucking brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 3>or amazing at sports because if a girl </v>

2069
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:06.540
<v Speaker 3>has a combination of our noses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's over for her.</v>

2070
01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:11.100
<v Speaker 3>So fingers crossed that she gets someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>else's knows,</v>

2071
01:30:11.101 --> 01:30:13.020
<v Speaker 3>maybe by the time you guys decided to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have babies,</v>

2072
01:30:13.021 --> 01:30:18.021
<v Speaker 3>crispr will be totally dialed in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a nice little Christie Brinkley </v>

2073
01:30:18.021 --> 01:30:18.160
<v Speaker 3>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2074
01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:19.140
<v Speaker 3>maybe we'll have.</v>

2075
01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:21.300
<v Speaker 3>It'll be an APP at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if it's a dude,</v>

2076
01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:23.490
<v Speaker 3>a big nose just gives you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

2077
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:27.180
<v Speaker 3>Big Nose for dude is fine and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>praying because he's very tall.</v>

2078
01:30:27.181 --> 01:30:29.460
<v Speaker 3>If it's a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe she's just a brilliant athlete and</v>

2079
01:30:29.461 --> 01:30:30.390
<v Speaker 3>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

2080
01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's probably not gonna happen.</v>

2081
01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:34.950
<v Speaker 3>Probably just be kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who knows,</v>

2082
01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:40.580
<v Speaker 3>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the interesting thing about </v>

2083
01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:40.580
<v Speaker 3>having children that I've found is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they come out of the box,</v>

2084
01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:42.750
<v Speaker 3>their own little mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own little personality.</v>

2085
01:30:42.751 --> 01:30:45.180
<v Speaker 3>You just kind of nurture that </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality along the way.</v>

2086
01:30:45.181 --> 01:30:50.181
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my two youngest daughters could not be </v>

2087
01:30:50.181 --> 01:30:50.790
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so similar to each other.</v>

2088
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.250
<v Speaker 3>They're there so dissimilar rather to </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

2089
01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens.</v>

2090
01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:57.930
<v Speaker 3>My brother and I are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where he's from,</v>

2091
01:30:57.931 --> 01:31:00.630
<v Speaker 3>the planet Zap Guitar and we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2092
01:31:01.230 --> 01:31:04.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the way it would just be.</v>

2093
01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:10.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird combination of like we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about nurture and nature and do </v>

2094
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:15.131
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see the thing is about a woman </v>

2095
01:31:15.131 --> 01:31:16.230
<v Speaker 3>having a baby go on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that you,</v>

2096
01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:21.290
<v Speaker 3>especially as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be much more difficult for you </v>

2097
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:23.050
<v Speaker 3>to do the road?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2098
01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.960
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything about it.</v>

2099
01:31:24.961 --> 01:31:26.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2100
01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:31.040
<v Speaker 3>I know that I work out a lot and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously the more mobile and healthy </v>

2101
01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:31.040
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easier,</v>

2102
01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:35.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of months where you </v>

2103
01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:36.351
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also a couple of months of </v>

2104
01:31:36.351 --> 01:31:36.351
<v Speaker 3>the year where I don't do the road </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

2105
01:31:36.351 --> 01:31:38.760
<v Speaker 3>Like I think I could tailor the schedule</v>
<v Speaker 3>around it and we certainly could because</v>

2106
01:31:38.761 --> 01:31:43.761
<v Speaker 3>you're successful because you make </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough money to hire help and hire </v>

2107
01:31:43.761 --> 01:31:45.060
<v Speaker 3>people to help you when you travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2108
01:31:45.061 --> 01:31:46.650
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2109
01:31:46.651 --> 01:31:48.990
<v Speaker 3>But your whole life changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about that a lot.</v>

2110
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2111
01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:51.570
<v Speaker 3>it's at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 10:00.</v>

2112
01:31:51.571 --> 01:31:52.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go grab dinner.</v>

2113
01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

2114
01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.800
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's like the next step,</v>

2115
01:31:58.801 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 3>but you just adjust.</v>

2116
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Your life becomes so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes very strange,</v>

2117
01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:08.510
<v Speaker 2>like hanging out with your own kids is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2118
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
<v Speaker 2>it's very odd because the love that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel for them is so intense and so </v>

2119
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:14.270
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:17.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like this warm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cuddly love,</v>

2121
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like while you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2122
01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:20.830
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2123
01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:23.230
<v Speaker 2>you're cuddling with your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2124
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:25.540
<v Speaker 2>talking with them and while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking with them,</v>

2125
01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 2>for me at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2126
01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:32.100
<v Speaker 2>I can't even believe you're real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even believe this is a </v>

2127
01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:33.730
<v Speaker 2>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a daughter for forever.</v>

2128
01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're talking and she's like,</v>

2129
01:32:35.591 --> 01:32:36.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about that?</v>

2130
01:32:36.471 --> 01:32:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2131
01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:38.760
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're having a little calmer.</v>

2132
01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.780
<v Speaker 1>You're worried that they're thinking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2133
01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.310
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were just a puddle of mush.</v>

2134
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:44.740
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm open to.</v>

2135
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I think a big problem in our society is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we expect women,</v>

2136
01:32:47.861 --> 01:32:50.170
<v Speaker 1>like you've got to have this career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this body,</v>

2137
01:32:50.171 --> 01:32:52.210
<v Speaker 1>have this family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why do we do that?</v>

2138
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:54.040
<v Speaker 1>We do that because it's always been that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2139
01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Who is we in this group?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2140
01:32:56.740 --> 01:33:01.740
<v Speaker 1>But how many people do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people do expect you to have </v>

2141
01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.050
<v Speaker 1>all these things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a projection,</v>

2142
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:05.230
<v Speaker 1>but obviously when you get down to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody cares what you actually do.</v>

2143
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:10.470
<v Speaker 1>But it's what's put out there as what </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like happiness and I even talk </v>

2144
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:14.461
<v Speaker 1>about this because I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to pretend like what I'm </v>

2145
01:33:14.461 --> 01:33:14.461
<v Speaker 1>saying is something I'm thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

2146
01:33:14.461 --> 01:33:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about it.</v>

2147
01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:20.400
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do have to do this digging to be </v>

2148
01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.381
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does my happiness actually look </v>

2149
01:33:22.381 --> 01:33:24.881
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might not be the cookie cutter </v>

2150
01:33:24.881 --> 01:33:26.020
<v Speaker 1>image that is kind of put on all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a very weird job,</v>

2151
01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:29.500
<v Speaker 1>but if I couldn't do this job I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be the saddest person.</v>

2152
01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Like standup comedy gives me the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>joy and uh,</v>

2153
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:39.510
<v Speaker 1>that is a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a relationship with that and I </v>

2154
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.510
<v Speaker 1>have to factor everything sort of around</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2155
01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until I have a kid.</v>

2156
01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:43.980
<v Speaker 1>And then who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have one.</v>

2157
01:33:44.530 --> 01:33:45.470
<v Speaker 2>It does change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2158
01:33:45.471 --> 01:33:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say Louis C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>k game.</v>

2159
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.530
<v Speaker 2>He created place once came to having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>

2160
01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.300
<v Speaker 2>which is very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he said.</v>

2161
01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Let it change you and I don't know Louis</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

2162
01:33:55.391 --> 01:33:57.600
<v Speaker 2>I should say this too because people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

2163
01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.070
<v Speaker 2>somebody was giving me a hard time about</v>
<v Speaker 2>not commenting on it.</v>

2164
01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:00.670
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

2165
01:34:00.730 --> 01:34:05.730
<v Speaker 2>my thought was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all I want to gather my </v>

2166
01:34:05.730 --> 01:34:05.730
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2167
01:34:05.730 --> 01:34:07.450
<v Speaker 2>And second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him that well.</v>

2168
01:34:07.451 --> 01:34:12.451
<v Speaker 2>I don't even have his phone number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a phone call </v>

2169
01:34:12.451 --> 01:34:13.900
<v Speaker 2>conversations with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet we've exchanged emails maybe three</v>

2170
01:34:13.901 --> 01:34:18.310
<v Speaker 2>times ever and he and I have run into </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other at clubs and said hi,</v>

2171
01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:20.800
<v Speaker 2>we've never gone out and hung out </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2172
01:34:21.130 --> 01:34:24.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good friends with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when all this was going down,</v>

2173
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:29.790
<v Speaker 2>it's not like I had information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if Joey Diaz did something fucked </v>

2174
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:30.880
<v Speaker 2>up and people wanted me to comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2175
01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I would never say anything bad no matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>what joy diaz did.</v>

2176
01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just the way it is.</v>

2177
01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:39.100
<v Speaker 2>If there's just no way around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2178
01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:40.920
<v Speaker 1>If you knew he raped someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is horrible.</v>

2179
01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so sorry that he did that,</v>

2180
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:46.140
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2181
01:34:46.141 --> 01:34:47.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never,</v>

2182
01:34:49.770 --> 01:34:50.970
<v Speaker 2>I would never throw them under the bus,</v>

2183
01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:56.220
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's bus throwing and then there's </v>

2184
01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.561
<v Speaker 1>bus throwing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a comment after sort of </v>

2185
01:34:58.561 --> 01:35:01.530
<v Speaker 1>condemning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>condemning it and then there was of </v>

2186
01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:02.030
<v Speaker 1>course like there was a guy who was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie baby driver,</v>

2187
01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:03.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he asked us,</v>

2188
01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:08.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like at the 48th lead or </v>

2189
01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:11.561
<v Speaker 1>something and he went on some show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just went off about Kevin and so </v>

2190
01:35:11.561 --> 01:35:12.880
<v Speaker 1>everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

2191
01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.020
<v Speaker 1>it looked like a way to get attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

2192
01:35:15.021 --> 01:35:18.860
<v Speaker 1>when I was on set he didn't seem that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool and it was so much in retrospect,</v>

2193
01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:21.200
<v Speaker 1>but he's not the guy that's on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking dead,</v>

2194
01:35:21.201 --> 01:35:22.490
<v Speaker 1>the punisher guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2195
01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:23.870
<v Speaker 1>isn't that him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just saw that.</v>

2196
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's that guy who's pretty </v>

2197
01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:29.290
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2198
01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:31.670
<v Speaker 1>he's the new punisher in that Netflix </v>
<v Speaker 1>just seemed very like bandwagon jumping.</v>

2199
01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:36.700
<v Speaker 1>When the Louis C K thing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can speak from a perspective of a </v>

2200
01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:36.700
<v Speaker 1>woman who's seen this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2201
01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I brought him up twice at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my knowledge of him.</v>

2202
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:42.980
<v Speaker 1>But you get these emails from like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York Times or like,</v>

2203
01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have anything you want to say or </v>

2204
01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:48.040
<v Speaker 1>if you know any other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2205
01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't and I don't want to attach </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

2206
01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be part of that story </v>

2207
01:35:53.710 --> 01:35:54.290
<v Speaker 1>just for the sake of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then you look like a fame whore.</v>

2208
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Well that's also the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you get caught up in something </v>

2209
01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:03.140
<v Speaker 2>where you become inexorably connected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this awful event and you didn't do </v>

2210
01:36:03.961 --> 01:36:04.290
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2211
01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2212
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:08.660
<v Speaker 1>So Joey didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>

2213
01:36:09.150 --> 01:36:10.090
<v Speaker 1>not joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey,</v>

2214
01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:13.580
<v Speaker 1>but oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy as joey is,</v>

2215
01:36:13.581 --> 01:36:16.340
<v Speaker 1>he's a very gentle person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a giant.</v>

2216
01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.890
<v Speaker 1>He's Puerto Rican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Cuban.</v>

2217
01:36:18.891 --> 01:36:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant Cuban teddy bear.</v>

2218
01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.990
<v Speaker 1>He is because he seems so tough and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>loves St Cox Soccer,</v>

2219
01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.270
<v Speaker 1>but he is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

2220
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:29.270
<v Speaker 1>he's just so kind and he's got these </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes like a whale,</v>

2221
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:32.570
<v Speaker 1>like they're just ancient and big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the camel eyelashes.</v>

2222
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:36.800
<v Speaker 1>He's got these lovely I and you and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>smiles at you like a toddler.</v>

2223
01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the best.</v>

2224
01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:43.350
<v Speaker 2>I exchanged emails with him maybe once </v>
<v Speaker 2>every three or four years.</v>

2225
01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:48.560
<v Speaker 2>We've texted each other maybe 10 times </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever for all only phone calls.</v>

2226
01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:52.680

<v Speaker 2>Is He wants to talk to you.</v>

2229
01:36:56.220 --> 01:37:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Joey wants to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I ever ever text him is because I </v>

2230
01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:01.230
<v Speaker 2>have to send an address to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>navigation system.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Louis,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2240
01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:19.380
<v Speaker 2>I held somebody at gunpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck fucking kidnapping.</v>

2242
01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:23.130

<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2243
01:37:23.131 --> 01:37:23.760
<v Speaker 2>you were crazy.</v>

2244
01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.730
<v Speaker 1>But it goes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind of thing.</v>

2245
01:37:28.450 --> 01:37:32.200
<v Speaker 2>This is the kind of thing that sticks </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he did it to one of us.</v>

2246
01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you in our world like we are all</v>

2247
01:37:37.570 --> 01:37:39.730
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all the same thing.</v>

2248
01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's gonna be some weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>pettiness and bullshit and there's gonna</v>

2249
01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:46.720
<v Speaker 2>be some prejudices and it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>some individuals that are supportive,</v>

2250
01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:52.020
<v Speaker 2>but overall amongst the good eggs </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst the ones that you and I </v>

2251
01:37:52.150 --> 01:37:53.860
<v Speaker 2>associate with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are all.</v>

2252
01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:55.770
<v Speaker 2>We all consider each other same thing.</v>

2253
01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>

2254
01:37:57.150 --> 01:38:00.490
<v Speaker 1>we understand each other's hearts and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how hard it is and what it's like.</v>

2255
01:38:00.491 --> 01:38:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And we all know that it's us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the audiences are friends,</v>

2256
01:38:03.431 --> 01:38:05.560
<v Speaker 1>it's US versus them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the club versus you know,</v>

2257
01:38:05.561 --> 01:38:10.240
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do a job and we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what this very weird job entails</v>

2258
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 1>and we know the way the other person </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks like we have fucked up thoughts </v>

2259
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:18.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's okay to admit these thoughts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and it's a very special bond </v>

2260
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:19.840
<v Speaker 1>and you can't just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comic.</v>

2261
01:38:19.841 --> 01:38:24.841
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to kind of earn it and </v>

2262
01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:27.271
<v Speaker 1>there's a respect there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's what he did as deplorable </v>

2263
01:38:27.271 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 1>and it was with other comics and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad because I feel bad because everybody</v>

2264
01:38:32.381 --> 01:38:33.790
<v Speaker 1>gets so angry at women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2265
01:38:33.791 --> 01:38:34.750
<v Speaker 1>why now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2266
01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:37.810
<v Speaker 1>because there's safety in numbers and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one would listen before.</v>

2267
01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:39.850
<v Speaker 1>But people knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew.</v>

2268
01:38:40.230 --> 01:38:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Some people knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew to a degree.</v>

2269
01:38:41.921 --> 01:38:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Like I knew I knew the girls names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know if it was true.</v>

2270
01:38:45.341 --> 01:38:50.341
<v Speaker 1>It was a rumor you don't know and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be the one that's running </v>

2271
01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:52.810
<v Speaker 1>out there like with a lit torch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

2272
01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:58.010
<v Speaker 2>It's going to sound fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to take a chance with it </v>

2273
01:38:58.010 --> 01:38:58.010
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Ready?</v>

2274
01:38:58.010 --> 01:39:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Have you put yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I put myself in Harvey Weinstein's </v>

2275
01:39:03.451 --> 01:39:04.680
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Really,</v>

2276
01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:07.080
<v Speaker 2>but I sat down and I tried to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2277
01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.840
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2278
01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:12.200
<v Speaker 2>what would this guy like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would his brain work?</v>

2279
01:39:12.201 --> 01:39:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Because he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like lost in the throes of the addiction</v>

2280
01:39:16.591 --> 01:39:21.591
<v Speaker 2>of power and sex in this chase of </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting all these superstars to suck his</v>

2281
01:39:21.811 --> 01:39:26.811
<v Speaker 2>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is apparently what a lot of them </v>

2282
01:39:26.811 --> 01:39:28.521
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've talked to women that know </v>

2283
01:39:28.521 --> 01:39:29.220
<v Speaker 2>people in the business and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiating tactic,</v>

2284
01:39:29.221 --> 01:39:31.760
<v Speaker 2>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would give them roles if they did and</v>

2285
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:34.940
<v Speaker 2>he always followed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He always honored his word was wondering</v>

2286
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:35.610
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2287
01:39:35.611 --> 01:39:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering like how do you ensure </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone gives you the part?</v>

2288
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had a reputation for doing it,</v>

2289
01:39:40.531 --> 01:39:41.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2290
01:39:41.001 --> 01:39:43.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the contract thing that he had you,</v>

2291
01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.470
<v Speaker 2>his contract with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Miramax,</v>

2292
01:39:47.490 --> 01:39:48.450
<v Speaker 2>with the Weinstein group.</v>

2293
01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a sexual harassment.</v>

2294
01:39:50.221 --> 01:39:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Like a clause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2295
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:52.220
<v Speaker 1>covering up too.</v>

2296
01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:57.340
<v Speaker 2>But they had it like in tears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one would be worth two fifths </v>

2297
01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:59.720
<v Speaker 2>because they knew it was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew.</v>

2298
01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's not complicit then what is.</v>

2299
01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:08.500
<v Speaker 2>But have you done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you tried to put yourself in the </v>

2300
01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Louis Ck is brain?</v>

2301
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no because I definitely have had</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thought.</v>

2302
01:40:13.890 --> 01:40:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I think when you get to a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see there's,</v>

2303
01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:20.310
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't at that level then this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing.</v>

2304
01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:22.410
<v Speaker 1>We did a poll and it was a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2305
01:40:22.650 --> 01:40:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Let me find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget the level I've found with a lot </v>

2306
01:40:27.650 --> 01:40:30.831
<v Speaker 1>of male comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a certain like a lot of </v>

2307
01:40:30.831 --> 01:40:30.831
<v Speaker 1>perverts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2308
01:40:30.831 --> 01:40:33.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain set of blinders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I can do whatever I want.</v>

2309
01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:35.760
<v Speaker 1>There's almost like a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accountability.</v>

2310
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.850
<v Speaker 1>You show up drunk or high or fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

2311
01:40:38.851 --> 01:40:39.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so creative.</v>

2312
01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:44.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a certain allowance we give to men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people when they get famous,</v>

2313
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:45.800
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2314
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I pride myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always on time.</v>

2315
01:40:47.851 --> 01:40:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't show up anywhere drunk like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just take it a little bit more seriously</v>

2316
01:40:50.401 --> 01:40:54.400
<v Speaker 1>because I know I have to work a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit harder whether being a girl helps or</v>

2317
01:40:54.401 --> 01:40:55.420
<v Speaker 1>not at times.</v>

2318
01:40:55.420 --> 01:41:00.420
<v Speaker 1>It just depends on the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that there's a lack of </v>

2319
01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:04.741
<v Speaker 1>awareness about other people and I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>think at a certain level there is a </v>

2320
01:41:04.741 --> 01:41:08.521
<v Speaker 1>mindset of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've seen this in lower tiered </v>

2321
01:41:08.521 --> 01:41:11.641
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't matter what I say to you </v>

2322
01:41:11.641 --> 01:41:13.510
<v Speaker 1>when I call you a bitch or a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit or I harass you,</v>

2323
01:41:13.810 --> 01:41:16.360
<v Speaker 1>you don't matter because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna make it.</v>

2324
01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:18.610
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't matter.</v>

2325
01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.130
<v Speaker 1>And I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this.</v>

2326
01:41:21.131 --> 01:41:26.131
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go into names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard things that other women will </v>

2327
01:41:26.131 --> 01:41:28.330
<v Speaker 1>confide in me that men say to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember starting at the store,</v>

2328
01:41:28.630 --> 01:41:32.350
<v Speaker 1>things that were said to me by men who </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably don't remember.</v>

2329
01:41:32.351 --> 01:41:34.660
<v Speaker 1>They said it cause there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cavalier.</v>

2330
01:41:34.661 --> 01:41:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Just I'll just say fucking whatever I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

2331
01:41:37.061 --> 01:41:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I want her to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

2332
01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:39.430
<v Speaker 1>You're a bitch.</v>

2333
01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.170
<v Speaker 1>You're body's discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't matter.</v>

2334
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Your body is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

2335
01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:44.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2336
01:41:44.861 --> 01:41:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Like I hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want her to hurt.</v>

2337
01:41:47.170 --> 01:41:52.170
<v Speaker 1>There's a comic at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the guys are friends with all of </v>

2338
01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:52.170
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

2339
01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's not there a ton anymore.</v>

2340
01:41:56.501 --> 01:42:01.501
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was definitely like a fixture there </v>

2341
01:42:01.501 --> 01:42:01.501
<v Speaker 1>in the early years when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2342
01:42:01.501 --> 01:42:03.130
<v Speaker 1>we were at another comic's house for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

2343
01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I was standing there and he walked up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2344
01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:10.620
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't said a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said something rude to a girlfriend </v>

2345
01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:12.601
<v Speaker 1>of mine because he was hitting on her </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that didn't go well and he just </v>

2346
01:42:12.601 --> 01:42:12.640
<v Speaker 1>looked at me and he went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better keep working out because your</v>

2347
01:42:12.641 --> 01:42:13.990
<v Speaker 1>body's not going to be like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

2348
01:42:14.730 --> 01:42:15.760
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>

2349
01:42:16.810 --> 01:42:21.810
<v Speaker 1>And the only other thing he ever said to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me was like 10 years later he yelled at </v>

2350
01:42:21.810 --> 01:42:21.940
<v Speaker 1>me because I brought my dog to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

2351
01:42:22.810 --> 01:42:24.720
<v Speaker 1>but it was body does look like though </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

2352
01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:27.940
<v Speaker 1>but also like stupid things stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so.</v>

2353
01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:31.570
<v Speaker 1>It's meant to for me to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did you say that we should go fuck,</v>

2354
01:42:31.571 --> 01:42:34.030
<v Speaker 1>that will help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it did not have.</v>

2355
01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must work on the most deprived girls </v>

2356
01:42:39.090 --> 01:42:40.150
<v Speaker 1>and he just picked the wrong one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it of course,</v>

2357
01:42:40.210 --> 01:42:45.210
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that work on the girls with the </v>

2358
01:42:45.210 --> 01:42:46.120
<v Speaker 1>lowest self esteem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that ever work?</v>

2359
01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.980
<v Speaker 1>It must.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must.</v>

2360
01:42:47.981 --> 01:42:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Or they might think it works or are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging?</v>

2361
01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Then it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2362
01:42:50.981 --> 01:42:52.480
<v Speaker 1>he's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2363
01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:53.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2364
01:42:53.681 --> 01:42:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you should smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2365
01:42:54.610 --> 01:42:56.290
<v Speaker 1>it never works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been nice.</v>

2366
01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:59.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to talk.</v>

2367
01:42:59.081 --> 01:43:00.570
<v Speaker 1>So you start with that and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls like,</v>

2368
01:43:00.571 --> 01:43:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I was smiling and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh cool.</v>

2369
01:43:02.610 --> 01:43:05.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like an opening for </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's not as articulate,</v>

2370
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:07.250
<v Speaker 1>awkward opening from.</v>

2371
01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say the state,</v>

2372
01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:11.140
<v Speaker 1>so we'll just say it was California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>

2373
01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:13.060
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was headlining a club.</v>

2374
01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as years and years and years ago,</v>

2375
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.000
<v Speaker 1>because the club is not that great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a guy who was opening for </v>

2376
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.231
<v Speaker 1>me and it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My power dynamic is different because </v>

2377
01:43:25.231 --> 01:43:28.651
<v Speaker 1>I'm the headliner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never told a guy he has to like </v>

2378
01:43:28.651 --> 01:43:28.660
<v Speaker 1>sleep with me to get a gig or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2379
01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my,</v>

2380
01:43:31.150 --> 01:43:33.220
<v Speaker 1>just like licking my purse and left and </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2381
01:43:33.490 --> 01:43:35.000
<v Speaker 1>My box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay.</v>

2382
01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I did it once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2383
01:43:35.651 --> 01:43:40.270
<v Speaker 1>So he was the opener and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2384

<v Speaker 1>can I show you around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which as the opener behooves you like to</v>

2385
01:43:43.871 --> 01:43:45.880
<v Speaker 1>be nice to the headliner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I like you,</v>

2386
01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I have plenty of friends that I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>take with me because they were cool.</v>

2387
01:43:48.970 --> 01:43:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we like hung out.</v>

2388

<v Speaker 1>we just say,</v>

2389
01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:56.780

<v Speaker 1>And then on that Saturday night I had a </v>

2390
01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:58.370
<v Speaker 1>friend in town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a guy and I left with them.</v>

2391
01:43:58.371 --> 01:44:03.371
<v Speaker 1>We all went to a bar and I left with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that I was friends with and this </v>

2392
01:44:03.371 --> 01:44:05.960
<v Speaker 1>comic lost his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started sending me texts,</v>

2393
01:44:05.961 --> 01:44:06.830
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you,</v>

2394
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I spent all this time with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know who I am?</v>

2395
01:44:09.441 --> 01:44:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Like just losing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2396
01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:13.100
<v Speaker 1>and I left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out of the city,</v>

2397
01:44:13.101 --> 01:44:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I was going somewhere else and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>harassing me and I contacted a friend of</v>

2398
01:44:17.481 --> 01:44:20.030
<v Speaker 1>ours was a mutual friend and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better check your boy.</v>

2399
01:44:20.031 --> 01:44:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is his problem?</v>

2400
01:44:21.051 --> 01:44:21.560
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2401
01:44:21.561 --> 01:44:22.880
<v Speaker 1>he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's my friend,</v>

2402
01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:27.881
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did nothing to defend me and this guy's </v>

2403
01:44:27.881 --> 01:44:28.370
<v Speaker 1>just like spewing this vitriolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage.</v>

2404
01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Actually I think sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could be right.</v>

2405
01:44:31.581 --> 01:44:36.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other day I was at the Improv </v>

2406
01:44:36.581 --> 01:44:40.330
<v Speaker 1>and this piece of shit was the host and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like closing the show out and I </v>

2407
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:45.701
<v Speaker 1>hadn't seen him in years and I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to give him the satisfaction or </v>

2408
01:44:45.701 --> 01:44:48.851
<v Speaker 1>anything and I go on and he bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died a thousand deaths and I was just</v>

2409
01:44:48.921 --> 01:44:53.921
<v Speaker 1>sitting there watching and I know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew that I was there and he knew </v>

2410
01:44:53.921 --> 01:44:53.921
<v Speaker 1>what he had done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they felt like shit.</v>

2411
01:44:53.921 --> 01:44:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he was onstage.</v>

2412
01:44:55.970 --> 01:45:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell the restaurant that I know </v>

2413
01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:02.500
<v Speaker 1>no matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he left his phone on stage and I </v>

2414
01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:02.500
<v Speaker 1>made him come back up and get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2415
01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:07.001
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was calling himself like he had like </v>

2416
01:45:07.001 --> 01:45:07.040
<v Speaker 1>a cool nickname for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called him back and he had to like,</v>

2417
01:45:07.041 --> 01:45:08.840
<v Speaker 1>come get his phone and then I fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrecked it.</v>

2418
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:12.590
<v Speaker 1>But it was more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought I was nobody you thought you</v>

2419
01:45:12.591 --> 01:45:17.591
<v Speaker 1>could treat me like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why did he think that if he was the </v>

2420
01:45:17.591 --> 01:45:19.961
<v Speaker 1>opening act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he probably thought I didn't </v>

2421
01:45:19.961 --> 01:45:21.380
<v Speaker 1>deserve it or he's a crazy person or </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was in his city,</v>

2422
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:26.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'd never seen behavior like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibited by someone who was opening for</v>

2423
01:45:26.211 --> 01:45:27.480
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was just like</v>

2424
01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.070
<v Speaker 2>male female shit that's like he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>courting you.</v>

2425
01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:34.740
<v Speaker 2>He thought that he got mad that I left </v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone else.</v>

2426
01:45:34.770 --> 01:45:39.770
<v Speaker 2>He thought that you and him were hanging</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and that you liked him and it was </v>

2427
01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:41.280
<v Speaker 2>eventually going to lead to him banging </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chicken.</v>

2428
01:45:41.281 --> 01:45:43.000
<v Speaker 2>One last comic standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to be</v>

2429
01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:44.690
<v Speaker 1>before ever had right after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2430
01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:49.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have been after a and I'm sure </v>

2431
01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:49.700
<v Speaker 1>that if you were heading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was after for sure,</v>

2432
01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:51.600
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure that girls like I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2433
01:45:52.050 --> 01:45:53.180
<v Speaker 1>male friends of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

2434
01:45:53.181 --> 01:45:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I fuck all my openers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like guys do that.</v>

2435
01:45:55.381 --> 01:45:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I've never had the luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a bad practice.</v>

2436
01:45:58.921 --> 01:46:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a super gross practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think a lot of guys do.</v>

2437
01:46:01.561 --> 01:46:03.210
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't seem smart.</v>

2438
01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:06.020
<v Speaker 2>I always tell guys to not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2439
01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I should never say don't fuck other </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians because like Tom Seger and </v>

2440
01:46:11.230 --> 01:46:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Christina [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're great.</v>

2441
01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:14.510
<v Speaker 2>That worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That worked out like Moshe Kasher,</v>

2442
01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Natasha Leggiero that worked out.</v>

2443
01:46:16.230 --> 01:46:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it either works out splendidly </v>
<v Speaker 1>or is a nightmare.</v>

2444
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2445
01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2446
01:46:23.650 --> 01:46:28.650
<v Speaker 2>one thing would be that the person would</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what you do because very few </v>

2447
01:46:28.650 --> 01:46:29.120
<v Speaker 2>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2448
01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:34.200
<v Speaker 2>and I would think as a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be hard when you're the </v>

2449
01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:37.861
<v Speaker 2>funny one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're the funny one and you're </v>

2450
01:46:37.861 --> 01:46:37.861
<v Speaker 2>dating a guy and maybe they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you're see,</v>

2451
01:46:37.861 --> 01:46:40.570
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing is your fiance is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>chill.</v>

2452
01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

2453
01:46:42.250 --> 01:46:44.590
<v Speaker 1>he's so funny too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't need.</v>

2454
01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.390
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't need any attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

2455
01:46:46.450 --> 01:46:48.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is one of,</v>

2456
01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:54.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't really seek it out outside </v>

2457
01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:54.570
<v Speaker 1>of Sannup I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get it all out.</v>

2458
01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it out of your system and I don't </v>

2459
01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.080
<v Speaker 1>want to be greedy about it and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know,</v>

2460
01:47:00.081 --> 01:47:00.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

2461
01:47:00.691 --> 01:47:02.130
<v Speaker 1>You start dating someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you realize,</v>

2462
01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:03.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't handle this other gels,</v>

2463
01:47:03.690 --> 01:47:06.300
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with comics it's interesting.</v>

2464
01:47:06.301 --> 01:47:11.301
<v Speaker 1>You rarely see a super successful female</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic with like a guy that's like </v>

2465
01:47:11.301 --> 01:47:12.600
<v Speaker 1>middling at the chuckle bucket.</v>

2466
01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:14.930
<v Speaker 2>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

2467
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Can you think of one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any of them.</v>

2468
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any like headliners that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck their opening acts that are girls </v>

2469
01:47:23.710 --> 01:47:27.700
<v Speaker 2>now and I mean maybe they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's cool if they do a cool.</v>

2470
01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:30.970
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that fence.</v>

2471
01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them know.</v>

2472
01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Flip the script.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2473
01:47:36.210 --> 01:47:38.990
<v Speaker 2>Like just get back to the business of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

2474
01:47:38.991 --> 01:47:43.991
<v Speaker 2>What was it like headlining after three </v>
<v Speaker 2>years because I did a little bit of </v>

2475
01:47:43.991 --> 01:47:46.160
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had um,</v>

2476
01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.560
<v Speaker 2>I had a manager who was like a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2477
01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:53.680
<v Speaker 2>When I got my manager when I was about </v>
<v Speaker 2>three years in and I headlined a bunch </v>

2478
01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.470
<v Speaker 2>of places where I really did not deserve</v>
<v Speaker 2>what.</v>

2479
01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:58.640
<v Speaker 2>He got me a bunch of gigs and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't have any pressure on me the</v>

2480
01:47:58.641 --> 01:48:03.200
<v Speaker 2>way you did winning last comic standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just sort of just starting out.</v>

2481
01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:07.840
<v Speaker 1>So you go on this tour right after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last comic standing I think,</v>

2482
01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could've been doing that much time </v>

2483
01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:13.160
<v Speaker 1>because there was like four of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just close it out.</v>

2484
01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time you think you're doing?</v>

2487

01:48:35.781 --> 01:48:38.901
<v Speaker 1>boat and like they're good and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine and they do fine as both those </v>

2496
01:48:40.681 --> 01:48:42.930
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of scraped together what you</v>

2497
01:48:42.931 --> 01:48:44.310
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even on the tour,</v>

2498
01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I was always the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the night,</v>

2499
01:48:47.041 --> 01:48:49.670
<v Speaker 1>but people are still there to see you or</v>
<v Speaker 1>their favorite one.</v>

2500
01:48:49.670 --> 01:48:52.830
<v Speaker 1>So you're just coming from this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>

2501
01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:55.260
<v Speaker 1>But also you have confidence but also </v>
<v Speaker 1>humble place of like,</v>

2502
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I hope that I can stretch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enough.</v>

2503
01:48:57.510 --> 01:49:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And so you have about 45 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least I did when you were done,</v>

2504
01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:02.370
<v Speaker 1>when a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're ready to headline.</v>

2505
01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:07.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a lot of the energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I put toward it was like,</v>

2506
01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to talk really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fast that way if you don't laugh,</v>

2507
01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:10.950
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know you didn't like because I</v>

2508
01:49:10.951 --> 01:49:15.360
<v Speaker 1>got another joke right here and that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of become a style for now.</v>

2509
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not about a fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more of I'm so excited to talk.</v>

2510
01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:24.440
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and some other comics did this Ray </v>

2511
01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Romano charity event a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago and Mark Marin was on it with me and</v>

2512
01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:30.300
<v Speaker 1>we went downstairs to watch ray to Kinda</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear what the crowd sounded like.</v>

2513
01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:32.910
<v Speaker 1>And so he was doing well and mark turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

2514
01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:34.770
<v Speaker 1>this is the funniest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

2515
01:49:34.771 --> 01:49:35.790
<v Speaker 1>they're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2516
01:49:35.791 --> 01:49:36.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good.</v>

2517
01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:37.440
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be fine.</v>

2518
01:49:37.441 --> 01:49:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2519
01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:39.360
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do what you always do.</v>

2520
01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Steam roll over the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't wait for applause,</v>

2521
01:49:41.821 --> 01:49:45.930
<v Speaker 1>dear voices and get off stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I almost cried from laughing because</v>

2522
01:49:45.931 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>it was like no one ever breaks my balls </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2523
01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.650
<v Speaker 3>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do that.</v>

2524
01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:53.440
<v Speaker 3>And that's from that competitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

2525
01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:58.680
<v Speaker 3>like that sort of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you have the hard hard ass exterior</v>

2526
01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:03.730
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think a lot of people take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance on breaking your balls,</v>

2527
01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:09.240
<v Speaker 3>which is a shame because I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the best way to show that you love </v>

2528
01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:12.901
<v Speaker 3>someone and it's the best way to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that somebody loves you is if they do </v>

2529
01:50:12.901 --> 01:50:17.821
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell the intention that shield </v>

2530
01:50:17.821 --> 01:50:18.460
<v Speaker 3>also keeps you from getting harassed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>creeps to.</v>

2531
01:50:18.610 --> 01:50:20.890
<v Speaker 3>They don't believe they can get away </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it maybe.</v>

2532
01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.690
<v Speaker 3>And that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so for sure.</v>

2533
01:50:22.691 --> 01:50:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2534
01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:27.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've been harassed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think if you were more vulnerable,</v>

2535
01:50:27.491 --> 01:50:29.770
<v Speaker 3>you've probably been harassed more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2536
01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:35.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you try not to give people a </v>

2537
01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:35.160
<v Speaker 3>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2538
01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:35.160
<v Speaker 3>you're at a meet and greet after you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing your fans.</v>

2539
01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.810
<v Speaker 3>And especially after I was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>with other comics.</v>

2540
01:50:37.811 --> 01:50:39.280
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after for sure.</v>

2541
01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:40.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with other comics,</v>

2542
01:50:40.210 --> 01:50:45.210
<v Speaker 3>I think with other comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you win the show three years in </v>

2543
01:50:45.210 --> 01:50:46.990
<v Speaker 3>and then you're at a certain level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a level.</v>

2544
01:50:46.991 --> 01:50:51.991
<v Speaker 3>All by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a lot of other women I </v>

2545
01:50:51.991 --> 01:50:53.050
<v Speaker 3>related to because no one else was out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that I didn't know any other women</v>

2546
01:50:53.550 --> 01:50:55.950
<v Speaker 3>you're kinda lonely out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2547
01:50:56.290 --> 01:50:59.980
<v Speaker 3>and so I would look up to people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I consider myself a colleague of</v>

2548
01:50:59.981 --> 01:51:02.080
<v Speaker 3>yours now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the time I was just like,</v>

2549
01:51:02.110 --> 01:51:03.040
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I,</v>

2550
01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:05.110
<v Speaker 3>you're so much higher than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2551
01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't know you.</v>

2552
01:51:07.151 --> 01:51:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know any of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just,</v>

2553
01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:15.330
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think any of the comics would </v>

2554
01:51:15.330 --> 01:51:15.330
<v Speaker 3>step to me because they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you not around comics a lot.</v>

2555
01:51:15.330 --> 01:51:18.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember when we met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I knew we knew each other.</v>

2556
01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Like it took time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always at the store,</v>

2557
01:51:20.471 --> 01:51:25.471
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I think it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you were around though in the </v>

2558
01:51:25.471 --> 01:51:30.450
<v Speaker 3>days that I wasn't at the store level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year did you win last comic </v>

2559
01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:30.450
<v Speaker 3>standing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand eight.</v>

2560
01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See I wasn't there then.</v>

2561
01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you weren't there,</v>

2562
01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:34.810
<v Speaker 3>but obviously everyone knew who you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>

2563
01:51:35.530 --> 01:51:40.530
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to Steve Simone about </v>

2564
01:51:40.530 --> 01:51:40.530
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people,</v>

2565
01:51:40.530 --> 01:51:43.381
<v Speaker 3>you know your whole career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you may not start talking to them </v>

2566
01:51:43.381 --> 01:51:44.410
<v Speaker 3>until recently and then it's as if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were always friends.</v>

2567
01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.740
<v Speaker 3>So now I consider myself like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>upperclassman there.</v>

2568
01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really tried to just be kind to the </v>

2569
01:51:53.670 --> 01:51:56.791
<v Speaker 3>other comics door guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>younger comics I've always given and </v>

2570
01:51:56.791 --> 01:52:00.001
<v Speaker 3>you're like this too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives someone the time of day if </v>

2571
01:52:00.001 --> 01:52:00.001
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be respectful and nice.</v>

2572
01:52:00.001 --> 01:52:01.960
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem giving it back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know a lot of those door guys,</v>

<v Speaker 3>They were both door guys.</v>

2575
01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:09.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of people started as door </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you told it to me,</v>

2607
01:53:32.441 --> 01:53:37.441
<v Speaker 1>but it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started going there under the idea </v>

2608
01:53:37.441 --> 01:53:42.121
<v Speaker 1>that I should support the club because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want it to go under and then I </v>

2609
01:53:42.121 --> 01:53:43.620
<v Speaker 1>don't want it to go under it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so sad.</v>

2610
01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Why I found out they record all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sets.</v>

2611
01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say that I get,</v>

2612
01:53:49.150 --> 01:53:50.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the store is.</v>

2613
01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I always say that the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the or in particular is like an abusive </v>

2614
01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:56.410
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like,</v>

2615
01:53:56.411 --> 01:53:57.760
<v Speaker 1>this hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2616
01:53:57.761 --> 01:53:59.410
<v Speaker 1>And then when you don't go for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2617
01:53:59.411 --> 01:54:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I need you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need.</v>

2618
01:54:00.761 --> 01:54:05.761
<v Speaker 1>It's like Stockholm Syndrome training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like doing a set with a giant </v>

2619
01:54:05.761 --> 01:54:06.650
<v Speaker 1>weight vest on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like swinging two bats</v>

2620
01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:09.380
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great if you can,</v>

2621
01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:14.770
<v Speaker 2>if you can compete or hang rather in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that environment you can go anywhere </v>

2622
01:54:15.171 --> 01:54:16.330
<v Speaker 2>else you'd be killing.</v>

2623
01:54:16.410 --> 01:54:17.880
<v Speaker 1>It's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2624
01:54:17.881 --> 01:54:22.881
<v Speaker 1>you get comics that kind of get the vibe</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the store from a couple of years ago </v>

2625
01:54:22.881 --> 01:54:23.820
<v Speaker 1>when it wasn't the friendliest place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has that reputation.</v>

2626
01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:29.240
<v Speaker 1>But I take great solace in knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like my home is an intimidating </v>

2627
01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:33.051
<v Speaker 1>environment and I love whatever space </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've carved out there and I don't take </v>

2628
01:54:33.051 --> 01:54:37.581
<v Speaker 1>it for granted and I try to respect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and respect the audience and you </v>

2629
01:54:37.581 --> 01:54:39.630
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so proud to be a store comic.</v>

2630
01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:41.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not the kindness of lovers all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2631
01:54:42.150 --> 01:54:47.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not always the most supportive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm very proud of that upbringing </v>

2632
01:54:47.150 --> 01:54:49.140
<v Speaker 1>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that storm made me the comic that I am,</v>

2633
01:54:49.141 --> 01:54:50.580
<v Speaker 1>that our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2634
01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:55.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main room where it's all Swedish </v>

2635
01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:57.741
<v Speaker 1>tourist and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does not want me to talk and it just </v>

2636
01:54:57.741 --> 01:54:58.200
<v Speaker 1>makes you so you can go anywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comic shit on it.</v>

2637
01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:00.690
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just sound jealous because you can't</v>

2638
01:55:00.691 --> 01:55:05.691
<v Speaker 1>hang shits on the stove all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that.</v>

2639
01:55:05.821 --> 01:55:09.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just a regular comics you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just they don't like it.</v>

2640
01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:14.700
<v Speaker 1>It's because they don't like bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anybody who makes fun of something </v>

2641
01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:14.700
<v Speaker 1>that you're afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2642
01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Well then there's things to make fun of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just because they saw bombing there </v>

2643
01:55:19.190 --> 01:55:20.580
<v Speaker 1>feels so good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like pushing into a bruise.</v>

2644
01:55:20.581 --> 01:55:21.180
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2645
01:55:21.181 --> 01:55:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I need this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2646
01:55:22.830 --> 01:55:27.830
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you've got a good attitude about </v>

2647
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.830
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still did the Improv.</v>

2648
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing the improv tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2649
01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:29.980
<v Speaker 1>And is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The store's got it.</v>

2650
01:55:29.981 --> 01:55:31.690
<v Speaker 1>So there's something about it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2651
01:55:31.810 --> 01:55:33.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a grittiness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very proud of it.</v>

2652
01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And the Improv's never been anything but</v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely to me.</v>

2653
01:55:35.851 --> 01:55:40.851
<v Speaker 1>It was the first club I got past that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still great club and the Comedy </v>

2654
01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking stupid piano off the stage.</v>

2655

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they see behind</v>

2656
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.200

<v Speaker 3>behind the fucking pain.</v>

2657
01:55:45.250 --> 01:55:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I apologize to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time I'm like,</v>

2658
01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:52.480
<v Speaker 3>I someone send them a drink because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can only see my feet and what have you </v>

2659
01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:53.040
<v Speaker 3>have to do something physical and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it behind the piano.</v>

2660
01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:54.930
<v Speaker 3>So for the one time Owen Benjamin drops </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

2661
01:55:54.931 --> 01:55:56.310
<v Speaker 3>We have a whole piano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2662
01:55:56.311 --> 01:55:57.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what I told Owen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2663
01:55:57.331 --> 01:55:58.650
<v Speaker 3>you need to bring your own fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>piano.</v>

2664
01:55:58.651 --> 01:56:01.020
<v Speaker 3>You and Craig Robinson bring a keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>

2665

<v Speaker 3>It's just like one of those old school </v>

2666
01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:06.440
<v Speaker 3>things that nobody ever got rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2667
01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things to talk to them </v>

2668
01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:11.620
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that was luck?</v>

2669
