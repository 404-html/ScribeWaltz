1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.290
Shut it.
Shut it folks.
We're fucking moving.

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.330
We're in motion right now.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.260
We're coming to you live from Beautiful Pasadena,

4
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.900
California where it's all going down.

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.610
Love is in the air and some other shit that's legal in two states.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.390
Ah,

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.070
this Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by on it go to o n n I t.com

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.600
and use the code named Brogan and you will save 10% off any and all of the

9
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:37.890
supplements available at on it.

10
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.790
There's no other way to really truly describe on it then a,

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.600
I tried to say a lifestyle company,
a supplement company,

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.310
a company that sells you shit to make you more bad ass.
Okay?

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.580
Everything that on itself,
it's something to make your mind work better,

14
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.230
improve your mood,
make your body work faster,
whether it's fitness equipment,

15
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.920
whether it's the supplements,
whatever the fuck it is.

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.850
We're selling you the best shit humanly possible.
Um,

17
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.280
I'm part owner in this company and that's how much I believe in it.

18
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.930
The stuff is the best shit we can find.
And when we sell you supplements,

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.670
no one's trying to rip you off in any way,
shape or form you have.
You can send,

20
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.940
you don't have to send shit.
If you order the first 30 pills,

21
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:20.580
you get them 100% money back guarantee.
If you don't like it,

22
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.790
you just say you don't like it.
The reason being twofold.
One,

23
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.410
we're definitely not trying to rip anybody off.

24
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:27.900
We don't want anybody to have a negative experience.
And two,

25
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.130
we are so confident that you're going to enjoy the products that we're willing

26
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:36.030
to take that chance.
This,
whether it's Alpha brain or whether it's new mood,

27
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.000
there is science behind all of these various supplements,

28
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.330
whether it's the court accepts mushroom supplement,
shroom tech sport,

29
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.780
which is one of the best supplements you can ever use as far as endurance goes.

30
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960
It's fucking phenomenal.
Um,
the,

31
00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:51.870
the hemp force protein powder that we sell the best hemp protein,
you can get,

32
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.440
the,
the richest in protein,
the smoothest.
And uh,

33
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:58.560
unfortunately we have to buy it from Canada because it's illegal in this
country.

34
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:02.610
Yo,
this country's kind of whack as fuck with it's stupid laws,

35
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.120
but we're working that out,
right?
Colorado and Washington state,

36
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.580
Colorado and Washington state stepped up and made marijuana legal.

37
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.380
I would love to sell marijuana on a.com if we could just say bricks of weed

38
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:20.430
through the mail someday.
Just call him happiness packages and people say,

39
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:24.850
hey man,
marijuana can be bad for you.
You know that.

40
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:28.650
That's the age old problem is that everything could be bad for you.

41
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.420
Washing your hands can be bad for you.

42
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:33.750
If you're fucking bananas and you wash your hands a hundred times a day.

43
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.930
When you talk to me about people that have a problem with marijuana,

44
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.200
I tell you that this people that have a problem with God damn everything,

45
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.820
don't concentrate on that.

46
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.940
Concentrate on what is being used or what is being achieved with marijuana.

47
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:50.640
That's good and the good aspects of it,

48
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:54.240
you can't ignore it just because some people have negative experiences.

49
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.750
The good aspects of it are a,
you're,
you're losing your ego,
you're relaxing,

50
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:00.000
you're getting more social.
You,

51
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.040
<v 1>you get more sensitive.
Food tastes better.
I don't know about that.</v>

52
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.440
I don't know about that Brian.
Oh,
sex is way better shut sex has gotten want to,

53
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.200
I don't want to hear about your,
but you know that killer bee honeys.

54
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.510
Another thing we're selling [inaudible] dot com we can't sell you week.

55
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.200
Folks could kill you.

56
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.030
We could kill you if you take 25 pounds of it and drop it out of an airplane and

57
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:23.910
hits you in the head.
Okay?
That's the only way we kills Ya.
And unfortunately,
uh,

58
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.760
because weeds illegal.
We can't sell you hamp either.
So we can sell it,

59
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.580
but we can't grow it.
It's really a screwy situation.

60
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.150
We have to actually get our shit from our neighbor to the North Canada and all

61
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:36.970
of them were very happy to give our brothers in the north some money.

62
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.010
The Canadian farmers,
it's all nice and everything,

63
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.610
but they're limited to because it's such a high commodity thing now.
It's a,

64
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.630
it's so in demand.
It's,
it's hard to keep up the supply.
Can I just say,

65
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:51.631
I love how you've added your own little taste to the Onnit website of having a

66
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.870
poker be one of the skills that helps you out for a alpha brain alpha brain.

67
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.930
There's a lot of above.
You mean pools?
That's what you meant.
Oh,
but it's true.

68
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.780
Max Everly,
uh,
he's a totally addicted to it.
Max,
I believe who's a,

69
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.010
one of my very good friends is one of the best pool players in the world.
And um,

70
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.920
Max is a hell of a pool player and he loves taking Alpha brain before he plays

71
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.130
pool poker players swear by it too,
apparently.
Um,

72
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.960
there's a lot of the dudes that,
uh,
that earn the professional poker tour,

73
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.070
uh,
are really into Alpha brain.
They're into every possible edge you can get.

74
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.930
I mean,
poker is all about thinking quickly and concisely and being able to,

75
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.500
you know,

76
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.860
formulate all the different possibilities in your mind and nothing helps with

77
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:39.400
that.
There's Max I,
right.
They're powerful Max crazy hair.
Yeah.

78
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.020
If you see that dude and he wants you to apply for money to not say yes,
I don't.

79
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.450
Sorry,
did knock your action Max.
Just say it's fucked up to say,
hey,

80
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.830
instead of let's go find some hot Asians.
Yeah,
he will fall apart on you.

81
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.310
He will fall apart on you.
Cause I played.
I played pretty good fucking pool,

82
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.390
but Max happily buries me every time he's,
he's a monster.

83
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.360
I've seen that guy run eight racks of 10 balls in a row.

84
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.050
That's not like unheard of.
That shit's ridiculous.
I've seen Max,

85
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:06.280
I believe do so freaky shit.

86
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.540
All on Alpha brain folks on at.com use the code name.
Rogan.

87
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:15.520
Save yourself 10% off all the supplements,
the other ship,
the new stuff.

88
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.600
We have so much new stuff.

89
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.570
You have to go to the website because I can't talk anymore.

90
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.430
People get pissed off and they stop listening.
Killer bee,
honey.

91
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:25.090
We got Omega Three jellies for your young ins.
Go check it out.
Fox.
That's it.

92
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.710
The end.
Danieli ball.
Al is here.
Ready to drop some science on you pitches.

93
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.500
Are you prepared?

94
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.850
We'll good experience.

95
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.860
<v 3>Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast all day.</v>

96
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.580
<v 1>Shorten these things up.
Danieli you know what I'm saying?
Man,
I'm,</v>

97
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.120
I'm talking too much.
I'm a rambling dude.
And when you,

98
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:54.930
when I have no script in front of me,
I probably have that cat parasite disease.

99
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.730
I should go look it up.
I we need to stop talking about and just do it.

100
00:05:58.731 --> 00:05:59.241
Just do it.

101
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:02.420
But I wouldn't want to tell people cause then they'd fucking blame everything on

102
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:04.760
my cat.
Paris.
We could be the spokesman for it.

103
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.810
I think that'd be awesome if we were the spokesman for,

104
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.810
if that many people are infected by it.
Joey.
Awesome.
Joey has 100 absolutely.

105
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.270
And he's not out.
His kids are about to have it.
Joe is a,

106
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.220
he's had more than 11 cats in his house at one point in time.

107
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:22.200
I don't know what he has now.
Does he have 11 it's 11 yeah.

108
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.240
And he has wild cats too.
He has ones outside that he only,
he only like feeds.

109
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:29.660
He doesn't even get to touch.
Those are the ones we'll probably have it.
Yeah.

110
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:32.390
The feral cats are the ones that probably have it.
He's got feral cats too.

111
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:35.600
He takes care of what?
Regular cats and feral cats.
That's nuts.

112
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.230
The thing is that that,
that toxoplasma disease,
when,

113
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:41.690
when people get that shit like you,

114
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:44.890
everybody always hears about the crazy cat lady.
You know,

115
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.580
everybody always hears about the crazy cat.

116
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:49.850
People that look lik live around all these cats and a 1520 cats.

117
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.380
If those cats really are hypnotized and those people in forced them to live

118
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:56.850
around there polluted shit,
that's kind of fucked up.

119
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.020
That's why we need to take the task and we'll be the spokesman for it.

120
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.060
That's a good idea.
That can be our thing.

121
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.500
Most folks don't even know what we're talking about.

122
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.800
Are you familiar at all with the whole toxoplasma thing?
Have you heard about it?

123
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.520
But you know,

124
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.580
kind of like random bad shit that can happen when you have cuts around.

125
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.890
That was about the extent that I got.
That's all you got,

126
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.630
but you're like super smart dude and a professor.
I fake it,
man.
You pick it.

127
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.050
I just fake each.
Well that's what it is.
Well,
you're very well read,

128
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:25.280
but is there almost too much things are too many things rather too much thing.

129
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:27.590
See my education,
it's goes deep son.

130
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.210
Fucking strong with the grammar is there's too many things to to know.

131
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.990
I mean in this day and age like to really truly be a renaissance man,

132
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.840
like there you are.
It doesn't matter how well read you are.

133
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.280
Doesn't matter how curious you are,

134
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.280
you are going to come across subjects that are just,
you have no idea.

135
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.530
There's just too much information out about anything.

136
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.210
Even about the stuff that you do know about.

137
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.850
There will still be the areas that you don't know about.
You know what I mean?

138
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.710
It's like the nature of the beast,

139
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:56.330
but at the same time to me in a way it doesn't matter because the reality of

140
00:07:56.331 --> 00:08:00.240
stuff is the same in 90 specific field of knowledge.
You'll discuss,
you know,

141
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.670
whether you're talking about martial arts or sex or UNH,
whatever.

142
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.900
At the end of the day,

143
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.380
the big themes are going to show up regardless so far your star,

144
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:12.980
so if you don't know every little thing there is to know which nobody will ever

145
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:16.130
get there,
then who the hell cares?
As long as you've got the essence of,

146
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.740
of the game.
Yeah.
And you know,
it's like,

147
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.950
I think that's part of how religion got a stronghold on humanity because that,

148
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:30.401
that reality of all these different things that you don't know and so much out

149
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:32.420
there that it's,

150
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.980
there was a quote by Terence Mckenna about,

151
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:42.280
I think it was his brother Dennis actually that said about uh,
expanding.
Uh,

152
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.180
the field of vision just really shows you more of what you don't know.

153
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.730
And that like if you have a camp fire,
like a,
the,
the brighter the campfire,

154
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.890
the more darkness has revealed.
And it's not that you ever,
it all,

155
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.980
<v 0>it just,
it be the more information you take in,</v>

156
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:03.981
the more it gets more and more confusing to the point where the real comfort

157
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:08.940
comes in simplicity.
It's why I like country music songs are so popular.

158
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.240
The idea of embracing simplicity,
especially in this day and age,

159
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.840
it's pretty popular because it feels good to like pretend that you know,

160
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:18.030
like fucking life's of John Wayne movie.
It feels,

161
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:21.150
it feels good to pretend that this stuff makes sense.

162
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:25.680
Where the more you look at life and the more you look at all the different

163
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:28.260
variables and then the fact that we are finite beings,

164
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.220
just that alone is the ultimate mind.
Fuck that.
No matter how well you do,

165
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.230
you know you,
you have a short amount of time in this spot,
in this dimension.

166
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.430
So the most noble aspects of religion,
I've always,

167
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.050
I've always defended the Nobel aspects of religion because I've seen it do good

168
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:50.180
things to people that have issues.
I've seen it uses a scaffolding for,

169
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.520
for developing a good ethical and moral behavior.

170
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.820
But the worst aspects of it are always the insistence on limiting information.

171
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:03.840
The insistence on slowing the,
the,
the,
it's not all religion by the way,

172
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:07.470
folks in,
and I'm not,
I'm not blaming all,
but I'm saying there's an aspect,

173
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:09.930
let's not even call it.
Religion is an aspect of human nature.

174
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.860
When you were in a position of power and all of a sudden there's information

175
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:17.040
that's coming at you.
So you control a bunch of people,
which by the way,

176
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:21.120
if you run a school or if you run,
um,
you're,
you're a preacher,

177
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.530
you're in a position of power.

178
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:25.230
You might not think of it as a position of power you might think of is it a

179
00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:28.890
position of teaching?
But you're clearly in a position of power.

180
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.810
And it's just a very unfortunate that when human beings get to that spot where

181
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:36.350
there's one person controlling another person or in,
in,

182
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.030
in charge of like speaking more than the other people,

183
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.490
they want to like hold that and manipulate it.

184
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.730
And if information comes in the contrary to what they've been teaching,

185
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.930
they fight that fucking shit tooth and nail.
And unfortunately it happens.

186
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:52.860
Even the lowest levels of academia,
it doesn't just happen in the,

187
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:56.880
in religion it happens.
And when professors get challenged on,
you know,

188
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.290
a longstanding ideas were,
are proven to be false.
It's,
I mean it's,
it goes way,

189
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.100
we want to think that like when you go way back to like Galileo getting house

190
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:07.500
arrest for saying that the earth wasn't the center of the universe.

191
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.960
You want to think?
Yeah,
but that was then.
We don't,
we're not,

192
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:14.670
we're past that shit now.
Not Quite.
We just have enough information.

193
00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:15.504
So it's,

194
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.130
it's way too ridiculous to lock somebody up for saying that the earth is in the

195
00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:21.000
center of the universe,

196
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:26.330
but it's still okay to teach in schools of the earth is only 10,000 years old.

197
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.760
You know what I mean?
He loves my mind crazy.
They're still doing it.
There's,

198
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.380
there's people,
I don't remember what state it is.

199
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:37.370
Let's be nice and pretend we don't know what state it is,
but it's,

200
00:11:37.371 --> 00:11:41.370
it's definitely worth warm out.
And these motherfuckers there,

201
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:46.470
they're trying to teach alternative theories to the theory of evolution and you

202
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:48.810
know,
they're saying,
well,
it's just the theory.

203
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.260
Evolution is just a theory this and it hasn't been proven.

204
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.070
You show me transitionary

205
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.940
<v 1>falter,
listen,
forget calling it the evolutionary theory.</v>

206
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.830
Let's just talk about the theory of how shit got to be what it is now.

207
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.200
You know,
when you,
when you call it evolution,

208
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.010
call it whatever you want to stop saying a name that you disagree with.

209
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:13.090
The evolution means lack.
Oh God.
Who created evolution?

210
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.440
If you just throw away that word,
what's going on?
Well,

211
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:20.770
obviously things are improving right in front of us all the time constantly.

212
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.580
Whether it's social things was or whether it's the physical capabilities of

213
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:26.200
human beings.
You know,

214
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:31.201
the size of lions in Africa that get stuck on an island when when things have to

215
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:35.680
get better or they get have to get better at something in order to improve.

216
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.753
They do.

217
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.040
And it seems like that's going on from the moment the Big Bang happened to the

218
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.160
cooling of these planets to the time where he could support liquid water to the

219
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:49.350
emergence of life.
There's a constant series of,
of,

220
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.660
of complications or,

221
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.540
or a constant process of things being more and more complicated and that's just

222
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:59.710
unavoidable.
So I don't,
it's easy.
Seems like that's everywhere around us.

223
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.770
Everywhere we look.
So you got to call it something.
Say maybe,

224
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.970
maybe there's a god and maybe the what God does is just plant seeds,

225
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.130
just like we do when we make it to paint.
I'll plant,

226
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:10.690
we're not involved in the entire process,
right?

227
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.380
Maybe the God is the seed planter of the universe,
but the,

228
00:13:14.381 --> 00:13:16.800
the motion and the did,
the way that everything goes,

229
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.590
it's sort of undeniable if get becomes more and more complex.

230
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:24.010
And when you have people that are in positions of power that insist on using

231
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:24.910
information that's

232
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.020
<v 4>really fucking old,
but it's the nature of the business,
right?</v>

233
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:32.680
If you are in a position of power,
anything that threatens it is a threat to you.

234
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.350
So fuck whatever new in for it.
You don't want anything to change.

235
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:38.230
A new information can change.
And by definition then it's bad.

236
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.510
Do they use any of the Dead Sea Scrolls?

237
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.050
Does any Christian religion and Braden mean,
granted there are,

238
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.060
last time I checked her 30,000 different denominations of Christianity.

239
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.480
So that's quite a few.
That true.
30,000 a holy Shit.

240
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.590
Which ones have the most sex?
You know,

241
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.140
that's like you've got to look at who's the,
is it the Mormons?

242
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:02.530
They seem like the healthiest you would dig was there was this one guy very

243
00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:07.380
early Christianity Carpool Kratos or somewhere Greek name like that that um,

244
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.130
I think second century Christianity,

245
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:14.150
why argue that the way to have and went through sex orgies and that he was

246
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.450
against standing kind of like ownership including Mary edge cause he can see

247
00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:21.580
there we are owning somebody as such as fuck it up.

248
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.100
So not only do we keep our property scene call model,

249
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.360
but we also share our lovers.
So we all have wild orgies in the name of Jesus.

250
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.500
What year was this?
Very early on was like,
I want to say second century.

251
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.860
So he knew how to live.
That guy knew how to live.

252
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.800
But can you imagine like Eddie's version off the IAT Buddy Vale.

253
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.220
But I never done simple little bit awesome fuck Sunday morning and everybody

254
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:44.650
would be rushing to church like crazy knocking on the door.

255
00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:45.840
Please let me back in.

256
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.760
You know the problem is always going to be some dude's left out that no one

257
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:52.340
wants to fuck and a will.
Those assholes were ruin it for everybody

258
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.460
<v 1>else.
I think that's that.
He's thorough.
Fair allegiance,
right there it is,
man.</v>

259
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.920
They come along and they say,
this is not God's way.
Why?

260
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:01.610
Because nobody wants to fuck that guy.
Exactly.
My thinking think man,

261
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.950
if he looked like Channing Tatum,
is that the guy?

262
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.710
They were really handsome fellow Channing Tatum.
That's the guy you like.

263
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.010
That's a guy like,
look Dave,
if that dude look like Channing Tatum,

264
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:13.310
he would never be proposing.
I'd be like,
yes,
I'm I need to settle down.

265
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:17.900
We'll raise,
raise each other's kids.
That's what Mckenna propose to.

266
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.030
He proposed that there was just these wild psychedelic drug orgies and that they

267
00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:26.900
would take mushrooms and have these orgies and that before,
you know,

268
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.080
when they really couldn't identify who was the father because they were all

269
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:32.810
being polyamorous as it were,

270
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.200
having sex with a bunch of different people,
but Mckenna,

271
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:40.460
I always felt like there was a little bit of wistfulness in those concepts that

272
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:42.350
I felt like,
well,
you look at Mckenna and you're like,

273
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.500
it's probably hard for that guy to get close and waves.

274
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:51.190
He probably concocted some wacky ass carries of things gone by the way things

275
00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:54.020
were,
and maybe not,
dude,

276
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:57.930
maybe it's always been caveman club and bitches overheads and dragging them into

277
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:02.950
holes to shoot loads into him because that seems like what it used to be like at

278
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.980
some point in time.
It did.
It really become a mushroom orgies.
I Dunno.

279
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.470
I think he would have liked that.
I think down to these dates,

280
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.840
every theory you ever years from anybody.

281
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.390
It's all about being able to get laid back.
That's my quick seat.

282
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.210
Disease of human nature.
Well,

283
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:22.270
there's no denying the workings of the human body and the human body requires a

284
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:27.350
lot of different things.
Uh,
it requires stimulation.
It requires,

285
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.710
that's why people go crazy when you put them in solitary confinement.

286
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.950
It requires the human touch.
I didn't,

287
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:37.040
I moved to La in [inaudible] 94 I guess,
and I did.

288
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.090
I was out here doing a sitcom and I didn't know anybody out here and I really

289
00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:43.580
didn't like work.
It was,
it wasn't,
it wasn't that fun.
It was,

290
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:45.230
it was a couple of guys that I liked on the set,

291
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:48.530
but it was dealing with all these actors.
It was a real alien experience for me.

292
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.250
And you know,

293
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.030
I miss my girlfriend back home in New York and I was out here for a couple of

294
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:57.530
weeks and this girl that I was working with on the show,
um,
she gave me a hug.

295
00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.130
Like it was no big deal.
It's like,
Hey,
how are ya?
What's going on?

296
00:17:01.131 --> 00:17:04.930
I'm excited to see you.
She gave me this hug at work and I remember it like,

297
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.900
like feeling like I went to the gas station and I filled up my tank.

298
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:13.280
You know what I mean?
It's like,
ah,
like I was on empty and now I'm better.

299
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.540
Like she gave me something by giving me a hug and it wasn't a sexual thing.

300
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.620
It was a,
it was a touch thing and I think we use,

301
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.340
we're so used to being hugged and so used to being social.

302
00:17:25.341 --> 00:17:29.510
It's so common that you don't realize when you step away from it for a little

303
00:17:29.511 --> 00:17:30.080
bit,

304
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.000
but you fucking need the human touch when you haven't been hugged for a while

305
00:17:35.001 --> 00:17:36.860
and someone hugs you.
It feels amazing.

306
00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:40.940
It just feels great just to get a nice hug from a person,
a guy.

307
00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:42.980
It's not a sexual thing.
It can be a guy.

308
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.650
That's what I'd seen that cracked me up when I moved to us.

309
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.290
Is it that I was used to giving hugs?
We men and men,
right,

310
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.080
and Iot are a bunch of men.
I realized they would always,

311
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.380
it's a hen to and in between three pats on the back with sheep's trust 20 inches

312
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:01.320
away cause otherwise it's sexual or sats again.
I'm like,
Oh fuck that.

313
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:04.280
I mean he forgot to give me a hug.
Give me August.
Well Dude,

314
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.440
my Dick on dude's legs and shit and the hips,

315
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:11.790
I like to my Dick on their hips will make sense to give him a hug and rub my

316
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:16.470
dick on their hips.
Yeah,
I hugged the fuck out of people.
I don't care.
Yeah,

317
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.710
we always say that like when we're going to Twitter,
we're on Twitter.

318
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:23.520
Going to shows a free hugs at the ice house tonight.

319
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.090
Well we say silly shit like that.
Nothing wrong with hugging people,
man.

320
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.210
But there is something wrong when somebody wants to hug you and you don't want

321
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:33.420
to hug them,
then just start robbing fucking.
Then you're like,
listen man,

322
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.640
I don't even know you.
Or people that want to hug you that have bad breath.
Like,

323
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.650
you can hug me but you gotta keep your mouth shut where it says the sweaty palms

324
00:18:40.651 --> 00:18:43.500
are sweaty hands and it's like a dead fish.
It's so often,

325
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.920
well I think it was strengthening my immune system because I do these shows and

326
00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:50.430
after the shows I'll shake hands with like hundreds of people cause I after the

327
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:53.700
shows I wait in line and then I take pictures with everybody.
I just feel like,

328
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.410
you know,
it's only a couple more hours of my time and it's,

329
00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.210
I'm so fortunate in so many ways that I feel like a hat and someone,

330
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:06.060
you know like dice wears gloves,
like he won't even shake people's hands.

331
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:07.950
Dice foresees weightlifting gloves.

332
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.460
<v 5>The funniest was when we're that say this already or that Greg Fitzsimmons when</v>

333
00:19:12.461 --> 00:19:15.430
we were in Seattle and we are taking photos together.

334
00:19:15.431 --> 00:19:18.460
Like you were taking photos and then they would come to us and me and him would

335
00:19:18.461 --> 00:19:22.180
take photos together and he was saying like how he doesn't shake hands,

336
00:19:22.181 --> 00:19:24.810
he just fist bumps.
And so I'm like,
you know,

337
00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.000
that makes so much sense because I am touching all these people's hands.

338
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:29.950
And so I did,
the next person went up to,

339
00:19:29.951 --> 00:19:32.140
happened to be an Asian guy and his girlfriend or whatever,

340
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.380
and I did a fist bump and he goes,
hey,
he,
you're the only one.

341
00:19:35.381 --> 00:19:37.630
He hasn't done shaking a person's hand.

342
00:19:37.631 --> 00:19:40.740
Like he tried to throw me underneath the bus,
like he doesn't want to share here.

343
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.150
So then,
and then I was like trying to get them,
trying to get them back.

344
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:49.220
So what I would do is like,
we would have her arm around the guy like,
like,
uh,

345
00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:53.270
you know,
uh,
and,
and Greg said,
uh,
I don't touch the person.

346
00:19:53.271 --> 00:19:56.090
So like when they do the arm thing,
I just stand there.

347
00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:59.930
I don't put my arm around them.
So I would always be like,
come on Greg,

348
00:19:59.931 --> 00:20:00.860
put your arm around the guy,

349
00:20:00.861 --> 00:20:03.230
let's take a photo here and then say he would have to do it.

350
00:20:03.231 --> 00:20:04.640
He really doesn't hug me.
No,
no.

351
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:08.060
And so then I started like moving his hand down and so like,

352
00:20:08.061 --> 00:20:11.410
he would touch his book,
the guy's butt stuff.
It was hilarious.

353
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.840
We are having the greatest time doing that.
Just stupid shit.

354
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.793
<v 1>Yeah.
We've,</v>

355
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:19.830
we went for a series of maybe five years of photos where Brian made a Baa face

356
00:20:20.991 --> 00:20:23.650
and the back of the photo,
it's not a joke like there's,

357
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.700
there might be 100,000 photos plus of Brian.
I mean,

358
00:20:27.701 --> 00:20:30.290
he was fucking committed to it.
Yeah.

359
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.880
There's a new era of humanity.

360
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.920
The photo error,
there's more photos today than there ever were ever.
I mean,

361
00:20:38.921 --> 00:20:39.850
in one day,

362
00:20:39.851 --> 00:20:43.930
I bet there's more photos taken then the entire history of the human race.

363
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.480
<v 5>Can you imagine history books in a hundred years?</v>

364
00:20:46.481 --> 00:20:48.160
It's just going to be fucking like my

365
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.160
<v 6>space photos from like the top and like this person who did this important thing</v>

366
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:56.060
and times this is Tila Tequila.
Right?

367
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.910
And this was her website that really shocked the world.
Yeah.
Speaking of photos,

368
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.370
just so you guys know why you,
we may seem this,

369
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.210
Gus guests may seem distracted and weird.
Right behind Joe's had,

370
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.770
there's these giant picture off a guard with vendor.
Very generous cleavage.

371
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:15.820
Do you know who that is?
I don't.
Do I want to know about this beautiful year?

372
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.450
Not America.
That's Pamela Anderson.
You got to a kid.
I mean that's fine.

373
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.000
Not knowing who pet look.
I look like I'm eight years old.

374
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.990
See how she's so yellow?
It's because of the hepatitis C.

375
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.300
That's why Brian stopped that.
But so many,

376
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.630
to be honest is actually at the moment of being here.

377
00:21:31.631 --> 00:21:36.400
Like 40 minutes is the first second that my eyesight goes above our clavicles

378
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.380
balloons.
Yeah,
that fan.
When I was a younger man,
I would've loved them.
So,

379
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.590
but now I look at them and I say they're good,
look great and everything,

380
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:47.890
but I can't get past the irony or the,

381
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:52.700
the ridiculousness of the fact that there's a a bag of water under your nephew

382
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.980
thought that he got passed that crazy dude.
That's so crazy.
I just,

383
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.660
just saying that I had a dream,
Brian,
that we were at a strip club and you,

384
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:05.380
you and I were at a strip club and there was a girl with a fake butt and you

385
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:08.200
kept saying,
dude,
she's got a fake,
but she's got to fake.

386
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:11.110
This is a real can of get her over here.
She'll show us.
She'll tell us.

387
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:15.790
And this girl was covered in oil and you were like pinching her fake,

388
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:20.140
but like you can't feel it at all.
And I was,
and I was just shocked how,

389
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:25.060
how odd it was.
I don't know why I see my life.
You time traveled.
Yeah.

390
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.310
Time traveled.
And uh,
well tell me,

391
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:31.210
because this girl had like an arm bracelet on as if she was like a Meu Thai

392
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:33.520
fighter or some shit.
And she had black hair.

393
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.490
She had just covered in oil and she's quite tanned.

394
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:38.070
She had black hair and she was tan.
But I said,

395
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.150
I don't think was oil is just pussy juice.

396
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.270
How come girls don't go with the Tan lines?
Tan Lines are gone.

397
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.670
They don't exist anymore.
You don't see him in porn.

398
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.670
If you ever see him in porn to get all excited and it's the hottest shit ever,

399
00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:51.460
ever under boob,
Tan Line perfection.

400
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.970
Garfield looking down at the sidewalk.
That's great.
Garfield,

401
00:22:54.971 --> 00:22:58.430
looking at the sidewalk,
the fuck,
I don't know when you talked to him about this.

402
00:22:58.431 --> 00:23:02.080
Imagine that's it.
Thank you.
I'm glad.
Do you know when you started?
No,

403
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:02.531
there's three,

404
00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:06.180
three filled those room knows the fuck you're talking about Brian Youth.

405
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.450
Your brain bad it Garfield.
I think you have a hamster parasite.

406
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.910
Everybody else got that cat parasite.
You got like a hamster.

407
00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:15.470
Paris Garfield looking down at the side walk under bib.

408
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.310
I did not know what that is.

409
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.800
That's a weird thing that girls can do where they can go out and they can

410
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:24.371
literally,

411
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:28.360
their entire tit can be hanging out as long as their areas are covered.

412
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:32.020
It's okay.
Yeah.
That is such a weird thing with us.
Like you can,

413
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.780
you can paint your tits.
Have you ever seen that?

414
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.410
When people paint their whole body so they're fucking naked and you have pain on

415
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.310
your tits are out and you're just wandering around at a party and like guys with

416
00:23:42.311 --> 00:23:43.390
their girlfriends and their girlfriends,

417
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.570
they found like a loophole for showing their tits.
Right.

418
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.890
Not that I'm blaming the look.
I'm not a hater.

419
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.520
I'm just saying it's a weird thing that you can just paint your tits and we're

420
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:56.450
pretending that's close when it paint become close because it's not dick close.

421
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:59.420
I'll tell you that you can't paint your deck.
We should try now.
You can't.

422
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:02.420
You go right to jail.
You can't just paint your Dick and go out there.

423
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.880
We'll arrest you.
They will lock you up for sure.
They'll say you're naked,

424
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.660
but a girl can be topless and covered in paint and somehow or another we let

425
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:12.020
that slide.
Even if it's like painted like a Tracy,
we like,
I'm a law enforcement.

426
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.280
You now on the field when we're out there on the streets trying to keep people

427
00:24:16.281 --> 00:24:19.610
safe.
I don't want pits out if it's painted really well though.

428
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.090
Like if it was a Turkey gobbler or something like that or you know,

429
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.480
like it's nice.
Yeah.
It's pretty like it's a cool artwork.
Artwork.
Yeah.

430
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:28.820
Well I guess there's an argument for that.
Look,

431
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.710
I think you should be able to do it.
Don't get me wrong,

432
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.690
but I think it is weird that you're allowed to do it.

433
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.430
You're not allowed to be topless,

434
00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:36.740
but you are allowed to be topless with paint on your tits.

435
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.380
That's the fucked up bark.
You ever not allowed to be topless.

436
00:24:39.381 --> 00:24:41.420
What the fuck is that?
I mean he's just like,
we have what?

437
00:24:41.421 --> 00:24:44.360
Sanford under valley ward copied all of porn,
but at the same time,

438
00:24:44.361 --> 00:24:45.770
if a woman gets topless on the beach,

439
00:24:45.771 --> 00:24:49.160
it's considered indecent exposure and you go to jail.
These were very ridiculous.

440
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.910
What if we could pants,
uh,
painted on and we get to a strip club?

441
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.990
I don't think he can do that.
I think they'll arrest you.
You should try.

442
00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:02.480
You try to paint your Dick Walker genes on Paige jeans?
Yeah,
I guess why not?

443
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:07.070
It really gets down to the question of like how thin his clothes,

444
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.820
like at what point in time is it not close when it's opaque?
Is it close?

445
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.330
I could see the outlining the deck if I'm,
if you're wearing clear pants,

446
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.090
are you allowed to wear clear pants?
Like say if you were wearing,

447
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:21.380
it looked like Saran wrap,
clear pants and I just see your cock and balls.

448
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:24.620
Is that legal because you're wearing clothes,
you're just wearing clear close?

449
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.070
Probably not league.
I think so.
Unless there's,

450
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.550
unless he trimmed like I think if he had no pubic hair,
it might be legal.

451
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:36.110
What have years old monster Bush.
It's the Bush as hair,

452
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:39.050
everything.
No underwear walking around.

453
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.070
So are you around a lot of walk around in underwear?
That's a question.
Yeah.

454
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.490
Are you?
I think so.
Can you just walk somewhere with underwear on?

455
00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:49.940
Can you walk into a store with underwear on?
I would think so.

456
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.420
You can walk in if you have board shorts and no underwear on,

457
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.760
they don't even know.
And meanwhile,

458
00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:59.390
this is just a thin layer cloth between you and your dangerous Dick.

459
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.820
Girls wear bathing suits everywhere.
So that's underwear.

460
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.030
Are they allowed to wear bathing suits into a store?
Every store.

461
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.330
My ex girlfriends do.
You did a bunch of sweet.

462
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.270
We went to olive garden in a bathing suit.

463
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.790
It cause it's just a way to get in a bathing suit to olive garden.
Yeah.

464
00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.880
That's how you know you're classy
boy.

465
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.030
But it should have married that girl with the naked story brings back a mammary.

466
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.300
I had the most annoying neighbors in the universe who are hardcore Christian.

467
00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:28.690
Fundamentalist total freaks who made noise.

468
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.640
Don't give out their address online but give out the house right next to them

469
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:34.671
on be nice.

470
00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:37.640
Plus they probably moved by now and it's somebody else who would get stuck with

471
00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:39.080
people.
But in any case,

472
00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:43.070
these guys were just bugging the shit out of me and they were uh,
in the,

473
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.310
in the back they were cleaning

474
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.140
<v 4>their car.
He was like the way the Hobbs this worst stop it.</v>

475
00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:51.750
This was about a full one foot out of my screen door that was open in the back

476
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:52.980
with some are.
So there was only,

477
00:26:52.981 --> 00:26:55.850
I only had the screen door but you could see inside cars at the light on.

478
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.660
I was like,
how do I piece these people off?

479
00:26:57.661 --> 00:27:01.470
They're bugging the hell out of me with their obnoxious music.
I was like,

480
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:05.600
you know what,
fuck the play naked chef.
So I was cooking at the moment.

481
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:06.900
They were right there.
So I just,

482
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.870
it other than just cool clinic and they are not quite pay attention yet.

483
00:27:09.871 --> 00:27:11.790
So I'm going to make sure to pump the music a little.

484
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:16.380
So the look inside with one second from the time I did that,

485
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.810
they were out back in the house,
locked behind her,
them and it was wow.

486
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:25.600
<v 1>You like it when they watch that
there was a guy was arrested.</v>

487
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.300
Did you hear about the story that was arrested for that very thing in

488
00:27:28.301 --> 00:27:29.650
Springfield,
Virginia,

489
00:27:29.651 --> 00:27:34.651
a guy named Eric Williamson was arrested and charged with indecent exposure for

490
00:27:35.411 --> 00:27:39.730
failing to put on any clothes after getting up at 5:30 AM to make some coffee,

491
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.360
any silos and his house in his own fucking house.

492
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.440
A woman in her seven year old daughter had cut across Williams front yard and

493
00:27:47.441 --> 00:27:49.870
saw him through his kitchen window.
Well first of all,

494
00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:54.220
that concept trespasser and fucking Colorado and parts west,

495
00:27:54.221 --> 00:27:55.750
they could just shoot that crazy bitch.

496
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.870
So she called the cops cause the guy was making coffee naked.

497
00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.970
The guy got out of fucking bed and made coffee.

498
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.860
It's not like he was beating off in front of the window banging on it.

499
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.510
You and the kid.
That's crazy.

500
00:28:07.511 --> 00:28:12.511
If convicted Williamson could be fine $2,000 and could spend a year in jail.

501
00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.490
And this is,
this is incredible.
This is 2009.

502
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:19.290
I don't know what happened,
but I think this is,
he's been,

503
00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.450
I think this has happened more than once.
My favorite

504
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:24.470
<v 4>today was some guy,
uh,</v>

505
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:29.210
give it a $2,000 ticket to a toddler who was be seen any Solon backyard.

506
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.220
Oh God.
A toddler.
Yup.

507
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:37.190
<v 1>It did happen again.
It happened in October this year.
Young in Yorktown,</v>

508
00:28:37.191 --> 00:28:40.640
Virginia.
And again,
it's all places where it's fucking too hot out.

509
00:28:40.641 --> 00:28:44.510
Those people are retarded.
Not all of them,
but a good good percentage of them.

510
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.050
Right?
A good solid percentage.
If you're in Virginia,

511
00:28:49.051 --> 00:28:53.900
a good solid percentage of the people that you're solid.
It's not even a word.

512
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.230
So what I said,
I think I said this already coming out my mouth,
I'm like stupid.

513
00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.750
By the way,
both of these incidents happened in Virginia,

514
00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.230
two separate towns in Virginia.
God,

515
00:29:03.231 --> 00:29:07.430
people are stupid as fuck.
This guy was 69 years old.

516
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.510
He was in his house.
He was standing naked in front of the window up.

517
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.900
Well that might've been different.
This guy seems a little creepy.
Yeah,

518
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:19.330
it's again,
a woman with her kids walking her kids and this dude,
he,

519
00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.450
she said he made no effort to cover himself and was in clear view of the public.

520
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.720
You know why?
Because he probably is not even sure if he's alive anymore.

521
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.780
He's 69 years old.
What was the last time anyone touched his dick?

522
00:29:29.781 --> 00:29:32.430
He's probably on all kinds of pills and he purse like,

523
00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:36.440
I just want to be naked in front of the window.
Am I even alive anymore?

524
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.010
There's somebody out there,

525
00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.040
so he takes his off and stands in front

526
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.873
<v 6>of the mirror something.</v>

527
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:48.060
It's always some cock blocking bitch just hating with their kids.

528
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.060
Not to say the guy wasn't creepy and crazy and I'm sure he has,

529
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.270
but really it's your house.
You should be allowed to be naked.

530
00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.430
<v 5>You know what's fun about having a beetle is that every time you drive by kids</v>

531
00:30:02.431 --> 00:30:06.520
they punch each other because it's a you slug bug beetle.
The black,

532
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.090
you're supposed to be like slope.
What block and then he punched a person.

533
00:30:09.091 --> 00:30:10.770
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've never heard of them.
Yeah,

534
00:30:10.771 --> 00:30:14.400
it's like a kid's thing that every time you see a beetle you have to save the

535
00:30:14.401 --> 00:30:16.770
color of the beetle.
Like slug bug red.

536
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.380
If it's a red beetle and then you punch the person in that.

537
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.030
<v 6>Oh,
so they could punch you if they see the same car again.</v>

538
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.270
<v 5>Right.
Or if they see another beetle.</v>

539
00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.550
<v 6>Oh,
any beetle.</v>

540
00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.520
<v 5>Yeah.
So it's funny because you see it when you drive a butyl,</v>

541
00:30:28.521 --> 00:30:30.860
you see it like just driving by people.

542
00:30:30.861 --> 00:30:32.990
You'll see it like every five people will do it.

543
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.271
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

544
00:30:33.271 --> 00:30:36.270
I would recommend not playing that game with anybody who knows how to punch.

545
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.220
<v 5>Right.
Well I was thinking just go do it like a school girl.</v>

546
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.520
I like when they get out of class,
you know,

547
00:30:41.521 --> 00:30:45.030
just to keep on driving by real slow and this Japanese schoolgirl,

548
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.370
Japanese schoolgirl like a school

549
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.380
<v 1>going by a school and punching each other.
Brian,</v>

550
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.790
you're going to need to go to a doctor.
You really need to go to a doctor though.

551
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:58.390
The idea that you are on a podcast that seen and listened to by millions of

552
00:30:58.391 --> 00:31:02.680
fucking people,
staggers folks at home right now.
It like this guy.

553
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:07.300
Does he understand that?
No one understands him.
Yeah,
it's cool girl.

554
00:31:07.301 --> 00:31:10.960
And then you fly those airplanes,
get a kite,
light a cigarette.

555
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:14.470
You know when you cut grass like something wrong with your brain,

556
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:19.390
the sentences that you're putting together,
the nonsensical and you say,
I'm like,

557
00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:24.190
yeah,
you know,
maybe I'm partially to play him for nursing.

558
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.270
<v 6>I don't.
No,
maybe it's partially my fault.
Why is it naked?</v>

559
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.910
Why is being naked illegal?
Is that,
does that a religion thing?

560
00:31:31.911 --> 00:31:34.260
Is that even in the Bible?
Do you have cool work clothes?
You know,

561
00:31:34.261 --> 00:31:38.310
it's awesome because all the sacral stuff is,
it's hilarious because I'm,

562
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.240
especially in Christianity because Jesus doesn't really talk about sex.

563
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.420
I mean there's like one of mine or reference where people think actually was a

564
00:31:44.421 --> 00:31:46.320
joke and he was trying to say the opposite,
but in any case,

565
00:31:46.321 --> 00:31:50.150
this is a known issue.
It just never touch us on the topic.
For All we know.

566
00:31:50.151 --> 00:31:53.570
He could have been having origins from morning tonight or could have been

567
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.660
totally said,
we have no idea this is Jesus.
But what about the,

568
00:31:56.661 --> 00:32:00.590
doesn't the old testament have some sexual references and it doesn't,
it does.

569
00:32:00.591 --> 00:32:03.450
It forbade Chris a sexy homosexuality.
What would it,

570
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:07.460
what does it say about the lines with a man?
He should be stoned,
right?
Oh yeah.

571
00:32:07.461 --> 00:32:10.110
Which maybe is be interpreted in a different way,
but yeah,

572
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.160
it'd be cool if they meant that.
Like if you guys are having sex,

573
00:32:13.161 --> 00:32:17.060
you should get high for us a little feel better.
Let it be funny.

574
00:32:17.061 --> 00:32:21.020
It was a big misunderstanding and the dummies came along,
Oh,

575
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.020
we gotta throw rocks at them and then that's,
it became that,
you know,

576
00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.870
it was like if two guys are lying around together,
like you'll listen.

577
00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.910
If you want her to get really comfortable with each other,

578
00:32:28.911 --> 00:32:32.480
you've got to get high for us.
That should be it.
That should be,

579
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.870
they make you emperor off the ward and that should be a lot of the first laws

580
00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:36.920
passed.
Yeah.
I,

581
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.890
I've always said there's two types of people that are trying to gay marriage in

582
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:40.490
case sex.

583
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:43.640
It's people that are really dumb and people that are secretly worried that

584
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:47.120
Dick's are delicious.
Yeah,
of course.
That's all it is.

585
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.390
It's people that are just fucking fighting off the gay man and they're not

586
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:53.810
winning.
They're fighting off the gay,
but they're just fucking not winning.

587
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.860
The fact that you would want to control anybody who's into anything sexually,

588
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:02.630
you know,
like dudes.
I have friends that are into really big women.
Like,

589
00:33:02.631 --> 00:33:05.660
I don't want to mention names,
Sam Tripoli,
but there's,
there's a guy,

590
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.920
he fucking loves big women jokes,
but he loves a man.

591
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:15.000
Like a girl walked by two 10 to 20 he's like,
fuck yeah,
Mama,
you ready?

592
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:19.260
You know
it.
But that's him.
You know?

593
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.970
I mean like,
it's have to do it.
Everybody's got their own thing.
You know?

594
00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:26.810
Some men are into like really big women and the really tall women.
Some women,

595
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.010
some men are into like little tiny ones,
like whatever the fuck you're into,
man.

596
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.770
I don't care.
Why would anybody care?
But back in the day,

597
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:39.180
some someone decided that gay dudes are against God's way.

598
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.620
How did that,
how did that eventually,
originally start?
Does that old tea?

599
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.300
It's Old Testament,
right?
I mean,
but are,
you know,
and does it exist?

600
00:33:47.301 --> 00:33:52.040
And he picked Christianity.
Yeah,
it does.
Homophobia does.
Yeah.
What,

601
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.990
where does it exist?
Um,
you do everything a bunch of places.

602
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.700
So the oldest of the same places at different points in time maybe completely

603
00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.320
changed their tune dramatically.

604
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:05.270
But you do have it in places and times that other than Christian stuff like,

605
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:07.730
you know,
a lot of,
uh,
had a lot of Chinese culture,

606
00:34:07.731 --> 00:34:11.780
not exactly friendly toward homosexuality,
but the Japanese,
oddly enough,

607
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.590
especially the Samurais were very friendly with us and he's our Frakes and

608
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.500
that's a whole different game.

609
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.960
Some about Saks is he's in play octopuses the Williams school girls to every see

610
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.380
girls in between.
The Japanese were bad motherfuckers.
Man,
there,

611
00:34:26.381 --> 00:34:28.790
their culture was so,
uh,

612
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.710
so innovative when it came to so many different things.
The,
the,

613
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.380
the decider discipline,
the,
you know,
the,

614
00:34:35.381 --> 00:34:37.610
the controlling of the mind that all the different,

615
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:42.350
the innovations in martial arts,
so much of it came from Japan.
So much of it,

616
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.740
when you think about how small Japan is in relation to the rest of the world,

617
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.540
it's really kind of shocking.
Like Japans like the size of Texas,
right?
Not even,

618
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.360
not even a sign of Texas.
Yeah.
Texas.
I think Japan is,
it might be like,

619
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:56.691
you know,

620
00:34:56.691 --> 00:35:01.691
a fairly small area in comparison to like one of our good size states and

621
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:05.210
meanwhile think about how much shit came from there.
Yeah,
it's amazing.

622
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.310
It's weird how that happens.
Her one spot.

623
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.630
What kind of religion when they practicing when Shinto and what is that based
on?

624
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.570
[inaudible] so water of nature,

625
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:18.590
spirits and stuff like that that they all even started calling machine to will

626
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:20.180
literally means the way of the gods.

627
00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:22.940
Only when Buddhism came around just because he's like,

628
00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:26.180
I guess we have to call our shit something to differentiate it from this.

629
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.030
But these came around,
I want to say 12 and threads.

630
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.980
I want to say other lenders to the jump.
N C a d or BC.
Oh No,

631
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:37.650
I d eight d and so 1,280 that's not that long ago,
man.
Yeah,

632
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.300
<v 4>that's crazy.
Maybe a little bit before,
but that's the,
these mean Japan,</v>

633
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.840
would these mean Jana was six about 500 before,

634
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.010
like 2,500 years ago.
Where does Buddhism originally come from?
What country?

635
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.980
India.
India.
Yeah.
You start out with in India.
And I need to pass through.

636
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.570
But the weird thing is that today there's no Buddhism in India really?

637
00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:00.330
And or like tiny,
tiny.
Because what happens is,

638
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.830
well beside the Muslim in visuals in the north to destroy a bunch of time post

639
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.560
and all that shit.

640
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.920
But then the way in Louisa Marie actuate his Braille and you know in the West

641
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:08.770
when you know,

642
00:36:08.771 --> 00:36:12.600
protest aunties and comes out of catalysis and they kill each other for 200

643
00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:15.630
years.
When Buddhism comes out into wisdom,

644
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:18.960
start checking out what they do and then they steal a bunch of their ideas.

645
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:20.640
They bring them back into their things.

646
00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:23.730
So if somebody is Hindle they see the Buddhist thing,
it's like,
oh,

647
00:36:23.731 --> 00:36:26.190
we already do some of that shit.
I don't need to switch religions.

648
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.500
So they just blatantly borrow from it.

649
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:33.060
And so less and less people in India at any needed to convert because they could

650
00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:35.430
find room for that stuff within indoor season.

651
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.360
<v 1>Oh.
That's sort of how Christianity absorbed a lot of pagans with,
uh,</v>

652
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.670
like the changing their holidays,
like the Christmas religion,

653
00:36:43.671 --> 00:36:48.620
like the Christmas holiday and making that Jesus's birthday when Jesus has

654
00:36:48.621 --> 00:36:50.690
really supposedly born in like June or something.

655
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.350
<v 4>All right.
It's like big on holiday.
But that even as he's,
that in Christianity,</v>

656
00:36:54.351 --> 00:36:55.184
they lie about it.

657
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.090
They try to pretend it didn't happen in Indonesia and they're like,
yeah,

658
00:36:59.120 --> 00:36:59.630
that's cool.

659
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.610
<v 1>That was a good idea.
And we borrowed it.
They're smart.
Yeah.
Look,</v>

660
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:06.390
the Buddhist said a lot of fucking cool ideas.
Yeah.
Wow.
How would the Buddhist,

661
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.340
what was it about Buddhism?
There was,

662
00:37:08.341 --> 00:37:13.341
so there's no other religion that I know that is so intent on like the cleansing

663
00:37:15.271 --> 00:37:20.130
of consciousness and the purity of thought,
the idea of a,
you know,
uh,

664
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.960
meditation and isolating the isolating your,
your consciousness to,

665
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:25.710
to,
to,

666
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:30.710
to clear out all these in practical ideas like material wealth and the need for

667
00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:36.030
sexual satisfaction.
All those different things managed through Buddhism.

668
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:40.860
Um,
that's,
that's very rare that a uh,
uh,

669
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.920
an ideology like takes on such a strong and discipline stance about like

670
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.110
expanding consciousness.
Like how did that start?

671
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.210
<v 4>Well,
cause I mean Buddhism starts out as a mystical movement,
right?</v>

672
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.230
And they still thought that about mystical techniques designed to take you to a

673
00:37:56.231 --> 00:37:57.580
certain state of consciousness.

674
00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:00.880
That's why like the whole point of Buddhism is not to become a Buddhist is to

675
00:38:00.881 --> 00:38:02.660
become a Buddha.
You know,
you have to do this,

676
00:38:02.661 --> 00:38:05.860
that and is not like worship the guy who would eat it.
Good for you.

677
00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:07.690
Well who cares?
How does that affect you?

678
00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:12.370
Is about being able to do the same thing that the guided meditation in that

679
00:38:12.371 --> 00:38:15.280
sense,
he's one of those techniques designed to,
to take you there,

680
00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.720
to bring you to that state of consciousness and um,
make door new into a boat.

681
00:38:19.721 --> 00:38:20.554
They're sanitary.

682
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.970
<v 1>That's a fascinating thing because that should,</v>

683
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:27.290
that's sort of the case with an anything that you're trying to achieve.
You know,

684
00:38:27.291 --> 00:38:27.831
when you are,

685
00:38:27.831 --> 00:38:31.800
whether you're doing martial arts or the you're doing art or anything,
you're,

686
00:38:31.801 --> 00:38:36.430
you're trying to find your own path through

687
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.290
<v 0>the example of others.
Yeah.</v>

688
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.680
And that's one of the things that's like really important about being around bad

689
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:43.720
motherfuckers.
Like people don't understand,

690
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:47.230
they really underestimate the importance of being around bad motherfuckers.

691
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:52.120
You got to like know like what other people are capable of,
what they can do.

692
00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:53.680
And in order to be like truly,

693
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:58.681
I mean in my experience to be truly inspired and now and when you find people

694
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:04.531
that are like jealous around bad motherfuckers or try to hold people down,

695
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.710
if you find like if you have friends and those for like,
okay,
just to you,

696
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.900
whoever you are,
if you're a cock blocker,

697
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.110
if you're one of those guys that tries to fuck your friends,

698
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.020
girlfriends or you,
uh,

699
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:20.950
you get jealous when your friend successful and you talk shit about him behind

700
00:39:20.951 --> 00:39:24.430
his back and you stab him in the butt.
If you're one of those guys,

701
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.530
you're just fucking yourself.

702
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:30.540
If you see some guy and he's doing better than you,
you,

703
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.950
you either one of have to accept one of two things.
You got to go.

704
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:34.300
That guy's like,
he's crazy.

705
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:38.170
He works too hard except did cause there is that right there is that there's a

706
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:41.410
lot of jealousy that's misplaced because really that person probably doesn't

707
00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:43.870
have as good a life as you,
if you know some good fishing spots,
right?

708
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:49.090
But if you start feeling negative feelings towards them because they're

709
00:39:49.091 --> 00:39:52.060
successful,
that's,
that's bad for you man.

710
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.930
That that is that the negative feelings that you're feeling towards him,

711
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.710
they work,
they will fucking affect you.
They will come after you.

712
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.750
They will chip away at your self esteem.
They will chew your,

713
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.980
your mind will know that you're thinking of like when you see,

714
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:10.180
like I've seen this before where a guy like becomes like real successful at the

715
00:40:10.181 --> 00:40:10.750
comedy store.

716
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.690
It was always like some guy will get a movie or something or it's a series and

717
00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:17.280
take off and then you see other comics,
they'd be like,
yeah,
well he's fucking,

718
00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:20.380
he's got a show now,
man.
Fucking guys go to show.
Meanwhile,

719
00:40:20.381 --> 00:40:23.970
they were like buddies just like a month ago.
And this guys,
somehow or another,

720
00:40:23.971 --> 00:40:28.660
that guy's success is causing this dude uncomfortable feelings and,

721
00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.860
and so what he does his lashes out at the person who's successful.

722
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.910
You'll lashing out it yourself.
You gotta take your medicine.

723
00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:40.960
That feeling that you get when you know that you haven't done the best you can

724
00:40:40.961 --> 00:40:45.790
do.
That's to keep you from doing that.
Again,
that terrible feeling of regret.

725
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.380
Don't lash out at other people.

726
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:51.190
Just take your fucking medicine and get your shit together.

727
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.230
Easier said than done.

728
00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.630
Thought that easier said than done because then you have to do something that

729
00:40:55.631 --> 00:41:00.160
I'd are down whining like a beach about what somebody else is doing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

730
00:41:00.161 --> 00:41:00.670
It's um,

731
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:05.670
the management of your energy that at that is the most important aspect of

732
00:41:05.711 --> 00:41:06.544
living this life.

733
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.570
Managing your energy and the managing to keep it somehow and it keeping your

734
00:41:10.571 --> 00:41:14.740
thoughts,
keeping your consciousness,
your focus in a good direction,

735
00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:16.870
in a healthy direction.
How do you do it?
Cause I mean,

736
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:21.100
I was going over in my mind,
I was like,
how many m sinks that Joe dual,
you know,

737
00:41:21.101 --> 00:41:23.560
from comedy to the podcast,
UFC,
you know,

738
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:27.010
like there's so much you work out religiously,
you do all this stuff.

739
00:41:27.011 --> 00:41:31.240
They're like late 30 out of the hell.
Do you do it with 24 hours in a day?

740
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:36.170
Stay in a semi sane.
Everything I do,
I like to do.
That's the big part of it.

741
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.020
Like,
you know,
I was looking forward to this podcast.

742
00:41:38.021 --> 00:41:40.400
Let's going to be a lot of fun.
I'm looking forward to going into Jujitsu.
I'm,

743
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:43.760
I'm looking forward to working out.
I'm,
I'm looking forward to writing tonight.

744
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:46.310
I'm gonna get some riding.
I'm looking forward to getting into the tank later.

745
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.580
You know,
I don't do anything.
I love working for the UFC.

746
00:41:49.581 --> 00:41:51.150
I look forward to the big fights.

747
00:41:51.151 --> 00:41:53.090
So look forward to the little fights and nobody even cares about.

748
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:57.300
I love what I do,
you know,
and that to be the,

749
00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:03.150
that thing that makes me the happiest in life is that I've found all these

750
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:06.950
things that interests me and we,
I know we all have different personalities.

751
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:10.010
Like we had Tim Ferriss here yesterday and that motherfucker likes to salsa

752
00:42:10.011 --> 00:42:14.720
dance.
Okay.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
But I love Tim Ferris.

753
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.530
So it's,
we,
I found things that,

754
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:23.240
that stimulate me for whatever reason.
And those are the things that I pursue.

755
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:27.590
So I'm constantly motivated and energized by my activities.

756
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.670
All the things that I do,

757
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:32.300
like I've had jobs before and even a job like fear factor,

758
00:42:32.301 --> 00:42:36.710
which was a great job still,
I would be like,
what the fuck am I doing here man?

759
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:41.180
Just collecting a check.
Right.
You know,
this is not what I would rather be doing.

760
00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.170
And when you,

761
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.260
if you could figure out a way to live your life where everything you're doing is

762
00:42:45.261 --> 00:42:49.160
what you want to do at that moment,
you know,
it's just,
that's,

763
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:53.570
that's a really difficult thing to,
to sort of manage.
And I've been,

764
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.490
I have to,
I have to think that.
I know that I've worked very hard,

765
00:42:58.491 --> 00:43:01.220
but I think I'm very fortunate.
There's no question about it.

766
00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:06.080
There's a lot of fortunate involved in that.
It's not,
um,
there's no way it's a,

767
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:10.650
all my work boats cause he's not going to,
I mean far Trump can play a role,

768
00:43:10.651 --> 00:43:13.060
but he's not going to happen unless you do the work either.
It's,

769
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:16.070
it goes both ways.
Yeah.
Um,
you know,

770
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:21.670
I think everybody has their own take on what life is really all about,

771
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:27.800
what,
what it is for them.
You've got to find out what your thing is.
You know,

772
00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:32.801
whether it's studying ancient religions and or some people they get their

773
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:36.830
fucking thrills out of combing the mountain side with a brush looking for

774
00:43:36.831 --> 00:43:40.190
fossils like that that reels them to no end.

775
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:45.170
Everybody's got their own fucking vibe.
And if you want to be a happy person,

776
00:43:45.171 --> 00:43:46.310
you got to find your vibe.

777
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:50.180
That to me is always been like the biggest problem that I have with it,

778
00:43:50.181 --> 00:43:53.270
with any sort of totalitarian or any,

779
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:57.920
any sort of like really strict ideology is that you cannot apply the same rules

780
00:43:57.921 --> 00:44:02.330
and the same behavior patterns to everybody.

781
00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:07.130
Because when you do that,
you lose the,
the beauty of the freak.
You know,

782
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:10.910
like I was talking like we're talking about Joey Diaz today,

783
00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.940
me and my friend Aubrey,
we're having a conversation about Joey,

784
00:44:13.941 --> 00:44:16.520
but how awesome he is.
He's just such a rare person.

785
00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:20.660
Like he's just such a rare freak and it's such,
you know,

786
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.010
he's just a crazy dude.

787
00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:25.490
I can't get them into other countries cause he fucking back in the day,

788
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:30.380
kidnap to dude machine gun still calling from mean.
It's crazy.

789
00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.220
He's at,
he can't go to Seattle.

790
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.940
<v 6>He's got warrants.
I mean he's,
he's a maniac,
but he's,</v>

791
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:39.840
he's a beautiful craziness.
Like all,

792
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.210
all this nutty life experiences,

793
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:47.190
both positive and negative have made this incredible person that you're really

794
00:44:47.191 --> 00:44:50.560
the,
it's a,
he's a joy to be around and he's a beautiful human being.

795
00:44:50.561 --> 00:44:53.430
Like he's always hugging people and everywhere he goes,

796
00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:55.870
he's like your number one fan.
You know,
he,

797
00:44:55.871 --> 00:44:59.220
he's happy to see like he's the type of guy that will go to the same places in

798
00:44:59.221 --> 00:45:01.320
his neighborhood all the time.
As soon as he walks in,

799
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:04.300
they all know I'm doing like Joey,
what's going on Joey?
What are you doing?

800
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.600
Cock sock or what are you doing?
And they're just like,
oh,

801
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:09.420
this burst of happiness.
Cause this guy's around.
Well,
you know,

802
00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:12.990
if you followed the tenants of most religions that guys,
you know,

803
00:45:12.991 --> 00:45:15.540
he's fucking sinner by the highest stretch of the imagination,
right?

804
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:20.070
Where the f the,
the furthest explanation of the term,
you know,
like to a tee,

805
00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:21.660
he's a fucking center across the board.

806
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:24.000
Everything he's doing is wrong except being nice to people.

807
00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:28.590
But smoking weed whacking off and he's fucking crazy.

808
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.890
Live with 11 cats and he's you.

809
00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:35.380
You can't control people and get those variables,
you know?

810
00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:39.330
I mean the stuff you'll find within the rules is the ordinary.

811
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:41.940
If you're willing to get start in our is going to be outside of the rose.

812
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:42.960
That's just the name of the game.

813
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:46.230
But of course that threatens any institution is threatened by that.

814
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.100
And so they will try to squash it and I'll make it happen.
Like in school,

815
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.340
of course when you're in school,
they know they don't want a acting out.

816
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:55.970
They don't want anybody who's not there.

817
00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.490
That's the weirdest thing about school is that it just by virtue of the fact

818
00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:00.870
that you have to sit there and do the work,

819
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:04.230
when they say you have to sit there and do the work,
just by virtue of that,

820
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:08.130
they control your,
your consciousness and you are,
you,

821
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:12.630
you relinquish your consciousness to them and that sets you up for a lifetime of

822
00:46:12.631 --> 00:46:17.280
work.
Were you doing what you don't want to do when they want you to do it?
Yeah.

823
00:46:17.281 --> 00:46:18.610
Cause I mean it's cool.
He's not released.

824
00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:22.320
Their credit score is not about educating and awesome human being is designed to

825
00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:27.090
make you fang shown in an average way in the society while educating you.

826
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.640
But that's the,
that's the primary aspect.
I mean it's sort of,

827
00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:33.720
that certainly educates you more than not going to school.
Not,
yeah.
Okay.

828
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.800
Because that's the other thing is like the anti intellectual Liza Mazda crazy.

829
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:40.770
This is like,
no,
please give me back into school.
It's any day now,

830
00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:43.410
but then when you already need to then you get to talk shit about it.

831
00:46:43.411 --> 00:46:46.160
And so you can see all the lean meats and all the problems and allow,

832
00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:49.780
it could be so much better at any teas.

833
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.870
And it's frustrating when you see it today meets,
well you are,

834
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.240
you are a professor of religion.
Yeah.
It started in January.
It true in general,

835
00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.690
but,
and you have,
you wrote something recently that I read where you were,
uh,

836
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.780
really,
uh,
it seemed like he just had,

837
00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:08.640
had a really frustrating moment or you release yourself with your,

838
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:11.700
your writing about academia.
What,
what,
what did you say?

839
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.020
That there's nothing like having an open letter to an academic college and um,

840
00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:20.920
and quilting Tupac,
fuck you and fuck you on your motherfucking mom.

841
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:24.250
Cause that what you did,
that's the end of the longer life.

842
00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.260
It sounds so beautiful with your accent though.
There's a lot of people that go,

843
00:47:29.261 --> 00:47:30.010
hey man,
who's that guy was

844
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.260
<v 4>sounds like GSP.
I think you sound like GSP,</v>

845
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:34.030
which is ridiculous because I don't think,

846
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.980
I don't say it's branch around the same thing.
Well that's Americans for you man.

847
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:40.100
Anything that's not long ago I spoke,

848
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:44.290
well I don't even know some fucking French or some shit got could be speaking in

849
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:48.220
Arabic.
He's fucking French ended up over the,
I think I told you that before.

850
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:51.730
What type of guy he asked me,
how are you from?
It's like,
Oh yeah,
for me,

851
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:55.180
you are from Italy?
No Way.
I was just in Paris last week.

852
00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.170
Oh Wow.
I live on earth.

853
00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.750
So when you wrote this and you quote a Tupac in this open letter to academia,

854
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:09.580
what was your,
what was the,
well just tell us what the letter said I was,

855
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:14.320
that was just for the straight and which is most of the time I'm not because I'm

856
00:48:14.321 --> 00:48:16.330
hanging out with students and students are awesome.

857
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:20.380
Know 99% of my students have a great time hanging out.
They are fun,

858
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:22.870
makes good for conversation.
That's the part of school I like.

859
00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:28.250
I'm frustrated by all the rest the administration on and um,

860
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.150
bullshit that's around.

861
00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:35.010
I mean I notice my teaching students that are always ecstatic.

862
00:48:35.011 --> 00:48:37.750
Oh man you are doing such a good job.
Sometime I'm like really?

863
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:40.390
Cause I was having a really shitty day and I feel like I gave you a crap.

864
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.730
That's good.
Yeah.
Yeah this is awesome.

865
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.710
But then I look in the next class and they look at what a regular teaching look

866
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:50.830
like and it makes you want to shoot yourself cause it's dry as hell.

867
00:48:50.831 --> 00:48:53.260
There's no attempt to connect it to real life.

868
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:57.100
There's academia is like its own little,
that box for the most part.

869
00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.400
And the only reason why people read academic stuff is because somebody is

870
00:49:00.401 --> 00:49:04.540
forcing them to because nobody's going to go out and buy the book and spend it

871
00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:05.350
on Saturday night.

872
00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:10.350
You know the problem we took a demia is that these populated 90% by people who

873
00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:14.590
spend their Saturday night to shine in their PhDs and devising new ways to

874
00:49:14.591 --> 00:49:19.580
squeeze or joy out of learning because that's what they do or really know is it

875
00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:22.150
that they don't really want to squeeze all the joy out of learning.

876
00:49:22.151 --> 00:49:25.620
They just are not motivated to make learning more exciting is that I think is

877
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:26.290
what they are.

878
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:30.070
They are joyous mother fuckers and so they transmit that to their students and

879
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:34.540
they don't know how to think in any other way and off it is the institution part

880
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:37.300
of it is the repetition,
pirate of it,
whatever that may be,

881
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:38.770
but theirs is part of it.

882
00:49:38.771 --> 00:49:43.020
Just the idea of just going to school for a long time yourself and you,

883
00:49:43.021 --> 00:49:45.040
you sort of get used to this fact,

884
00:49:45.041 --> 00:49:49.330
this cold hard fact that you have to do things you don't want to do and probably

885
00:49:49.331 --> 00:49:51.190
that I'm sure that does a lot to do with it.

886
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.910
You come to accept the norms of like in any field when the school doing to the

887
00:49:54.911 --> 00:49:57.790
field and they try to mold doing what the expert look like,

888
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.460
they are bicycle trying to squash your individuality.

889
00:50:00.461 --> 00:50:03.250
Exactly the things you were saying about joy in order to staff that makes you

890
00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:03.491
you,

891
00:50:03.491 --> 00:50:07.690
that's wild and weird and that all gets to be squashed in the name of becoming a

892
00:50:07.691 --> 00:50:12.030
professional and so that academia does that as well.
You know,
Grad School is a,

893
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:15.760
my nam being tortured or for the most part the world is going to be on

894
00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:16.594
newscasters.

895
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.250
It's going to be people with no real opinions that we'll never say anything that

896
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.180
would offend to anybody.

897
00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:26.950
They just fucking bullshit their way through life until their ticker stops.

898
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:28.040
But to give an

899
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.680
<v 6>idea of how low the berries about this stuff.</v>

900
00:50:30.681 --> 00:50:33.920
Cause that's exactly the scenario you're describing is exactly what happens.

901
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:38.390
To give an idea of how low the barriers or the first day of classes and any

902
00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:41.300
semester I teach,
first day I love going,

903
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:45.770
I'll put on a red hot chili peppers and I'll give out the syllabus.

904
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.770
Shaking hands with people.
Not a big deal.
Right?

905
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:53.660
All udds press play for some music and write who cans with another human being

906
00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:57.950
for two seconds hitch.
How many people are in your class?
Maybe 50 or something.

907
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.700
So you know,
five minutes of a song you get to shake hands with everybody.

908
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:05.300
Then you'll start,
before I even start,
I'm like 10 steps ahead.

909
00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.810
Cause people are like no professor ever shook my hand and I'm like are you

910
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:09.350
kidding me?

911
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:13.220
You know that's the big deal that a one press play music and shake hands before

912
00:51:13.221 --> 00:51:18.050
you even get started at Cetera.
Pirates.
Wow,
that's sad.
You know that's just,

913
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:19.011
but I've seen it.

914
00:51:19.011 --> 00:51:22.580
I mean I've cool tote with some people who first day of classes and they walk

915
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:25.490
into a class and I'm like,
hello students,

916
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:29.630
my name is doctor and right there for me the semester is over cause it's like

917
00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:33.440
your name is not doctor anything.
Your Dick,
your name is Joe,
whatever.
His like,

918
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:36.830
he already put on the title and put on this big better times to create a

919
00:51:36.831 --> 00:51:40.070
separation with students that smoothed out and my life,
I need to be a doctor.

920
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:44.000
Can I get an honorary doctorate somewhere?
I'm sure you're bumped.
Dr Rogan.

921
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:49.730
Does anybody out there?
Yeah,
it is a any distinction.
Mr Sir.
You know,

922
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:52.780
when I used to teach taekwondo,
everybody was Mr uh,

923
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.240
was Mr O'malley and Mr. Smith,
Mr. Kim,
you know,

924
00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.920
that's a very formal,
you have to,
whenever you know the address,
you yes sir.

925
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:05.810
No Sir.
It was always sir,
like a,
that's a,
that immediately puts that,

926
00:52:05.811 --> 00:52:09.020
that air of them being above you.
Yeah.
It's very cultish,

927
00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:13.760
a lot of a martial arts behavior and it's managed in a good way.

928
00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:16.280
So it's beneficial and,
and you know,
it's good for your character,

929
00:52:16.281 --> 00:52:19.550
but that same aspects of it easily can be manipulated.

930
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:23.780
And we all know martial arts instructors who wound up manipulating their

931
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:26.020
students.
You're a martial artist as well.
I should add worse.
Um,

932
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.500
and you have been for a long time.

933
00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.440
[inaudible] we all know like there's always stories of like,

934
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:33.380
it's always like a guys molesting his students.

935
00:52:33.381 --> 00:52:36.320
Like a young teenage girl that's like,
you know,

936
00:52:36.321 --> 00:52:39.140
learning under him or you know,
uh,

937
00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.310
that kind of a situation like very similar to the type of situations where you

938
00:52:43.311 --> 00:52:47.000
would have like preachers would do something like that or poor professors,
right.

939
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:51.140
There's always professors that are banging their students and scandals will rise

940
00:52:51.141 --> 00:52:53.780
where they give preferential treatment to girls who give head.

941
00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.670
It's a,
it's,
it's a story as old as time.
Right.

942
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:03.090
I'm going to keep my mouth shut about that.
Come on,
come on site.

943
00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:08.150
A Beautiful Guy.
You've got a great accent.
Not to kick a little ass.

944
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:12.740
I bet they throw it at you son.
There was one of ds was the bus the weird,

945
00:53:12.741 --> 00:53:16.600
I laughed for like an hour after that.
There was a,
at the end of the semester,

946
00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.400
I mean I'm an easy grader as a tease.

947
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:22.730
I give A's left and right and there was these girls who really did horrible and

948
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:26.430
there was nothing I could do to push her up.
He's,
you really fucked up.
I mean,

949
00:53:26.431 --> 00:53:29.970
you're getting,
yeah,
I forgot to see with me,
which is magical.
You didn't do shit.

950
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.670
It's like,
really?
And I kid you not.
She's like,

951
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.990
what do I need to do for the higher grade?
And I'm like [inaudible].

952
00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.830
I'm like still trying to check or where she's going.
Then I went by,

953
00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.640
she looks at me and she's like,
oh,
come on.
You know you want

954
00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:51.120
dude,
my Dick would have exploded my pants.
Like a firecracker

955
00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.270
probably bled out from my deck.
You should,

956
00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.610
you should have called her bluff and just shoved your finger right up.

957
00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.910
What do you think?
Um,
first of all,
what she looked like?
No,

958
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:10.790
unfortunately she wasn't taught
shit.
Like why was she so confident?

959
00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:13.950
Why not?
She was super hot.
I don't want to ruin your fun.
Oh,

960
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:17.460
you ruined it or running.
Sorry.
My memory is not that bad.

961
00:54:17.461 --> 00:54:21.660
She was in a wheelchair.
Dammit.
Dude.
How much did she weigh?

962
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:25.590
At least she have a nice body.
Yeah,
she wasn't big.
She wasn't big.
She was,
um,

963
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:29.570
she wasn't big regular size.
Size wise.
She was okay.

964
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:32.910
That was the only one.
Your entire academic career.
No,
no.
I mean,

965
00:54:32.911 --> 00:54:37.590
but that wasn't the most like don't be silly jokes.
That was the most,

966
00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.680
that was blatant and fun.
You know what I mean?
Right,
right,
right.

967
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.830
Well are cool about it.
You know,
they are flirting with you,
but it's,
it's polite.

968
00:54:46.831 --> 00:54:50.760
It's,
that was,
and he wasn't even about flirted.
He was,
I want the higher grade.

969
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:55.620
That's it.
She didn't give up on any level,
you know?
That's Hilarious,

970
00:54:55.621 --> 00:54:58.830
man.
Do you,
uh,
are you like cognizant of that?

971
00:54:58.831 --> 00:55:02.250
Like when you talk to girls like that you have this unfair advantage over them

972
00:55:02.251 --> 00:55:05.640
as a,
as a professor?
I mean,
bottom line is they don't want to be a dick.

973
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.960
You don't want to be a dick with anybody.
So I break the rules all the time,

974
00:55:09.961 --> 00:55:11.670
but kind of like what you were saying about Julie's like,

975
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:16.410
nobody's ever going to get hurt by me so that I break rules to me doesn't mean

976
00:55:16.411 --> 00:55:18.760
shit because they must be stupid rules if nobody gets served.

977
00:55:18.761 --> 00:55:21.200
If I break them down,
why are the roads to be gain weight?
You know?

978
00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:25.560
Because we need bureaucracy.
People employed,
so all that crap about,
oh,

979
00:55:25.561 --> 00:55:28.830
you're not supposed to hug your students because that would be sexual harassment

980
00:55:28.831 --> 00:55:31.350
or some shit.
I thought that ignore it.
But at the same time,
yeah,

981
00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.340
you want to hurt anybody.
Just hugging people.

982
00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:38.880
How many teachers wind up bang and girls in class?
Because obviously as I said,

983
00:55:38.881 --> 00:55:41.580
illegal.
Oh Wow.
It's highly,
they lose their job immediately.

984
00:55:41.581 --> 00:55:45.660
Do they really like 23 dof shit.

985
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.180
Tough Shit.
You can't bang.
Your students know.
I mean,

986
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:50.800
it's absolutely illegal if you're talking to high school or something when you

987
00:55:50.801 --> 00:55:54.240
were talking to under age,
but I'm talking to college students.

988
00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.590
I'm calling and talking to people in their twenties it's legal,

989
00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.680
but so nobody's going to put you in jail or something.

990
00:55:58.681 --> 00:56:01.820
But you're going to get fired by your university recently against their policy.

991
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.870
Big tits.
What does she's hot as fuck.
No,
for real.
She's like Pamela Anderson.

992
00:56:06.871 --> 00:56:09.680
Look in and you know,
and you're like,
look,
I'm saying those,
he's singled.

993
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.320
I taught her some English.
She's talking like,
oh you should,

994
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.150
you should be my lawyer.
But it seems like you know,

995
00:56:15.151 --> 00:56:17.430
just because you're teaching somebody,
I mean,
what if you give her a B?

996
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:20.970
I give her a fucking bay.
Come on.
Not even being unreasonable.

997
00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:25.580
There are standard you can't date while class is in session.
Oh,
okay.

998
00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:29.650
You know,
the 16 weeks or whatever and on our,
the symmetrics.
Exactly.

999
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.720
What would you stay there after class was lower cost is over.

1000
00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:34.420
We're going to meet the next group of kids.

1001
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:38.590
Hopefully there's another hot 23 year old and to keep this party rolling there.

1002
00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:42.400
Bunch of Cock blockers.
That's what it is.
No,
you can't.
You really can't.

1003
00:56:42.401 --> 00:56:43.570
You can't bang your students.
Right.

1004
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:46.630
What about dudes and they a lot of Bang dudes.
Like,
what if there's a,
you know,

1005
00:56:46.631 --> 00:56:50.650
you're gay and you got to some gay kids or some really gullible straight dudes

1006
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:55.150
that are willing to,
is that a,

1007
00:56:55.151 --> 00:57:00.130
is that the same thing with boys too fellows?
Unfortunate.

1008
00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:02.900
Silly.
That's just fucking goddammit it,

1009
00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:05.770
she wouldn't it be great if we just had teachers.
It wouldn't do anything creepy.

1010
00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:10.160
You know,
wouldn't that'd be like way simpler right now.
We'd be,

1011
00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:12.433
that's not going to happen.

1012
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:17.550
Is it possible to ever get to a position where you have uh,

1013
00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:22.590
an an enlightened group of people that are teaching students in like this open

1014
00:57:22.851 --> 00:57:26.860
and friendly way where we actually have a group of people that come out of these

1015
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:30.600
classes and can contribute to society?
Is that possible?
Like you,
you're,

1016
00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.820
you're in the inside,
right?
Um,
I dunno man.

1017
00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:37.360
Cause the point is for good teaching means it's where you are.

1018
00:57:37.361 --> 00:57:40.450
It's not as Keel that you pick up because you were read enough books or some

1019
00:57:40.451 --> 00:57:41.284
shit.
It's buyer.

1020
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:44.800
Adobe is an extension of who you are and do you do it in a certain way so you

1021
00:57:44.801 --> 00:57:48.010
can design the perfect university,
the perfect college,

1022
00:57:48.011 --> 00:57:49.330
the perfect teaching environment.

1023
00:57:49.331 --> 00:57:53.800
The reality is it all boils down to WHO's in there,
why are the people there?

1024
00:57:53.801 --> 00:57:56.800
Because that's what makes all the difference no matter how you design it.

1025
00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.010
If you have the perfect set up with the wrong people,
it's not going to work.

1026
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:01.500
That's his case with everything.
Right?
Yeah,

1027
00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.190
and it's always amazing to me like when you show up at a place and it's like one

1028
00:58:06.191 --> 00:58:11.191
place and they'll like a specialize in cheese and you go there and everyone's a

1029
00:58:11.411 --> 00:58:15.100
cheese expert and they're all like super knowledgeable and they're really nice

1030
00:58:15.101 --> 00:58:19.390
and friendly and it's like a small family business and all the pieces are in

1031
00:58:19.391 --> 00:58:22.750
place.
Like how is this even possible?
How can,

1032
00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:26.590
how can you get like this perfect environment even if it's just a small cheese

1033
00:58:26.591 --> 00:58:30.550
store and is it possible to get that on a grand scale like a university?

1034
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:35.350
But that's why even the singles molar case is usually works during that first

1035
00:58:35.351 --> 00:58:37.900
generation with the energy of the people who put it in there,

1036
00:58:37.901 --> 00:58:39.130
who made the place amazing.

1037
00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:42.670
Rarely you're going to go with three generations down the road and the same

1038
00:58:42.671 --> 00:58:45.730
thing is going to be going on and that seems to be because they didn't have to

1039
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:46.630
work for it.
Right.

1040
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:50.950
It's sort of like us bio strategies that and partially is also who they are.

1041
00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:51.970
They probably they don't,

1042
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:55.300
they are not as creative or they are not as funny or there's not as smart or

1043
00:58:55.301 --> 00:58:58.360
they are not as whatever and somebody else down the road is not going to be

1044
00:58:58.361 --> 00:59:01.240
because you're not going to have degeneration and after generations of perfect

1045
00:59:01.241 --> 00:59:05.450
people and is it's individual in that sense.
Yeah.
I've,

1046
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:08.920
when I look at people and when I look at like the,
the,

1047
00:59:08.921 --> 00:59:13.921
the greater sort of a historical picture that we have of the human race and you

1048
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:17.890
see all these like sort of peaks and valleys and peaks and valleys of

1049
00:59:17.891 --> 00:59:22.460
civilization and decline it,
it seems to me like it's really

1050
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:27.460
<v 0>hard for people to figure something out and then pass it on to other people with</v>

1051
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:32.270
the same impact as them figuring it out themselves.
So you have like all this,

1052
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:36.470
all these accomplishments of the people that came before you would like running

1053
00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:38.120
water and electricity and,

1054
00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.240
but yet they're being enjoyed by people that don't even understand them a little

1055
00:59:41.241 --> 00:59:44.710
bit and really can't like,

1056
00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:49.890
can't appreciate the position of excellence and amazement that you really should

1057
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:53.970
be in,
in this,
in,
in the,
in this 2012 arrows,
you know,

1058
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:56.640
<v 4>imagine if we are like in a post apocalyptic scenario,</v>

1059
00:59:56.650 --> 01:00:01.070
somebody tried to is born after that and you have to explain what society now

1060
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:02.600
was like.
It was like,
yeah,
you know,

1061
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:05.880
we could talk into this microphone and there were like half a million people at

1062
01:00:05.881 --> 01:00:10.050
least in,
in across.
It's like how,
how,
what exactly.
No Way.

1063
01:00:10.051 --> 01:00:12.820
It's because the Internet,
I don't know,
assumption

1064
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:15.890
<v 0>what people don't understand is how easy that could happen.</v>

1065
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:20.050
And we could go right back to way the way things were just a few hundred years

1066
01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:24.700
ago.
That's a small,
small skip.
But it's easy.

1067
01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:29.300
It's really easy.
It's what we have is so fragile.
I think there,
cause you know,

1068
01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:32.710
they see something like Katrina and they sort of get a sense of it.

1069
01:00:32.711 --> 01:00:37.090
They see a sandy hurricane sandy and the weeks without power of,

1070
01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:39.220
I think opened up a lot of people's eyes at this.

1071
01:00:39.221 --> 01:00:43.180
This motherfucker's way more fragile than you think.
It's we,
we,

1072
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.350
we have a very,

1073
01:00:44.351 --> 01:00:49.240
very fragile sort of thin veil of civilization

1074
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:51.830
<v 4>that we,
we live under the illusion of.</v>

1075
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.560
I mean even if you look at something as simple as oil,

1076
01:00:54.561 --> 01:00:58.460
which we base our old civilization on the routes,
on oil right now,
oil.
I mean,

1077
01:00:58.461 --> 01:01:01.250
we know that he's not going to last that long.
We don't know exactly how long.

1078
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.670
It could be a sanctuary,
which case,
you know,
it doesn't affect us.

1079
01:01:04.671 --> 01:01:07.670
It could be who the hell knows.
But the bottom line is it's running out.

1080
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:11.240
They will affect your grandchildren.
Yeah.
Big Time after he's gone.

1081
01:01:11.241 --> 01:01:14.540
But at the same time we haven't even gotten a good substitute.

1082
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:19.180
And so it's like we're running on this honor society where right now it's,

1083
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:22.790
it's on at that train,
you know?
Is that in somewhere where there's no,

1084
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:26.860
unless somebody figure something out,
you know,
I think that,
yeah,

1085
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:31.310
we actually had this discussion yesterday,
the idea of the race.
There's a race,

1086
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:34.090
like the society is running out of resources and we're,
we're

1087
01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:39.370
<v 0>living in this crazy sort of still this barbaric conquer or sort of a way,</v>

1088
01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.280
uh,
stealing resources from other nations.
But at the same time,

1089
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:47.760
technology and the connectedness of human beings is reaching like epic level

1090
01:01:47.761 --> 01:01:49.510
that has never reached before.
And it's what,

1091
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.390
one of the reasons why it's making it so much more difficult to govern because

1092
01:01:53.391 --> 01:01:54.320
it's,
it's really hard to,

1093
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:56.640
<v 4>should people,
oh man,
I got a story for you.</v>

1094
01:01:56.670 --> 01:02:00.300
This is going to be blew my mind the other day when I got these emails,
I was,

1095
01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:04.470
I'm speaking off your body's ability to connect with people on a greater scale

1096
01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:09.360
and all of that day are mentioning,
I got an email maybe four or five days ago,

1097
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:13.830
um,
when the very beginning of days,
rarely Palestinian thing that just started.

1098
01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.670
I get these emails from this guy in Israel who tells me he just ran into a bomb

1099
01:02:17.671 --> 01:02:22.590
shelter and just hanging out there for the time being.
And he has,
he say,

1100
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:25.150
you know,
I have enough food or enough water,
but uh,

1101
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:30.120
what I'm doing to kill time in the meantime is Joe Rogan Experience Duncan

1102
01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.990
Trussell podcast and a and my and [inaudible] and my podcast.
And I was like,

1103
01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:34.681
fuck,

1104
01:02:34.681 --> 01:02:38.430
really are in a bunker in Israel with missiles flying and you're telling me that

1105
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:42.270
that already blows my mind.
Now a day later or two days or something,

1106
01:02:42.271 --> 01:02:43.620
I got an email from some guy,

1107
01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:48.480
Palestinian guy who lives in France who tells me all about,
oh,

1108
01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:51.990
I like this thing you did that are,
and then she started getting about,
you know,

1109
01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:56.090
I'm really freaked out about my family in Gaza.
I'm super scared.
Uh,
and uh,

1110
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:56.850
you know,

1111
01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:00.240
you might want to know that what I'm doing right now to be able to chill out a

1112
01:03:00.241 --> 01:03:03.360
second and not freak out about these things is,
and listening to you,

1113
01:03:03.361 --> 01:03:05.490
I'm listening to rogue and I'm restating to trust it.
I'm like,

1114
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:08.850
you've gotta be fucking kidding me.
Right.
One Israeli guy,

1115
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:13.210
one Palestinian guy basically telling me the exact same thing.
Whoa.
I see.

1116
01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.380
He didn't even know what to say.
You know,
he was,

1117
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.810
<v 0>Holy Shit.
Yeah,
that's exactly,
yeah.</v>

1118
01:03:21.811 --> 01:03:26.520
With youthful societies,
uh,
in the,
in this day and age,
like the,

1119
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:28.760
the youth of societies in this day and age,
they,
they,

1120
01:03:28.761 --> 01:03:33.300
they have a perspective that really was never achievable before.

1121
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.900
And they have,
uh,
uh,
an access to,

1122
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.450
to things like podcasts and the Internet and websites.
And there's,

1123
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:45.330
there's not as much difference between people's,
it used to be,
it's just not,

1124
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:50.400
I mean,
in that way.
I mean,
you know,
as far as like there's not,

1125
01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:54.780
it's hard to sell people on the idea of an enemy that you don't even know that

1126
01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:55.614
you never met.

1127
01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:59.450
<v 4>And that's the beauty of globalization in a cultural level.</v>

1128
01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:03.350
Economic level is the Fed that yet and nationalities and he's going to go down

1129
01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:07.490
or these bullshit stereotypes about the people from across any border will

1130
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.770
become easier to know.
Real shit throw.

1131
01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.580
I made up facts that nobody got to test anyway cause you never got to see them.

1132
01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:14.381
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1133
01:04:14.381 --> 01:04:18.580
It's funny how like everyone's scared of like the idea of the new world order.

1134
01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:22.930
You know,
everybody's scared of the idea of one global government.

1135
01:04:22.931 --> 01:04:27.010
Like I remember there was this big thing,
uh,
McCaffrey on a side,

1136
01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:30.340
his name on CNN was talking about,
uh,

1137
01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.990
the marrow that we're going to merge with Mexico and Canada and that's why

1138
01:04:34.991 --> 01:04:36.160
they're crashing the economy.

1139
01:04:36.161 --> 01:04:40.390
In order for us to come up with an a marrow and the way of one currency for the

1140
01:04:40.391 --> 01:04:43.540
entire region.
And like how,
how was that fucking you?

1141
01:04:43.541 --> 01:04:45.430
Any less than you're getting fucked now.

1142
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:47.290
Like you're going to really trip out about that.

1143
01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:51.310
Like is if we had one world government would really be any less fair than it was

1144
01:04:51.311 --> 01:04:53.900
crazy government that we operate under.
You know what,

1145
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:58.300
what would be different for Bradley manning the dude who released on wikileaks

1146
01:04:58.301 --> 01:04:59.740
documents?
If it's one world government,

1147
01:04:59.741 --> 01:05:04.741
would he still be in jail with no access to people or you know,

1148
01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:09.480
naked in a fucking cell?
What would be different?
Yeah,

1149
01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:12.850
it seems like one Tottenham obey would be the same with Guantanamo Bay.

1150
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.470
Be the same.
If it was one world government,

1151
01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:17.980
I mean it was like if we really want to ourselves like

1152
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.430
<v 1>the,
the,
the shining hope for civilization.</v>

1153
01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:23.410
How do we have something like Guantanamo Bay?

1154
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:26.060
How do we take these dudes and you know,

1155
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:30.010
put blindfolds on him and fucking dog collar on behind their hands.

1156
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:34.670
<v 4>You know,
one other thing that cracks me up about,
well maybe could me up.</v>

1157
01:05:34.671 --> 01:05:36.860
He's the wrong water enough.
They're mentioning one time about my buddy.

1158
01:05:36.861 --> 01:05:37.430
In any case,

1159
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:42.430
the one of the things that's weird to me is I'll take an example of the United

1160
01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:47.030
States government people that are either flagwaving we are the greatest country

1161
01:05:47.031 --> 01:05:51.110
on earth kind of shit.
Or usually when they start finding out that no,

1162
01:05:51.111 --> 01:05:54.140
it's not all beautiful and you start finding out,

1163
01:05:54.141 --> 01:05:55.770
oh we just up in Tequila a few on there,

1164
01:05:55.771 --> 01:05:59.150
thousand Indians and his Labor bunch of people and uh,
you know,

1165
01:05:59.151 --> 01:06:02.630
set up a military coup in Chilean needle,
the sheet in Guatemala,
you know,

1166
01:06:02.631 --> 01:06:06.740
all of the ugly stuff of American history.
People flip and they were like,

1167
01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:10.760
the only evil in the world is the US government and everybody else who's against

1168
01:06:10.761 --> 01:06:13.570
it must be nice.
So if some crazy fundamentalist is nice,
no,

1169
01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:16.160
they're just misunderstood the real,
it's like,
fuck man,

1170
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:19.700
it's not all black and white.
There's not that.
There's all that good guys,

1171
01:06:19.701 --> 01:06:20.780
bad guys stories.

1172
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:25.310
He gets more complicated and that's why people are terrified of someone like

1173
01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.820
that American Taliban guy that decides the United States is evil and is going to

1174
01:06:28.821 --> 01:06:33.020
join the Taliban.
You know,
it's like people,

1175
01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:35.210
they have a very simplistic view of the world.

1176
01:06:35.211 --> 01:06:40.211
It's shaped by fiction and fiction is ruined many a mind to the complexities of

1177
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:45.350
the actual real reality that we live in because most fiction is being

1178
01:06:45.351 --> 01:06:49.610
distributed in a way that I don't think that the human brain is designed to

1179
01:06:49.611 --> 01:06:54.590
process like the idea of movies that the human,
yeah,

1180
01:06:54.591 --> 01:06:54.690
human

1181
01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:57.390
<v 1>body does not know what the fuck to do with movies.</v>

1182
01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.300
And that's one of the reasons why they're so amazing to us.

1183
01:07:00.301 --> 01:07:04.140
When you go see something like Avatar and then you leave the theater and you

1184
01:07:04.141 --> 01:07:06.570
have avatar depression,
like that Shit's real.

1185
01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:11.590
Like people have avatar depression because they wished that life could be like

1186
01:07:11.851 --> 01:07:16.620
it is in Navea.
Wherever the fuck it is.
Where is it?
Navea yeah,

1187
01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:20.430
it guess what?
It's not even really Navea.
Okay.
You Fuck Navi as not real,

1188
01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.640
goddammit.
But it's,

1189
01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:26.070
we imitate our atmospheres were set up to do that.
You know,

1190
01:07:26.071 --> 01:07:28.770
if I live in a tribe and Danieli bull,
Ellie's there,

1191
01:07:28.771 --> 01:07:31.680
I want to listen to Danieli Bilali cause this is guys who has got the

1192
01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:35.220
information.
He's the head of the tribe that's follow him and he,

1193
01:07:35.221 --> 01:07:36.570
we can learn from him and it,

1194
01:07:36.571 --> 01:07:40.620
it allows us to learn things without having to fucking risk getting eaten by

1195
01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:44.370
boars ourselves.
Like we understand that we get the knowledge of that from you,

1196
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:44.731
we,

1197
01:07:44.731 --> 01:07:47.980
and then we see things and we see things like some something happens to somebody

1198
01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:49.830
and it's a shocking thing and you learn from it.

1199
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.970
You see drama and all these different various things that were set up.

1200
01:07:53.971 --> 01:07:58.971
We have like all these reward systems in our mind and our body in our,

1201
01:07:59.701 --> 01:07:59.971
in our,

1202
01:07:59.971 --> 01:08:03.420
on our human system that are set up to sort of interpret all these different

1203
01:08:03.421 --> 01:08:06.480
things that are happening in the world and place them in a way that allows you

1204
01:08:06.481 --> 01:08:09.540
to stay alive the longest to breed the most effectively.

1205
01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:13.890
But when you sit someone down in front of a movie screen,

1206
01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:16.010
all those and all

1207
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.170
<v 0>those brew award systems and all those,</v>

1208
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:23.350
all those different things that you have that have passed human beings from

1209
01:08:23.811 --> 01:08:26.810
generation to generation until they've gotten to this point.

1210
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:31.390
All those things that are set up to reward you for certain things in the,

1211
01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:36.540
in the material world are being manipulated by giant HD screens and THX sound

1212
01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:42.941
and fucking perfectly written scripts and special effects and CGI and then you

1213
01:08:44.751 --> 01:08:47.630
know,
you really think that there's fucking good guys and bad guys out there.

1214
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:50.690
You start,
you know thinking and this is America.
Okay.

1215
01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:53.340
And these colors don't ruin you start,
you start getting,

1216
01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:58.030
<v 6>that's why I like mod there like the last decade or two of television because</v>

1217
01:08:58.031 --> 01:09:01.870
he's changing the [inaudible].
You know,
you go from your traditional good guys,

1218
01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.780
bad guys story too.
Now you have,
you know,

1219
01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:08.790
shows like decks there where the hero is the serial killer or Brian or even

1220
01:09:09.401 --> 01:09:13.120
something like game of Thrones.
Yeah,
every bodies,

1221
01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.160
the good guys are awesome and they do horrendous things.
Okay,

1222
01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:17.240
I need the bed guys.

1223
01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:19.780
You hid their gods except that they do something really cool.

1224
01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:23.470
All of a sudden that throws you off and it's like,
that's more like life.

1225
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:26.620
Much more like life.
I started watching homeland last night.

1226
01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:28.660
Is it pretty fucking good?

1227
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:31.510
I had heard from a lot of people that it's really good.
They said,
dude,

1228
01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:34.630
that's like a movie every week.
It's like a really good movie every week.

1229
01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.610
And I heard from so many different people,
I was like,
okay,

1230
01:09:36.611 --> 01:09:40.450
I got to give this a shot.
So I watched the pilot last night.
It's fucking good.

1231
01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.160
That dude,
I don't know.
I should,

1232
01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:46.100
I should Google it because I don't know homeboy's name.
Uh,
whoever the guy is,

1233
01:09:46.101 --> 01:09:50.530
just the lead.
That guy was in a,
that Stephen King movie,
Dream Catcher,

1234
01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:56.200
really good movie for about three quarters of the movie and then fucking falls

1235
01:09:56.201 --> 01:09:59.590
apart all over itself.
Shit's all over itself.
But,
uh,

1236
01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:03.760
the guy who's the lead guy is,
uh,
the same dude.

1237
01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:07.210
What is his name?
And Damian Lewis,
he's one of those guys.

1238
01:10:07.211 --> 01:10:10.480
He's seen him in a million fucking movies,
a million TV shows,

1239
01:10:10.481 --> 01:10:14.560
but you don't know who the hell he is.
You know,
he's,
he's been in everything.

1240
01:10:14.561 --> 01:10:19.210
But that guy going to act as fucking ass off and it's a,
that other chick,

1241
01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.710
um,
what is her name?

1242
01:10:20.711 --> 01:10:24.880
Claire Danes who plays crazy very well.

1243
01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:28.630
It's pretty fucking good,
dude.
It's all good.
Show.
Just started it last night.

1244
01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:32.350
I've been addicted to the walking dead the lately.
Yeah.

1245
01:10:32.351 --> 01:10:36.190
Donkin can't stop talking about that shit.
It's not enough days in the world,
man.

1246
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:39.790
Don't enough time to be sitting around watching all this amazing shit that

1247
01:10:39.791 --> 01:10:44.210
people are producing.
That was big enough TV.
But all of these is a pale,
you know,

1248
01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:47.800
it's,
it's tiny steps preparing you for the real shit.

1249
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:52.090
The day when he in 2030 or whatever and and die.

1250
01:10:52.091 --> 01:10:55.210
We'll sit down to read the real corn the way it's supposed to be done for

1251
01:10:55.211 --> 01:10:59.080
television.
That would be the good day.
Yeah.
I think we're doing it now,
man.

1252
01:10:59.081 --> 01:11:03.880
I'm just doing this and doing,
I mean this is a like this,

1253
01:11:03.881 --> 01:11:07.890
this,
this forum,
the complete open free form,

1254
01:11:07.891 --> 01:11:12.740
like a real complete open free forum,
right?
This is what has been missing in our,

1255
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.280
in our for a long

1256
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.113
<v 0>fucking time,</v>

1257
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:20.240
you could not get any mass mass distributed product,

1258
01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:23.610
whether it was a television show or radio show,

1259
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:28.790
you really couldn't get anything that had as few rules as what podcasts have and

1260
01:11:29.641 --> 01:11:32.640
have the ease of distribution the way they have.

1261
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:35.550
I mean like we were talking to my guy and Palestine and the guy in Israel and

1262
01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:39.690
he's listening to these podcasts in a,
in a bunker.
It's fucking crazy that this,

1263
01:11:39.691 --> 01:11:40.740
that didn't exist before.

1264
01:11:40.741 --> 01:11:44.520
There's no way for those guys to be exposed to all these,
uh,

1265
01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:48.210
different ideas and expose us to all these different ideas to just one of the

1266
01:11:48.211 --> 01:11:52.440
cooler things about what's,
um,
going on with this,

1267
01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.290
this experience of podcasting and social media.

1268
01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.620
It's for me personally is that it's very much a two way street.

1269
01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:01.240
Like I get a lot of uh,

1270
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:05.400
feedback and a lot of information,

1271
01:12:05.401 --> 01:12:08.580
a lot of fuel from the people in social media,

1272
01:12:08.581 --> 01:12:13.230
like just from articles to read or interesting points that someone might have,

1273
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:15.270
whether they disagreed with me or you know,

1274
01:12:15.271 --> 01:12:18.540
whether they had an alternative point of view that you might also want to

1275
01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:22.440
consider this.
Like a lot of fucking likeminded.
Cool,

1276
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.760
interesting people are out.

1277
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:27.010
<v 4>No,
you bet man.
I actually,
without kissing your ass,</v>

1278
01:12:27.011 --> 01:12:31.300
but I have to thank you to no end because ever seen being on your podcast the

1279
01:12:31.301 --> 01:12:35.830
first time and then jumping on Duncan's boat [inaudible] you really opened up my

1280
01:12:35.831 --> 01:12:37.450
word exactly to what you're saying.

1281
01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.620
Realizing that there are a bunch of people around the world who may be,
you know,

1282
01:12:41.621 --> 01:12:45.250
the weird freak of the lethal place or they leave where the doesn't mix with

1283
01:12:45.251 --> 01:12:46.084
everyone else.

1284
01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:50.620
But thanks to internet you can click and connect with the greater,

1285
01:12:50.621 --> 01:12:53.740
bigger word that it's awesome.
What put you in touch with,
do you know?

1286
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:57.730
In many ways without sounding too flamboyantly really makes me feel better about

1287
01:12:57.731 --> 01:13:02.260
humanity.
Finding out that that stuff is out there.
So it's a,

1288
01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.090
I don't know,
man.
I think he's a,

1289
01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.900
it really blew my mind after being on your show the first time and then being

1290
01:13:07.901 --> 01:13:12.190
invited again and we're beginning to realize that there are other ways of

1291
01:13:12.191 --> 01:13:15.700
communicating beside the ones I'm familiar with and the effect that it has on

1292
01:13:15.701 --> 01:13:18.810
people,
the real effect,
you know,
real shit that people,
those are the best.

1293
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:22.780
I'll show you when people try to staff net app and to them how they dealt with

1294
01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:27.040
or out something random that you saved in five minutes on a podcast effect that

1295
01:13:27.041 --> 01:13:30.460
somebody now strategy and that was a huge thing for their life.
And you're like,

1296
01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.360
is like the most humbling thing in the world.
You know,
it's really,

1297
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:38.170
it's beautiful while we sit there at that impact on your life,

1298
01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:40.440
it just makes you thankful,
you know?

1299
01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.210
<v 0>Oh,
100%.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm incredibly thankful,
you know?
And I'm thankful to you.
Uh,</v>

1300
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:49.050
if,
if it wasn't for people like you that I have these interesting conversations

1301
01:13:49.051 --> 01:13:52.040
with,
I wouldn't be able to do this either.
If it was just me by myself,
I would,

1302
01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:54.000
I repeat the same stories with guests.

1303
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.340
Imagine leave and myself this podcast with suck,

1304
01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:00.630
you know I need need people to talk to and that's part of the beauty of having a

1305
01:14:00.631 --> 01:14:02.250
podcast is that it,

1306
01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:07.350
if you look at human consciousness as sort of a like almost like you know those,

1307
01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:11.000
the computer programs brains,
you know,
where you know what you,

1308
01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:11.980
you just have a thought and then

1309
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.520
<v 1>all these branches off of thought.
A lot of comedians use them to organize data,</v>

1310
01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:20.800
organize jokes and,
and and segways and stuff like that.
If you look at the,
the,

1311
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:25.240
the human consciousness as one big sort of brain,

1312
01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:30.540
what we've essentially done by having hundreds and hundreds of hours of this

1313
01:14:31.991 --> 01:14:36.780
sort of open minded,
sometimes silly but honest and,
and,

1314
01:14:36.781 --> 01:14:37.041
and,

1315
01:14:37.041 --> 01:14:42.041
and the f friendly discussion is that you start this other branch and then boom,

1316
01:14:43.781 --> 01:14:46.270
these,
these things blossom off of his branch.

1317
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:50.100
Whether it's a Duncan Trussell podcasts or the Joey Diaz podcasts or Tom Segura

1318
01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:53.470
is podcasts with his wife.
Christina,
what,
whatever it is,
your podcast,

1319
01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:58.510
these are these branches break off and form their own branches.

1320
01:14:58.511 --> 01:14:59.360
And then it,

1321
01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:04.361
and then it sort of attracts this group of people who get all this positive

1322
01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:10.180
energy from these discussions and all of this positive feedback,
this,

1323
01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:14.650
this residence,
you know,
that you get from,

1324
01:15:14.651 --> 01:15:15.770
from all these people that are,

1325
01:15:15.771 --> 01:15:20.260
that are really feeling like excitement and joy and enjoyment from these

1326
01:15:20.261 --> 01:15:22.240
discussions.
And it really does improve their life.

1327
01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.090
That and that it like creates like a whole,

1328
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:29.010
it's almost like a sect of consciousness.
You know,
it's like we,
we,

1329
01:15:29.011 --> 01:15:30.880
we all know that what,
what we accept,

1330
01:15:30.881 --> 01:15:33.130
we all know that this is good for everybody.

1331
01:15:33.131 --> 01:15:36.520
We all know that there's a way to live life where you could be as friendly as

1332
01:15:36.521 --> 01:15:38.530
possible whenever you can.

1333
01:15:38.531 --> 01:15:41.110
And now it doesn't mean not calling people on their bullshit either.

1334
01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:44.170
Because by the way,
they need that.
And if someone calls you on your bullshit,

1335
01:15:44.171 --> 01:15:47.350
you should go take your fucking medicine.
Go,
you know what?
You're right.

1336
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:50.680
I was a Douche there.
I fucked up.
I didn't mean to do that,

1337
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.050
but it wasn't my intention.
That's,
uh,

1338
01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:57.850
that's one of the most interesting things about having a forum like that.

1339
01:15:57.851 --> 01:15:58.281
It's the,
the,

1340
01:15:58.281 --> 01:16:03.281
the ability to do that ability to create like some big just network of,

1341
01:16:05.731 --> 01:16:07.540
of human beings all connected to each other.

1342
01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.770
<v 4>Yeah.
Which is,
I mean,
it really do.</v>

1343
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:10.980
You are literally throwing a rock and the reports effect.

1344
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:14.530
You can't even begin to see them and when they do come back at you,
it's,

1345
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:15.250
it's amazing.

1346
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:19.660
It's really like the stories you get are like no fucking way really our

1347
01:16:19.661 --> 01:16:23.530
conversation in that particular day at that impact on,
it's weird man.

1348
01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:24.580
It's is really mind blowing.

1349
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:27.220
<v 1>Yeah.
It's totally unexpected to no,</v>

1350
01:16:27.230 --> 01:16:30.230
that's the weird part about it is it sort of happened completely organically.

1351
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:32.900
Just like this podcast happened completely organically.
I mean,

1352
01:16:32.901 --> 01:16:35.120
before this podcast I was just,
you know,

1353
01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:38.210
we were just doing stand up and I would write blogs a lot and you know,

1354
01:16:38.211 --> 01:16:42.470
and every now and then we would do,
uh,
we would do like a thing.

1355
01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:47.390
I think we did not Justin TV where we would,
uh,
put a laptop online and we'll,

1356
01:16:47.391 --> 01:16:51.710
I'll look through the web camera goes will boots,
you know,
it was really stupid,

1357
01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:52.993
but uh,

1358
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:57.290
this sort of slowly but surely turned into what it is now.

1359
01:16:57.291 --> 01:17:00.770
And now when I do these shows and I meet all these people that say,
oh,

1360
01:17:00.771 --> 01:17:04.730
changed their life and you know this,
I'm like,
okay,
all right.
I don't,

1361
01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:09.260
I don't know how it happened.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
But I obviously have an obligation.

1362
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:13.430
It's obviously a lot bigger than me.
Uh,
so I got to keep this,

1363
01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:16.310
keep this ball rolling.
But that's,
that's the way through because you know,

1364
01:17:16.311 --> 01:17:19.990
some people would see the exact same thing and feel like,
I'm like,
God damn,

1365
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.200
I have that effect on people.
I am so cool.
They're silly bitches.
I try to,

1366
01:17:24.201 --> 01:17:27.350
first of all,
I tried to bring as many other people through,

1367
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:30.110
like the way I described it as like we found a whole,

1368
01:17:30.111 --> 01:17:31.430
we found a hole in the fence,
right.

1369
01:17:31.431 --> 01:17:34.490
What I'm trying to do is bring as many cool people through the whole as
possible.

1370
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:39.130
And that that's to me one of the most important aspects of,

1371
01:17:39.131 --> 01:17:41.140
of the position.
Like when you,

1372
01:17:41.141 --> 01:17:42.950
when you're in a position where people are paying attention,

1373
01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:44.570
they're paying attention to you,

1374
01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:47.000
you should point out some stuff that you've seen,
you know,

1375
01:17:47.001 --> 01:17:49.640
whether it's really good,
bands are really funny,

1376
01:17:49.641 --> 01:17:54.470
people are really interesting things.
So my,
my whole approach to it,

1377
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.090
whether it's Twitter or anything,

1378
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:59.270
is constantly pointing out the things that I find fascinating.

1379
01:17:59.271 --> 01:18:02.930
And then I find interesting and I mean even that,
speaking of changing lives,

1380
01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:07.040
how many doors do you open that way for somebody who maybe,
you know,

1381
01:18:07.041 --> 01:18:10.120
he's exactly what we're just,
could I be nerdy?
Somebody was awesome at what they,

1382
01:18:10.121 --> 01:18:13.130
they're do they work hard?
They are sensitive,
they need that.

1383
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:18.270
But eiko flock one moment had opened one door that makes things happen for them.

1384
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:21.890
Yeah.
That,
that's with me too,
with all of us.
We all need that.

1385
01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.270
We all benefit from,

1386
01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:27.740
from opportunities and it's super important to provide opportunities if they're

1387
01:18:27.741 --> 01:18:31.670
there.
If you see,
you know,
like if I see someone like yourself,

1388
01:18:31.671 --> 01:18:34.670
that's a fascinating,
interesting guy.
Like you,
people need to hear you talk.

1389
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:39.500
Joey Diaz,
you know,
in any,
in any of these people that I bring myself around.

1390
01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.560
Um,
I think,
um,
this is,
uh,
it's,

1391
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:45.280
it's a very strange time and,
uh,

1392
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:49.100
there's not that many people that have that,
that ability.

1393
01:18:49.101 --> 01:18:51.710
There's not that many people that have that position.
No.
Sort of,

1394
01:18:51.711 --> 01:18:54.350
it's sort of like a Johnny Carson for the interview,
for the Internet.

1395
01:18:54.351 --> 01:18:55.184
You know what I mean?

1396
01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:58.790
Like Johnny Carson liquid introduce all these comedians to the world.

1397
01:18:58.810 --> 01:19:01.670
Yet when back in the day,
man,
if you've got on the Johnny Carson show,

1398
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:04.340
it was fucking gigantic for your careers.

1399
01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.180
Did you ever hear like how he was like kind of a jerk to most comics?

1400
01:19:08.181 --> 01:19:10.790
Like if he didn't like you,
he wouldn't even look at you.

1401
01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:13.580
He went and I heard a lot of that.
Yeah.

1402
01:19:13.581 --> 01:19:16.340
But also I've heard that he was amazing too.
A lot of people too.

1403
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:19.680
It makes me wonder like,
what would these people like that he was a jerk too.

1404
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.680
I don't know.
You know,
I don't,
you know,
I,

1405
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.380
I just used him as an example because he's,
he was always like the,

1406
01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:28.280
the guy who influenced,
uh,

1407
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:32.690
comedians the most like help comedians and Rodney Dangerfield was another one

1408
01:19:32.691 --> 01:19:33.530
like Rodney Dangerfield.

1409
01:19:33.531 --> 01:19:38.270
What he did was he figured out that one of the best things that he could do with

1410
01:19:38.271 --> 01:19:41.330
all of his fame was to introduce the world to other comedians.
Right.

1411
01:19:41.331 --> 01:19:43.040
So that's how we found out about dice clay.

1412
01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:44.960
That's how we found out about Sam Kennison.
He,

1413
01:19:44.961 --> 01:19:49.580
Rodney Dangerfield was like the best at helping other people out and introducing

1414
01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:52.070
the world to all these other talented people.

1415
01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:56.430
And that goes back to what you are saying.
You know,
somebody may get Jellos Shit.

1416
01:19:56.431 --> 01:19:59.720
He's like,
you are gaining papa the IRD.
She is going to take it away from me.

1417
01:19:59.721 --> 01:20:02.690
You're a competitor.
I need to squash you.
And that's,
you know,

1418
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:08.280
pretty solid stand.
It's defeat in India.
And I had those feelings,

1419
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:12.050
<v 6>especially when I was a younger man,
for sure.
I was jealous of a,</v>

1420
01:20:12.051 --> 01:20:14.910
a lot of people that were better than me and things.
Uh,

1421
01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:17.410
it was just because it was dumb and I didn't understand what,

1422
01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:21.450
what would the sensation was in my mind and what the sensation was.
In my mind.

1423
01:20:21.451 --> 01:20:25.320
It was a,
it was a drive to be better and instead of being better,

1424
01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:27.740
I was trying to belittle the people who were better.
Right.
You know,

1425
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:31.280
and it was just so,
cause that's a lot easier.
It was easier.
It was just,

1426
01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:35.430
it was an incorrect way of operating my mind.
Right?
That's all it was.

1427
01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:39.420
And the problem with that though is that you define yourself by the way you

1428
01:20:39.421 --> 01:20:40.470
operate your mind.

1429
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:44.460
And that's how people get stuck in patterns so that you,

1430
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:48.400
you define yourself by your past actions,
whether the in there,

1431
01:20:48.401 --> 01:20:52.950
if they're unfortunate and undesirable and embarrassing those things,

1432
01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:58.120
those things hurt you.
Right?
No big time.
And,
uh,
and I mean,
that's a thing.

1433
01:20:58.121 --> 01:21:02.730
Get raided and having to both just owning your mistakes,
you know,

1434
01:21:02.731 --> 01:21:05.070
big deal because everybody makes me steak,
everybody fuck up.

1435
01:21:05.071 --> 01:21:08.280
And that's the beauty because that's when you learn stuff rather than dealing

1436
01:21:08.281 --> 01:21:09.750
with deed.
Like Amen.

1437
01:21:09.810 --> 01:21:12.920
Whether I learned something from you or you learned something from me,
a wean.

1438
01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:14.340
Anyway,
you know,
he's like,

1439
01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:17.730
you lean more in a way when you fuck up because you're going to learn shit from

1440
01:21:17.731 --> 01:21:21.210
it and then you can move on and improve essentially as a human being.

1441
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:26.760
People get stuck over the embarrassment or,
Ooh,
I messed up,
I need to hide it.

1442
01:21:26.761 --> 01:21:29.340
I need to squash it.
I need not to see it.
And he's like,
great.

1443
01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:32.160
Then you're going to have to wait 10 more times because you're not dealing with

1444
01:21:32.161 --> 01:21:35.790
it now.
Yeah.
Barring physical limitations,
like,
you know,

1445
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:37.950
heart horrific injuries or whatever,

1446
01:21:37.951 --> 01:21:42.840
most of what you have in life that you go through that's very difficult is an

1447
01:21:42.841 --> 01:21:45.130
opportunity to grow.
You know?
And it's,

1448
01:21:45.131 --> 01:21:48.780
it's hard for people to wrap their heads around that,
but we all can do better.

1449
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.870
And I'm not saying that every horrible thing that happens to you is,
uh,
is,

1450
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.520
you know,
you should be happy for them.
No,

1451
01:21:53.521 --> 01:21:55.950
but you can turn it into something that,
that,

1452
01:21:55.980 --> 01:22:00.060
that motivates you and benefits you.
It's just really hard for people to do.

1453
01:22:00.061 --> 01:22:03.630
It's really hard for people to just put in the fucking work and it's hard.

1454
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:05.670
It's hard to feel good about that.
You know,

1455
01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:09.420
it's hard to feel good about putting in the work and doing difficult shit.

1456
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:13.440
But that's why to me it's funny because you'll get either the people who try to

1457
01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:15.930
rationalize every bad shit that happens in these old,

1458
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.280
it's everything happens for a rezoning seeing the name and I just want to punch

1459
01:22:20.281 --> 01:22:22.860
them in the face cause he's like,
come on.
It's like really is like,

1460
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:26.280
it's still about positive thinking.
Yeah.
Let me give you some pause it,
it's like,

1461
01:22:26.281 --> 01:22:29.940
come on,
my friend hits me with the Chili babies die and drive by dude.

1462
01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.730
They do exactly what happened.
The baby wasn't thinking positive.

1463
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:35.760
There's some meaning.
There's no fucking meaning.
You know that.

1464
01:22:35.770 --> 01:22:40.080
So those guys piss me off.
But at the same time,
the depressive,
a cynical,

1465
01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:43.950
oh it's so bad and terrible.
There's no meaning in anything and go this shit.

1466
01:22:43.951 --> 01:22:47.190
He's like dead just as south defeatist if not more.

1467
01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:50.850
So to me it's like a knowledge that not everything makes sense and knowledge

1468
01:22:50.851 --> 01:22:53.850
that bad shit happens for no good reason to good people.

1469
01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:57.510
I knowledge that you'll deal with heartbreak,
tragedy,
fuck everybody dies.

1470
01:22:57.511 --> 01:23:00.180
It doesn't get any bigger than that and move on.

1471
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.510
And you know this without necessarily saying that disease.
Uh,

1472
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:06.070
it's because sandy Permian

1473
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:09.070
<v 4>is maybe because of nothing,
but what can I get from it now?</v>

1474
01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:10.420
What can I learn from it?

1475
01:23:10.421 --> 01:23:12.520
Whether it happened for a good reason or a shitty reason,

1476
01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.410
where do I move from here?

1477
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:19.600
<v 0>Yeah,
that's uh,
one of the hardest things for people to wrap their heads around,</v>

1478
01:23:19.601 --> 01:23:21.980
like an objective look at their situation.

1479
01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.610
A lot of people are really good at giving advice,
but they don't,

1480
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:26.090
they couldn't give themselves advice.

1481
01:23:26.091 --> 01:23:30.610
Scars is that like the worst is when someone's an idiot and they want to give

1482
01:23:30.611 --> 01:23:32.530
you advice and you're like,
come on man,
stop it.

1483
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:36.930
Manage your own fucking situation.
You dumb ass.
You know,

1484
01:23:41.690 --> 01:23:42.523
the,
the,

1485
01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:47.230
the management of the human consciousness to me is one of the most important

1486
01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:50.200
things that a person needs to learn in life.

1487
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.800
And one thing that they don't fucking teach you in school.

1488
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:58.660
That is one of the craziest things about school is that they don't teach you how

1489
01:23:58.661 --> 01:24:03.661
to organize your mind and how to defeat negative thinking and how to encourage

1490
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:08.380
positive thinking and build momentum with positive acts.

1491
01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:13.090
How to reinforce those positive things,
write things down that are doing well,

1492
01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:16.990
celebrate them with each other.
You know,
pass milestones.

1493
01:24:16.991 --> 01:24:20.530
Like there's a reason why like belts in martial arts like exist for thousands of

1494
01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:22.750
years.
You fucking feel good when you get a belt.

1495
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:26.800
I remember when I got my blue belt,
I was on a fucking television show.
Okay.

1496
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:27.830
And I didn't even,

1497
01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:30.350
the only thing I thought about being on the television show was like,
oh,

1498
01:24:30.351 --> 01:24:33.730
this is kind of cool.
I'm on TV.
It's great.
It's good money.
I feel very fortunate,

1499
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:37.600
but it didn't give me the rush that I got when I caught a blue belt.
I was like,

1500
01:24:37.601 --> 01:24:41.610
Holy Shit,
I've got a blue belt in Jujitsu.
I'm not a white belt anymore.
You know?

1501
01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:45.130
It was like,
whoa.
I got out.
Fucking was beaming that day.
I went home.

1502
01:24:45.131 --> 01:24:48.580
I was all excited.
Wow,
I got my first belt.
Like this is awesome.

1503
01:24:48.581 --> 01:24:52.750
Like it was like a real positive feeling of,
of,
of moving forward.

1504
01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:56.920
That's something that you people,
people need a discipline man.

1505
01:24:56.921 --> 01:24:58.660
They need a little something to do.

1506
01:24:58.661 --> 01:25:00.970
Whether it's writing or whether it's you know,

1507
01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:04.360
a martial lard or fucking just become a marathon runner.

1508
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:07.810
You need something where you push yourself so you can learn what you can do.

1509
01:25:08.490 --> 01:25:08.671
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1510
01:25:08.671 --> 01:25:11.520
And literally can be anything cause he can be a physical discipline committee,

1511
01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:16.020
intellectual discipline,
maybe even both,
which would be ideal.
But yeah,

1512
01:25:16.021 --> 01:25:18.720
it's applying yourself to something because they're going to face the same

1513
01:25:18.721 --> 01:25:21.060
challenges.
So regardless of which specific field,
okay.

1514
01:25:21.061 --> 01:25:24.150
Maybe somebody is not going to punch you in the face when you are a painted or

1515
01:25:24.151 --> 01:25:24.601
something.

1516
01:25:24.601 --> 01:25:27.930
But the point being you're still going to be dealing with disappointment with

1517
01:25:27.931 --> 01:25:30.070
the learning Corp.
There's going to be

1518
01:25:30.650 --> 01:25:32.570
<v 0>don't like your work and it's going to crush you.</v>

1519
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:37.080
And they might be right know they might be right or they might be haters.
You,

1520
01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.870
you know,
you find out a lot about life,

1521
01:25:38.871 --> 01:25:41.780
the dealing with people through your own discipline and people that are in

1522
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:44.620
similar disciplines.
This is just a,

1523
01:25:44.621 --> 01:25:48.700
that that aspect of education is so,
so lacking.

1524
01:25:48.701 --> 01:25:52.850
It's so crazy when you really think about like engineering a society,

1525
01:25:52.851 --> 01:25:54.800
engineering the consciousness of a society,

1526
01:25:54.801 --> 01:25:58.220
which is what education is really supposed to be about really.
Essentially.

1527
01:25:58.221 --> 01:26:00.230
I mean you're,
you're,
you're,
uh,

1528
01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:04.130
making sure that the future generations are of contributing

1529
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:07.250
<v 4>and that's what you're doing.
And the funny thing is that that's usually,</v>

1530
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:08.360
there are exceptions,

1531
01:26:08.361 --> 01:26:13.070
but that's usually the last possible concern when it comes to academic

1532
01:26:13.071 --> 01:26:16.940
environments while the students actually learn is like student.
I mean,

1533
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:18.680
I keyed in on,
I added people shit,

1534
01:26:18.690 --> 01:26:21.020
I remember a guy at Ucla once the data than me,

1535
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:24.860
he had a tenure track job there and he was a professor and he was like,
you know,

1536
01:26:24.861 --> 01:26:29.861
this is a great gig if only I didn't have to teach because he was primarily

1537
01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:32.810
wanted to research and writing is stupid.

1538
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:36.260
Econimic drawer and do is seeing a new dad and be a loner Weirdo.
Yeah.

1539
01:26:36.261 --> 01:26:40.550
And interacting with students bothered him and that actually less uretor than

1540
01:26:40.551 --> 01:26:41.590
you would imagine.
You know,

1541
01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.870
there's actually a lot of those guys were really comfortable in a pile of

1542
01:26:44.871 --> 01:26:48.680
documents in some more autocratic and they turn it okay,
action at bureaucracy,

1543
01:26:48.681 --> 01:26:51.920
which goes back to my fuck you and your mother fucking Mama because those are

1544
01:26:51.921 --> 01:26:55.790
the people who kill the fun of it,
you know?
But it's added all schools.

1545
01:26:55.791 --> 01:26:59.130
Is that at Harvard is at the highest levels of education?
Where do you find what,

1546
01:26:59.150 --> 01:27:02.330
like what school do you,
can you say,
should you not say where you teach at?
Yeah,

1547
01:27:02.370 --> 01:27:03.380
probably shouldn't say,
well,

1548
01:27:03.381 --> 01:27:07.400
I teach multiple places so it could be anyone that sending,
I got these shoes.

1549
01:27:07.401 --> 01:27:10.550
But honestly it's not even that personal now because they can't get in trouble

1550
01:27:10.551 --> 01:27:14.690
for no,
I mean it is your mother fucking Mama and I'll have it to be a big deal.

1551
01:27:14.691 --> 01:27:17.390
And you know,
what I meant to say is,
is a,

1552
01:27:17.391 --> 01:27:19.610
is the personnel in the sense that it could be them,

1553
01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:22.940
it could be somebody at they're faceless bureaucrat is a mentality.

1554
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:26.540
You know what I mean?
He's not even like that single individual.
If he's not,

1555
01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:27.950
that is another one.
There's like,

1556
01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:32.120
so it's a lack of passion that disturbs you or lack of a pursuit of excellence

1557
01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:36.470
in upset or teaching and that you think is more common than not.

1558
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:40.550
There's exceptional teachers,
but they're fairly rare.
Exactly.
And I mean,

1559
01:27:40.551 --> 01:27:41.780
you know,
even exceptions,

1560
01:27:41.781 --> 01:27:45.620
even a lot of exception if you guy like 20% of people who are good,

1561
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:48.320
that's awesome.
That's actually good in a teaching environment,

1562
01:27:48.321 --> 01:27:51.020
which one you think about it,
you're relieving.
We teach people who kind of suck,

1563
01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:55.010
which is awful.
But even that I would sign up for that.
Well,
you know,
I'll you,

1564
01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.580
I think of it in terms of like people that are started out doing open mic nights

1565
01:27:58.581 --> 01:28:02.570
with how many of them have gone on and actually become professional comedians.

1566
01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:08.170
I only know out of all the people that I did it with three right?

1567
01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:12.590
And two of them,
I'm still friends with Chris Mcguire and Greg Fitzsimmons.

1568
01:28:12.591 --> 01:28:14.570
So those are two guys that I started out with.

1569
01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:16.370
It actually became professional comedians.
Right.

1570
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:20.990
And that's a tiny number compared to the amount of people that we actually knew

1571
01:28:20.991 --> 01:28:23.150
from those days that we're attempting to do it.

1572
01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:28.420
So if you can get 20% of your students and those students become proficient in

1573
01:28:30.591 --> 01:28:33.560
whatever you're teaching,
whether you're teaching history or mathematics,

1574
01:28:33.561 --> 01:28:36.830
whatever,
that's pretty fucking good.
I'm set.
And the thing is,

1575
01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.990
thinking about the comedy example,
imagine that the people you started with,

1576
01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.580
there's no testing ground.

1577
01:28:43.581 --> 01:28:46.280
There is no people laugh or not think it's funny or not.

1578
01:28:46.281 --> 01:28:50.630
So your career is not shaped by actual feedback are good or not.

1579
01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:54.830
Your career is based on how well you stepped through the stupid academic hoops.

1580
01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:59.060
Like getting the jobs has nothing to do with actual teaching scale.

1581
01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:02.110
It's all about other crop that you research.

1582
01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.380
How good research I would go with your CV.

1583
01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:07.650
Luke's have you served in some subcommittee you where your span,
you know,

1584
01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:10.650
that kind of shit.
So it isn't that to encourage uh,

1585
01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:15.360
people to innovate and to keep coming up with new ideas and that the research is

1586
01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:20.430
how we learn things on the sciences,
sciences.
I dig it.
I see the point of it.

1587
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.550
Even the,
in a lot of humanities,
social science,

1588
01:29:23.551 --> 01:29:27.870
the reality is that the so called the research is stuff written in indie stuff.

1589
01:29:27.871 --> 01:29:31.230
The academic language that the only other people are going to read are eight

1590
01:29:31.231 --> 01:29:33.840
other experts in the field that you might as well cold them right down and I

1591
01:29:33.841 --> 01:29:37.110
ride,
he's got up and he's the design almost to be missed.

1592
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.430
Not something that's communicable to irregular audiences because of that makes

1593
01:29:41.431 --> 01:29:43.470
you look cool and learned and note of that.

1594
01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:46.980
And to me that's the exact opposite of communicational master.
You know,

1595
01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:47.930
communication mastery,

1596
01:29:47.970 --> 01:29:52.470
staking really difficult ideas and translating them in ways that anybody can

1597
01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:53.810
relate to.
Right?
Right.

1598
01:29:53.850 --> 01:29:58.440
Making them digestible so that any from any walk of life you can see a

1599
01:29:58.441 --> 01:29:59.820
connection to your life,

1600
01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:02.940
the easiest they can get the exact opposite direction he's making it.

1601
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:07.160
We are then the pseudo intellectual game for nerds.

1602
01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:11.200
We walk into a library 40 years ago and never saw the light of the sun again.

1603
01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:14.890
You know,
is that those are,
cause that's the name assigning shut it,
it's,

1604
01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:19.930
it's really difficult to take advice from person who's not living a healthy

1605
01:30:20.641 --> 01:30:21.720
life.
Exactly.

1606
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:26.990
And you can learn certain things from them but it should really be like the idea

1607
01:30:27.721 --> 01:30:32.340
of like the idea of the Samurai,
the Samurai had to be a well rounded person.

1608
01:30:32.341 --> 01:30:37.341
You gotta understand calligraphy and artwork and that having that one

1609
01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:41.610
well-rounded unit would serve you in battle because you would be a person of

1610
01:30:41.611 --> 01:30:44.850
character and clear thought of soda with it and that's what they do.

1611
01:30:44.851 --> 01:30:49.260
Occasional should be right,
but it's not that.

1612
01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:53.820
Definitely the percentage of teachers do you think are really innovating and

1613
01:30:53.821 --> 01:30:56.820
trying to provide a better learning environment and trying to like,

1614
01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.760
like you must have a bunch of professors that you are cool with

1615
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:02.720
dark pool ladders.

1616
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:07.410
There's a fairly high number of people who are nice human beings who meanwhile

1617
01:31:07.890 --> 01:31:11.820
there are bunch of obnoxious,
stuffy borrow crowds,

1618
01:31:11.821 --> 01:31:15.930
but there is a solid number of people lose made of Nice human beings.

1619
01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:20.840
They're just not very lunch human being.
So they're not bad.
They are,
they try it.

1620
01:31:20.841 --> 01:31:23.900
Just did or delivery,
durability to light.

1621
01:31:23.901 --> 01:31:27.180
Some turn a light on inside student side is very limited.

1622
01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:30.530
It's not because they are bad is I don't know whatever the fuck they are never

1623
01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:33.540
not be a,
it's almost like they're four months in that sense.

1624
01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:37.590
Is there any sort of a universal standard when it comes to Alexa getting a phd

1625
01:31:37.591 --> 01:31:42.591
in applied mathematics or in whether it's English or literature,

1626
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:46.710
is there like a standard amongst all the universities in the country or does

1627
01:31:46.711 --> 01:31:49.940
each university sort of get together with its scholars and,

1628
01:31:49.941 --> 01:31:52.020
and sort of figure it out themselves?

1629
01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.880
This is what we think we should require of them in order for them to be,
uh,

1630
01:31:56.910 --> 01:32:00.910
you know,
to get a bachelor's degree.
This is everybody.
There are,
it's both.

1631
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:04.690
There are certain general standards that are expected and then there are,

1632
01:32:04.691 --> 01:32:08.190
each school can push its policies in certain direction.

1633
01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:12.850
So they're both seeing success,
but they're usually not based on,
um,

1634
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:16.120
on actual and what you're saying and making you a better human being.

1635
01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:20.320
That's not the goal of education is giving you a bunch of knowledge about stuff

1636
01:32:20.321 --> 01:32:23.830
you didn't know about which may be useful and some people will be able to take a

1637
01:32:23.831 --> 01:32:28.030
lot out of it and become and turn it into something that actually apply to life

1638
01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:32.050
or maybe use less crap that's invading your head for no good reason.

1639
01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:35.770
There is no connection to real life a lot of the time.
You know what I mean?

1640
01:32:35.771 --> 01:32:39.040
That's the biggest problem is he remains even when it's good.

1641
01:32:39.130 --> 01:32:43.720
It's a theoretical game that's not designed to change how you get up from the

1642
01:32:43.721 --> 01:32:47.740
seat and walk through class.
How you are as a human being,

1643
01:32:47.741 --> 01:32:51.550
how you feel is not designed to effect that is purely about knowledge for

1644
01:32:51.551 --> 01:32:54.460
knowledge sake,
which you know,
it has some good sides,

1645
01:32:54.461 --> 01:32:56.830
but it also some major limits right there

1646
01:32:57.140 --> 01:33:00.950
<v 0>to so many fucking things to know and learn.</v>

1647
01:33:01.130 --> 01:33:05.990
If you're just just learning grammar,
language,
education,
logic,

1648
01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:07.250
mathematics,

1649
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:12.140
who you start going over the various disciplines and do various things that a

1650
01:33:12.141 --> 01:33:12.974
person can,

1651
01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:17.380
there's not enough time in your young life to really put together a,

1652
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:21.530
an an accurate piece of the world and then go out and be a part of it.
Right.

1653
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:25.740
It's,
that's the weirdest thing about school is that when Mo,

1654
01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:28.970
most of my friends that graduated cause like right when they got out,

1655
01:33:28.971 --> 01:33:32.780
that was like one of the weirdest times in their life where they were like,
fuck,

1656
01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:34.610
now what?
You know,

1657
01:33:34.670 --> 01:33:38.360
now what do I bad fucking been buried in books for all these years and trying to

1658
01:33:38.361 --> 01:33:42.770
figure and now I'm out there like,
oh,
key dokie.
Like here,
here goes,

1659
01:33:42.771 --> 01:33:45.880
here goes nothing.
It's almost like,
uh,
it's,

1660
01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:50.960
it's real hard to get a realistic view of the world before you were an adult,

1661
01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:55.360
<v 4>right?
Yeah.
I mean before you'll got actual experience,
you know what I mean?</v>

1662
01:33:55.361 --> 01:33:59.020
Doing stuff right there and then being stuck in his intellectual game.

1663
01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.720
And I mean I'm a nerd,
you know,
I love to read like crazy.

1664
01:34:01.721 --> 01:34:04.140
I love to know sings about a million different subject.

1665
01:34:04.141 --> 01:34:07.990
So I'm fire from advocate,
dean,
anti intellectualism,
fire from it,

1666
01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:13.060
but at the same time to me for real intellect goes hand in hand with a certain

1667
01:34:13.061 --> 01:34:16.720
relationship with your body.
We Test Sarah Camera.
It's about,
it's about bullets,

1668
01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:20.320
you know what I mean?
It makes you,
makes you a more complete human being.

1669
01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.570
It makes you better at not only,
you know,

1670
01:34:22.571 --> 01:34:25.380
if you are an athlete and they are smart,
probably going to be a better,

1671
01:34:25.381 --> 01:34:27.730
I thought latex not only at the other stuff,

1672
01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:29.320
as long as you don't have too much homework.

1673
01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:32.650
That's what I show the fuck up your training.
If you know,

1674
01:34:32.651 --> 01:34:37.000
if you're a nerd and you know we live in this idea that your thoughts are,

1675
01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:37.451
you know,

1676
01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:40.840
y'all are really these gnome that stuck in your head that's directing the

1677
01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.190
machine of the body so that who you are physically doesn't really affect your

1678
01:34:45.191 --> 01:34:47.930
consciousness,
which is essentially what's cool is that here,
right?

1679
01:34:47.931 --> 01:34:49.660
Because I mean look at how people learn.

1680
01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:53.590
You go sit into these really uncomfortable chairs facing forward.

1681
01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:57.540
Your body wants to stretch you on a movie,
on a Shiksa manage.
You can't,

1682
01:34:57.541 --> 01:35:00.950
you're supposed to stay there.
The Easton Easton to some bastard up there,

1683
01:35:00.951 --> 01:35:02.490
it was going blah,
blah blah.

1684
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:09.030
Integrating more consciousness affecting conscious any,

1685
01:35:09.031 --> 01:35:13.490
it's so avid ceilings that are about giving it a lot more importance to the
body,

1686
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:18.620
to physical experiences.
Not All [inaudible] two hours of pee somewhere,
which is,

1687
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:22.640
it's not about consciousness,
it's about moving muscle and shit,
which is nice,

1688
01:35:22.641 --> 01:35:25.160
but it's not.
The same thing is also emphasizing our,

1689
01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:28.940
through a whole variety of physical discipline,
you can affect the mind.

1690
01:35:28.941 --> 01:35:32.840
You can affect speed eight if you want to get that fire,
you can.

1691
01:35:33.230 --> 01:35:35.600
There's a connection between all these different things.

1692
01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:40.370
Whereas we have this mentality that all knowledge is about knowledge sake.

1693
01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:46.060
There's a relatively really no connection to your body and a vetted the telco

1694
01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:49.160
room to actually applying that knowledge in real life,

1695
01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:53.780
which to me is missing the point because he's like,
if knowledge is not,

1696
01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.100
if it doesn't make,
if it doesn't improve the quality of your life,

1697
01:35:58.190 --> 01:36:02.780
what the Hell is the point?
You know?
And uh,
it,
it doesn't,
I don't mean just,

1698
01:36:02.781 --> 01:36:05.300
Oh it needs to make the car on the road or some stuff.

1699
01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.910
He could be even intellectually but over the quality of your life.

1700
01:36:07.911 --> 01:36:10.910
Cause it makes you happy because it makes you relate better to another human

1701
01:36:10.911 --> 01:36:13.700
being's well that has an effect in life.
Well,

1702
01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:18.701
I'm talking about knowledge that just about in the year 1763 [inaudible] and

1703
01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:23.930
there is no time to lean kit,
which why,
what's the point?

1704
01:36:23.931 --> 01:36:27.090
What's the lesson you can learn?
What can you get out of it for your life?

1705
01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.320
There is no effort whatsoever and never doubted

1706
01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:32.210
<v 6>is it because it's just too much information to give people,</v>

1707
01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.970
they don't have time for that aspect of it.

1708
01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.400
<v 4>Part of it for sure.</v>

1709
01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:38.220
Because there's a bunch of factual things you need to get and they are less

1710
01:36:38.221 --> 01:36:41.190
controversial,
you know,
there's no argument about a factual stuff.

1711
01:36:41.191 --> 01:36:43.890
Whereas when you're a supporting quote trying to educate somebody,

1712
01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:45.720
there's also an element of who are you?

1713
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:49.920
Are you are human being okay as something to offer to somebody else or use some

1714
01:36:49.921 --> 01:36:54.580
guy in a position of power who's trying to force this on more subjective thing

1715
01:36:54.581 --> 01:36:58.650
on people.
So what you're telling me is academics

1716
01:36:59.350 --> 01:37:04.150
<v 6>and uh,
academia in general just needs more mushrooms.
That's ward by ward.</v>

1717
01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:04.751
What I was saying,

1718
01:37:04.751 --> 01:37:09.580
that's what I seismic I'm hearing they need a fresh perspective and a

1719
01:37:09.581 --> 01:37:11.190
psychedelic outlook.
Yeah.

1720
01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:13.990
I think I'm gonna have a mushroom Thanksgiving this year.
It's a good move.
Do it.

1721
01:37:13.991 --> 01:37:16.340
If I wasn't with my kids,
I would do it.
I mean San Diego,

1722
01:37:16.341 --> 01:37:19.450
I said I might stay an extra day.
Holla.
Don't say that man.

1723
01:37:19.451 --> 01:37:21.760
They'll find you in San Diego.
They've got a mushroom sniffing dog.

1724
01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:23.560
It's right near the fucking military base.

1725
01:37:23.561 --> 01:37:25.630
The last thing they want is mushrooms in the military.

1726
01:37:26.210 --> 01:37:29.560
That is the last thing you need.
And you're in the military is mushrooms.

1727
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:33.370
You need amphetamines and steroids.
You don't need mushrooms.
Right.
Okay.

1728
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:36.010
You were out there.
You want to come home safe.
Mushrooms are for later.

1729
01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:40.470
Rooms are for when you get back.
Uh,
I,

1730
01:37:40.690 --> 01:37:45.690
I've talked to a lot of dudes who are in Afghanistan who listened to the podcast

1731
01:37:46.511 --> 01:37:51.290
over there,
a lot of troops listening to podcasts over there.
And,
uh,
it's a,

1732
01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:56.100
it's a weird conversation.
You know,
I've had a bunch of them with dudes after

1733
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:58.230
<v 0>shows.
I go,
listen man,
you,
you know,
you don't even know,</v>

1734
01:37:58.231 --> 01:38:02.520
but you guys kept me sane when I,
when I was over there.
That's a,

1735
01:38:02.590 --> 01:38:06.830
another strange responsibility for people that are,
uh,
you know,
in,

1736
01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:11.900
in such a tough position to be a over at war and to be providing them with some

1737
01:38:12.061 --> 01:38:14.130
other thoughts.
So listen,

1738
01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:19.190
amphetamines and steroids and keep pulling that trigger and run.

1739
01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:24.630
You didn't create the shit.
He just stuck in it.
It's like the running man.

1740
01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:29.890
Just get through it before the aliens land.
Do you,
um,
what,

1741
01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:32.610
what do you think about all these ancient aliens,

1742
01:38:32.611 --> 01:38:36.390
motherfuckers that want to say that?
Uh,
the original,
uh,

1743
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:41.220
sources of humanity was that we were created by aliens.

1744
01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:44.610
Does that seem ridiculous to you?
I mean,
sure it does,
but at the same time,

1745
01:38:44.611 --> 01:38:49.030
just because he's there,
they,
it doesn't mean it can be through.
We exist.
Yeah.

1746
01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.760
There was a Harvard guy,

1747
01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:54.390
some astronomer who was talking about the likelihood of life in the universe is

1748
01:38:54.391 --> 01:38:55.320
very small.
Right.

1749
01:38:55.321 --> 01:39:00.321
It's very likely that we are alone because they searched for 504 search,

1750
01:39:01.831 --> 01:39:05.940
500 different planets and they found no signs of life.

1751
01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:09.810
I thought that was the dumbest thing I've ever heard out of a smart guys mouth

1752
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:14.940
because this 500 he said he found firing and they found nothing.
No.
Yo,

1753
01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:19.800
you search 501 dummy.
Right?
Because earth is one of them and earth has life.

1754
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:23.880
Yeah,
so you found one which is fucking crazy.

1755
01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.500
We are crazy.

1756
01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:30.180
The fact that we exist at all and that we have internet and then we have Google

1757
01:39:30.181 --> 01:39:34.110
on our phone and then we can fly in tubes.
The hope that fucking shoot,

1758
01:39:34.111 --> 01:39:37.950
you're 30,000 feet in the air.
That's what I'm saying on son.
He mentioned this.

1759
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:41.820
Could I be get to somebody who doesn't know anything about it is I say it sound

1760
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:43.170
like alien tails.

1761
01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:46.200
Well I always used to talk about it on stage that you tried to rap.

1762
01:39:46.410 --> 01:39:48.660
Try wrapping your head around the fact that 200 years ago,

1763
01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:49.980
if you wanted a picture of something,

1764
01:39:49.981 --> 01:39:54.900
you had to draw it like that is not that long ago.
Or even,

1765
01:39:54.901 --> 01:39:57.840
yeah,
around that time is like forget playing any music.

1766
01:39:57.841 --> 01:39:59.970
The only music you ever had a year of his life and it was a can.

1767
01:39:59.971 --> 01:40:02.260
There's nothing else cause you can,
you know,

1768
01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:05.520
there's no recording device that you can press,
play and go,
yeah,

1769
01:40:05.521 --> 01:40:10.110
now I have gigs of music on my phone.
Yeah.
You know,
it just,

1770
01:40:10.111 --> 01:40:13.310
it never fails to trip me out that I can go to my foot.

1771
01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:17.220
Like I don't have an iPod anymore.
I mean I have an Ipod,
um,
uh,

1772
01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:21.120
the one of like,
oh,
I have a,
like a leftover one,

1773
01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:24.540
but your phone becomes also your eye.
But when I go to the gym,

1774
01:40:24.541 --> 01:40:28.410
I play my phone and there's so much variety in there.

1775
01:40:28.411 --> 01:40:32.490
There's thousands of fucking songs.
And your phone best music.

1776
01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:34.500
I've seen the word old talk inside your phone.

1777
01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:36.840
We can't even wrap our stupid heads around it.

1778
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:42.180
It's like what I was saying about the rise and fall of these civilizations like

1779
01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:47.310
we we're experiencing and we're benefiting from something we don't even

1780
01:40:47.311 --> 01:40:52.260
understand a little bit.
Whereas when you were living in the pioneer days,

1781
01:40:52.261 --> 01:40:54.220
everything was pretty straight forward.

1782
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:56.950
You had a fix that wagon wheel and this is what you gotta do.
You gotta take,

1783
01:40:56.951 --> 01:41:00.520
some would pound the metal and do this and then put the wheel back on.

1784
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:03.850
And if you want to,
you know,
shoot a deer,
you got to sneak up on it.

1785
01:41:03.851 --> 01:41:07.240
And this is how you skin it and they say cut it into and if it's fucking hot
out,

1786
01:41:07.241 --> 01:41:10.720
you better smoke.
That shit.
Turned it to beef jerky.
Otherwise it'll go bad.

1787
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:15.910
Like we knew how to manage all of the things that we had in our environment.

1788
01:41:16.031 --> 01:41:18.910
And if we didn't,
we knew a guy in town who did,
well,
I'm not a blacksmith,

1789
01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:21.710
but Bob is,
and I'll go to Bob and get some more shoes.
You know,

1790
01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:24.850
like I remember that movie,
the unforgiven,

1791
01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:29.620
the cleanings would move him seeing him like out on the farm with his fucking

1792
01:41:29.621 --> 01:41:33.610
kids.
Like,
like trying to,
trying to farm and fallen flat on his face,

1793
01:41:33.611 --> 01:41:38.200
trying to push pigs into a pen.
That's,
that was reality for everybody.

1794
01:41:38.201 --> 01:41:40.900
That was the only way to live.
That's,
that's all that existed.

1795
01:41:40.901 --> 01:41:44.250
And you knew how to manage all the different aspects of your life.

1796
01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:49.200
You understood how a gun worked.
You understood how to sharpen an ax.
Not Anymore,

1797
01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:52.490
man.
I'm fucking pressing buttons.
I don't even understand.

1798
01:41:52.730 --> 01:41:55.750
I have never even thought about trying to understand wireless Internet,

1799
01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:56.960
but I'm on it right now.
I know.

1800
01:41:56.961 --> 01:42:01.210
I've never even thought about attempting for a moment to gain any sort of an

1801
01:42:01.211 --> 01:42:02.044
understanding of it.

1802
01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.390
<v 4>I mean,
that's so much of disease.</v>

1803
01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.860
So beyond anything you can get quickly or under,

1804
01:42:05.861 --> 01:42:08.660
cause he would have to understand so much of physics so much.
It's,

1805
01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.860
it's like forget it.
Okay.
It works.
I press play.
Works on happy.

1806
01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.910
<v 0>Yeah.
We're civilization spoiled.
Yeah.</v>

1807
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:16.120
Do you think that that's just a stage though?

1808
01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:19.150
And that one day our brains would catch up with all this shit and like they say

1809
01:42:19.151 --> 01:42:22.600
the human brain doubled in size over a period of 2 million years.

1810
01:42:22.601 --> 01:42:25.540
So at some point in human evolution,
that's what separated us.
We,

1811
01:42:25.541 --> 01:42:28.510
that's how we took her off from the other apes.
Is that,

1812
01:42:28.630 --> 01:42:31.200
is that going on right now?
I mean probably cause I mean when you look

1813
01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.960
<v 4>good,
the speed of technological innovation off nonetheless thousand years,</v>

1814
01:42:34.961 --> 01:42:38.140
the last hundred,
you know when you can see there maybe 150,

1815
01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:42.930
a like three CT phones,
cars or planes,
TV,
radio,

1816
01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:47.230
computer,
Inter.
It's like all of it is,
it's mind blowing really.

1817
01:42:47.231 --> 01:42:49.690
Cause it's all in the span of just very few.
I mean fuck,

1818
01:42:49.691 --> 01:42:53.260
I remember when I was a kid in Italy and I'm not like these old guy who was
like,

1819
01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:57.490
you know,
back in my time or no,
I mean,
um,
late thirties.

1820
01:42:57.491 --> 01:43:02.050
And I remember when I was a kid that if I wanted to find out what the MBA
finals,

1821
01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:04.870
I would call the one Italian magazine,

1822
01:43:04.871 --> 01:43:09.640
the cover basketball day at talk to their friend in New York who had given them

1823
01:43:09.641 --> 01:43:12.910
the news.
And so maybe two days later when they open for business,

1824
01:43:12.911 --> 01:43:16.450
I get to find out who won the NBA final.
If I don't make that call,

1825
01:43:16.451 --> 01:43:20.020
I have to wait a month for the magazine to be published so I know who won the

1826
01:43:20.021 --> 01:43:22.210
game.
And I'm like,
that was what,

1827
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:26.810
25 years ago or something 30 years ago.
Are you kidding me?

1828
01:43:26.811 --> 01:43:29.440
I mean now you can be in some hole in the wall somewhere,

1829
01:43:29.441 --> 01:43:33.310
you have Internet connection and you can watch it live and it's insane.

1830
01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.710
You know it,
it really is

1831
01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:36.970
<v 0>and it's changing now.</v>

1832
01:43:36.971 --> 01:43:41.170
It's getting crazier and crazier and it's not going to stop.
And this,

1833
01:43:41.171 --> 01:43:43.210
this what we have now,
so amazing,

1834
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:48.390
but it really is the tip of the iceberg and one of the side effects is going to

1835
01:43:48.761 --> 01:43:52.400
be a complete and total lack of privacy that's on the side effects that people

1836
01:43:52.401 --> 01:43:55.760
have to understand.
Sure.
Like you enjoy your privacy while you can,
right.

1837
01:43:55.820 --> 01:44:00.730
Because eventually it's not gonna exist.
We are slowly,
uh,
married,
uh,

1838
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:03.600
immersing ourselves in the,
the,

1839
01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:08.410
the mass of humanity as like one super organism.
Yup.

1840
01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:11.660
That's,
that's really where it's all going and it's going,
the,
the,

1841
01:44:11.670 --> 01:44:14.840
all the boundaries are going to go away through technology and then technology

1842
01:44:14.841 --> 01:44:19.310
eventually,
biologically will be a part of our system.
So we'll,
we'll,

1843
01:44:19.311 --> 01:44:24.020
we'll have some chips inside of our body or we'll have some implants that we,
uh,

1844
01:44:24.021 --> 01:44:27.770
install into people's bodies and that quick and easy way.
And for people that,

1845
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:30.920
that d that say that all,
that's crazy sign,
that's not going to happen.

1846
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:35.870
Look at Pamela Anderson's tits.
Okay.
Look at what she's accepted.

1847
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:41.080
She has accepted bags of water under her nipples that make her tits pop out in

1848
01:44:41.181 --> 01:44:42.410
an unrealistic way.

1849
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:44.960
You don't think that you're going to accept a chip in your brain.

1850
01:44:44.961 --> 01:44:48.080
It's going to let you see the future.
That's ridiculous.
You're going to take it.

1851
01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:49.160
You're going to get that operation.

1852
01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.030
There's going to be dudes who were stupid as fuck and there's going to be dudes

1853
01:44:53.031 --> 01:44:56.990
with brain jobs and those do the w brain jobs.
There'll be running shit.

1854
01:44:56.991 --> 01:44:59.990
They'll be fucking flying around in private jets and Ferrari's and you're like,

1855
01:44:59.991 --> 01:45:03.800
it don't need a bit fucking super moon live in the country and these colors

1856
01:45:03.801 --> 01:45:06.890
don't run and you're out there chopping wood with an ax.

1857
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:09.740
You fucking dummy and this guy could read your mind.
Okay,

1858
01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.210
this guy's got a fucking little piece of silicone on the base of his skull and

1859
01:45:14.211 --> 01:45:17.270
he could see through walls.
Right?
You're not going to take that.
You're dumb.

1860
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:18.560
You're dumb dumb.
You're going to,

1861
01:45:18.561 --> 01:45:21.560
you're going to be back there with the monkeys who couldn't figure out how to

1862
01:45:21.561 --> 01:45:23.990
make fire,
right?
Yeah.
All those stupid fucks.

1863
01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:28.100
There's still an Africa swinging from trees that's used to be us apparently

1864
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.780
millions of years ago supposedly.

1865
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:34.010
Have you seen that new shit where they found that,
uh,
people were,
um,

1866
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:39.430
that human beings 500,000 years ago were using tools and using m Flint,

1867
01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:45.230
Flint tipped,
spears and arrows.
Most,
the most recent,

1868
01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:46.070
uh,
discovery,

1869
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:50.780
which predates what we thought human beings used as tools.

1870
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:52.520
Uh,
by 200,000 years,

1871
01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:54.310
<v 4>let's see.
Insane.
I mean saying,</v>

1872
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:57.820
I don't even know what human beings 500,000 years ago would have looked like as

1873
01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:01.570
were talking about.
No shit
man.

1874
01:46:02.770 --> 01:46:04.090
I wonder what they looked like,
man.

1875
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:07.750
<v 0>I bet.
Yeah.
What I mean,
how eight,
like where are we,
you know,</v>

1876
01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:12.490
a half a million years ago?
When did it,
well,
they know that neanderthals,

1877
01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.560
notice how I said talls like a true intellectual with my three years of college.

1878
01:46:18.030 --> 01:46:21.740
Um,
they know that they,
uh,
they,
they made,
um,

1879
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.350
they've done not only made weapons,
but they also,
uh,
were navigators.

1880
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:28.580
They're one of the most recent discoveries is that they think they flew,

1881
01:46:28.610 --> 01:46:32.870
they sailed out to islands on their own,
you know,
without a homo sapiens.

1882
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:35.540
And neanderthals had figured out how to make boats.
This is,

1883
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:38.240
they didn't really think that just to a few decades ago.

1884
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:42.210
<v 4>They were around until relatively speaking now that long ago because they went</v>

1885
01:46:42.211 --> 01:46:44.580
extinct like maybe 30,000 years ago or something.

1886
01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:48.720
And they went around since maybe two and their cubs in two years ago that that

1887
01:46:48.721 --> 01:46:52.740
lot times shared by Homo sapiens sapiens and the neon their tele at the same

1888
01:46:52.741 --> 01:46:53.574
time.
It's,

1889
01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.020
<v 0>yeah,
that's nuts man.
Huh.
That's uh,
the,</v>

1890
01:46:58.230 --> 01:47:01.880
they were weird looking dude.
They were like five feet tall,

1891
01:47:01.881 --> 01:47:05.870
200 pounds solid rock walkie talkie is fuck.

1892
01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:10.220
They all looked like who some are Paul Harris x but not,
but not with that head.

1893
01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:12.350
Like he has a human hat.
They had like weird heads.

1894
01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:15.080
They are like crazy for foreheads heavy.
Yeah.

1895
01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:20.000
I saw a documentary where they were um,
trying to uh,

1896
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:21.320
put like a,

1897
01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:25.610
like clay and like reconstruct a neanderthals face and they compare it to a

1898
01:47:25.611 --> 01:47:28.580
human being.
He had a homosapien right next to the article.

1899
01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:32.150
There's so many prominent features are different.
The brow and the like,

1900
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:36.440
they were a totally different fucking thing,
but they were real close,

1901
01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:39.950
real close to us.
They had,
they,
um,

1902
01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:43.970
they crossed the Mediterranean in boats a hundred thousand years ago.

1903
01:47:44.630 --> 01:47:46.010
Isn't that amazing?
They were,

1904
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:48.230
some people still think they were swimmers by the way,

1905
01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:52.280
but there's other people that are saying they found they have found distinctive,

1906
01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:56.990
uh,
like uh,
evidence that they had made it to these islands.
Yeah.

1907
01:47:56.991 --> 01:48:00.740
There's no just that's insane.
Maybe the gun as well.

1908
01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.740
Well let me get with crocodiles.
Yeah,
right.
You'll months can sweep,

1909
01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.680
<v 4>but the,
no,</v>

1910
01:48:06.681 --> 01:48:10.190
that's fakey and Nan there does where actually the first one way to burry their

1911
01:48:10.191 --> 01:48:11.024
bodies.

1912
01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:15.950
So they are the first species that have a burial for their dad before

1913
01:48:15.951 --> 01:48:17.770
homosapiens down as far as,
well,

1914
01:48:17.771 --> 01:48:21.500
cause I mean a lot of Homo sapiens sees a lot of the evidence that we have.

1915
01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.280
Typically what we could,
like the staff pass the hand there thousand years ago,

1916
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:27.950
we really don't know a whole lot about,
you know what I mean?

1917
01:48:27.951 --> 01:48:32.550
There's like you find a fragment of a tooth from 300,000 years and then you find

1918
01:48:32.551 --> 01:48:35.960
the they'll finger from,
it's like so poutine together.

1919
01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:38.540
There's a lot of guesswork involved about this stuff.

1920
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:41.570
And that's part of what's fun about it is that every other day there's new

1921
01:48:41.571 --> 01:48:45.260
articles coming in.
We can,
you know,
theories that make it,
uh,

1922
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:48.710
the change there is like the stuff that we thought we knew until yesterday.

1923
01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:50.360
Scratch that.
That was bullshit.

1924
01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.230
We actually now know that what you just said like you know,
500 years ago,

1925
01:48:54.231 --> 01:48:56.720
there would a 500,000 years ago they used on tools,

1926
01:48:56.721 --> 01:49:00.320
whereas before we thought a lot less that staff is constantly changing.
My,

1927
01:49:00.321 --> 01:49:03.500
one of the theories have been tilled as far as I know,
still current was that,

1928
01:49:03.501 --> 01:49:07.280
and then there are times where the first two,
uh,
to burry their dead,

1929
01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:12.340
which is a three p itself that some known human species or letter related to us,

1930
01:49:12.351 --> 01:49:14.660
but not us,
could do the exact same thing.

1931
01:49:14.970 --> 01:49:19.970
<v 0>Would it be crazy if humans learned how to see fair from neanderthals if homo</v>

1932
01:49:20.170 --> 01:49:23.220
sapiens humans cause they,
they actually work humans,
I'm saying it wrong,

1933
01:49:23.490 --> 01:49:27.000
but they did it before us supposedly.
Right.

1934
01:49:27.630 --> 01:49:30.990
But then there's other people that think that we have absorbed them.
You know,

1935
01:49:30.991 --> 01:49:33.780
in a,
in this,
this two different schools of thought on that.

1936
01:49:33.810 --> 01:49:36.480
One of them is that we interbred with them and one of his,
and no,

1937
01:49:36.481 --> 01:49:39.150
we just shared DNA from the get go and it's just,

1938
01:49:39.151 --> 01:49:40.650
we're better at understanding that now.

1939
01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.560
<v 4>Yeah.
They say that basically now I'm,</v>

1940
01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:45.600
they're adults in order to evolutionary dead end that there is no crossover with

1941
01:49:45.601 --> 01:49:48.070
human beings is only ancestral stuff or,
exactly.

1942
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:52.870
<v 1>Or instead a hat be Nando tell sex scenario where homosapien sapiens and now in</v>

1943
01:49:52.871 --> 01:49:54.880
their lab sites and dudes,
fuck dudes.

1944
01:49:54.881 --> 01:49:58.060
They would definitely fucking the Anatol check the old up to if they could get

1945
01:49:58.061 --> 01:50:00.040
some,
if they're in the middle of nowhere.

1946
01:50:00.041 --> 01:50:03.910
If you like hunting elk with a stick and you find some hot Niana tall chick and

1947
01:50:03.970 --> 01:50:07.960
she's ready to go,
you're like,
all right,
come on,
let's do it on.
It's on.
Yeah,
man.

1948
01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:08.440
Shit done.

1949
01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:12.640
I've traveled before and crows come through where we are on the road for days on

1950
01:50:12.641 --> 01:50:15.160
end and after a while from state after state,

1951
01:50:15.161 --> 01:50:17.530
you see the average woman be 300 pounds.

1952
01:50:17.531 --> 01:50:21.160
When suddenly you see at and their pound woman,
you're like,
oh my God,

1953
01:50:21.161 --> 01:50:24.230
that's so hot.
You know,
so it's just,
it's sold that I left.

1954
01:50:24.231 --> 01:50:25.570
If you make an adjustment,

1955
01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.050
you have yourself a Harem of neanderthal chicks then make you big,
thick,

1956
01:50:29.051 --> 01:50:33.670
baby's too big,
thick,
strong ones.
Hundred thousand years ago,

1957
01:50:33.671 --> 01:50:37.720
these guys were taking boats as far as a 12 kilometers.

1958
01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:42.010
That's pretty incredible.
That's really incredible.

1959
01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:44.920
Well actually some of them even 40 kilometers,

1960
01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:49.690
some of them made me even more ambitious journeys.
That sounds amazing.
I man,

1961
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:53.680
that's why.
How the fuck did homosapiens just occur?
I mean not,

1962
01:50:53.681 --> 01:50:57.850
it's not like it just occurred,
but if you really stop and look at us,
right,

1963
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.640
the fleshy weak ass bitches,
but very,

1964
01:51:00.670 --> 01:51:05.670
very clever and compare us to all the other apes is what a weird sort of a

1965
01:51:05.951 --> 01:51:09.340
journey to go from whatever the fuck it,
I mean,

1966
01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:13.870
I don't understand how the creation of species,
I understand the evolution,

1967
01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:16.030
what's the species has been established for the most part of it,

1968
01:51:16.130 --> 01:51:17.950
with what currently understood about that.

1969
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:19.990
I've sort of tried to wrap my head around that,

1970
01:51:20.110 --> 01:51:22.450
but I don't understand the emergence.
Like on our side,

1971
01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:25.460
it has a frog just become a frog.
How does that bird who were,

1972
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:29.170
where does an eagle come from?
You know,
like,
was there some steps along the way?

1973
01:51:29.171 --> 01:51:32.770
I'm sure there were.
The problem with the fossil record though,

1974
01:51:32.771 --> 01:51:37.771
it's that there's not enough evidence left behind to really piece and accurate.

1975
01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:41.110
Most Shit doesn't become a fossil.
No.
People that like,

1976
01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:44.530
people that have never really thought about it don't understand how difficult it

1977
01:51:44.531 --> 01:51:45.880
is to make a fossil.

1978
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:50.140
Like you have to have some sort of a cataclysmic situation where a volcano or a

1979
01:51:50.141 --> 01:51:53.920
mud slide or something traps the people,
um,
like,
uh,

1980
01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:59.720
amber SAP can trap million year old bugs and we learned a lot from that.

1981
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:05.830
Um,
but most people,
the your,
your nature just absorbs us.

1982
01:52:06.010 --> 01:52:10.360
Most animals nature absorbs them.
It's like you leave a bear,

1983
01:52:10.361 --> 01:52:12.670
a dead bear in the woods.
Like you come back in a month later,

1984
01:52:12.671 --> 01:52:14.410
there's nothing left.
No,
I mean,
that's fine.
In fact,

1985
01:52:14.411 --> 01:52:16.540
these three books are always the thick as the,
you know,

1986
01:52:16.541 --> 01:52:21.160
you go through the first 200,000 years of feast,
they're like two pages,

1987
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:24.220
then you go in the last 10 years there were like three books.

1988
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:28.180
Fake of it is not because he's any more interesting is because we know more.

1989
01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:29.860
You know,
that's what it boils down to.

1990
01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:34.690
I listened to this lecture once,
um,
I think it was,

1991
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:37.900
I think it was another Mckenna one where he was talking about if you had a

1992
01:52:37.901 --> 01:52:42.580
computer have sufficient power and you understood when variables and you

1993
01:52:42.581 --> 01:52:46.520
understood you could,
you could program the,

1994
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:51.550
<v 0>all the measurements from a sand dune and from that sand Dune,</v>

1995
01:52:51.651 --> 01:52:55.130
you could get a map of the wind and you could,

1996
01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:59.540
you could literally get an accurate representation of how fast the wind was

1997
01:52:59.541 --> 01:53:04.100
blowing and for how long and how did it create this from the,
this mass of sand.

1998
01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:05.840
And I always wondered like,

1999
01:53:05.841 --> 01:53:10.841
I wonder if what just what we can do now is so bizarre as far as exchange data

2000
01:53:12.861 --> 01:53:15.950
and as far as figure things out and communication,
uh,

2001
01:53:15.951 --> 01:53:20.951
wonder if it's possible to take the results of life on this planet in what we

2002
01:53:21.471 --> 01:53:26.000
know of over the last,
you know,
2030,

2003
01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:26.631
whatever it is,

2004
01:53:26.631 --> 01:53:31.631
a hundred years of accurate history and put what we know to be 100% true in some

2005
01:53:33.321 --> 01:53:38.321
sort of a gigantic mathematical program and extrapolate the past from that or

2006
01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:40.910
eh,

2007
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:45.320
or make a calculation from what we know and literally be able to get an accurate

2008
01:53:45.321 --> 01:53:49.370
representation of everything from single celled organisms to dinosaurs all the

2009
01:53:49.371 --> 01:53:53.810
way to a human being and recreate that in a way that people could actually
watch.

2010
01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:57.620
<v 6>That could be the kind of thing that 300 years from now standard we look now</v>

2011
01:53:57.690 --> 01:54:00.770
like really does bustards didn't know about that.
Of course he could do that.

2012
01:54:00.771 --> 01:54:05.420
Stupid.
Yeah.
Well they'll probably laugh at people with like a sex change too,

2013
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:07.550
right?
Like are you got to go and get your Dick cut off?
Dude,

2014
01:54:07.551 --> 01:54:10.970
why don't you just go into the sex change center,
press the button.

2015
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:16.520
I want to be a black woman.
Hold on the new like a fucking,
like a,

2016
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.530
like,
like fixing a hot pocket
one day.

2017
01:54:21.531 --> 01:54:23.480
That's if we can,

2018
01:54:23.481 --> 01:54:26.600
if we can make people look like women,

2019
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:30.760
we are going to be able to make you a woman one day,
you know?
Alright.

2020
01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:32.053
Unquestionably,
there's,

2021
01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:37.040
there's going to be some unbelievable manipulation of reality coming up in the

2022
01:54:37.041 --> 01:54:41.300
future.
Before that,
I'm imagining,
can you picture when they finally figured out,

2023
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:45.710
very rarely stick robots that look like humans and everybody can buy like the

2024
01:54:45.711 --> 01:54:50.540
hottest possible sex power nurse on the planet for like 500 bucks at target.

2025
01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:54.410
And,
uh,
people will never leave the house.
You know what I mean?

2026
01:54:54.411 --> 01:54:56.330
Is a society as we know,

2027
01:54:56.331 --> 01:55:00.290
it will come to an end once that sex toys will be perfect at it because no one

2028
01:55:00.291 --> 01:55:05.291
will leave the damn hours if you have in your closet 10 of the hottest women or

2029
01:55:05.391 --> 01:55:08.980
men or whatever
fucking party

2030
01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.480
fucking party.
And they will,
uh,
you know,
it's not even gave,

2031
01:55:14.481 --> 01:55:16.500
they're not real robot.

2032
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:21.920
You Fuck robot that day.
But look,
you're willing to fuck a flashlight,

2033
01:55:21.921 --> 01:55:23.330
but you're not willing to fuck a robot.
Dude.

2034
01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.260
What if someone made you a robot dude with the perfect vagina?

2035
01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:32.090
Everything else you know you had except the fact that it looked like a dude,

2036
01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:36.980
but God vagina.
Perfect.
No,
you wouldn't do it,

2037
01:55:36.981 --> 01:55:40.750
but you would fuck a fleshlight as long as you can contain it into a nonhuman

2038
01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:44.270
tube.
Exactly.
That's it.
Looked a guy for so

2039
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:49.100
<v 1>strange.
We had a dude on the other day who's a robotics expert.
Uh,</v>

2040
01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.910
Daniel H.
Wilson.
Fascinating guy.
Great conversation.
It was really easy.

2041
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.040
He freaked me the fuck out,
man.
There's,
we're talking about like,

2042
01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:00.840
when's the first guy gonna cut his legs off and put robot legs on?
It.
Really,

2043
01:56:00.841 --> 01:56:03.960
it really made me cringe when he said it.
Cause I was like,
he's right.

2044
01:56:03.961 --> 01:56:06.810
And that's going to happen.
Like there's gonna come a point in time.

2045
01:56:06.811 --> 01:56:09.690
We were talking about a amputees who never run in the Olympics with special

2046
01:56:09.691 --> 01:56:10.524
prosthetics.

2047
01:56:10.650 --> 01:56:14.340
And that one day they're going to have legs that are better than a human.

2048
01:56:14.341 --> 01:56:15.700
You're going to laugh at human legs,

2049
01:56:15.701 --> 01:56:17.910
so they're going to have some fucking awesome,

2050
01:56:18.150 --> 01:56:23.010
like they came up with some artificial skin cell that was a,

2051
01:56:23.011 --> 01:56:25.230
it was an,
it was mixed with steel.
I,

2052
01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:28.920
I got to understand how the fuck they did that.
Let me,
uh,
let me,

2053
01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:31.800
let me Google this real quick,
but it's the beginning.

2054
01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:37.820
It's an artificial human cell with somehow another fucking steel fibers woven

2055
01:56:38.071 --> 01:56:42.330
into it.
Yeah.
It's,
I dunno,

2056
01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:46.110
I dunno what the fuck they did.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't,

2057
01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:48.980
I don't totally understand it,
but they're,

2058
01:56:48.981 --> 01:56:53.910
they're able to create artificial cells now and they're,
it's not all like,

2059
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:57.930
it's not all with like,
uh,
like flesh.
Like they can,

2060
01:56:57.931 --> 01:56:59.820
they can do it with like varying materials.

2061
01:56:59.821 --> 01:57:03.190
Like they think they're going to be able to create skin,
um,

2062
01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:08.010
based on spider silk or spider webs that's bulletproof.
No Way.

2063
01:57:08.190 --> 01:57:08.521
Yeah.

2064
01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:13.521
That in the future they will be able to replace human skin with a bulletproof

2065
01:57:13.561 --> 01:57:17.730
substitute.
No,
come on.
You're making,
no,
no,
I'm not.
Yeah,

2066
01:57:17.731 --> 01:57:21.360
absolutely serious.
They're,
they're trying to mean they've,

2067
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:25.350
they've already figured out a way to make certain animals produce spider silk.

2068
01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:29.770
Is that Jeff facts?
One day we'll have it.
Well,

2069
01:57:30.670 --> 01:57:32.280
I don't think,
I think like Jeff,

2070
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:36.420
the problem at jetpacks is like they would have to be like all magnetized so

2071
01:57:36.421 --> 01:57:37.500
that you couldn't crash into each other.

2072
01:57:37.501 --> 01:57:39.720
Like you get really close like two magnets and Whoa.
Yeah.

2073
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.450
You fly on the flying cars.
Yeah.

2074
01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:44.970
That's why one of the reasons why helicopters never took off.

2075
01:57:45.450 --> 01:57:46.680
When they first made the helicopter,

2076
01:57:46.681 --> 01:57:49.530
they thought that it was going to replace the car.
That was the idea.

2077
01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:52.950
But then they realized it's people are too fucking stupid for that right now.

2078
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:55.650
Yeah.
There was a big helicopter crash in Manhattan.

2079
01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:59.250
That's a billionaire guy died and turns out he had his five year old daughter in

2080
01:57:59.251 --> 01:58:02.480
his lap and she was kicking the controls.
Oh,
you got to make it.
No,
she kicked it.

2081
01:58:02.481 --> 01:58:07.170
Controls the helicopter went into a fucking tailspin and they died.
Whoa.

2082
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:12.210
Yeah.
Whoops.
That's why helicopters can't replace cars.
No,
I mean,

2083
01:58:12.211 --> 01:58:12.480
shit,

2084
01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:15.330
it's Amena Code already when you're driving on the freeway and you look at all

2085
01:58:15.331 --> 01:58:17.610
the people driving either really,

2086
01:58:17.611 --> 01:58:20.730
we're not crushing into each other every cycle and know that it amazes me,

2087
01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:24.030
especially when you go and you see what fucking people put on their Twitter page

2088
01:58:24.330 --> 01:58:28.630
and then you go,
how is this ape staying in my lane?
It fucking dumb.
Dumb.
Yeah.

2089
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:32.220
Is that the product of the education system or is it,

2090
01:58:32.221 --> 01:58:35.190
there's a broad spectrum of the human mind and there's some people that are,

2091
01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:39.510
they're born ditch diggers.
I'll show them be definitely optional.
Goddammit.

2092
01:58:39.690 --> 01:58:41.350
This is coming from an educator,
ladies and gentlemen,

2093
01:58:41.351 --> 01:58:44.620
a very smart guy thinks there's ditch diggers.
Fuck.

2094
01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:46.540
I was hoping for for the best.

2095
01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:52.040
Is there a way like we can give them that?
What does that stuff,
uh,
uh,

2096
01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:55.320
from the limitless movie,
what was that Nzt that you,

2097
01:58:55.321 --> 01:58:58.670
you give people and they fucking become super smart.
He was like a lazy bitch.

2098
01:58:58.671 --> 01:59:01.120
And then he wrote a book in like a day and became a billionaire.

2099
01:59:01.230 --> 01:59:04.990
Kind of like the matrix support approach to learning where you plug in the thing

2100
01:59:04.991 --> 01:59:07.630
and you're like,
I know cofo.
Yeah,
exactly.
What little,

2101
01:59:07.631 --> 01:59:09.660
you know the brain chip that we were talking about earlier,

2102
01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:10.870
the guy gets a brain job.

2103
01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:15.220
Maybe that's going to save all the ditch diggers and then we'll just make robots

2104
01:59:15.221 --> 01:59:19.690
to ditch dicks,
dicks,
and six with our,
maybe I'm thinking about dicks.

2105
01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:24.830
Very Dick Oriented show.
So happy to,
well,

2106
01:59:25.070 --> 01:59:28.590
you've contributed to it,
sir.
You're here.
You're responsible to,

2107
01:59:28.591 --> 01:59:29.740
it's a fucking group environment.

2108
01:59:33.370 --> 01:59:35.010
Sorry,
go ahead.
Were you gonna say

2109
01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:40.880
you stop for say folks,

2110
01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:45.410
there is evolution everywhere.
Even here on the podcast grind,

2111
01:59:45.411 --> 01:59:46.590
red ban is catching himself

2112
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:49.190
<v 7>hog</v>

2113
01:59:49.190 --> 01:59:51.890
<v 1>for,
no,
it's not a call for.
That's a good thing.</v>

2114
01:59:51.891 --> 01:59:56.891
Then I said it was uncaught won't welcome to everybody's life.

2115
01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:00.350
Everybody in fall for this podcast has benefited from saying things were

2116
02:00:00.351 --> 02:00:04.310
uncalled for it,
you know,
I think the world could use a little more uncalled for.

2117
02:00:04.311 --> 02:00:06.880
Shit.
All right.
God dammit.
Everybody's,

2118
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:10.750
everybody wants everything to be beautiful and perfect and called for right

2119
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:14.690
sometimes.
No,
there's hiccups.
We're figuring this thing out as we move along.

2120
02:00:14.691 --> 02:00:18.170
Folks.
No one,
uh,
no one's got it down to a science.

2121
02:00:18.230 --> 02:00:21.020
None of those Buddhist monks even get laid.
Okay?

2122
02:00:21.050 --> 02:00:24.230
That's how you know the Buddhists are wrong.
They're wrong to everybody's wrong.

2123
02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:28.370
You know why they're wrong.
No Pussy.
That's several simple.
Have you ever had sex?

2124
02:00:28.371 --> 02:00:31.040
Yes.
Isn't it awesome?
Yes,
it is.
They're not having something awesome.

2125
02:00:31.250 --> 02:00:33.440
If you live your life and you don't experience something,

2126
02:00:33.441 --> 02:00:36.410
that's one of the best things that you can experience a year are missing out on

2127
02:00:36.411 --> 02:00:40.040
one of the best parts about this life.
And the idea is,
well,

2128
02:00:40.041 --> 02:00:42.200
it consumes you and you want to be free from that.

2129
02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:46.730
I don't have this and stop being a silly bitch.
Stop being silly,
bitch.

2130
02:00:46.731 --> 02:00:50.470
It doesn't have to consume you.
That's like someone who's a,
you know,
uh,

2131
02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:53.840
an alcoholic saying that no one should enjoy wine.
Right?
Well,

2132
02:00:53.841 --> 02:00:57.440
that's not true because some people can have wine and then they get laughing and

2133
02:00:57.441 --> 02:00:58.910
have a great conversation.

2134
02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:01.550
I have sex with someone they probably wouldn't have sex with.

2135
02:01:01.570 --> 02:01:04.280
And next thing you know,
oh,
jet's a millionaire.

2136
02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:06.410
It's not the wrong with wine folks.

2137
02:01:08.810 --> 02:01:12.740
And that to me is like the litmus test of a healthy religion is their attitudes

2138
02:01:12.741 --> 02:01:17.300
about sex at warming.
Guys,
he's like,
but even that,
there's some really weird,

2139
02:01:17.330 --> 02:01:20.210
I would join the Mormons before I would join any other religion,

2140
02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:23.360
especially old school ones.
It had eight wives block it.

2141
02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:27.350
I would go down to Mexico and join up with the Mitt Romney's clan,

2142
02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:29.060
take up guns against the cartels.

2143
02:01:31.730 --> 02:01:33.260
The least they had a bunch of wives.

2144
02:01:33.261 --> 02:01:36.890
I mean it seems like no one can figure out the whole monogamy thing that you

2145
02:01:36.891 --> 02:01:41.780
look at the divorce rate in America,
I think it's 51% right?
And uh,

2146
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:45.710
for primates it's zero.
It's zero.

2147
02:01:45.711 --> 02:01:50.540
Monogamous primates,
yes.
Zero.
No mean we're the only ones who pull it together.

2148
02:01:50.541 --> 02:01:52.280
We keep it together.
We'll keep it,
give it a flick.
And you know,

2149
02:01:52.281 --> 02:01:53.960
you keep it going for a hundred years,
then you'd die.

2150
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:58.270
But if people live to like be infinity,
how might your wet,

2151
02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:03.020
once ray Kurzweil's ideas come to light and we have endless existences,

2152
02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:06.500
what will we,
well,
you know what in the back then we'll have,

2153
02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:09.720
but by the time we get to that point,
I bet we'll have,
uh,

2154
02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:12.890
some sort of an artificial reality anyway that people would be enjoying more

2155
02:02:12.891 --> 02:02:14.780
than regular reality anyway.
Yeah.

2156
02:02:14.781 --> 02:02:17.870
Because there'll be some world of Warcraft shit that you can plug your brain

2157
02:02:17.871 --> 02:02:18.570
into.

2158
02:02:18.570 --> 02:02:20.570
<v 0>Yeah.
The Matrix is real.</v>

2159
02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:23.760
Did you ever fall simulation theory following fallen into these wacky

2160
02:02:23.761 --> 02:02:27.060
motherfuckers know scary shit,
man.
Yeah.

2161
02:02:27.570 --> 02:02:30.260
Cause it's based on mathematics.
They're finding,
well,
I'll,

2162
02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:34.050
I'll Google it because I don't really understand it,
but,
uh,

2163
02:02:34.130 --> 02:02:39.130
they're finding these mathematical equations inside string theory and they're a

2164
02:02:40.201 --> 02:02:45.160
self correcting and it's freaking people out because,
uh,

2165
02:02:45.170 --> 02:02:50.120
they're very,
uh,
I don't want me to pull this up here.
So correcting.

2166
02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:57.780
Yeah,
they're,
um,
they're,
they're finding this,
uh,
type of,

2167
02:02:57.810 --> 02:03:02.550
um,
self correcting computer code that they've,
uh,
they've,

2168
02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:05.640
they've known about since I believe it was like the 1940s.

2169
02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:09.770
And they're starting to find this in the equations of string theory.
It's very,

2170
02:03:09.790 --> 02:03:14.340
it's really fucking confusing because you don't understand.

2171
02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:15.690
Do you understand mathematics?

2172
02:03:15.691 --> 02:03:17.880
Like do you understand what they're talking about when they say the equations of

2173
02:03:17.881 --> 02:03:18.890
string theory?
Fuck no,

2174
02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:22.380
<v 1>no idea.
I mean Matt Dummies,
one of the mysteries of the universe.
Universities.</v>

2175
02:03:22.381 --> 02:03:26.450
No,
I'll go out to add in my head to subtract to do stuff that I actually use.

2176
02:03:26.451 --> 02:03:27.850
Anything else.
And that's it.

2177
02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:29.830
<v 5>I think you either have it or you down.</v>

2178
02:03:29.831 --> 02:03:32.950
I think that's like a part of your brain that's your active or not

2179
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:36.350
<v 1>because you think it's a nurture thing from childhood that like you,</v>

2180
02:03:36.351 --> 02:03:40.520
you like some people get stimulated as a child and they start pursuing that road

2181
02:03:40.521 --> 02:03:43.190
and then it becomes a part of their natural existence and then it becomes
normal.

2182
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:48.430
<v 5>I think it's your,
how your brain thinks.
Like if you're a certain way,</v>

2183
02:03:48.431 --> 02:03:51.130
a thought pattern,
it,
you're not,
you don't,

2184
02:03:51.131 --> 02:03:56.080
you don't get it as easy as somebody that's more number driven.
Like architects,

2185
02:03:56.140 --> 02:03:58.420
like architects a,
if you look at an architect,

2186
02:03:58.421 --> 02:04:02.020
most of them understand all this complex,
crazy shit,

2187
02:04:02.021 --> 02:04:06.270
but then you try to talk to him and it was just the most right one sided that

2188
02:04:06.271 --> 02:04:09.460
they only understand architecture kind of thing.
I don't know.

2189
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:13.520
<v 1>Yeah,
maybe.
Well,
I,
I certainly think if you,</v>

2190
02:04:13.550 --> 02:04:18.550
if you look at the human race as being like one big crazy giant organism,

2191
02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:21.770
you would think that everybody would have a part in it in order for it to,

2192
02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:26.840
to keep progressing and then it wouldn't really work the right way if everybody

2193
02:04:26.841 --> 02:04:28.940
was the same,
right?
If everybody was the same,

2194
02:04:29.210 --> 02:04:32.360
there really wouldn't be that much in innovation and nothing would get done.

2195
02:04:32.361 --> 02:04:35.630
So it almost makes sense that you're going to have,
you know,

2196
02:04:35.631 --> 02:04:38.100
mathematical prodigies that can't run

2197
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:41.420
<v 0>fast,
you know,
and then you're going to have dudes who are,</v>

2198
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:45.510
are really awesome at a space and distance and eye hand coordination,

2199
02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:49.320
but they just suck at putting numbers together or they suck at driving or you

2200
02:04:49.321 --> 02:04:53.220
know,
whatever.
That's not a good example.
But you know,
it seems like if you,

2201
02:04:53.250 --> 02:04:55.850
if you accept the fact that human beings,

2202
02:04:55.851 --> 02:04:58.570
so the only way we work is we work together.
That's the only way.
I mean you,

2203
02:04:58.571 --> 02:04:59.404
if you're a loner,

2204
02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:02.610
if you're one of those Ted Kaczynski guys live in the woods drinking your own

2205
02:05:02.611 --> 02:05:05.930
piss,
nobody trusts you.
Okay.
You know what,

2206
02:05:06.010 --> 02:05:09.150
why would I trust some guy who was up there a on the mountain top and it never

2207
02:05:09.151 --> 02:05:11.670
comes down and talks to people.
We,
we,

2208
02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:16.140
if we accept that we all are without question,
need each other,

2209
02:05:16.530 --> 02:05:20.900
then you kind of think that it's got a sort of how it must have some sort of

2210
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:22.530
formula to it,
you know,

2211
02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:27.780
which is why like I always felt like if things got bad,

2212
02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:30.870
you know,
things got overpopulated or things got crazy,

2213
02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:32.250
like there's always going to be like disease.

2214
02:05:32.251 --> 02:05:33.830
There's going to be some spring back.

2215
02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:36.240
It's always going to be something that tries to stop it.

2216
02:05:36.710 --> 02:05:39.830
<v 4>I mean,
of course does the less growth doesn't exist in nature.</v>

2217
02:05:39.831 --> 02:05:41.360
You know what I mean?
It's just you can,

2218
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:45.650
you can only heat go on for so long before eventually you hit your limits and

2219
02:05:45.651 --> 02:05:49.110
you come crushing down and just not gonna.
Uh,
you know,

2220
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:53.660
there's no animal species ever that can outstrip the,
it's the resources.

2221
02:05:53.661 --> 02:05:54.860
It just doesn't work right.

2222
02:05:54.861 --> 02:05:58.070
Because you run out of shit and we are smart so we can keep come up like pushing

2223
02:05:58.071 --> 02:06:01.550
the limits because we have a new technological innovation that allows us to get

2224
02:06:01.551 --> 02:06:05.300
more out of less space and all of that.
So we've played a game well,

2225
02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:09.290
but I mean you can only play it so long before eventually you don't come up with

2226
02:06:09.291 --> 02:06:12.020
something.
But he landed in the next a hundred years and then you're fucked.

2227
02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:13.171
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2228
02:06:13.171 --> 02:06:16.860
And when you look at how many people there are and how many people that used to

2229
02:06:16.861 --> 02:06:21.120
be,
yeah,
that's crazy.
And Sunday we've grown so quick.

2230
02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:26.600
It's not that look like we had doctor Peter Duesberg on who was the HIV guys

2231
02:06:27.810 --> 02:06:31.590
says HIV doesn't cause he was talking about the population in Africa tripling

2232
02:06:32.010 --> 02:06:34.520
the population's tripled over the past like 20 or 30 years.
Right.

2233
02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:37.750
<v 4>Fuck it's been,
did they started measuring?
It should not even that long ago.</v>

2234
02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:39.770
If you think like,
um,

2235
02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:44.860
something like the entire population of the United States in the year 8,900,

2236
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:50.060
so two and they're barely over 200 years was a about 5 million people.

2237
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:52.730
It's not even all of her late today.
You know what I mean?

2238
02:06:52.731 --> 02:06:57.620
Is like less than the entire population.
That was the whole population of us.

2239
02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:59.240
Less than a late today.

2240
02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:01.570
<v 0>Hey Brian,
this is loud as fuck.
What are you doing man?</v>

2241
02:07:04.210 --> 02:07:08.770
What's going on out there?
30 Asian women.
Oh,

2242
02:07:08.771 --> 02:07:10.420
you son of a bitch.
Have a seat.

2243
02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:17.440
They're all just hanging out right next to the studio for some reason.

2244
02:07:17.770 --> 02:07:19.530
Is that what you were going to check on the noise?
Yeah.

2245
02:07:19.870 --> 02:07:20.980
What the hell are these people?

2246
02:07:21.010 --> 02:07:24.010
But there's like a seriously like 38 and I'm going to check on the noise.

2247
02:07:24.070 --> 02:07:28.810
We've got an issue here behind you.
Check on the noise.
Um,

2248
02:07:29.710 --> 02:07:34.000
the,
that allowed us fuck someone.

2249
02:07:34.001 --> 02:07:36.040
Go stick a dick in her mouth.
Right?
And quickly

2250
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.850
<v 6>stop all that giggling.
Brian,
it's your duty for all these podcasts.
People.</v>

2251
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:42.400
What were we even talking about before we got to interrupted?

2252
02:07:42.401 --> 02:07:46.490
Besides computer theories and self correct purse.

2253
02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:50.740
Oh,
population population went from zero to 5 million.
Is that what you said?

2254
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:55.360
200 years ago.
Early on in the year 1800 fucking a that's insane.

2255
02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:58.030
That's a lot though.
If you really stop and think about it,
that's incredible.

2256
02:07:58.031 --> 02:08:00.580
They come over on boats and horses at 5 million of them,

2257
02:08:00.650 --> 02:08:05.650
but that's after two and 30 hours of colonizations and you know when she started

2258
02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:09.270
the very beginning you're really talking about,
you know,
so few people.
It is,

2259
02:08:10.090 --> 02:08:10.781
I don't know man.

2260
02:08:10.781 --> 02:08:13.420
He said one of the single verb population is one of the things that nobody wants

2261
02:08:13.421 --> 02:08:15.820
to talk about because he's uncomfortable cause what are you gonna do?

2262
02:08:15.821 --> 02:08:18.010
Tell people they can't have,
how many kids they want.

2263
02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:20.100
That's not a very nice seemed to do.

2264
02:08:20.101 --> 02:08:24.520
And at the same time you kind of have to at some point because you can't

2265
02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:26.140
possibly keep it going forever.

2266
02:08:26.230 --> 02:08:30.250
And eugenics is a really horrible subject.
You can,

2267
02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:31.540
you can never bring that up.

2268
02:08:31.541 --> 02:08:34.750
We never bring the idea up that you need to call the population even though

2269
02:08:34.751 --> 02:08:36.250
that's like a natural part of nature.

2270
02:08:36.251 --> 02:08:39.700
I said the strong survive because I mean the whole Chinese model off if you have

2271
02:08:39.701 --> 02:08:42.100
more than one kid will bash on the hat is effective,

2272
02:08:42.101 --> 02:08:45.520
but it's not exactly the most democratic thing getting the universe,
you know?

2273
02:08:45.521 --> 02:08:48.670
It's also not good for your,
your ideas of humanity,
right.

2274
02:08:48.671 --> 02:08:53.170
You look at when we talk about like human rights violations and poor living

2275
02:08:53.171 --> 02:08:57.130
conditions like China is like right up there on that list.
It's helpful.
You know,

2276
02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:59.410
as you look down at your Chinese made iPhone,

2277
02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:04.770
what a what a motherfucker that is what a mother fucker it is that the,

2278
02:09:04.771 --> 02:09:08.350
the minerals that came from that came from even worse conditions.

2279
02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:13.150
Some poor African kid digging a hole in the ground and that you need that shit

2280
02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:16.870
in order to make a cell phone while you're,
you're googling in Manhattan,

2281
02:09:16.871 --> 02:09:20.710
sitting on the corner looking out the window.
You know,
you,

2282
02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:25.480
you're the chain of what's happened to get that phone into your hand.

2283
02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:29.380
It's a,
it's dirty business at the very end of the chain.
That fancy.

2284
02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:34.600
It's fucked up man.
And we don't do anything about that.
You know the then,

2285
02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:37.560
well,
we need to get those trainees people more money if you can.
If you,

2286
02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:40.870
I don't care if he gave him $1,000 a month,
you know,
which is insane.

2287
02:09:40.871 --> 02:09:42.430
And I heard of that's still,

2288
02:09:42.431 --> 02:09:45.520
that's still not going to allow them to get the fuck out of there and improve

2289
02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:49.380
like that.
They're,
they're stuck.
Let's write,

2290
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:51.000
it cracks me up when I see we men,

2291
02:09:51.001 --> 02:09:54.760
we did big giant [inaudible] golfing engagement.
That's shit.
And I'm like,
okay,

2292
02:09:54.761 --> 02:09:55.571
that's about what,

2293
02:09:55.571 --> 02:10:00.550
27 young kids or 28 how many is,
yeah.

2294
02:10:00.670 --> 02:10:04.420
And not only that,
that's shits in warehouses.
We've got the,
the,

2295
02:10:04.421 --> 02:10:07.390
the diamond people,
they got that shit locked down.
They're so brilliant.

2296
02:10:07.810 --> 02:10:08.860
Those diamond people,

2297
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:12.370
they've managed to get people to pay for like stupid little shiny rocks and

2298
02:10:12.371 --> 02:10:14.410
paste incredible money.

2299
02:10:14.890 --> 02:10:19.720
I remember that commercial that they used to have isn't three years salary or

2300
02:10:19.721 --> 02:10:23.140
three months salary.
A small price to pay for a lifetime,

2301
02:10:23.141 --> 02:10:25.870
like three months for a rock.

2302
02:10:26.050 --> 02:10:30.610
Want you to work for three months or one rock.
Ooh,
three months.

2303
02:10:30.611 --> 02:10:34.420
It should be like a house.
And the old homesteading days,

2304
02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:37.190
if you worked for three months,
he built a house.
Yup.

2305
02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:42.020
Three months for a fucking shiny rock.
Holy Shit.

2306
02:10:42.110 --> 02:10:42.651
Which by the way,

2307
02:10:42.651 --> 02:10:46.550
you can make it just a shiny looking the exact same way and you'll have to look

2308
02:10:46.551 --> 02:10:49.850
through a glass to make sure it's not the original,
but no,
it's not real.

2309
02:10:49.930 --> 02:10:54.930
It's one of my favorite things about the rap culture is like big giant diamond

2310
02:10:55.281 --> 02:10:56.630
encrusted necklaces,

2311
02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:00.920
diamond chains and diamonds on the rings diamond and the teeth and diamonds in

2312
02:11:00.921 --> 02:11:01.521
their ears.

2313
02:11:01.521 --> 02:11:06.521
Like I love the bounce back from poverty to extreme wealth and how,

2314
02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:10.640
you know,
how flashy they are.
It's what,
to me,

2315
02:11:10.641 --> 02:11:13.760
one of the most fascinating aspects of humanity is like they're really over

2316
02:11:13.761 --> 02:11:15.260
showy rap guys.

2317
02:11:15.261 --> 02:11:19.210
Like throwing money on each other and standing in front of Ferrari's,
you know,

2318
02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:24.380
flexing their diamond rings.
Like fucking love it man.

2319
02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:28.130
I love it.
Check it bitch.
You know,

2320
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:31.800
it's just,
it's so fascinating.
And then there's,
you know,

2321
02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:36.500
people that are like of a old wealth like Prince Charles who would think that

2322
02:11:36.501 --> 02:11:41.240
would be garrish behavior and beyond embarrassing,
you know,

2323
02:11:41.241 --> 02:11:44.510
I would love to see a reality show where little Wayne had to live with Prince

2324
02:11:44.511 --> 02:11:49.511
Charles Lowe weighing it gets Prince Charles high as fuck.

2325
02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:53.900
And they go play Polo.

2326
02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:58.250
Hold on with flavor and Prince and Prince Charles talks,

2327
02:11:58.251 --> 02:12:01.520
any shit little Wayne goes,
you know,
they can't save you.
You know,

2328
02:12:01.521 --> 02:12:04.240
they can't save you.
Right.
Who were you talking to?

2329
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:08.090
No one did you ever see that interview where he's talking to the guy,

2330
02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:10.680
they go there,
they're doing a interrogation of him.

2331
02:12:10.690 --> 02:12:13.940
They're there for some fucking subpoena or something like that.
I know they're,

2332
02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.090
they're questioning him and the,
the question,

2333
02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:17.800
the guy's asking them a bunch of stupid questions.

2334
02:12:17.801 --> 02:12:20.720
So like he gets gangster with a guy and he goes,
you know,

2335
02:12:20.721 --> 02:12:24.920
he can't save you in the real world.
He can't save you.
I'm just letting you know.

2336
02:12:25.190 --> 02:12:27.350
And the guy's like,
what?
Are you threatening me?
He goes,
no,
not at all.

2337
02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:31.940
Just let you know.
They can't say it's like,
it's really creepy.

2338
02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:37.330
Has got Tattoos on his face and fucking giant rang sign from the street.

2339
02:12:39.230 --> 02:12:44.230
Do you have people in your school that come from varying economic backgrounds?

2340
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.780
They up.

2341
02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:47.360
You see the difference between people that come from like really poor countries

2342
02:12:47.361 --> 02:12:50.000
and made it to America and really appreciate the fucking shit out of it.

2343
02:12:50.001 --> 02:12:52.220
More than these sloppy people from Orange County.

2344
02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:56.960
They're living in Irvine their whole life.
Never even seen a bullet.
Yeah man.

2345
02:12:56.961 --> 02:12:59.130
I mean there's,
there's bullets.
That's what makes it fun.

2346
02:12:59.150 --> 02:13:01.340
You'll get people off officially community college.

2347
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:03.830
It's awesome because you've got people to a full ages.

2348
02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:07.340
You got people lethal [inaudible] February,
religions can call you name it,

2349
02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:07.611
you know,

2350
02:13:07.611 --> 02:13:11.820
so you find all sort of from the guy who was coming straight from South Santa

2351
02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:14.270
Hotels,
I'm sorry I got to late,
but there was,

2352
02:13:14.271 --> 02:13:16.970
they lock up my blog because they shot some dude on there,
my house,

2353
02:13:16.971 --> 02:13:20.510
and they're like,
fuck,
okay.
That's what you come to school,

2354
02:13:20.511 --> 02:13:24.590
the weight and the wine was like straight out of Beverly Hills.

2355
02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:29.000
It's like,
it's hilarious.
It's like,
really,
you guys sitting in the same class,

2356
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:32.750
those Compton dudes hook up with those Beverly hills checks and fuck you was

2357
02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:36.390
really not.
No,
no,
no,
no.
See,
some of them want to take a trip to the dark side,

2358
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:39.400
especially when they're like in school and they're experimenting right now.

2359
02:13:39.401 --> 02:13:41.730
It's my experiencing someone from a different culture.
I mean,

2360
02:13:42.030 --> 02:13:46.690
I'm just so amazed by these urban environments that you grew up in.
Yeah.

2361
02:13:46.710 --> 02:13:49.860
That actually,
is there a theme to today?
I think there might be.

2362
02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:54.150
I need to check off before I do this podcast.
The,
um,
the,

2363
02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:57.270
the most satisfying aspect of teaching for you as what?

2364
02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:01.020
It's the interaction with the people that's interacting with students.
He's fun.

2365
02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:03.540
You know,
that's one of those moments where he's like,
really?

2366
02:14:03.541 --> 02:14:07.200
Somebody pay me to talk about stuff I like with people who are cool.

2367
02:14:07.590 --> 02:14:09.810
Are you kidding me?
I mean,
which lottery did I wait?

2368
02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:14.130
This is too cool to be through.
So you're doing that as well with your podcast.

2369
02:14:14.190 --> 02:14:15.750
Uh,
for,
for those who don't know,

2370
02:14:15.751 --> 02:14:19.170
it's called a drunk in Dallas and Dallas is spelled with a t you fucking

2371
02:14:19.171 --> 02:14:23.630
imbeciles
undereducated Americans.
Um,

2372
02:14:23.670 --> 02:14:26.060
and you could go to a iTunes and it's in a,

2373
02:14:26.061 --> 02:14:30.150
the philosophy section right where it's at.
Yeah.
That could not give me to date,

2374
02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:34.980
even philosophy after two episodes where like for a few days where number wining

2375
02:14:34.981 --> 02:14:35.850
food,
also food.
Sure.

2376
02:14:35.851 --> 02:14:39.960
Granted the fact is probably the other three people in that category are people

2377
02:14:39.961 --> 02:14:43.580
who are broadcasting out of their mom's basement discussing the subtotal

2378
02:14:43.650 --> 02:14:45.960
differences between Nagel and Aristotle.

2379
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:49.650
But still it's still first in something that it was fun.
That's amazing.

2380
02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:53.190
And that's after how many weeks?
It was like the sec on that piece of the,
so,

2381
02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:53.491
you know,

2382
02:14:53.491 --> 02:14:57.240
then you got the bounce after a few days it goes down and all of that before a

2383
02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:59.520
few days we were like,
number one.
I'm like,
shit,
this is awesome.

2384
02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:04.570
How does the Itunes,
uh,
how do they measure?
They have design beauty in sinks.

2385
02:15:04.590 --> 02:15:06.990
They have,
it's by episode.
So whichever APP is that.

2386
02:15:06.991 --> 02:15:09.180
I think he a week at the most heats.

2387
02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:12.600
So of course all the more recent ones tend to be the more popular one because

2388
02:15:12.601 --> 02:15:15.330
the more people at least in a week and then they have a gender,

2389
02:15:15.331 --> 02:15:18.900
I think podcast history or Sam,
see where they measure the Avodah.
Jeff,

2390
02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:22.110
there are so many,
but I don't know exactly how they keep their statistics.

2391
02:15:22.111 --> 02:15:25.830
It's subscribers,
new subscribers,
new comments,

2392
02:15:25.860 --> 02:15:29.400
nude in downloads.
You know what else it is crashed.

2393
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:33.210
I tunes his fucking crash right now.
God dammit.
Apple.

2394
02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:35.430
I think application not responding.
Brian.

2395
02:15:35.431 --> 02:15:38.910
Brian then upgraded to your snow leopard.
Yet.
Listen,
son of a bitch.

2396
02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:44.130
I like to keep shit old school.
I'm tired of them.
What?
They updates.
It's working.

2397
02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:45.480
It's working fine.
Stupid.

2398
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:48.420
Stop changing things and allowing the government to look at my emails.

2399
02:15:48.970 --> 02:15:51.060
See My dick pictures that I send myself.

2400
02:15:52.650 --> 02:15:57.210
More Dick Board folks,

2401
02:15:57.211 --> 02:15:59.820
I'm not gonna lie to Ya.
We might've got a little high before the show.

2402
02:15:59.821 --> 02:16:02.520
I'm not going to lie to you.
Some of this might be silly.
Never happens.

2403
02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:06.140
Navara why would you with Daniela Bolelli ever.

2404
02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:09.360
That is one advantage though that you must have with the ladies is that accent

2405
02:16:09.361 --> 02:16:13.470
man,
chicks love a very good European French,
English,

2406
02:16:13.471 --> 02:16:17.220
some along those lines.
But Italian woof is pretty good,
right?

2407
02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:20.780
I'm very unfair advantage.
I must have think.
Yes,
look at that.

2408
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:23.820
Being honest with us.
You went that good grade.
I'm looking,

2409
02:16:23.821 --> 02:16:26.850
I'm going to look under philosophy.
See where you at right now.
Do you know?
No,

2410
02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:29.280
I didn't check in a few days.
I didn't even see philosophy.

2411
02:16:29.290 --> 02:16:32.380
I see religion and spirituality,
science and medicine.

2412
02:16:32.530 --> 02:16:35.950
It's under our society and culture and society and culture.

2413
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:38.650
I think we deem that day.
That seems like life.

2414
02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:40.310
How can you have society and I mean,

2415
02:16:40.350 --> 02:16:43.690
I mean we could have an MMA podcast and it could be under society and culture.

2416
02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:47.830
That was actually the funny thing of the first,
uh,
you know,
precisely.

2417
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:51.520
I mean I'm under society and culture.
The Joe Rogan experience,
society,

2418
02:16:51.550 --> 02:16:52.660
culture socket,

2419
02:16:53.070 --> 02:16:57.400
let's Id the tags that are ridiculous because they are like,

2420
02:16:57.430 --> 02:16:58.450
it's about most of it.

2421
02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:01.870
Unless you're really dedicating a podcast specifically to one issue.

2422
02:17:01.930 --> 02:17:06.340
It's about life.
That's what it boils down to.
That as it should be,
right?
Yeah.

2423
02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:08.650
As it should be.
The um,

2424
02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:13.740
the name of the podcast again is drunk and Taoist and I can't find it in here

2425
02:17:13.761 --> 02:17:15.940
and what I can't find philosophy.

2426
02:17:15.941 --> 02:17:20.500
Is there a specific section that says philosophy?
The philosophy.
You've got it.

2427
02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:25.520
Yeah.
There it goes.
It's a subsection of a subsection.
Yay.

2428
02:17:25.590 --> 02:17:27.850
I'll call as for a few days.
The first thing,

2429
02:17:27.851 --> 02:17:29.330
that subsection of the first subsection,

2430
02:17:29.350 --> 02:17:33.850
but I'm not anymore so that's pretty dope.
What number are you right now?

2431
02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:36.820
I have no idea.
I was like seeks a few days ago,
but that's,

2432
02:17:36.821 --> 02:17:39.610
I'm sure it bounced out cause we haven't done a new one.
If you say son,

2433
02:17:39.611 --> 02:17:41.080
we're going to change that shit for you.

2434
02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:43.610
<v 1>We're going to find it.
I can't find it.
I don't know where it is,</v>

2435
02:17:43.611 --> 02:17:46.280
but it's drunken Taoist,
t.

2436
02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:50.330
A.
O.
I.
S.
T.
You heard me?

2437
02:17:50.780 --> 02:17:54.050
That's how you spell it.
You freaks.
I'll put a link up to it on a,

2438
02:17:54.051 --> 02:17:57.560
on Twitter and a man.
Thanks so much brother.
Thank you very much man.

2439
02:17:57.561 --> 02:18:01.670
Another fun and fascinating podcasts or waste my drunken Dallas Danieli will

2440
02:18:01.671 --> 02:18:04.610
Ellie,

you're a good man.
Danieli always good to talk to you,
brother.
Joe,

2441
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:07.600
if there's ever anything we can do for you or anything you want to promote and

2442
02:18:07.601 --> 02:18:11.780
please let us know.
Uh,
thank you to everybody tuning into the podcast.

2443
02:18:11.781 --> 02:18:14.960
Thanks to a,
all the positive energy,

2444
02:18:14.961 --> 02:18:19.270
all the love and all the information that you guys give me an a feedback and all

2445
02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:22.430
that shit.
We're getting through this all together.
And uh,

2446
02:18:22.431 --> 02:18:25.490
I would not be able to do it without you and I would not have the same feeling

2447
02:18:25.491 --> 02:18:29.390
without all the love and all the,
the,
the positive reactions and all the,
the,

2448
02:18:29.391 --> 02:18:32.630
the positive response that we get.
We appreciate the fuck out of it.

2449
02:18:32.631 --> 02:18:36.620
And I know Brian does and I know everybody else.
Does.
Joey and Orient Doc,

2450
02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:39.050
can we talk about it all the time?
We,
we love the fuck out of you guys.

2451
02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:43.550
Thank you very much.
Thanks to all the sponsors.
You know who the fuck you are.

2452
02:18:43.551 --> 02:18:47.450
I'm not saying you at the end anymore,
goddammit.
But a go to death squad.
Dot TV.

2453
02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:51.020
Um,
uh,
that's Brian's site and that's how you get yourself one of those sweet

2454
02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:55.640
psychedelic kittycat tee shirts that I see at all the shows now.

2455
02:18:55.641 --> 02:18:58.760
And I saw him in Montreal.
It was fucking awesome.
It was,
it's beautiful when I,

2456
02:18:58.790 --> 02:19:01.870
when I look out there and that audience,
when I see those death squad shirts,

2457
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:03.980
I know him.
And,
uh,
I'm know I'm winning.

2458
02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:05.880
<v 6>You're good family.
Um,
with family,</v>

2459
02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:11.350
his mother Fucker,
that was his,
that was his long,

2460
02:19:11.650 --> 02:19:14.950
long game.
That was his checkmate from a long distance.

2461
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:18.160
I'm going to be a in San Diego Wednesday by Doug Benson now.

2462
02:19:18.430 --> 02:19:19.420
Powerful American comedy.

2463
02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:23.850
<v 1>Beautiful.
And uh,
I will be here with Joey Diaz Wednesday night,</v>

2464
02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:27.030
the night before Thanksgiving,
uh,
at the ice house comedy.

2465
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:30.380
We've got a 10 o'clock show.
Greg Fitzsimmons is going to be there.

2466
02:19:30.381 --> 02:19:35.090
Adam Hunter who wrote that joke that I got in trouble telling on Fx to really

2467
02:19:35.091 --> 02:19:38.450
get in trouble.
It caused a commotion.
And,
uh,
you know,

2468
02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:42.000
I said a joke that Adam Hunter had a really funny joke about Martin Kampmann and

2469
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:45.690
he said,
Martin from behind it,
it's it,
but it's a funny fucking joke,

2470
02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:48.160
be upset because there's,
you know,

2471
02:19:48.170 --> 02:19:51.140
children listening and so I didn't even think about it.
I'm an idiot.
Oh comedian.

2472
02:19:51.141 --> 02:19:55.660
Okay.
But the Pipi what bothers me that people called it homophobic and a,

2473
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:59.990
that is not a homophobic joke.
Okay.
Because anything that's gay,

2474
02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:03.980
if you mentioned something gay,
it's automatically deemed to be negative.

2475
02:20:03.981 --> 02:20:08.180
I joke about you're not even supposed to joke about things that are gay or gay

2476
02:20:08.181 --> 02:20:12.410
sex or anything and he won.
That's gay.
Cause if you do somehow it's a negative,

2477
02:20:12.411 --> 02:20:17.330
I think.
I say,
fuck you.
I say,
that's stupid.
That is absolutely ridiculous.

2478
02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:22.010
Everything is on the table.
As long as you know,
you have good intentions.

2479
02:20:22.011 --> 02:20:25.580
And my intention was only to make people laugh and it was a,

2480
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:30.020
because Adam Hunter is a funny dude and he'll be on the show a Wednesday as well

2481
02:20:30.021 --> 02:20:33.770
as,
uh,
like I said,
Greg Fitzsimmons,
Joey Diaz,
Sam triple,
he's going to be there.

2482
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:38.660
And,
uh,
we'll find some other cool guys,
uh,
that are in town,
um,
that,
uh,

2483
02:20:38.661 --> 02:20:41.880
our,
uh,
local standups,
but 10 o'clock,

2484
02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:45.160

And,
uh,

2485
02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:50.440
