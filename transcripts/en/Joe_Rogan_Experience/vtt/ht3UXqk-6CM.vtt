<v Speaker 1>Vacation with your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>we're going to Lanai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>that'd be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're alive.</v>

5
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of vacations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me about Guyana.</v>

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good segue.</v>

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.240
<v Speaker 1>He'd been there a bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

9
00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:16.510
<v Speaker 1>why was in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

10
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I've been to Guyana twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but between there I went to Bolivia and</v>

11
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>did like very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar kind of trip,</v>

12
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>like doing a river trip with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amerindians.</v>

13
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Are those people weirded out by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans?</v>

14
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Because the Jonestown massacre thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny you bring up jealous town</v>

15
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>because there's a couple things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>been like,</v>

16
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.263
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.220
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

18
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main group I was with in Guyana,</v>

19
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the,</v>

20
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>and I'll surprise one day when I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make a dish,</v>

21
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.940
<v Speaker 1>they make a dish with cassava,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a route like maniac.</v>

22
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make a dish with that.</v>

23
00:00:56.831 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>They make a flower from it and make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dish.</v>

24
00:00:58.541 --> 00:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>And I was one day saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

25
00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like pizza,</v>

26
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

27
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.213
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

28
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>No comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

29
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.490
<v Speaker 1>no thought of what pizza is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking like,</v>

30
00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>wow man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something,</v>

31
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 1>you take such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.500
<v Speaker 1>you just consider such a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday life.</v>

33
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It's good to know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.430
<v Speaker 1>And they don't know about Georgetown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

35
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Even though was in their own country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know about it at all.</v>

36
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not.</v>

37
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 1>But yet like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get into this,</v>

38
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:28.540
<v Speaker 1>but you got to like realize sort of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>insular,</v>

39
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the Amerindian communities are who</v>

40
00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:37.570
<v Speaker 1>live in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the jungle in Guyana,</v>

41
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have communication on any new yet</v>

42
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.470
<v Speaker 1>more and more now.</v>

43
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.360
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot changed.</v>

44
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>The two times I went there with five or</v>
<v Speaker 1>six years apart,</v>

45
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>they discovered sunglasses and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

46
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>The first time I was down there trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn them on because uh,</v>

47
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

48
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.820
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bow hunt for fish,</v>

49
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one of the main ways they get</v>

50
00:01:56.531 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 1>phished bow hunting for fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're looking into the water,</v>

51
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>polarized lenses are invaluable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel lost without fish underwater.</v>

52
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.780
<v Speaker 1>And I kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

53
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>you got to get on board with polarized</v>
<v Speaker 1>sunglasses.</v>

54
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Not Hand in to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

55
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.570
<v Speaker 1>he didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy wrote and he didn't like</v>

56
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 1>anything about having them on his face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just couldn't do it.</v>

57
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 1>But then I go down to five years later</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

58
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.700
<v Speaker 1>everyone of those boys is rocket</v>
<v Speaker 1>polarized glasses.</v>

59
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.620
<v Speaker 1>So you see changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

60
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

61
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I've brought up Jonestown a number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times because in the US,</v>

62
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.531
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

63
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Guyana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all anybody says don't drink the</v>

64
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Koolaid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

65
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Really cool aid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was some like who late?</v>

66
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a Koolaid type.</v>

67
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.281
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

68
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:43.000
<v Speaker 1>So when people look at when we had this</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

69
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:44.530
<v Speaker 1>because there's a couple of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are important here.</v>

70
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>What the poison was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>So we had a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked back up the route,</v>

72
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.061
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

73
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 1>That they make a sava.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>So there's a root cassava and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the route that gives all life.</v>

75
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>They eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it.</v>

76
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean they eat fish and game.</v>

77
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>River fish and wild game.</v>

78
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.870
<v Speaker 1>And then that's like a staple the data</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

79
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the everyday is a half dozen things all</v>

80
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>produced from cassava,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of like a Yam and it's</v>

81
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>cultivated with slash and burn</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture and they cultivate these</v>

82
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 1>yams and from it they make a flower.</v>

83
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make a type of grain.</v>

84
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:31.951
<v Speaker 1>It's like cous cous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make a syrup that's used as a</v>

85
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:37.741
<v Speaker 1>coloring agent in a flavoring agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make a non alcoholic drink,</v>

86
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>they make a somewhat alcoholic drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be like an equivalent to</v>

87
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 1>beer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they make a much more alcoholic</v>

88
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:46.920
<v Speaker 1>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be an equivalent like</v>

89
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>fortified wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

90
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 1>They make all this stuff from this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this route that they grow</v>

91
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>in its raw form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you shred the root in squeeze the</v>

92
00:03:58.211 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>shredding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be like,</v>

93
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>imagine you took a Yam and shredded a</v>
<v Speaker 1>yam and then squeeze the amd between</v>

94
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 1>your hands and tripped out of liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That liquid is deadly poisonous.</v>

95
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dogs,</v>

96
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

97
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>anything that drinks that liquid dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

98
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's cyanide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Jonestown massacre,</v>

99
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a cocktail of the best.</v>

100
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:27.391
<v Speaker 1>People think that it was koolaid flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aid volume and potassium.</v>

101
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Cyanide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my question coming home from Ghana was</v>

102
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.123
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they,</v>

103
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>was the cyanide from the route where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like doing homemade cyanide,</v>

104
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so when I got home I looked into</v>

105
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 1>this and it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems as though that commune,</v>

106
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Jonestown commune had been ordering</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual potassium cyanide,</v>

107
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>which is used in a number of mining</v>
<v Speaker 1>practices and other stuff.</v>

108
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an available,</v>

109
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.750
<v Speaker 1>it's an available compound and dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They laced the Koolaid width.</v>

110
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>I'd heard about this cassava stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

111
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>do they know what the process is like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they know,</v>

112
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>like how people figured out how to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it non poisonous and help.</v>

113
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just been done so long.</v>

114
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same stuff with like different</v>

115
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>poisons they use to poison the that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people use to poison fish.</v>

116
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>What strikes me about it is how in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>village,</v>

117
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.530
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

118
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Macusa village I was in,</v>

119
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is mostly Macusa,</v>

120
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>but there's also like Wapa Shoshana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another tribe.</v>

121
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Carob is no our tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's predominantly a Macusa village</v>

122
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>and there's about 300 people with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in this village</v>

123
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>and how careless they are with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid.</v>

124
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Like if you nowadays like picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're like the type of person to</v>

125
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>like you and me are married to and raise</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids with.</v>

126
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had that type of mom and you had</v>

127
00:05:55.691 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 1>a big bowl of liquid that would kill you</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you drank a bit.</v>

128
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 1>How that bowl would be monitored in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>household?</v>

129
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be like barbed wire around it.</v>

130
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Electrical fence and how do they sit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Lazy.</v>

131
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>They just lay it out and I said I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked.</v>

132
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:17.700
<v Speaker 1>This guy wrote them at him and I kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>returning to this.</v>

133
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.580
<v Speaker 1>There's certain things I can always ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just like things that he</v>

134
00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>struggled to understand my fixation on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

135
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.970
<v Speaker 1>but I kept saying to this Macusa Guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rove,</v>

136
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>who I should back up too.</v>

137
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.840
<v Speaker 1>I got communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So guy out is.</v>

138
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>It's the only English speaking country</v>
<v Speaker 1>in South America.</v>

139
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

140
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

141
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government functions or English.</v>

142
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you picture yourself America,</v>

143
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>it's northeast corner opening out onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>the southern Caribbean.</v>

144
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>That's guy on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bordered on the east by</v>

145
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the West by Venezuela to the</v>

146
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:58.841
<v Speaker 1>south by Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 90 percent virgin rain forest and</v>

147
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>within that 90 percent of virgin</v>
<v Speaker 1>rainforest is only 10 percent of the</v>

148
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the coastal people's are like creole</v>

149
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People mostly descended from slave</v>

150
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europeans in the interior are the</v>

151
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:17.681
<v Speaker 1>Amerindian groups and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government functions sort of the</v>

152
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 1>power in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Guyana is that as the coastal peoples</v>

153
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.570
<v Speaker 1>and there's not a ton of interest and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be barely any interplay between</v>

154
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>the Amerindian communities in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

155
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>the government's English speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>

156
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>English mixed in,</v>

157
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.550
<v Speaker 1>in the Amerindian communities in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like this Guy Rovan because he's</v>

158
00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:41.080
<v Speaker 1>sort of a upping.</v>

159
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:41.990
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a,</v>

160
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>he has a leadership role in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>community and he's learned just standard</v>

161
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 1>English very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's had a fascinating life.</v>

162
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Just how much stuff has changed for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

163
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just converse.</v>

164
00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way that you can converse in like</v>

165
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:04.010
<v Speaker 1>an a type of the type of English we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking right now almost,</v>

166
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.930
<v Speaker 1>which creates this weird tension between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that you're discussing and</v>

167
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 1>how you're discussing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>

168
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>to have a guy just in conversational</v>
<v Speaker 1>English talking about problems they're</v>

169
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 1>having with neighboring shamans in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own shaman,</v>

170
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 1>putting curses on each other and it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates like there's like a strange</v>

171
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>tension between like how it's being</v>
<v Speaker 1>conveyed to you,</v>

172
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how so like,</v>

173
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking conversational</v>

174
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess like a life.</v>

175
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you'd want it to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's telling you this,</v>

176
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:42.611
<v Speaker 1>you'd almost want to be reading it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>like closed caption and he'd be saying</v>

177
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 1>it in the indigenous language because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds weird to have to,</v>

178
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.910
<v Speaker 1>to have an idea that's so foreign to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be like a battle of shamans</v>

179
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.350
<v Speaker 1>battling over access to wild animals.</v>

180
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

181
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>to have that delivered in conversational</v>
<v Speaker 1>English just struck me as unusual</v>

182
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 1>because usually when you're traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting all of your information</v>

183
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 1>like traveling and Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy would tell a story and he'd tell a</v>

184
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:11.780
<v Speaker 1>story in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

185
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Tsimshian no one was saying that Shan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimani.</v>

186
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tells story in Chimani to a person</v>

187
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>who spoke Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person who speaks Spanish would tell</v>

188
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>it to a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

189
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.031
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

190
00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimani guy telling someone who speaks</v>

191
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that person telling it</v>

192
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 1>to a person who speaks Spanish and</v>
<v Speaker 1>English and then that person giving you</v>

193
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 1>the information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get it through that it takes on</v>

194
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:46.370
<v Speaker 1>a mythical quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're crossing some space time</v>

195
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

196
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing like these ideas discussed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their ancestral tongue.</v>

197
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

198
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember I sent you a video of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy talking about killing a Jaguar?</v>

199
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

200
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.670
<v Speaker 1>The language you've never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when he's speaking,</v>

201
00:10:00.671 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never in all my travels,</v>

202
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:05.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd never heard of language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds anything like that is a video</v>

203
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:06.410
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we play that?</v>

204
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.490
<v Speaker 1>It's online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was,</v>

205
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>do you know the title of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

206
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I think if you type in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

207
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Chimani t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s I Chimani Jaguar,</v>

208
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.620
<v Speaker 1>seatac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if Jamie can you pull it up?</v>

209
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.310
<v Speaker 1>It's very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The language is really amazing.</v>

210
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Seem so ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

211
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not like has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Latin languages.</v>

212
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Just sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very unique.</v>

213
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 1>So I guess what I'm getting at is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear someone talking about something in</v>

214
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>conversational English that seems so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>removed from just our understanding of</v>

215
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes on a weird quality.</v>

216
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 1>But what's nice about it is you can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a place where life is so vastly</v>

217
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:46.650
<v Speaker 1>different than anything we understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

218
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.420
<v Speaker 1>and just get like the straight dope</v>
<v Speaker 1>right from the source is why I love is</v>

219
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like what's so cool about Guyana</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can go and converse with</v>

220
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 1>people who are very much a hunter</v>
<v Speaker 1>gatherer culture today,</v>

221
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 1>but just shoot the shit with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>without ever feeling like you're missing</v>

222
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the.</v>

223
00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Everything's not lost in translation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all weird and garbled and in like</v>

224
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 1>painstaking to wade through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can just ask like,</v>

225
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:16.860
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with the local shyman?</v>

226
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you the dope on the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they trade spells.</v>

227
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

228
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:23.481
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

229
00:11:23.481 --> 00:11:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I was laying the groundwork</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a,</v>

230
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.410
<v Speaker 1>the Jim Jones poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find the video?</v>

231
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I thought I lost the word that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>spelling.</v>

232
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.010
<v Speaker 1>T S I m a n e</v>

233
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.580
<v Speaker 1>t s I m a n e.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

234
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Chimani.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they spell it out.</v>

235
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Or they're being screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

236
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.120
<v Speaker 1>You spell a lot worse when you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually writing it out.</v>

237
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrible.</v>

238
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how anybody wins a spelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>bee ever.</v>

239
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Toumani Tsi.</v>

240
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you type in Chimani Jaguar,</v>

241
00:11:57.041 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 3>t s I m a n e Jaguar.</v>

242
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.143
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

243
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.700
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is an Amerindian hunter</v>
<v Speaker 3>remembers his best dog lost to a Jaguar</v>

244
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.410
<v Speaker 3>in the jungles of Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

245
00:12:09.411 --> 00:12:11.030
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's play this because it's fucking</v>

246
00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:11.864
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

247
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.403
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>

248
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.100
<v Speaker 5>Following is an interview with a member</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the tribe of Bolivia.</v>

249
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.300
<v Speaker 5>Do their inherent difficulties of</v>
<v Speaker 5>translating indigenous languages.</v>

250
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:28.310
<v Speaker 5>Subtitles are at times approximate</v>
<v Speaker 5>income.</v>

251
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.880
<v Speaker 5>So he's explaining where he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying he hunts for food.</v>

252
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.190
<v Speaker 5>I always share that with my family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a good provider of me cutting up the</v>

253
00:12:47.191 --> 00:12:52.050
<v Speaker 5>meat in this video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I also enjoyed the adventure.</v>

254
00:12:52.051 --> 00:12:57.051
<v Speaker 5>I love trekking through the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once I was hunting with my favorite dog</v>

255
00:12:57.251 --> 00:13:00.710
<v Speaker 5>and a couple of the dogs that ran ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>barking,</v>

256
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 5>they were going after something you meet</v>
<v Speaker 5>kit you.</v>

257
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.690
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden my favorite dog just</v>
<v Speaker 5>went completely silent.</v>

258
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.970
<v Speaker 5>There were about 50 meters ahead of me</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I got to the other dogs had gone</v>

259
00:13:13.971 --> 00:13:17.600
<v Speaker 5>ahead after something</v>
<v Speaker 5>to hear.</v>

260
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.180
<v Speaker 5>Can You</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep</v>

261
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.790
<v Speaker 5>saying my favorite dogs laying there</v>
<v Speaker 5>dead.</v>

262
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 5>There was a big homeless right side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almost looked like it had been arrowed</v>

263
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.680
<v Speaker 5>if we didn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first thing I did was pick up my dog</v>

264
00:13:30.681 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 5>and said them where the ants wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>get those body.</v>

265
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:39.090
<v Speaker 5>That dog was the bravest one I had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to translate information</v>

266
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.090
<v Speaker 3>that's just watching the video if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>interested,</v>

267
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:47.660
<v Speaker 3>but you get a sense of how cool it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the recover.</v>

268
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Do we fully cover the poison things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

269
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got home it yet,</v>

270
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:52.420
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't the same poison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

271
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Jim Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

272
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.030
<v Speaker 3>he grew up in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

273
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was involved in a pentecostal church.</v>

274
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:04.171
<v Speaker 3>He's involved in the methodist church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he kind of became a healer and</v>

275
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 3>started his own cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was funny.</v>

276
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:09.910
<v Speaker 3>I was reading about him when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out the poison.</v>

277
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:12.820
<v Speaker 3>I was reading about how he was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead of his time because the Jim Jones</v>

278
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:17.821
<v Speaker 3>massacre in 1979 and a 78 or 79 and one</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to guide them sideways,</v>

279
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.830
<v Speaker 3>but with his church was that he wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have an interracial service.</v>

280
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.160
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that caused friction in his church</v>

281
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:32.200
<v Speaker 3>at the time earlier in his career and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved out to the bay area and started</v>

282
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:35.230
<v Speaker 3>this church and then he got like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>paranoid and thought that his</v>

283
00:14:35.231 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 3>congregants shouldn't be engaging in</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual activities,</v>

284
00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:41.140
<v Speaker 3>but he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was syring illegitimate children left</v>

285
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:43.180
<v Speaker 3>and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go down to Guyana,</v>

286
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.440
<v Speaker 3>go out to the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

287
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.590
<v Speaker 3>a thousand of them down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People in the US from the bay area kind</v>

288
00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 3>kinda like wondering what happened to</v>
<v Speaker 3>their loved.</v>

289
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 1>They send a congressman down there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out what's going on.</v>

290
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:59.720
<v Speaker 1>He shows up with a bunch of cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The congressman says,</v>

291
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

292
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to help anyone who wants to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the bay area,</v>

293
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.270
<v Speaker 1>go back to the bay area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the airstrip.</v>

294
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 1>It was a shootout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The congress,</v>

295
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.200
<v Speaker 1>the US congressmen gets killed in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shootout and then data all start killing</v>

296
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:17.201
<v Speaker 1>themselves with the poison and firearms</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other shit.</v>

297
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred and 70 some kids over 900</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

298
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

299
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like the defining thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then yeah,</v>

300
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:26.480
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to these boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

301
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Georgetown,</v>

302
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:28.920
<v Speaker 1>like the Jonestown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

303
00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.660
<v Speaker 1>the Jim Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonestown massacre and never drink the</v>

304
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.493
<v Speaker 1>Koolaid to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

305
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.730
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had heard it was budget koolaid.</v>

306
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the summit.</v>

307
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.210
<v Speaker 1>It was an I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a debate and in trying to</v>

308
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:44.790
<v Speaker 1>find like trying to like dig around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>find the source of the cyanide,</v>

309
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 1>which became very important to me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn for some reason.</v>

310
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

311
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I think Koolaid even tried to distance</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself from it was.</v>

312
00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.370
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some archival stuff and I guess</v>

313
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.540
<v Speaker 1>in this archival stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>images like footage taken around and</v>

314
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 1>photographs around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have found out that they had both</v>

315
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:07.880
<v Speaker 1>flavor aid and Koolaid on hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

316
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.130
<v Speaker 1>What it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koolaid propaganda that's trying to pass</v>

317
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:12.440
<v Speaker 1>the buck on the flavor aid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

318
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no thing there.</v>

319
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:18.080
<v Speaker 1>And if you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you go up the main river that</v>

320
00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:22.340
<v Speaker 1>drains the main river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that drains guy on his elbow and if you</v>

321
00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:24.620
<v Speaker 1>go way up the ESC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weebo and um,</v>

322
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get to in a stream that comes in</v>

323
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:30.140
<v Speaker 1>from there called the roup annuity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go up the roof annuity and then you</v>

324
00:16:30.141 --> 00:16:34.640
<v Speaker 1>get to the reward and at the mouth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] in Rupa Nuni is real</v>

325
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.900
<v Speaker 1>village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in [inaudible] village you're a</v>

326
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.860
<v Speaker 1>isolated enough where you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 900 Americans and in some other</v>

327
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.180
<v Speaker 1>people from other areas night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.160
<v Speaker 1>dying in a mass suicide.</v>

329
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's around the time you were born.</v>

330
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.340
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating that it's why it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense though,</v>

331
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.140
<v Speaker 1>that they're just so removed from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>

332
00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

333
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.730
<v Speaker 1>do they use agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how are they getting this esop day</v>

334
00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 1>grow peppers and then they grow the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cassava and the cassava,</v>

335
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:07.970
<v Speaker 1>like it's kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

336
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always hear about slash and burn</v>

337
00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:15.371
<v Speaker 1>agriculture so they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll go in and do a slash and burn in</v>

338
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.610
<v Speaker 1>the spot out in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

339
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a recycled sort of slash and</v>

340
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 1>burn agriculture and I'll break down</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means.</v>

341
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 1>So they'll go into an area and slash</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and burden just to clear the,</v>

342
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 1>just so sunlight can make it through to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

343
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>So they chopped the jungle down and burn</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

344
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Then the cassava,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

345
00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:39.761
<v Speaker 1>it looks like big yams when you grow it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just take a stock of an existing</v>

346
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 1>plant</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just bury that stock in the ground.</v>

347
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.850
<v Speaker 1>It will sprout up a new crop and so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

348
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.540
<v Speaker 1>you're close to the equator so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have seasons as much.</v>

349
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 1>There's some seasonal variation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do have times that they do have</v>

350
00:17:56.341 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 1>like they are wet season and dry season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you always get about the</v>

351
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 1>same amount of darkness as daylight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the wild fluctuations</v>

352
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>that we have in the temperate zone so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can grow year round and they stage</v>

353
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:10.380
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you have a crop that's</v>

354
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:12.410
<v Speaker 1>coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a crop that will become an in</v>

355
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.990
<v Speaker 1>three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a crop that will be coming in</v>

356
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.660
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a crop that becoming a nine</v>

357
00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 1>months and once you get a certain number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cycles,</v>

358
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember how many cycles you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>off a piece of ground.</v>

359
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:25.920
<v Speaker 1>You let the ground go feral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it a few years and then come in and</v>

360
00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:26.754
<v Speaker 1>burn it again.</v>

361
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Also intermittently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you plant cassava,</v>

362
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 1>you before you replant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a little fire and burn some</v>

363
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>debris in that same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No irrigation.</v>

364
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 1>You're not watering it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

365
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only fertilize you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving it as you're burning some of the</v>

366
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:47.810
<v Speaker 1>surrounding just detritus scraped up</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the jungle floor that you burned</v>

367
00:18:47.811 --> 00:18:52.811
<v Speaker 1>there and grow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is a staple of life that in river</v>

368
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:57.480
<v Speaker 1>fish and game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just such a wild thing that it's</v>

369
00:18:57.481 --> 00:18:59.550
<v Speaker 1>such a poisonous plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

370
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all this stuff that there's</v>

371
00:19:02.131 --> 00:19:06.000
<v Speaker 1>other poisons that are extracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like people that,</v>

372
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.550
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people in South America and the</v>

373
00:19:08.551 --> 00:19:11.100
<v Speaker 1>jungles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that use blow darts so people to</v>

374
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:13.590
<v Speaker 1>hunt with blowguns is generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>

375
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Like even talking to even talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them Macusa who hunt with bows and</v>

376
00:19:17.671 --> 00:19:19.470
<v Speaker 1>arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked them like,</v>

377
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:21.630
<v Speaker 1>why don't you guys hunt with blow darts?</v>

378
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Blowguns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he explained me,</v>

379
00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:26.580
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to because we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>aeroplan,</v>

380
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>which gives arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you were in this other area,</v>

381
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more up in the mountains and there's no</v>

382
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Arrow plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd hunt with a blow dart.</v>

383
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.910
<v Speaker 1>So is aeroplan just to plant that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a shaft,</v>

384
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:41.700
<v Speaker 1>like makes the Arrow what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

385
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.130
<v Speaker 1>What is the type?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cane.</v>

386
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks,</v>

387
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a palm.</v>

388
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And the palm leaf puts out these long</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces in one.</v>

389
00:19:52.321 --> 00:19:56.460
<v Speaker 1>One of those is ready you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you caught it green and then they can</v>

390
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 1>make an Arrow no time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go out of the jungle,</v>

391
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:01.110
<v Speaker 1>find this piece and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

392
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the theories on how we</v>

393
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:08.250
<v Speaker 1>domesticated plants species would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was a very gradual,</v>

394
00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:12.540
<v Speaker 1>unintentional domestication where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would go out,</v>

395
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just take something simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say a lot of raspberries.</v>

396
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go out and you gather raspberries</v>

397
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 1>and you bring them home and you eat them</v>
<v Speaker 1>near home and then people are eating</v>

398
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:26.740
<v Speaker 1>these seeds and shitting these seeds out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pretty soon there's a lot more grass</v>

399
00:20:26.741 --> 00:20:31.741
<v Speaker 1>berries growing around your home village</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the simple fact that you always</v>

400
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 1>bring the seeds home and discarding them</v>
<v Speaker 1>around in,</v>

401
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:40.551
<v Speaker 1>in creating it so they have it except</v>
<v Speaker 1>for maniac,</v>

402
00:20:42.091 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 1>which people don't even really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's really well</v>

403
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 1>understood what it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been domesticated for long time.</v>

404
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.370
<v Speaker 1>All the plants they use are widely</v>
<v Speaker 1>available in the jungle,</v>

405
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.910
<v Speaker 1>but tend to also have some around home</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that they've brought home and plant</v>

406
00:20:55.911 --> 00:20:59.590
<v Speaker 1>in nearby or they just grow up there now</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they've been bringing this stuff</v>

407
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:03.430
<v Speaker 1>into their village for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So aero plant is readily available.</v>

408
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cut the Arrow shaft green and it</v>

409
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:12.580
<v Speaker 1>looks like just a green dial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has some curvature to it.</v>

410
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Then no come home and they start a fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they heat the green thing just by</v>

411
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 1>twirling it over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

412
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.880
<v Speaker 1>over the embers are over the flame</v>
<v Speaker 1>twirling it and getting it hot and it'll</v>

413
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:29.170
<v Speaker 1>let off a little steam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you bend it in a neutral and</v>

414
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 1>get a hot and bend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll eventually make it,</v>

415
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:37.140
<v Speaker 1>well arrow straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the they make for different kinds</v>

416
00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:40.090
<v Speaker 1>of arrows depending on what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting for.</v>

417
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.840
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you were making a arrow to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

418
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.480
<v Speaker 1>it gives you more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're making a big game</v>

419
00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:49.470
<v Speaker 1>arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

420
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the big game they hoped would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>red brocket deer,</v>

421
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.190
<v Speaker 1>white lip packery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a favorite,</v>

422
00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>collared Peccary,</v>

423
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:04.060
<v Speaker 1>which we call have Alina and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>tape here.</v>

424
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.200
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

425
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 1>the air they use for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they would take that.</v>

426
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:09.670
<v Speaker 1>So let's say they're going to build one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those,</v>

427
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.530
<v Speaker 1>so they take that green shaft and</v>
<v Speaker 1>straighten it.</v>

428
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:16.860
<v Speaker 1>The next step is they find a wood called</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullet wood and they cut what would be</v>

429
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:22.021
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to form the base of your</v>

430
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.970
<v Speaker 1>tip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the base,</v>

431
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:29.680
<v Speaker 1>your spear and that bullet would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fit into the end of the green</v>

432
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.580
<v Speaker 1>shaft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is almost like a picture to having</v>

433
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.320
<v Speaker 1>the consistency of bamboo and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoved that bullet would nair and it</v>

434
00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:37.690
<v Speaker 1>causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it forms like a base into that.</v>

435
00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:42.340
<v Speaker 1>They take an old machete blade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they cut out and file down to be</v>

436
00:22:42.341 --> 00:22:47.341
<v Speaker 1>about a four inch steel knife?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that goes in to the bullet would to,</v>

437
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.440
<v Speaker 1>to the forms the junction between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrow shaft and the steel piece.</v>

438
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the only man made material they</v>
<v Speaker 1>use in their arrows.</v>

439
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Then they take a plant that looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaco and they make their own string and</v>

440
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 1>they got little bits of rubber from</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber trees that they wax the string</v>

441
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:11.640
<v Speaker 1>with and they put a bullet would knock</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the part that that you're,</v>

442
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.090
<v Speaker 1>that you're bolstering actually pushes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and that gets tied in to the Arrow</v>

443
00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:19.600
<v Speaker 1>shaft and then they fletched Arrow with</v>
<v Speaker 1>feathers,</v>

444
00:23:19.601 --> 00:23:24.601
<v Speaker 1>some Guan or black Curacao or crustless</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curacao and that's what they fletch</v>

445
00:23:26.241 --> 00:23:28.480
<v Speaker 1>their arrows with because they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very water resistant.</v>

446
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.820
<v Speaker 1>So they're broad heads are made at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>machete.</v>

447
00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:31.654
<v Speaker 1>Bleeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

448
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.630
<v Speaker 1>And this is a recent innovation for use</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use wood.</v>

449
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.380
<v Speaker 1>And how long have they been doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with machete bleeds in his lifetime,</v>

450
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.970
<v Speaker 1>it's always been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't call them,</v>

451
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.520
<v Speaker 1>they come cutlasses enrollments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime robbins,</v>

452
00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:44.560
<v Speaker 1>32.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a kind of my main friend down there</v>

453
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:47.300
<v Speaker 1>that hung out with both times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was down there in his lifetime.</v>

454
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:53.290
<v Speaker 1>He remembers people using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He remembers people using blades,</v>

455
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.970
<v Speaker 1>which is made from like a bamboo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like material.</v>

456
00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.730
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be like a convex spearpoint cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of bamboo and sharpened.</v>

457
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:06.970
<v Speaker 1>He remembers people using those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had always used cutlass blades.</v>

458
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in Bolivia,</v>

459
00:24:09.891 --> 00:24:13.880
<v Speaker 1>you'd see people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are just using the the old form.</v>

460
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.290
<v Speaker 1>There are other arrows when they make</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrows for hunting birds and they make</v>

461
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:19.400
<v Speaker 1>arrows for hunting fish.</v>

462
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.820
<v Speaker 1>The only man made material on those</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrows is hog wire fencing,</v>

463
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.170
<v Speaker 1>so basically wire fencing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They snip out the hunks of wire,</v>

464
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.030
<v Speaker 1>smash it down till it's flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they can cut barbs and there to</v>

465
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:37.031
<v Speaker 1>hunt birds and hunt fish or the bowl is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this not a laminate boat,</v>

466
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.370
<v Speaker 1>so they make a bowl by just cutting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>

467
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.950
<v Speaker 1>single piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single stem tree,</v>

468
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:48.560
<v Speaker 1>shaving it down to what they're after</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then take that same Yucca plant,</v>

469
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.280
<v Speaker 1>pull out the fibers out of the Yucca</v>
<v Speaker 1>strands and make bold strings.</v>

470
00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:55.040
<v Speaker 1>That goes very quickly as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we made a bolstering one day.</v>

471
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

472
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.630
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

473
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:58.463
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

474
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you take the strands and twisted like</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine like you're rubbing your hands</v>

475
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:04.640
<v Speaker 1>to warm them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got all those strands in your hands</v>

476
00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:09.350
<v Speaker 1>and you roll them and it makes singles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes strands that are comprised</v>

477
00:25:09.351 --> 00:25:09.681
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:25:09.681 --> 00:25:13.310
<v Speaker 1>a dozen fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you start braiding up from there</v>

479
00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:18.230
<v Speaker 1>until you braid up a big long bow string</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how you string your boat.</v>

480
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 1>So when they're shooting their bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's a long shot for them,</v>

481
00:25:21.651 --> 00:25:22.930
<v Speaker 1>like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 yards,</v>

482
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.000
<v Speaker 1>long shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long shot and the length of shot you're</v>

483
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:30.140
<v Speaker 1>going to take sort of depends on um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of depends on.</v>

484
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really think like</v>

485
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.900
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the like that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to wound it and it's going to get away.</v>

486
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't weigh on them very heavily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

487
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Like in our culture and our hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture here,</v>

488
00:25:41.581 --> 00:25:43.600
<v Speaker 1>we've come to like really a,</v>

489
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 1>the wound loss is something we do a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>to avoid.</v>

490
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of talk where I don't,</v>

491
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be surprised to get a good</v>

492
00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:57.110
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should know what's going to happen.</v>

493
00:25:57.111 --> 00:25:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Don't take shots that are too far away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

494
00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:02.450
<v Speaker 1>We really put a strong value on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

495
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.300
<v Speaker 1>when you let the air or go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when you let the bullet go,</v>

496
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 1>you damn sure know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a quick clean kill.</v>

497
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 1>At least we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put a lot of value on that in</v>

498
00:26:11.571 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that stuff goes out the</v>

499
00:26:13.881 --> 00:26:15.410
<v Speaker 1>window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyone would say that that's your</v>

500
00:26:15.411 --> 00:26:18.110
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not on their mind.</v>

501
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.070
<v Speaker 1>You see them take some hail Mary's</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

502
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.360
<v Speaker 1>and they can shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're,</v>

503
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.990
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to shoot a bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they're trying to do is get a</v>

504
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 1>warrior point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of those arrows I described</v>

505
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:34.760
<v Speaker 1>fitted with a long wire on the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut out of a piece of steel fence with a</v>

506
00:26:34.761 --> 00:26:39.761
<v Speaker 1>barb with a couple of barb's filed into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and that head is joined by string to</v>

507
00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:45.270
<v Speaker 1>the Arrow shaft so that once the head</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes contact,</v>

508
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 1>the Arrow shaft can fall away.</v>

509
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.880
<v Speaker 1>But there's a string connecting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrowhead,</v>

510
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:56.370
<v Speaker 1>the wire barb to the Arrow shaft and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that allows the tangle up up in the</v>

511
00:26:56.371 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they shoot,</v>

512
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.440
<v Speaker 1>all they really need to do is pick that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing with that wire.</v>

513
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Barb know that the bird or the hunt for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large aquatic rodents,</v>

514
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:11.220
<v Speaker 1>knowing that the bird is going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>tangled up in the trees overhead and</v>

515
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:12.990
<v Speaker 1>that they can then climb up to go get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

516
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Even then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even shooting like that kind of</v>

517
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:19.200
<v Speaker 1>thing where you're just trying to pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing.</v>

518
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Thirty yards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be very long.</v>

519
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Shoot and fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not shooting.</v>

520
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean shooting fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not really like bow fishing,</v>

521
00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:28.840
<v Speaker 1>which I've done a lot of in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A 10 yard boat.</v>

522
00:27:28.841 --> 00:27:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Fishing shot is very far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

523
00:27:30.481 --> 00:27:31.470
<v Speaker 1>You're right above them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

524
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're shooting down into the</v>

525
00:27:32.671 --> 00:27:33.504
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

526
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:34.523
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they have,</v>

527
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.780
<v Speaker 1>do you have to judge when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting into the water,</v>

528
00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 1>you have to judge differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

529
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 1>The way diffraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless that thing,</v>

530
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.360
<v Speaker 1>unless that fishes sunning um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless that fish is stunning and it's</v>

531
00:27:45.361 --> 00:27:47.610
<v Speaker 1>back at the surface of breaking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface,</v>

532
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to account for refraction.</v>

533
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.110
<v Speaker 1>So you're aiming way low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you've got a fish that's a fish</v>

534
00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:57.930
<v Speaker 1>two feet below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water surface is extremely hard to</v>

535
00:27:57.931 --> 00:28:01.230
<v Speaker 1>hit because it's so deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your aim and like you're aiming at your</v>

536
00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:02.500
<v Speaker 1>boot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

537
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean it feels like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

538
00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:07.770
<v Speaker 1>your aim and so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an equation so low you're aiming</v>

539
00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:11.430
<v Speaker 1>way below the fish because refraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anyone's ever taken a fishing pole</v>

540
00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:12.600
<v Speaker 1>and stuck in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

541
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.850
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the hooks.</v>

542
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.430
<v Speaker 1>So that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the trick of both fishing.</v>

543
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.250
<v Speaker 1>But were they both fish for some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>

544
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.630
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing that both fish down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is also you also dealing with</v>

545
00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 1>current and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

546
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:29.400
<v Speaker 1>they're shooting a hollow arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't weigh shit.</v>

547
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't cut through the water at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're holding way low for</v>

548
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:38.631
<v Speaker 1>refraction and holding way upstream</v>
<v Speaker 1>because their Arrow is so buoyant.</v>

549
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

550
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:41.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an American,</v>

551
00:28:41.641 --> 00:28:44.880
<v Speaker 1>both fish and reg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I shoot has a fiberglass Arrow,</v>

552
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:50.240
<v Speaker 1>so the current isn't as much of an issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that arrows so heavy that it can</v>

553
00:28:50.551 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 1>cut through the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But refraction is the same.</v>

554
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

555
00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:00.510
<v Speaker 1>a point blank shot both phishing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>still very difficult and then you've got</v>

556
00:29:00.511 --> 00:29:02.280
<v Speaker 1>to factor that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still need to hit the thing pretty</v>

557
00:29:02.281 --> 00:29:04.560
<v Speaker 1>good in a place where the arrows is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to pop out.</v>

558
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bowhunt hunt for that they used the</v>

559
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:13.431
<v Speaker 1>bowl hunt for for salted fish called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>era [inaudible] and airplane was the</v>

560
00:29:14.281 --> 00:29:15.660
<v Speaker 1>biggest freshwater fish in the world.</v>

561
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 1>They say they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sturgeon.</v>

562
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest freshwater fish.</v>

563
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.970
<v Speaker 1>The largest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

564
00:29:20.971 --> 00:29:24.990
<v Speaker 1>The largest scaled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An [inaudible] is the largest scaled</v>

565
00:29:24.991 --> 00:29:27.030
<v Speaker 1>freshwater fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big is it?</v>

566
00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get him up into the hundreds of</v>

567
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.190
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard of it.</v>

568
00:29:31.191 --> 00:29:33.060
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

569
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:38.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a r a p A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a.</v>

570
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:39.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an Arab hyman.</v>

571
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.820
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ that looks completely</v>

572
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.460
<v Speaker 1>prehistoric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a bizarre relationship with</v>

573
00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:50.461
<v Speaker 1>these fish in the Macusa do in Guyana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's amazing.</v>

574
00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.540
<v Speaker 1>They used to hunt them looking creditor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to hunt them to export the</v>

575
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 1>salted meat based 100 to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assaulted me to markets.</v>

576
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

577
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:06.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those is worth $7,000 to them</v>

578
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:07.750
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

579
00:30:07.751 --> 00:30:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Because that's how much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how much a white guy will pay to</v>

580
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:10.540
<v Speaker 1>catch one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let it go.</v>

581
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

582
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a guy like a guy will pay more</v>

583
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 1>to Macusa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will make more to take a guy out to</v>

584
00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:21.570
<v Speaker 1>catch an error.</v>

585
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Piman let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what you'd pay to hunt for elk in</v>

586
00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:26.620
<v Speaker 1>the US on a guided trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

587
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.400
<v Speaker 1>They get seven grand to catch an error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paella.</v>

588
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.560
<v Speaker 1>And when Rovan was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would go on to week hunting trips</v>

589
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 1>where they're gone for two weeks with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their father.</v>

590
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.570
<v Speaker 1>They would go for two weeks to hunt salt</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

591
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.810
<v Speaker 1>So they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were operating at a dug out canoes</v>

592
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.930
<v Speaker 1>that they would have to paddle and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would paddle a duck that would make a</v>

593
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:52.570
<v Speaker 1>dug out canoe themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paddle the Dugout,</v>

594
00:30:52.571 --> 00:30:56.500
<v Speaker 1>can you up river for a week to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good hunting and fishing grounds.</v>

595
00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Then they would hunt and fish for one</v>
<v Speaker 1>week until they would get 100 pounds of</v>

596
00:31:02.891 --> 00:31:06.910
<v Speaker 1>salted fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you'd go back down river,</v>

597
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:11.940
<v Speaker 1>which would take a day or two days and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then get to the mouth of the Rupa Nuni</v>

598
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:17.340
<v Speaker 1>River and paddle up the Reuben Nuni</v>
<v Speaker 1>river for two days to another town and</v>

599
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:23.311
<v Speaker 1>then they would haul the salt fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including era of flesh and sell that 100</v>

600
00:31:25.241 --> 00:31:28.180
<v Speaker 1>pounds of salted fish for 75 US dollars.</v>

601
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So two weeks plus work for a family for</v>
<v Speaker 1>$75.</v>

602
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And now they will not touch those fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they make a handful of people</v>

603
00:31:40.271 --> 00:31:42.940
<v Speaker 1>every year go down and give them seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand to catch one,</v>

604
00:31:42.941 --> 00:31:46.200
<v Speaker 1>let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So seven grand to them must be just an</v>

605
00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.620
<v Speaker 1>enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's changed everything.</v>

606
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.530
<v Speaker 1>When I was talking about like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they discovered sunglasses and shit.</v>

607
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot like they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>already onto this air pilot thing.</v>

608
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:56.500
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I went down and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's changed everything about it.</v>

609
00:31:56.501 --> 00:31:59.440
<v Speaker 1>It's changed that village,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air pilot fishery,</v>

610
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.350
<v Speaker 1>the way they used the arrows on them out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trees,</v>

611
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.720
<v Speaker 1>they would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're familiar like when,</v>

612
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.510
<v Speaker 1>when a river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a river flows in asp pattern,</v>

613
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.090
<v Speaker 1>like repeating s's now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

614
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during high water,</v>

615
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:16.741
<v Speaker 1>a river will jump one of the assets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've picked it up saying yes.</v>

616
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:21.430
<v Speaker 1>So the river jumps and ass in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned in the main channel abandons</v>

617
00:32:21.431 --> 00:32:23.950
<v Speaker 1>the curves of the S.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

618
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Those curves become what's called oxbow</v>
<v Speaker 1>lakes were during high water during a</v>

619
00:32:29.381 --> 00:32:31.570
<v Speaker 1>flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those oxbow lakes are connected to the</v>

620
00:32:31.571 --> 00:32:33.820
<v Speaker 1>main river system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the water goes low,</v>

621
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:38.821
<v Speaker 1>the oxbow lakes become a isolated air</v>
<v Speaker 1>pimas living those oxbow lakes and they</v>

622
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:44.230
<v Speaker 1>on peacock bass and other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the water got low and the era</v>

623
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:47.660
<v Speaker 1>pimas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all kind of restricted to very</v>

624
00:32:47.661 --> 00:32:52.661
<v Speaker 1>small little spots in the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would climb up in trees overlooking</v>

625
00:32:54.741 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 1>these places and wait for the air pilot</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come up near the surface and shoot it</v>

626
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.200
<v Speaker 1>with an arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a detachable,</v>

627
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 1>basically Harpoon head Arrow and shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with the Arrow.</v>

628
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.220
<v Speaker 1>The Harpoon had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would detach from the Arrow and the</v>

629
00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Arrow would float on the surface</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected by string to the Arrow shaft.</v>

630
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.680
<v Speaker 1>You would then go take a hand line with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hook and file that fish in your</v>

631
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:23.000
<v Speaker 1>dugout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>canoe until you could cast your hook out</v>

632
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:28.060
<v Speaker 1>and catch your Arrow and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected by your fishing line to your</v>

633
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:34.421
<v Speaker 1>Arrow and your arrows connected by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tether to the Harpoon head and you would</v>

634
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:39.230
<v Speaker 1>hand line in and slaughter the Arab Ima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

635
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.510
<v Speaker 1>and then drive the era.</v>

636
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Pama was salt and they and they still</v>
<v Speaker 1>have salt fish day,</v>

637
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:47.240
<v Speaker 1>like when we're out fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're salt and fish all the time.</v>

638
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.970
<v Speaker 1>They would salt that fish and then sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then that became an endangered</v>

639
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.340
<v Speaker 1>like that became like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very threatened species under the</v>

640
00:33:56.341 --> 00:33:58.970
<v Speaker 1>thing and the I thing that they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt for is would hunt for giant river</v>

641
00:33:58.971 --> 00:34:03.971
<v Speaker 1>turtles and sell the meat and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly depleted because their whole</v>

642
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:08.660
<v Speaker 1>lives occur on this one river in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once those market influences came in and</v>

643
00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:13.430
<v Speaker 1>they had moved beyond subsistence</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and fishing and they moved into</v>

644
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:16.700
<v Speaker 1>market hunting and fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did the same thing that we did to</v>

645
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:19.790
<v Speaker 1>our own country in the late 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early 19 hundreds is eight.</v>

646
00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:24.791
<v Speaker 1>We're on course to entirely deplete the</v>
<v Speaker 1>resource through market demands because</v>

647
00:34:26.601 --> 00:34:28.400
<v Speaker 1>their village gets more and more people</v>
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>

648
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.420
<v Speaker 1>It grew considerably in the five or six</v>
<v Speaker 1>years between my two visits and their</v>

649
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.850
<v Speaker 1>environment just couldn't support that</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of market hunting.</v>

650
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:43.240
<v Speaker 1>So this era pimas thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chi is giving gives them a way to make</v>

651
00:34:46.941 --> 00:34:49.970
<v Speaker 1>money to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy staples and run a school and</v>

652
00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:51.620
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives them kind of an out.</v>

653
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny because like a,</v>

654
00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lot more interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like personally I'm a lot more</v>

655
00:34:59.401 --> 00:35:04.200
<v Speaker 1>interested in a guy shooting fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary and salt in the meat than I am</v>

656
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.620
<v Speaker 1>a dude like me going down to catch an</v>
<v Speaker 1>error [inaudible] and let it go.</v>

657
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.770
<v Speaker 1>So in some ways it's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

658
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.410
<v Speaker 1>it's sad just because like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not sad.</v>

659
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:15.960
<v Speaker 1>It's great that they're saving the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishery,</v>

660
00:35:15.961 --> 00:35:19.040
<v Speaker 1>but you see like just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just sad to see shit changed man.</v>

661
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And why do they let it go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they give it to the people</v>

662
00:35:21.931 --> 00:35:23.760
<v Speaker 1>that live there so they could use it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat.</v>

663
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.760
<v Speaker 1>They let it go so they can catch it</v>
<v Speaker 1>again because they want to make sure</v>

664
00:35:26.761 --> 00:35:29.880
<v Speaker 1>that the population stays laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Robin,</v>

665
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:30.721
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

666
00:35:30.721 --> 00:35:32.520
<v Speaker 1>the reason that one of those oxbow</v>
<v Speaker 1>lakes,</v>

667
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got lower and lower and lower and</v>

668
00:35:36.631 --> 00:35:37.830
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of their guys,</v>

669
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.920
<v Speaker 1>one of these Macusa guys realize there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>26 era piman stranded,</v>

670
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:45.540
<v Speaker 1>an oxbow lake and the pimas are running</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of water and when the water goes</v>

671
00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:47.460
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air pine will excavate.</v>

672
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.660
<v Speaker 1>He'll keep excavating in the bottom to</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just save a little spot for</v>

673
00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:53.360
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

674
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 1>And a guy found them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all in there,</v>

675
00:35:56.011 --> 00:35:57.960
<v Speaker 1>but there's not enough water to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to cover them up.</v>

676
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.160
<v Speaker 1>They can sip air is the thing that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>them cooler.</v>

677
00:36:00.161 --> 00:36:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So you can always find era [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they come up the gold bear,</v>

678
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role air and very loud noise they</v>

679
00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:12.150
<v Speaker 1>make when they come up to gold bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can live in low oxygen</v>

680
00:36:12.151 --> 00:36:15.030
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you took most fish and threw</v>

681
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:17.850
<v Speaker 1>them in a stagnant oxbow that's got six</v>
<v Speaker 1>inches of water in it,</v>

682
00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:19.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Shit right?</v>

683
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Is there a pimas they can just keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>excavating a little spot in the bottom</v>

684
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:27.000
<v Speaker 1>and just wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>praying or their equivalent of praying</v>

685
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:31.350
<v Speaker 1>that the water level comes back up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberate them from the oxbow?</v>

686
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:32.770
<v Speaker 1>There still needs a huge fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

687
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.000
<v Speaker 1>giants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they found 26 that were out of the</v>

688
00:36:36.001 --> 00:36:40.450
<v Speaker 1>water in their backs were all messed up</v>
<v Speaker 1>from birds and other predators grab in</v>

<v Speaker 1>then they went and spent four days.</v>

<v Speaker 1>These are 26 air time is between 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>inches in upper eighties in length.</v>

691
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.960
<v Speaker 1>They spent four days moving these 26</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arab pimas into the river in a canoe</v>

692
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:02.640
<v Speaker 1>full of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

693
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.740
<v Speaker 1>That's all valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those fish are to him now.</v>

694
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.630
<v Speaker 1>In the old days it had been dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Shit.</v>

695
00:37:06.631 --> 00:37:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you just sold them.</v>

696
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just like a fine night.</v>

697
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:14.190
<v Speaker 1>They have like on the river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the river that they call home the river,</v>

698
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:16.830
<v Speaker 1>they kind of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a finite resource.</v>

699
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.150
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is other groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're mostly [inaudible].</v>

700
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.540
<v Speaker 1>And my friend Roman's Macusa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

701
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.940
<v Speaker 1>his wife is Wapa Shauna.</v>

702
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:32.450
<v Speaker 1>And there are other Wapa Shauna's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other places who will come down to hunt</v>

703
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:37.680

<v Speaker 1>like these other groups that come in</v>

704
00:37:37.681 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 1>have different hunting practices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Robin was telling me one time that</v>

705
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:43.820
<v Speaker 1>he was going up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the largest snake in the worlds of</v>

706
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Green Anaconda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their river has the largest thing in the</v>

707
00:37:48.181 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 1>alligator family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the black Caiman.</v>

708
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:50.911
<v Speaker 1>Some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

709
00:37:50.911 --> 00:37:53.430
<v Speaker 1>it's not a true alligator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the largest member of that.</v>

710
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.130
<v Speaker 1>How big is Emilia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black Caiman.</v>

711
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get big.</v>

712
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.910
<v Speaker 1>They get bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like American alligator big like yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some black came and stayed.</v>

714
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.410
<v Speaker 1>There used to be a market for those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use the market hunt those for the</v>

715
00:38:07.411 --> 00:38:09.780
<v Speaker 1>heights for bags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boots and shit.</v>

716
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.030
<v Speaker 1>So they have the giant River Otter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a river out or like way to go</v>

717
00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.500
<v Speaker 1>up river otters go to 100 pounds.</v>

718
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.650
<v Speaker 1>They had the biggest snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Green Anaconda.</v>

719
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.020

<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

720
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.130
<v Speaker 1>the largest freshwater scaled fish by</v>
<v Speaker 1>some definitions.</v>

721
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.530
<v Speaker 1>The largest eagle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the Harpy Eagle.</v>

722
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.990
<v Speaker 1>The Philippine Eagle has a bigger wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>span,</v>

723
00:38:30.991 --> 00:38:32.700
<v Speaker 1>but some like when you measured by</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>

724
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.550
<v Speaker 1>the Harpy from and then there's another</v>
<v Speaker 1>harpy that's a giant,</v>

725
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.470
<v Speaker 1>like the Papillon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Papa New Guinea heartbeat.</v>

726
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.440
<v Speaker 1>The heartbeat is that one that eats</v>
<v Speaker 1>sloths and monkeys.</v>

727
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Monkeys and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We saw one really.</v>

729
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.610

<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

730
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I finally saw my first heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm just the face on it to the male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the male face.</v>

734
00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just is like a.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So freakishly different than anything</v>

737
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:18.070
<v Speaker 1>you'd looked at like that harpies face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's going up the river.</v>

740
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.550

<v Speaker 1>how the whopper,</v>

741
00:39:24.551 --> 00:39:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Shawna will come down and hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting different than the Macusa.</v>

742
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Like the Macoun aren't that big on</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing Tay peers.</v>

743
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:33.670
<v Speaker 1>But the WAPA Shawna will come down in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their area and he says they come down</v>

744
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:36.790

758
00:40:17.141 --> 00:40:19.600
<v Speaker 1>It's also infused with a certain level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Christianity.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So ahead of Christmas,</v>

<v Speaker 1>travel overland and by river to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and hunt them Macusa river.</v>

762
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.370

764
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.830

765
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:45.430
<v Speaker 1>which the Rebbe Macusa do not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

766
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.520
<v Speaker 1>they're hunting anacondas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They own everything.</v>

767
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:49.840
<v Speaker 1>They eat the Anaconda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

768
00:40:49.841 --> 00:40:53.410
<v Speaker 1>They dry all that shit and the fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like to render the fat down because</v>

769
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:55.510
<v Speaker 1>they feel that it is helpful for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

770
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.730
<v Speaker 1>they feel that it's helpful for</v>
<v Speaker 1>arthritis.</v>

771
00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.700
<v Speaker 1>We pulled up on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

772
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.220
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

773
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:05.220
<v Speaker 1>we pulled up on an Anaconda one time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was 13 or 14 feet long just sitting</v>

774
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 1>on the bank.</v>

775
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.080
<v Speaker 1>You can walk up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can walk right up to it.</v>

776
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Robin was telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

777
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:14.770
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a type like mysticism and when we have</v>

778
00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:16.510
<v Speaker 1>our own beliefs that would seem absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

779
00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:21.511
<v Speaker 1>To an outside perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was telling me if I were to touch</v>

780
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:26.910
<v Speaker 1>that Anaconda with my boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would die a very painful death if I</v>

781
00:41:30.701 --> 00:41:35.701
<v Speaker 1>just laid my bowl him on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And about how long he says he thought</v>

782
00:41:36.351 --> 00:41:41.120
<v Speaker 1>about it at about 45 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the belief they have.</v>

783
00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.480
<v Speaker 1>If you touch it with a hunting bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will die in 45 minutes.</v>

784
00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:46.610
<v Speaker 1>But it's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How bizarre.</v>

785
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.570
<v Speaker 1>No experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked about that a thousand times and</v>

786
00:41:50.571 --> 00:41:52.090
<v Speaker 1>never got any more clarity on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Net.</v>

787
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you touch it with a stick?</v>

788
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.490
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

789
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Touch it with a bolt will die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

790
00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:00.621
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't eat it,</v>

791
00:42:00.621 --> 00:42:04.100
<v Speaker 1>but he was telling me if you're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard up and have really bad arthritis,</v>

792
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.980
<v Speaker 1>you can take the fat from Anaconda and</v>
<v Speaker 1>help cure the arthritis.</v>

793
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:08.660
<v Speaker 1>How much fat is an Anaconda?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

794
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never cut into one.</v>

795
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.640
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a rattlesnake skinned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem like they don't have any fat.</v>

796
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.860
<v Speaker 1>You gotta understand how big these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are though.</v>

797
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.530
<v Speaker 1>They're so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean way bigger than your leg.</v>

798
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was 14 feet long.</v>

799
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Fourteen feet long was probably weighs</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of pounds,</v>

800
00:42:23.331 --> 00:42:24.164
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

801
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of pounds if you eaten</v>

802
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.930
<v Speaker 1>rattlesnake.</v>

<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these,</v>

820
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.730
<v Speaker 1>these gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Macoun,</v>

821
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:08.740
<v Speaker 1>she came down the Wapa shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ashana have different hunting practices</v>

822
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:14.330
<v Speaker 1>and different things that are acceptable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat and they have.</v>

823
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:19.331
<v Speaker 1>And this is a group of Wapa Shauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hunting and fishing socks are</v>

824
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:20.900
<v Speaker 1>going after each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

825
00:43:20.901 --> 00:43:25.901
<v Speaker 1>that was a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's different pissing match with</v>

826
00:43:26.121 --> 00:43:27.500
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

827
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:32.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was that.</v>

828
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:36.170
<v Speaker 1>They're hunting area sucks that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of Wapa Shannon that come down to</v>

829
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:39.400
<v Speaker 1>rape and pillage on the Rebbe A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

830
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Robin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain to me their hunting areas of</v>

831
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Piss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor hunting area.</v>

832
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:43.280
<v Speaker 1>So why do they stay there?</v>

833
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they stay there.</v>

834
00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

835
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.160
<v Speaker 1>and I asked him to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it go,</v>

836
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:52.820
<v Speaker 1>does it make you guys mad today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come down because now the,</v>

837
00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:57.070
<v Speaker 1>like the people in the predominantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macusa reba village,</v>

838
00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is onto a,</v>

839
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.920
<v Speaker 1>they're on like a pretty progressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservation program.</v>

840
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Like they can just dig through their</v>
<v Speaker 1>market hunting practices.</v>

841
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:11.450
<v Speaker 1>They got a glimpse into the future and</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't like what they saw and they were</v>

842
00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 1>on a pretty aggressive program about</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainability.</v>

843
00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm their eyes toward the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The WAPA Shawna are this group of</v>

844
00:44:19.371 --> 00:44:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Robuchon or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I asked them,</v>

845
00:44:20.771 --> 00:44:23.780
<v Speaker 1>does it piss you off to the whopper?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shauna come down here and oh,</v>

846
00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.570
<v Speaker 1>they also the whopper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean offish with poison Macusa.</v>

847
00:44:26.571 --> 00:44:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Don't fish the poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they use the poison from the cassava?</v>

848
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they a poison.</v>

849
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:33.980
<v Speaker 1>They use a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

850
00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:39.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a root and the leaf that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>both poisons the root.</v>

851
00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.870
<v Speaker 1>It's an thing use here in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States when they have to do a fish kill.</v>

852
00:44:42.871 --> 00:44:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get a big population of</v>
<v Speaker 1>invasive fish in a waterway and you just</v>

853
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:50.550
<v Speaker 1>need to like wipe the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean Ed's shit like that when you're</v>

854
00:44:50.551 --> 00:44:53.310
<v Speaker 1>trying to do a fish kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We in the US use a thing called</v>

855
00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:55.800
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and it's derived from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>South American plant.</v>

856
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.830
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another plant called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barbato.</v>

857
00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.561
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>

858
00:44:58.561 --> 00:44:59.101
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

859
00:44:59.101 --> 00:45:01.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like different people in different</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

860
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 1>And the Amazon drainage as a thing they</v>
<v Speaker 1>call Barb Bosco,</v>

861
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.920
<v Speaker 1>and that is a leaf that you just pull up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would look like you're just like</v>

862
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:10.920
<v Speaker 1>taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just imagine if you took a bunch</v>

863
00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:14.850
<v Speaker 1>of time or rosemary and put it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortar and pestle and pulped it,</v>

864
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.460
<v Speaker 1>and then you take and spread that in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

865
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.200
<v Speaker 1>That'll kill fish.</v>

866
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Both of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they kind of,</v>

867
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 1>they act in two separate ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two types of fish,</v>

868
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:28.470
<v Speaker 1>poise and one inhibits the fishes</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to pull oxygen from the water.</v>

869
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.880
<v Speaker 1>So I watched them apply this poison and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to get area.</v>

870
00:45:32.881 --> 00:45:35.780
<v Speaker 1>There's not much current because it'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wash the poison away.</v>

871
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.770
<v Speaker 1>So you get into one of these oxbow</v>
<v Speaker 1>lakes,</v>

872
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:43.250
<v Speaker 1>apply the poison kickback 20 minutes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty soon all the Fisher up gulping at</v>

873
00:45:43.381 --> 00:45:46.290
<v Speaker 1>the surface and then you shoot them with</v>
<v Speaker 1>bows and arrows.</v>

874
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

875
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:49.770
<v Speaker 1>what's the other way of doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wrote none.</v>

876
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And I can't remember which category</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote downfalls and,</v>

877
00:45:52.351 --> 00:45:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but there's another one that has some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like some kind of neuro effect</v>

878
00:45:55.981 --> 00:46:00.240
<v Speaker 1>that it has some kind of brain in</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow impairs some other aspect of</v>

879
00:46:00.241 --> 00:46:03.060
<v Speaker 1>their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these fish poisons are classed in</v>

880
00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:03.810
<v Speaker 1>two categories.</v>

881
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not more clear on what the two are,</v>

882
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.780
<v Speaker 1>but I know that the ones that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent it from be able to get air and</v>

883
00:46:09.781 --> 00:46:12.810
<v Speaker 1>the other one keeps the police in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that don't suffocate them,</v>

884
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.780
<v Speaker 1>does that come up when they eat it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

885
00:46:15.781 --> 00:46:18.180
<v Speaker 1>but they were telling me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

886
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.770
<v Speaker 1>if you need to watch your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're poisoning a pond,</v>

887
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.410
<v Speaker 1>you need to watch it and make sure dogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>or any livestock don't come down.</v>

888
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:31.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't last long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were telling me usually the</v>

889
00:46:31.891 --> 00:46:36.840
<v Speaker 1>fish you don't shoot will recover if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some amount of water flowing</v>

890
00:46:36.841 --> 00:46:39.000
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they might go in and build a</v>

891
00:46:39.001 --> 00:46:43.440
<v Speaker 1>temporary dam to block whatever inlet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say it's a,</v>

892
00:46:43.441 --> 00:46:46.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a isolated channel off to the side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of river.</v>

893
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 1>They'll go in and pretty carefully with</v>
<v Speaker 1>rocks and logs,</v>

894
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:51.840
<v Speaker 1>block the flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming into it,</v>

895
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.420
<v Speaker 1>poison it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then once they've gotten whatever</v>

896
00:46:54.421 --> 00:46:57.510
<v Speaker 1>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they unblock it and let the clean water</v>

897
00:46:57.511 --> 00:46:59.880
<v Speaker 1>come in and they'll resuscitate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

898
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

899
00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:04.710
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they said of livestock dogs,</v>

900
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:07.410
<v Speaker 1>people drink that water can kill that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can kill that company.</v>

901
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Do they lose people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every unit that Kusamba water man and</v>

902
00:47:10.201 --> 00:47:12.030
<v Speaker 1>talking to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize they lose this like a</v>

903
00:47:12.031 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 1>handful of things that people get lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

904
00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had mentioned people dying from</v>

905
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.300
<v Speaker 1>anacondas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd mentioned people dying from Black</v>

906
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Cayman's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

907
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I know that injuries from puranas are</v>
<v Speaker 1>common snake bite.</v>

908
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.430
<v Speaker 1>The snakes are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in one of these,</v>

909
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I remember sitting in Robin's friend's</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

910
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.960
<v Speaker 1>his outdoor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Palapa kind of house,</v>

911
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:36.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with hammock strung in it and they're</v>

912
00:47:36.811 --> 00:47:40.150
<v Speaker 1>just being a giant tranche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Low like a two and a half inch diameter</v>

913
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.750
<v Speaker 1>transla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not even doing anything to it.</v>

914
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Which randall is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just hurt.</v>

915
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hurt.</v>

916
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:50.350
<v Speaker 1>They don't really fuck you up like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>black widow or something along those</v>

917
00:47:50.351 --> 00:47:54.860
<v Speaker 1>lines before we found a kid who had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit by a scorpion young kid and um,</v>

918
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.290
<v Speaker 1>some scorpions can be fatal.</v>

919
00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:58.180
<v Speaker 1>He was vomiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very sick,</v>

920
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.990
<v Speaker 1>but just the fact of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they get bit by snakes,</v>

921
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.570
<v Speaker 1>they getting bit by poisonous snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

922
00:48:04.571 --> 00:48:06.460
<v Speaker 1>There's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most debt,</v>

923
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 1>the deadliest snake in the western</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere,</v>

924
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:10.160
<v Speaker 1>the coral they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

925
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.420
<v Speaker 1>They have all the ones he mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their chief getting hit by a,</v>

926
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 1>by a venomous snake and them having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>call a medevac which is not in the air</v>

927
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:21.910
<v Speaker 1>for I think the air force came in with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopter and got them out of there and</v>

928
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:24.280
<v Speaker 1>he was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

929
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit's everywhere man,</v>

930
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.400
<v Speaker 1>but they got an eye for it and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

931
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 1>like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

932
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.600
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the non locals eyes,</v>

933
00:48:34.601 --> 00:48:37.210
<v Speaker 1>the one getting stung and bit and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

934
00:48:37.211 --> 00:48:40.090
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine like the first time I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was down there I got hit by an electric</v>

935
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:41.110
<v Speaker 1>eel a couple times.</v>

936
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That scared the shit out of me,</v>

937
00:48:42.761 --> 00:48:44.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you don't even know what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

938
00:48:44.531 --> 00:48:47.020
<v Speaker 1>You're in the water and Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of getting electrocuted.</v>

939
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.210
<v Speaker 1>There was more in tune with all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

940
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:51.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a strong blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

941
00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.400
<v Speaker 1>it hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have those on fear factor or grab</v>

942
00:48:54.401 --> 00:48:55.720
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like grab a barbell.</v>

943
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:59.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like grabbing a hot wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that an animal,</v>

944
00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:01.000
<v Speaker 1>a living thing and generate that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

945
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Did it voluntarily for a joke just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what it's like.</v>

946
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun.</v>

947
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked.</v>

948
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.090
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like it's probably just</v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>

949
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 1>But I reached in and grabbed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

950
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:12.670
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

951
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.860
<v Speaker 1>that's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

952
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like grabbing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hot wire fence with cattle in it.</v>

953
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched,</v>

954
00:49:19.481 --> 00:49:21.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some sort of a nature</v>

955
00:49:21.101 --> 00:49:24.670
<v Speaker 1>documentary where something tried to eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and uh,</v>

956
00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:29.020
<v Speaker 1>the electrical eel zapped it and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>this animal just lock up and fall over</v>

957
00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:29.640
<v Speaker 1>sideways.</v>

958
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

959
00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:31.230
<v Speaker 1>just pedaled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

960
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.060
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just completely electrocuted it got it</v>

961
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.450
<v Speaker 1>to the point where it just couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>

962
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Have you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>killing the Cayman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

965
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a bunch of fat solid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

966
00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:49.150
<v Speaker 1>because you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since he's done that,</v>

967

<v Speaker 1>a thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>

968
00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.600
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a few of them online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's what's.</v>

969
00:49:53.601 --> 00:49:56.710
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this cayman with electric eel</v>

970
00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.030
<v Speaker 1>and alligator and electric eels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

971
00:49:58.031 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frying.</v>

972
00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just cooking.</v>

973
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

974
00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:03.371
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

975
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:05.950
<v Speaker 1>you asked about eating snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Electric eel meat is not good.</v>

976
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.420
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the many things that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the many things that</v>

977
00:50:10.421 --> 00:50:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Macusa like do not eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at his body.</v>

978
00:50:12.521 --> 00:50:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Just twitching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

979
00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.140
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously that's a little alligator,</v>

980
00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:18.483
<v Speaker 1>but still.</v>

981
00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a crazy animal.</v>

982
00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:22.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was brutal.</v>

983
00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I never saw anything about Jaguars</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing Cayman's until about three or</v>

984
00:50:27.561 --> 00:50:29.540
<v Speaker 1>four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's like a whole slew of</v>

985
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 1>these videos coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you wonder,</v>

986
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe the advent of Gopros and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different video cameras.</v>

987
00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:38.420
<v Speaker 1>People take down there and finally</v>
<v Speaker 1>started catching it on film.</v>

988
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We missed the cycling bike.</v>

989
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.850
<v Speaker 1>We miss the sighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrowly missed the siding.</v>

990
00:50:42.851 --> 00:50:44.510
<v Speaker 1>We were down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tracks are everywhere,</v>

991
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:47.180
<v Speaker 1>so particularly because the time was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just down there.</v>

992
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:52.181
<v Speaker 1>Now the giant river turtles are nesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just like how we have,</v>

993
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:56.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how you picked your sea turtles,</v>

994
00:50:56.391 --> 00:50:59.930
<v Speaker 1>crawl up onto a sandy beach and dig a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole that night later eggs and then</v>

995
00:50:59.931 --> 00:51:04.010
<v Speaker 1>retreat back into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant river turtles lay like that.</v>

996
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:09.460
<v Speaker 1>But so the sandbars are covered in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston turtle shells and there are</v>

997
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:12.590
<v Speaker 1>vultures.</v>

998
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:17.600
<v Speaker 1>So like black vultures and king vultures</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Cara Cara's around the sandbars</v>

999
00:51:17.601 --> 00:51:22.601
<v Speaker 1>feeding on turtle eggs and Jaguar tracks</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over because the jaguars come down</v>

1000
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:27.800
<v Speaker 1>to wait for the turtles to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1001
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:30.950
<v Speaker 1>So you've seen a lot of that and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more surreal,</v>

1002
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:33.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a perspective shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1003
00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:34.670
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1004
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.391
<v Speaker 1>Big with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1005
00:51:35.391 --> 00:51:37.460
<v Speaker 1>that's the oceanic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a judgment to look at that</v>

1006
00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:41.660
<v Speaker 1>sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how old is that fucker?</v>

1007
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:43.250
<v Speaker 1>But I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God does.</v>

1008
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 1>They live hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1009
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1010
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.960
<v Speaker 1>they're ancient thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might've been around when Columbus was</v>

1011
00:51:47.961 --> 00:51:49.290
<v Speaker 1>around the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1012
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:50.380
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1013
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Are you familiar with the [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>treaty?</v>

1014
00:51:52.011 --> 00:51:54.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1015
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.150
<v Speaker 1>things that band international wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic,</v>

1016
00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.230
<v Speaker 1>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of turtles at the</v>

1017
00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.850
<v Speaker 1>MACUSA eat 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They traditionally eight giant river</v>

1018
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:05.250
<v Speaker 1>turtles and many people still do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they call that one the site.</v>

1019
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:06.860
<v Speaker 1>He's turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1020
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Because they now know they can't traffic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's certainly more so they got</v>

1021
00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:14.540
<v Speaker 1>like the eating turtle and the turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But an image it will be forever burned</v>

1022
00:52:14.541 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 1>in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two things that this to like</v>

1023
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.830
<v Speaker 1>sites that'll ever forever be stuck in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind.</v>

1024
00:52:21.831 --> 00:52:23.970
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is a,</v>

00:52:57.291 --> 00:52:59.900
<v Speaker 1>like I have like a Bob's pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Cruz,</v>

1035
00:52:59.901 --> 00:53:01.160
<v Speaker 1>California or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1036
00:53:01.161 --> 00:53:03.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's just like something sent down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there through goodwill,</v>

1037
00:53:03.261 --> 00:53:04.520
<v Speaker 1>donation centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1038
00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:08.450
<v Speaker 1>So they'll have like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like brands,</v>

1039
00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:09.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1040
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.620
<v Speaker 1>like famous brands that you see like</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1041
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our,</v>

1042
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.340
<v Speaker 1>in our culture wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there'll be like hunting monkeys in</v>

1043
00:53:16.341 --> 00:53:19.730
<v Speaker 1>them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like the laggers thing,</v>

1044
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:21.470
<v Speaker 1>it creates that kind of tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1045
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>So do they recognize the city's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations?</v>

1046
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.260
<v Speaker 6>Do they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>did they not eat those turtles?</v>

1047
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:29.123
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

1048
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:33.840
<v Speaker 1>you gathered is kind of loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't traffic in them but they will</v>

1049
00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 1>eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they will eat them.</v>

1050
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.340
<v Speaker 6>So they will collect the eggs but they</v>
<v Speaker 6>won't kill the turtles to sell.</v>

1052
00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.650
<v Speaker 6>So as they become more aware of</v>
<v Speaker 6>conservation,</v>

1053
00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:43.630
<v Speaker 6>like with this giant fish was the fish</v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

1054
00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:48.100
<v Speaker 6>the Arrow piman as they become more</v>
<v Speaker 6>aware of conservation to do.</v>

1055
00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.500
<v Speaker 6>Do you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like recognizing like,</v>

1056
00:53:50.501 --> 00:53:52.000
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's some stuff that we have to leave</v>

1057
00:53:52.001 --> 00:53:53.380
<v Speaker 6>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We got to let it recover.</v>

1058
00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.081
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1059
00:53:54.081 --> 00:53:56.860
<v Speaker 6>they obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're aware of the cycle of life when</v>

1060
00:53:56.861 --> 00:54:00.220
<v Speaker 6>it comes to their slash and burn</v>
<v Speaker 6>agriculture and leaving spots alone,</v>

1061
00:54:00.221 --> 00:54:04.510
<v Speaker 6>like are they becoming more aware of</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what animals they've kind of pushed</v>

1062
00:54:04.511 --> 00:54:06.310
<v Speaker 6>to the brink of extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1063
00:54:06.311 --> 00:54:07.680
<v Speaker 6>And it's like I don't even know how,</v>

1064
00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.490
<v Speaker 1>which is coming from the younger</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation because talking to guys,</v>

1065
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:15.340
<v Speaker 1>to our new guy who's I'm 43,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy just a couple of years older</v>

1066
00:54:15.341 --> 00:54:17.350
<v Speaker 1>than I am and talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1067
00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:23.110
<v Speaker 1>and he was a market hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's glad to see what's happened because</v>

1068
00:54:23.511 --> 00:54:28.511
<v Speaker 1>he in his own lifetime saw how much they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had depleted everything.</v>

1069
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:33.260
<v Speaker 1>So he and his lifetime salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from market hunting,</v>

1070
00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.560
<v Speaker 1>not just from subsistence stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as that village because the village</v>

1071
00:54:36.561 --> 00:54:39.650
<v Speaker 1>was a handful of families right then and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's 305 people.</v>

1072
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:43.100
<v Speaker 1>As that village grew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he watched,</v>

1073
00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the giant river otters.</v>

1074
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:50.950
<v Speaker 1>They were hunting giant river otters to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell the hides into Brazil and they</v>

1075
00:54:51.531 --> 00:54:55.410
<v Speaker 1>would smoke them out of their dens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he watched their numbers go down as a</v>

1076
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:56.960
<v Speaker 1>100 pound otter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For convenience.</v>

1078
00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Just as the name would let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very vocal,</v>

1079
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:05.780
<v Speaker 1>a large vocabulary of crazy sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The giant river otters make they get</v>

1080
00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:07.610
<v Speaker 1>when they see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pissed and they start making</v>

1081
00:55:07.611 --> 00:55:08.690
<v Speaker 1>crazy noises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See them.</v>

1082
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see them all the time.</v>

1083
00:55:09.711 --> 00:55:10.940
<v Speaker 1>They're squawking at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1084
00:55:10.941 --> 00:55:12.890
<v Speaker 1>what does it sound like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a</v>

1085
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.393
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1086
00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.160
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot better now.</v>

1087
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Look at that soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1088
00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:19.800
<v Speaker 1>they're easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some kind of snake or eel.</v>

1089
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.400
<v Speaker 1>They make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have an alarm noise in a number of</v>

1091
00:55:23.401 --> 00:55:26.040
<v Speaker 1>barks and crazy sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1092
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:28.320
<v Speaker 1>so he watched those get depleted from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyde hunting,</v>

1093
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:34.430
<v Speaker 1>giant river turtles from hunting eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he could see that the era pimas</v>

1094
00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:39.590
<v Speaker 1>were disappearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he was really glad this guy was</v>

1095
00:55:39.991 --> 00:55:43.440
<v Speaker 1>really glad that they'd gotten onto some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other way to bring some cash into the</v>

1096
00:55:43.441 --> 00:55:45.060
<v Speaker 1>village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1097
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.150
<v Speaker 6>And the air uptime of fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do they find out about this?</v>

1098
00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.600
<v Speaker 6>Like people from the United States are</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1099
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:51.780
<v Speaker 6>where are they coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1100
00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:52.614
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure.</v>

1101
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:54.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that there's been a number of</v>

1102
00:55:54.741 --> 00:55:56.070
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1103
00:55:56.690 --> 00:56:01.690
<v Speaker 1>coasta sunglasses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>company Kosta invested pretty heavily</v>

1104
00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:05.930
<v Speaker 1>through a conservation program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have coasta sunglasses invested</v>

1105
00:56:05.931 --> 00:56:10.931
<v Speaker 1>pretty heavily in helping them establish</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guiding system down there to take</v>

1106
00:56:12.831 --> 00:56:16.070
<v Speaker 1>people out to fish Arab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these people that come down,</v>

1107
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.160
<v Speaker 1>trained some of the Macugen how does</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with Westerners,</v>

1108
00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.470
<v Speaker 1>like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1109
00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.670
<v Speaker 1>in the time and we were out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were out.</v>

1110
00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.140
<v Speaker 1>When I'm with them on the river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're out.</v>

1111
00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in the hunting and fishing</v>

1112
00:56:35.441 --> 00:56:39.340
<v Speaker 1>activities that they do year round on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that they identify to be</v>

1113
00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 1>sustainable resources because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

1114
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:44.920
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still hunt several days a week,</v>

1115
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rovan that they live off fishing game.</v>

1116
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Everyone in that village,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all their protein is hunting and fishing</v>

1117
00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:55.030
<v Speaker 1>protein and some chickens that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise,</v>

1118
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.640
<v Speaker 1>but that's all their protein.</v>

1119
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So they're engaged in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a daily sense.</v>

1120
00:56:59.981 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Like Robin says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he spends about two days a week farming.</v>

1121
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:06.250
<v Speaker 1>He spent two or three days a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and fishing.</v>

1122
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.280
<v Speaker 1>And then he has other obligations yet is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take care of,</v>

1123
00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.760
<v Speaker 1>but he hunts and fishes constantly year</v>
<v Speaker 1>round and it's just,</v>

1124
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:16.000
<v Speaker 1>if he kills a white lip packery he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good for a week.</v>

1125
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Did you bring your bow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1126
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I brought my bowl fish and boat and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought a regular bowl.</v>

1127
00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Now when they saw your bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're like,</v>

1128
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you get us some of these,</v>

1129
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly not that excited about it</v>

1130
00:57:26.321 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they know they would run up</v>

1131
00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:31.420
<v Speaker 1>against sourcing problems with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrowverse got a,</v>

1132
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.670
<v Speaker 1>at one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robin had a recurve,</v>

1133
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he lost his house burnt down and he</v>

1134
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:38.050
<v Speaker 1>lost his recurve anyways.</v>

1135
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:42.160
<v Speaker 1>So just for the simple fact that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them and make arrows very quickly.</v>

1136
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.260
<v Speaker 1>They don't need to worry about how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever sourced parts.</v>

1137
00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:46.000
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have all this other stuff like</v>

1138
00:57:46.001 --> 00:57:47.890
<v Speaker 1>machete blades and all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1139
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.400
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1140
00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:53.540
<v Speaker 1>if you get a good compound boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

1141
00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I think if you brought one down and left</v>
<v Speaker 1>it there,</v>

1142
00:57:56.550 --> 00:57:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I think if you brought one down and left</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1143
00:57:58.201 --> 00:58:01.330
<v Speaker 1>I would get a lot of use will under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1144
00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Would it be too effective?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like would they run into problems with,</v>

1145
00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:07.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have kind of a sustainability</v>

1146
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1147
00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1148
00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I think that if you went down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1149
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:17.110
<v Speaker 1>this is speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think if you went down and gave</v>

1150
00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.480
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had down with a dozen of these</v>

1151
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:24.481
<v Speaker 1>things and left them there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that along that river corridor</v>

1152
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:31.450
<v Speaker 1>you would see a diminishment of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>handful of bird species for sure.</v>

1153
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think because the birds.</v>

1154
00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:37.150
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why it's a little bit tricky</v>

1155
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:41.020
<v Speaker 1>because I think that you would also be</v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing demand because one of the</v>

1156
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:45.910
<v Speaker 1>things about the birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Guano and curtis owls is that they</v>

1157
00:58:45.911 --> 00:58:48.820
<v Speaker 1>want them to fletch arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're hard to get.</v>

1158
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.950
<v Speaker 1>So they really want them because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked the,</v>

1159
00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:55.720
<v Speaker 1>they classify them under this broad</v>
<v Speaker 1>category that you hear in other places</v>

1160
00:58:55.721 --> 00:58:59.440
<v Speaker 1>called police and basically it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>

1161
00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.650
<v Speaker 1>some people say Paul always refers to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific career,</v>

1162
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.200
<v Speaker 1>but some people use pulleys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1163
00:59:05.201 --> 00:59:06.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Turkey,</v>

1164
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 1>like bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Turkey being a good edible birds.</v>

1165
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:15.910
<v Speaker 1>So the birds that they fletch arrows</v>
<v Speaker 1>with are also coveted food items.</v>

1166
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:18.340
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1167
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1168
00:59:19.391 --> 00:59:23.450
<v Speaker 1>if you were to bring conventional</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery tackle in,</v>

1169
00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 1>you would see that diminished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now other people will have shotguns,</v>

1170
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:30.020
<v Speaker 1>but the limiting factor there is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive the ammunition is.</v>

1171
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:35.150
<v Speaker 1>So they'll have like the shotgun shell</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they might have a handful of shotgun</v>

1172
00:59:35.151 --> 00:59:38.420
<v Speaker 1>shells that would last them a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it would own use when absolutely</v>

1173
00:59:38.421 --> 00:59:40.040
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Villa David,</v>

1174
00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:43.610
<v Speaker 1>they've been having a Jaguar problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were there.</v>

1175
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:49.210
<v Speaker 1>They had over the previous two months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last 24 dogs including a dog while we</v>

1176
00:59:50.301 --> 00:59:53.780
<v Speaker 1>were there to a Jaguar who comes in at</v>
<v Speaker 1>night and kills dogs and chickens.</v>

1177
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:59.180
<v Speaker 1>He was speculating that at some point in</v>
<v Speaker 1>time they will probably have to get rid</v>

1178
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:04.181
<v Speaker 1>of that Jaguar and that it would be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>firearm issue there would have to like</v>

1179
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.350
<v Speaker 1>figure out a solution for with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>firearm.</v>

1180
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:08.930
<v Speaker 1>So even people that might have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>firearm,</v>

1181
01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm have limited ammunition and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a,</v>

1182
01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:16.040
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a league,</v>

1183
01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 1>a tricky spot and the legal situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to have a firearm.</v>

1184
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:23.480
<v Speaker 1>But Bose I think that they would knock</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit out of carousels and Guano if</v>

1185
01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:26.630
<v Speaker 1>they had good bose but then might not</v>
<v Speaker 1>want them as heavily because it didn't</v>

1186
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:31.631
<v Speaker 1>need the fletching for fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're tackle superior close to</v>

1187
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>superior for bow fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

1188
01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Because the shots are so close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just isn't really necessary.</v>

1189
01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not necessary to have that</v>

1190
01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:44.960
<v Speaker 1>kind of investment and you just tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose arrows,</v>

1191
01:00:44.961 --> 01:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>bow fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wouldn't make sense to have very</v>

1192
01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>expensive fiberglass arrows when you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make an Arrow and 15 minutes,</v>

1193
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.740
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1194
01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're still limited to very</v>

1195
01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>close range shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1196
01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was in Bolivia where they</v>

1197
01:00:58.911 --> 01:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>hunt for a bigger variety of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including monkeys,</v>

1198
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:04.720
<v Speaker 1>a bose would be a gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1199
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>like compound bows be a real game</v>
<v Speaker 1>changer on monkey hunting.</v>

1200
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>So they're not monkey hunting and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't touch them really that.</v>

1201
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Here's the couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of things that are</v>

1202
01:01:15.681 --> 01:01:17.390
<v Speaker 1>really hard to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earlier I was saying like,</v>

1203
01:01:17.391 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>you have this luxury of being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have good conversations in English and</v>

1204
01:01:22.101 --> 01:01:23.660
<v Speaker 1>get your aunts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your questions answered,</v>

1205
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some things you really,</v>

1206
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit a wall.</v>

1207
01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1208
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you hit a wall on is</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say to someone like,</v>

1209
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:35.750
<v Speaker 1>how many days out of the year would you</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess you do x?</v>

1210
01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>It just like you never get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never get there.</v>

1211
01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Did they not understand years now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do,</v>

1212
01:01:43.051 --> 01:01:43.884
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like,</v>

1213
01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:49.330
<v Speaker 1>because we speak in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to understand why</v>

1214
01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:50.860
<v Speaker 1>that's such a hard question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

1215
01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>it would be very hard to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfactory answers about how often do</v>

1216
01:01:56.021 --> 01:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing is like,</v>

1217
01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:03.940
<v Speaker 1>how much do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you like hunting or fishing more</v>

1218
01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>isn't something that's thought about</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it'd be like,</v>

1219
01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you like to hunt more,</v>

1220
01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.950
<v Speaker 1>are far more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do both.</v>

1221
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like the luxury that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

1222
01:02:15.371 --> 01:02:18.400
<v Speaker 1>But what do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't have to do both.</v>

1223
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>You can't do one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was telling you he hunts two days</v>

1224
01:02:22.921 --> 01:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He farms two days a week.</v>

1225
01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>So we meet like asking the same question</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand times and finally kind of</v>

1226
01:02:30.031 --> 01:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>getting finally kind of getting to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>spot because they couched it because one</v>

1227
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>time I pushed him and pushed and pushed</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1228
01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>How many days a year do you hunt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish and we've talked about this for</v>

1229
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>forever and he came up with the figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 200 or 250.</v>

1230
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Then later I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many days a week do you hunt and</v>

1231
01:02:45.991 --> 01:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I asked them that a thousand times</v>

1232
01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>and got to know if you do the math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those numbers is wrong.</v>

1233
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also like what you like most.</v>

1234
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you like this most like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most.</v>

1235
01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Another thing is why don't you eat x?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1236
01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.380
<v Speaker 1>But if I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if imagine if someone came from another</v>

1237
01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:09.381
<v Speaker 1>country to here and you're driving them</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and every single thing they see</v>

1238
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:12.900
<v Speaker 1>that's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they said to you,</v>

1239
01:03:12.901 --> 01:03:15.110
<v Speaker 1>why don't you eat that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1240
01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you eat that spider?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1241
01:03:18.050 --> 01:03:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't eat those spiders.</v>

1242
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you eat that cat?</v>

1243
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:23.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a really complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1244
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:27.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't eat house cats.</v>

1245
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Let me count the reasons why we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat house cats,</v>

1246
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:32.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1247
01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.350
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you eat monkeys?</v>

1248
01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:35.250
<v Speaker 1>He's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1249
01:03:35.251 --> 01:03:37.200
<v Speaker 1>silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't eat monkeys because it's just</v>

1250
01:03:37.201 --> 01:03:40.260
<v Speaker 1>like we just don't eat monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have any weird</v>

1251
01:03:40.261 --> 01:03:41.510
<v Speaker 1>relationship with monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1252
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:41.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

1253
01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:44.310
<v Speaker 1>The more I press them on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wound up being he would say,</v>

1254
01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:48.180
<v Speaker 1>because we have so many fish and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>so easy to get a bite.</v>

1255
01:03:48.181 --> 01:03:52.680
<v Speaker 1>You hunt white lip peccary now white lip</v>
<v Speaker 1>peccary for folks who don't know.</v>

1256
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:54.990
<v Speaker 1>And He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that look like a Havalina as well?</v>

1257
01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little bigger than handling</v>

1258
01:03:56.890 --> 01:03:59.130
<v Speaker 1>the main difference from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a human,</v>

1259
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:03.150
<v Speaker 1>a human perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking on the to what you would.</v>

1260
01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:08.940
<v Speaker 1>What you would jump at is the gregarious</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of the white lip peccary.</v>

1261
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:14.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's three peccaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like the Cohen,</v>

1262
01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I think the Chaco and Peccary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've never laid eyes on,</v>

1263
01:04:18.481 --> 01:04:23.481
<v Speaker 1>White Lipson and collared and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>collared peccary a dozen is a giant</v>

1264
01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:27.000
<v Speaker 1>group of colored pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a big ass group of collared</v>

1265
01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:28.860
<v Speaker 1>peccary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we have in this sucker.</v>

1266
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we have in west Texas,</v>

1267
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of New Mexico,</v>

1268
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.230
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's essentially the same thing as a</v>

1269
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The collared peccary is the havoline.</v>

1270
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Same exact thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The white lip peccary November,</v>

1271
01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I said like a dozen is a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>collards.</v>

1272
01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Have Lean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've hunted those in the US and 700</v>

1273
01:04:49.141 --> 01:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>those in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White Pack.</v>

1274
01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:56.601
<v Speaker 1>We'll run in a group of 100 to 200 whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And white lipped peccaries when I was</v>

1275
01:04:58.291 --> 01:05:02.670
<v Speaker 1>mentioning in cassava,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white lipped peccaries are hell on</v>

1276
01:05:02.671 --> 01:05:03.780
<v Speaker 1>cassava.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patches.</v>

1277
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:06.060
<v Speaker 1>They eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come and meet the stalks,</v>

1278
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:07.163
<v Speaker 1>not the route.</v>

1279
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:09.750
<v Speaker 1>They'll destroy the cassava patch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll dig,</v>

1280
01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:12.330
<v Speaker 1>but they particularly liked eat this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll come in and they like to eat.</v>

1281
01:05:12.331 --> 01:05:13.860
<v Speaker 1>The young shoots growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1282
01:05:13.861 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>can they eat the cassava the route or is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it poisonous to them?</v>

1283
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1284
01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

1285
01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll wish I would've asked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

1286
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>If I had a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get a satisfactory answer out of</v>

1287
01:05:24.911 --> 01:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the white lipped peccaries will come</v>

1288
01:05:28.331 --> 01:05:33.331
<v Speaker 1>into the village and raise holy hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone running grabs their bows and</v>

1289
01:05:34.661 --> 01:05:38.800
<v Speaker 1>then they start shooting in the nail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chase them into the jungle and maybe</v>

1290
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>even track them for a day trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>whittle away at them because it's a</v>

1291
01:05:42.311 --> 01:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>great meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the favorite game meat is</v>

1292
01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>white lip packery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like it better than collared</v>

1293
01:05:47.261 --> 01:05:51.760
<v Speaker 1>peccary because they're bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it like a pork or something like</v>

1294
01:05:51.761 --> 01:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>that where they had like scent glands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're very.</v>

1295
01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like pork has a very strong off</v>

1296
01:05:57.431 --> 01:06:00.100
<v Speaker 1>putting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animal has a very strong offputting</v>

1297
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.220
<v Speaker 1>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the meat doesn't know if you handle</v>

1298
01:06:03.221 --> 01:06:05.650
<v Speaker 1>it properly and keep it clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never.</v>

1299
01:06:05.651 --> 01:06:10.651
<v Speaker 1>It would never be regarded like as as</v>
<v Speaker 1>good as pork to the American palate,</v>

1300
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.820
<v Speaker 1>but to the Macusa Palette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best,</v>

1301
01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:19.630
<v Speaker 1>so their whole thing that we don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these animals,</v>

1302
01:06:19.631 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 1>various animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have so many fish,</v>

1303
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:23.830
<v Speaker 1>flies out the window with white lip</v>
<v Speaker 1>peccary,</v>

1304
01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.370
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the white lipped peccary</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting is also related to the</v>

1305
01:06:27.371 --> 01:06:31.960
<v Speaker 1>protecting of crops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now as long as Rovan can remember,</v>

1306
01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:38.370
<v Speaker 1>real village has had a group of white</v>
<v Speaker 1>lipped peccaries that would come through</v>

1307
01:06:38.891 --> 01:06:43.891
<v Speaker 1>the area trying to raid the gardens and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it came to the area raiding the</v>

1308
01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:47.410
<v Speaker 1>gardens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would kill some number of them and</v>

1309
01:06:47.411 --> 01:06:50.680
<v Speaker 1>then they would track them into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle and stick with them and kill a</v>

1310
01:06:50.681 --> 01:06:51.514
<v Speaker 1>handful.</v>

1311
01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.160
<v Speaker 1>And it was when that happened was a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing.</v>

1312
01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:59.790
<v Speaker 1>They liked the peccaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a number of years where no</v>

1313
01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:02.560
<v Speaker 1>packer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where something happened to this group</v>

1314
01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 1>of one or 200 peccaries they haven't for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1315
01:07:06.521 --> 01:07:11.521
<v Speaker 1>They have not been through the village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not attrition because he was saying</v>

1316
01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:16.120
<v Speaker 1>at the most when we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they come through and get us,</v>

1317
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:21.150
<v Speaker 1>he would say on average we would get</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually kill between one and four when</v>

1318
01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:27.280
<v Speaker 1>they come in and hit the crops if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick with them and a group of guys goes</v>

1319
01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:29.830
<v Speaker 1>after me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white killed between one and four and</v>

1320
01:07:29.831 --> 01:07:31.200
<v Speaker 1>there's 200 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

1321
01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:33.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like slowly whittle away at them.</v>

1322
01:07:33.401 --> 01:07:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just would never account for that.</v>

1323
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.160
<v Speaker 1>But they vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robin never wanted to explain to me why</v>

1324
01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:45.400
<v Speaker 1>they vanished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I kept pestering him about it and</v>

1325
01:07:45.401 --> 01:07:46.960
<v Speaker 1>eventually he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>

1326
01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Since [inaudible] villages now so</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy and we have so much food,</v>

1327
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:59.370
<v Speaker 1>other groups and other villages have</v>
<v Speaker 1>grown very jealous of us</v>

1328
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:06.300
<v Speaker 1>and he told me that a shaman in another</v>
<v Speaker 1>village got so insanely jealous of</v>

1329
01:08:10.891 --> 01:08:15.891
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] prosperity through fishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>for [inaudible] and through all the good</v>

1330
01:08:16.101 --> 01:08:18.260
<v Speaker 1>hunting and fishing that they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1331
01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>that he got so jealous that he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm locked up,</v>

1332
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:26.120
<v Speaker 1>that this shaman locked up there</v>
<v Speaker 1>peccaries.</v>

1333
01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:30.710
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know where perhaps in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains they're locked up.</v>

1334
01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them out is getting them</v>

1335
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:41.171
<v Speaker 1>unlocked is difficult because at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that this shaman locked up there</v>

1336
01:08:41.211 --> 01:08:44.510
<v Speaker 1>peccaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they happened to be without a good</v>

1337
01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:49.511
<v Speaker 1>showman in their village that they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad shot when they have a shaman in</v>

1338
01:08:49.701 --> 01:08:51.020
<v Speaker 1>training his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his.</v>

1339
01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 1>He is a young sham and in training and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his powers are slow to develop.</v>

1340
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 1>So what happened to the old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald?</v>

1341
01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:02.630
<v Speaker 1>This guy's powers have been slow to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>

1342
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:08.740
<v Speaker 1>He's getting there and soon he will</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully be in a position to unlock the</v>

1343
01:09:10.821 --> 01:09:11.200
<v Speaker 1>packer.</v>

1344
01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Now what's a young showman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like a young president?</v>

1345
01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1346
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 1>does it really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we brought up wanting to go talk to</v>

1347
01:09:19.641 --> 01:09:22.970
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the sense that that wasn't the</v>

1348
01:09:22.971 --> 01:09:26.480
<v Speaker 1>best idea to go visit with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1349
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like 300 people in the village.</v>

1350
01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred and five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1351
01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

1352
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:34.070
<v Speaker 1>And I brought up a number of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got the sense that it wasn't the</v>

1353
01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:35.540
<v Speaker 1>greatest idea to go talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there,</v>

1354
01:09:35.541 --> 01:09:40.541
<v Speaker 1>theatrical involves this guy like living</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the outskirts of town and he was in</v>

1355
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:45.600
<v Speaker 1>town but no claims mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a handful of things that was</v>

1356
01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman was telling me and in it,</v>

1357
01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.520
<v Speaker 1>and I want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1358
01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.080
<v Speaker 1>I do not like if I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1359
01:09:54.081 --> 01:09:57.320
<v Speaker 1>If you told me something that I thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>was outlandish,</v>

1360
01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I would fucking jump on you.</v>

1361
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be like,</v>

1362
01:10:00.441 --> 01:10:05.441
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That desire to like be right and to</v>

1363
01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:11.710
<v Speaker 1>dispel a wrongness like I don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lick of that shit when I'm talking to</v>

1364
01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:14.330
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1365
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:15.830
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never like,</v>

1366
01:10:15.831 --> 01:10:17.450
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>

1367
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like it's so inappropriate.</v>

1368
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feeling.</v>

1369
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting to me and also</v>

1370
01:10:23.301 --> 01:10:28.301
<v Speaker 1>give such an interesting glimpse into</v>
<v Speaker 1>how most cultures and societies were</v>

1371
01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:33.020
<v Speaker 1>structured</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time in pre Christian Times.</v>

1372
01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's just like,</v>

1373
01:10:34.101 --> 01:10:36.200
<v Speaker 1>it's just educational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not in any way.</v>

1374
01:10:36.201 --> 01:10:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm never saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1375
01:10:37.471 --> 01:10:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying like,</v>

1376
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:40.244
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1377
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1378
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for sharing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So magic.</v>

1379
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not in any way I,</v>

1380
01:10:45.901 --> 01:10:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I've never like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some things that were explained</v>

1381
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:49.900
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're having a problem or you're,</v>

1382
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:55.630
<v Speaker 1>your archery skills go downhill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have a few misses the way to</v>

1383
01:10:56.571 --> 01:11:00.280
<v Speaker 1>correct that would be to go up and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hand,</v>

1384
01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:05.330
<v Speaker 1>hold the bowstring and punch a beehive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then hold your hand up to that hive</v>

1385
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:14.320
<v Speaker 1>because they don't miss</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you will find you will.</v>

1386
01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:18.980
<v Speaker 1>They will demonstrate their accuracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they bombard you.</v>

1387
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:23.210
<v Speaker 1>And Robin was saying that most of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>even know to hit you between your</v>

1388
01:11:23.211 --> 01:11:26.720
<v Speaker 1>fingers where it really hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will then absorb</v>

1389
01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:33.730
<v Speaker 1>that accuracy in your hand and you will</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a lot better shooting.</v>

1390
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more you can do this throughout</v>

1391
01:11:38.091 --> 01:11:39.950
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strong group will make you.</v>

1392
01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:45.280
<v Speaker 1>It's also helpful just even with kids is</v>
<v Speaker 1>also helpful to beat him by like a</v>

1393
01:11:45.951 --> 01:11:48.450
<v Speaker 1>bullet ant for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1394
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I had the hat and before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's awful,</v>

1395
01:11:50.901 --> 01:11:54.350
<v Speaker 1>but to get hit by a bullet ant to absorb</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the ant strength,</v>

1396
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>but this sharman that fucked up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peccaries could also just be jealous of</v>

1397
01:12:01.161 --> 01:12:01.531
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1398
01:12:01.531 --> 01:12:03.980
<v Speaker 1>and strip your ability to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately.</v>

1399
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:09.510
<v Speaker 6>And what I want to point out that robin</v>
<v Speaker 6>has an email address.</v>

1400
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:12.180
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1401
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:13.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can email.</v>

1402
01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.480
<v Speaker 6>I email with them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1403
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:20.430
<v Speaker 6>And he's firm in his beliefs but also</v>
<v Speaker 6>also.</v>

1404
01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's also a rational.</v>

1405
01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:25.410
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he seems fairly rational outside of</v>

1406
01:12:25.411 --> 01:12:26.244
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

1407
01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm torn even talking about it</v>

1408
01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:33.680
<v Speaker 1>because like I don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of talking about it because,</v>

1409
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:39.140
<v Speaker 1>because I have such a love for him as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1410
01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wouldn't want to say that would</v>

1411
01:12:42.111 --> 01:12:45.050
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would like dispel that idea of like</v>

1412
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:45.950
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

1413
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:47.870
<v Speaker 1>did he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not like that.</v>

1414
01:12:47.871 --> 01:12:50.660
<v Speaker 1>He's not perfectly rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would go anywhere with this guy</v>

1415
01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:53.930
<v Speaker 1>extremely capable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're talking about</v>

1416
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:55.930
<v Speaker 6>just like some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some long held beliefs.</v>

1417
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:59.420
<v Speaker 6>So it's their cultural belief systems</v>
<v Speaker 6>are just deeply ingrained and there's</v>

1418
01:12:59.421 --> 01:13:02.000
<v Speaker 6>probably some sort of a placebo effect</v>
<v Speaker 6>attached to all this.</v>

1419
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:06.950
<v Speaker 6>They've seen it in effect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone has cast what is a,</v>

1420
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some point in time those,</v>

1421
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:10.370
<v Speaker 6>those packers are going to come back</v>
<v Speaker 6>into town.</v>

1422
01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:13.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then what were credit fall?</v>

1423
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:15.560
<v Speaker 6>They'll probably say the Shaman has</v>
<v Speaker 6>relaxed grip.</v>

1424
01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.480
<v Speaker 6>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The new sholman yeah.</v>

1425
01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.100
<v Speaker 6>Or if someone wants credit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just a way of explaining the</v>

1426
01:13:22.101 --> 01:13:23.360
<v Speaker 6>volatility.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's the other thing.</v>

1427
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:24.223
<v Speaker 6>Here's the other thing,</v>

1428
01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:26.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1429
01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:28.850
<v Speaker 1>you could go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1430
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.730
<v Speaker 1>let me give you example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make a point about the way,</v>

1431
01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of see a culture in transition,</v>

1432
01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's always so relative.</v>

1433
01:13:36.321 --> 01:13:37.510
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1434
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:39.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a writer as a staff writer at</v>

1435
01:13:39.591 --> 01:13:42.200
<v Speaker 1>the New Yorker or one of my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists of all time.</v>

1436
01:13:42.201 --> 01:13:44.150
<v Speaker 1>John Lee Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be familiar this book,</v>

1437
01:13:44.151 --> 01:13:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he wrote sort of the definitive Che</v>

1438
01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.273
<v Speaker 1>Guevara Book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Che.</v>

1439
01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a war correspondent rights troubled</v>

1440
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:55.520
<v Speaker 1>spots around the country around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1441
01:13:55.521 --> 01:13:58.580
<v Speaker 1>John Lee Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a piece not long ago in the New</v>

1442
01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Yorker about a group of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

1443
01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:06.590
<v Speaker 1>had just made that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're making first contact with the</v>

1444
01:14:06.591 --> 01:14:08.180
<v Speaker 1>outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just recently,</v>

1445
01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:11.180
<v Speaker 1>2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had been.</v>

1446
01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.650
<v Speaker 1>They were regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were initially regarded as an</v>

1447
01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:19.651
<v Speaker 1>uncontacted group that lived in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>border between Peru and Brazil in the</v>

1448
01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:22.210
<v Speaker 1>jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for whatever reason,</v>

1449
01:14:22.211 --> 01:14:27.211
<v Speaker 1>they started coming out to a main river</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were having some contact with</v>

1450
01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.500
<v Speaker 1>other groups and they killed a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1451
01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:31.403
<v Speaker 1>bose.</v>

1452
01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:37.120
<v Speaker 1>So the government was in a situation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>when dealing with a first contact group,</v>

1453
01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:41.680
<v Speaker 1>you can't go in and just start putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on trial and shit.</v>

1454
01:14:41.681 --> 01:14:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Like it only leads to more problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were trying to.</v>

1455
01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:47.770
<v Speaker 1>It's an article about the difficulties</v>
<v Speaker 1>of leading,</v>

1456
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:53.260
<v Speaker 1>of introducing a first contact people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>into sort of a constructive engagement</v>

1457
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:58.270
<v Speaker 1>with the outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a trick there is some people look</v>

1458
01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and they have some countries have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy of isolation for uncontacted</v>

1459
01:15:02.891 --> 01:15:07.891
<v Speaker 1>people and try to enforce isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other theorists on this or other</v>

1460
01:15:09.191 --> 01:15:12.010
<v Speaker 1>anthropologists think that's completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfair.</v>

1461
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:17.490
<v Speaker 1>That is the most human of tendencies is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find other humans and swap ideas with</v>

1462
01:15:20.021 --> 01:15:21.130
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1463
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:25.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be laughable that I would come</v>

1464
01:15:25.331 --> 01:15:27.580
<v Speaker 1>to you and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1465
01:15:27.581 --> 01:15:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to prevent you from meeting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>

1466
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some aspects of Frenchness rub off on,</v>

1467
01:15:33.881 --> 01:15:35.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're worried about other things too,</v>

1468
01:15:35.771 --> 01:15:37.480
<v Speaker 1>but they're worried about like disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

1469
01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.200
<v Speaker 1>But also a tendency to to the alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be destructive,</v>

1470
01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.130
<v Speaker 1>being lured into prostitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all forms of exploitation,</v>

1471
01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:48.190
<v Speaker 1>trying to protect people from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there are also the romance of</v>

1472
01:15:48.191 --> 01:15:51.550
<v Speaker 1>running into these uncontacted tribes as</v>
<v Speaker 1>such that some people.</v>

1473
01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some people say those photos that</v>

1474
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:56.290
<v Speaker 1>they took from the helicopter where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>see these people are covered in war</v>

1475
01:15:56.291 --> 01:15:57.700
<v Speaker 1>paint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pointing arrows at the</v>

1476
01:15:57.701 --> 01:15:58.510
<v Speaker 1>helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1477
01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:01.420
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the shit that I'm guilty of,</v>

1478
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:05.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even though that's what I was</v>

1479
01:16:05.081 --> 01:16:07.510
<v Speaker 1>going to lead up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing where this battle I have in</v>

1480
01:16:07.511 --> 01:16:08.520
<v Speaker 1>my own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1481
01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.530
<v Speaker 1>That even though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are far,</v>

1482
01:16:11.531 --> 01:16:12.630
<v Speaker 1>far away there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1483
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.160
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far removed from a first contact people.</v>

1484
01:16:15.161 --> 01:16:15.791
<v Speaker 1>They're not even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1485
01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:17.800
<v Speaker 1>the guy's got an email address.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to paint this as</v>

1486
01:16:17.801 --> 01:16:18.920
<v Speaker 1>something is not right.</v>

1487
01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:23.860
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time they made their</v>
<v Speaker 1>bows from raw material out in the jungle</v>

1488
01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.480
<v Speaker 1>and hunt and fish for all their protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that shit so much and I like</v>

1489
01:16:28.481 --> 01:16:31.060
<v Speaker 1>laying in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you told me you can never go back.</v>

1490
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I want to lay in bed thinking about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring,</v>

1491
01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to lay in bed thinking about a</v>

1492
01:16:37.901 --> 01:16:42.901
<v Speaker 1>guy having a problem with this shaman</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just so refreshing and</v>

1493
01:16:43.661 --> 01:16:44.380
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1494
01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:48.460
<v Speaker 1>like mentally exhilarating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does know that that's going on.</v>

1495
01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:52.870
<v Speaker 1>So you get caught in this kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get caught in this kind of.</v>

1496
01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.940
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the opposite of colonialism or</v>

1497
01:16:57.941 --> 01:17:00.280
<v Speaker 1>something where you get caught this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing of wine to be like,</v>

1498
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:05.230
<v Speaker 1>oh these precious cute people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I could just keep them like how I</v>

1499
01:17:05.231 --> 01:17:08.590
<v Speaker 1>like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they stirred my imagination.</v>

1500
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1501
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.850
<v Speaker 1>I just want them to stay like how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are because that's how I like them.</v>

1502
01:17:13.851 --> 01:17:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Like when I come down to visit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to know that they're all doing</v>

1503
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:21.080
<v Speaker 1>the shit that's interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're in no way are they</v>

1504
01:17:21.081 --> 01:17:24.530
<v Speaker 1>perceiving their experience</v>

1505
01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:28.980
<v Speaker 1>in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you go down and see like in the</v>

1506
01:17:28.981 --> 01:17:31.230
<v Speaker 1>handful of years as much they change all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1507
01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the handful of years to see that,</v>

1508
01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:39.260
<v Speaker 1>just like practices are different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dress is different.</v>

1509
01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very different.</v>

1510
01:17:42.330 --> 01:17:45.870
<v Speaker 1>So you're just seeing it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing in real time,</v>

1511
01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:49.590
<v Speaker 1>it happened in a fast way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might come up and be like,</v>

1512
01:17:49.591 --> 01:17:51.900
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was in the US and the pre internet</v>

1513
01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:55.240
<v Speaker 1>days and I came to the US and the post</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet days and um,</v>

1514
01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:00.090
<v Speaker 1>it man is that place different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're watching it like wherever you</v>

1515
01:18:00.091 --> 01:18:02.820
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're also seeing that happen too.</v>

1516
01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:07.680
<v Speaker 1>So you're living that transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to go to there and then come back</v>

1517
01:18:07.681 --> 01:18:09.610
<v Speaker 1>five years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1518
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:11.850
<v Speaker 1>and see things different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

1519
01:18:11.851 --> 01:18:14.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

1520
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:16.680
<v Speaker 1>it fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as I hate to admit it and is a</v>

1521
01:18:16.681 --> 01:18:18.870
<v Speaker 1>wrong is it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just to be like absolutely up,</v>

1522
01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:22.740
<v Speaker 1>but like a kind of bummed me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you talk about,</v>

1523
01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:24.060
<v Speaker 1>when you saw it from a hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1524
01:18:24.061 --> 01:18:26.850
<v Speaker 1>because I tend to view the world through</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hunting and fishing perspective.</v>

1525
01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:30.810
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about bringing bows down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first thought is,</v>

1526
01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:31.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no fun.</v>

1527
01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:35.810
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't do that because I like</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching them a lot with the homemade</v>

1528
01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:40.080
<v Speaker 1>boats right now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's totally rational and it completely</v>

1529
01:18:40.081 --> 01:18:41.070
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1530
01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:42.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

1531
01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.470
<v Speaker 6>furness Dahlia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you find it,</v>

1532
01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.430
<v Speaker 6>you find it as it's changing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1533
01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.970
<v Speaker 6>as much as you know about the American</v>
<v Speaker 6>West as much as you told me about the</v>

1534
01:18:51.971 --> 01:18:55.780
<v Speaker 6>history of the American west and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>native Americans to see these people</v>

1535
01:18:55.781 --> 01:19:00.781
<v Speaker 6>that are essentially like in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the native Americans before the</v>

1536
01:19:01.931 --> 01:19:03.570
<v Speaker 6>colonial people arrive.</v>

1537
01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like a,</v>

1538
01:19:05.411 --> 01:19:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a bold statement.</v>

1539
01:19:09.731 --> 01:19:11.860
<v Speaker 1>If there's an anthropologist or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>historian listening,</v>

1540
01:19:11.861 --> 01:19:13.240
<v Speaker 1>they're going to pull their hair out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would,</v>

1541
01:19:13.241 --> 01:19:18.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would be like I'm so hesitant</v>
<v Speaker 1>to even throw this out.</v>

1542
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Just it's extremely approximate and full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of holes and full of contradictions,</v>

1543
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:26.110
<v Speaker 1>but some kind of post contact scenario</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know,</v>

1544
01:19:26.111 --> 01:19:28.930
<v Speaker 1>like let's say it was the 18 nineties or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something right here.</v>

1545
01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:32.020
<v Speaker 1>The firearm was very much a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1546
01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.333
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

1547
01:19:34.330 --> 01:19:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1548
01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's makes,</v>

1549
01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:39.580
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated in the Internet age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at that time you definitely,</v>

1550
01:19:39.581 --> 01:19:44.170
<v Speaker 1>we definitely established a form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism in the American West right</v>

1551
01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.550
<v Speaker 1>there by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1552
01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:46.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1553
01:19:46.241 --> 01:19:51.241
<v Speaker 1>before the Francis Parkman France</v>
<v Speaker 1>department was this figure,</v>

1554
01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:54.880
<v Speaker 1>he wrote the definitive history of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and Indian war.</v>

1555
01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.280
<v Speaker 1>But in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>42,</v>

1556
01:19:57.281 --> 01:19:59.830
<v Speaker 1>he was a historian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had health problems in 18,</v>

1557
01:19:59.831 --> 01:20:04.831
<v Speaker 1>42,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did a tourism trip out on to the</v>

1558
01:20:05.711 --> 01:20:10.180
<v Speaker 1>great plains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He met some fur trappers,</v>

1559
01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:13.770
<v Speaker 1>some mountain men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He traveled with the Oglala Sioux,</v>

1560
01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:19.120
<v Speaker 1>a crazy horse who probably wasn't crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse yet.</v>

1561
01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.440
<v Speaker 1>He was his name curly as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy horse.</v>

1562
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:24.550
<v Speaker 1>He was in crazy or like the three</v>
<v Speaker 1>stooges,</v>

1563
01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was like a name for mount,</v>

1564
01:20:26.761 --> 01:20:29.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have no idea what it meant before he</v>

1565
01:20:29.321 --> 01:20:31.570
<v Speaker 1>adopted the name crazy horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1566
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 1>he would have been 13 years old and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francis partment traveled with them as a</v>

1567
01:20:37.661 --> 01:20:40.360
<v Speaker 1>tourist and they went into the black</v>
<v Speaker 1>hills of South Dakota.</v>

1568
01:20:40.690 --> 01:20:44.480
<v Speaker 1>They went in there to get lodge poles</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was a time you were in</v>

1569
01:20:44.481 --> 01:20:46.420
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go in and fit out their lodge poles for</v>

1570
01:20:46.421 --> 01:20:49.180
<v Speaker 1>their teepees to replace broken</v>
<v Speaker 1>lodgepoles.</v>

1571
01:20:49.210 --> 01:20:52.540
<v Speaker 1>They went up in the black hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed some big horn sheep by throwing</v>

1572
01:20:52.541 --> 01:20:54.160
<v Speaker 1>rocks down on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off a cliff,</v>

1573
01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:58.000
<v Speaker 1>went and shot a bunch of buffalo and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was out there like as a tourist,</v>

1574
01:20:58.930 --> 01:21:00.670
<v Speaker 1>so tourism in the American West.</v>

1575
01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Now you got to remember the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last free roaming,</v>

1576
01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:13.140
<v Speaker 1>the last like non confined plains</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indians didn't get rounded up until,</v>

1577
01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:17.050
<v Speaker 1>depending on your definition of 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>76,</v>

1578
01:21:17.051 --> 01:21:18.040
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>77,</v>

1579
01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:21.940
<v Speaker 1>so he was out there way before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were still like what they</v>

1580
01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:26.260
<v Speaker 1>described at the time as hostile wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indians were running around and he was</v>

1581
01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:29.710
<v Speaker 1>traveling with them as a tourist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just bring that up to bring this</v>

1582
01:21:29.711 --> 01:21:33.580
<v Speaker 1>idea that here's this group of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are very much engaged in terrorism.</v>

1583
01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I was down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was down at because I wanted to go on</v>

1584
01:21:37.841 --> 01:21:40.150
<v Speaker 1>a river trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walk in and it's something I've done a</v>

1585
01:21:40.151 --> 01:21:44.120
<v Speaker 1>handful of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to go on a river trip and and w</v>

1586
01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:48.880
<v Speaker 1>w and participate in their hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing and food gathering activities as</v>

1587
01:21:48.881 --> 01:21:53.200
<v Speaker 1>they engage in them in the same way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might engage in it if I wasn't there.</v>

1588
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:56.280
<v Speaker 1>That's why we weren't fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we weren't catching air them</v>

1589
01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:59.620
<v Speaker 1>is letting them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that in the Internet era,</v>

1590
01:21:59.650 --> 01:22:01.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's like there's that thing always</v>
<v Speaker 1>returned to.</v>

1591
01:22:01.691 --> 01:22:03.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still</v>

1592
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:08.100
<v Speaker 1>hunting and fishing all your own food or</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing in your yard now.</v>

1593
01:22:08.101 --> 01:22:11.220
<v Speaker 1>When you guys went down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you participate in the hunting and</v>

1594
01:22:11.221 --> 01:22:13.390
<v Speaker 1>fishing or did you just observe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1595
01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Participate in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You participated with their traditional</v>

1596
01:22:16.501 --> 01:22:18.870
<v Speaker 1>tackle or did you use your own stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done?</v>

1597
01:22:18.871 --> 01:22:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've hunted fish with my own and I've</v>

1598
01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:26.001
<v Speaker 1>hunted fish with their bow and in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end I wound up the first time I went</v>

1599
01:22:26.131 --> 01:22:31.110
<v Speaker 1>down I hunted fish the second time too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hunted for fish.</v>

1600
01:22:31.111 --> 01:22:35.100
<v Speaker 1>So both fished with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their gear.</v>

1601
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:40.730
<v Speaker 1>But then it always felt like somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny too because like there's the thing</v>

1602
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:43.350
<v Speaker 1>that happens when you're watching like</v>
<v Speaker 1>goofy,</v>

1603
01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched like goofy survival shows and</v>

1604
01:22:46.531 --> 01:22:49.410
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Desire is the part where the host,</v>

1605
01:22:49.411 --> 01:22:53.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grapples with how difficult it is to</v>

1606
01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:58.101
<v Speaker 1>master ancient technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're trying to just pick it up and</v>

1607
01:22:59.401 --> 01:23:00.540
<v Speaker 1>do it from scratch.</v>

1608
01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rovan has been shooting that bow at</v>

1609
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.870
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 32 years old.</v>

1610
01:23:07.871 --> 01:23:12.490
<v Speaker 1>He's been shooting that boat at fish for</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say 27 years.</v>

1611
01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:16.330
<v Speaker 1>It is not an unusual thing to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1612
01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:19.000
<v Speaker 1>So when you go pick it up and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1613
01:23:19.001 --> 01:23:21.550
<v Speaker 1>you got to give props to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys should be able to kill a</v>

1614
01:23:21.551 --> 01:23:22.181
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bowl.</v>

1615
01:23:22.181 --> 01:23:24.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well kind of in kind of not.</v>

1616
01:23:24.221 --> 01:23:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Because if you spent 27 years doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1617
01:23:26.471 --> 01:23:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you're damn sure going to be good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same way is if you took someone like</v>

1618
01:23:30.611 --> 01:23:35.611
<v Speaker 1>one of these first contact people's from</v>
<v Speaker 1>between Peru and Brazil and handed them</v>

1619
01:23:36.461 --> 01:23:38.320
<v Speaker 1>my laptop and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1620
01:23:38.321 --> 01:23:43.321
<v Speaker 1>pull up my g mail contacts from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be like,</v>

1621
01:23:43.691 --> 01:23:45.520
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta give props to you guys.</v>

1622
01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1623
01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1624
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:53.290
<v Speaker 1>So I was having this conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone the other day where,</v>

1625
01:23:53.370 --> 01:23:55.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time Daniel Boone in 17,</v>

1626
01:23:55.871 --> 01:23:57.880
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Boone went to the cumberland gap</v>

1627
01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:02.500
<v Speaker 1>for the first time and dropped down into</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's now Tennessee and Kentucky and he</v>

1628
01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:03.940
<v Speaker 1>stayed there hunting hides.</v>

1629
01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:04.870
<v Speaker 1>He was a hide hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1630
01:24:04.871 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 1>they're hunting heights for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran out of gunpowder,</v>

1631
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:10.270
<v Speaker 1>made his own gunpowder and made it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a bat.</v>

1632
01:24:10.271 --> 01:24:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Guano your own piss pot ash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1633
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:16.420
<v Speaker 1>You can cook this shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1634
01:24:16.421 --> 01:24:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And make your own gunpowder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was looking at as being the</v>

1635
01:24:19.571 --> 01:24:24.571
<v Speaker 1>epitome of woodsmanship and the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he could do it makes him seem other</v>

1636
01:24:26.351 --> 01:24:27.910
<v Speaker 1>worldly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they,</v>

1637
01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:30.010
<v Speaker 1>what kind of formula do they have for</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much piss?</v>

1638
01:24:30.011 --> 01:24:31.120
<v Speaker 1>How much bat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guano,</v>

1639
01:24:31.210 --> 01:24:33.280
<v Speaker 1>which just something they knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the bat?</v>

1640
01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Guano used to be something that was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>cherished.</v>

1641
01:24:35.321 --> 01:24:36.620
<v Speaker 1>People would go to war for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1642
01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.320
<v Speaker 1>for explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking incredible.</v>

1643
01:24:38.321 --> 01:24:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Not just for explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for fertilizer.</v>

1644
01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1645
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the term batshit crazy like</v>

1646
01:24:44.891 --> 01:24:47.800
<v Speaker 1>the freezer bash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would fight for bat shit.</v>

1647
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would go nuts like it was so</v>

1648
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:51.544
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

1649
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.640
<v Speaker 1>That's where all the buffalo bones went</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the near extermination of the</v>

1650
01:24:54.641 --> 01:24:58.600
<v Speaker 1>buffalo really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the really good shit was bone China,</v>

1651
01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.300
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tableware and everything else is</v>

1652
01:25:01.301 --> 01:25:02.800
<v Speaker 1>fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1653
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could make the same.</v>

1654
01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Some of the same characters that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in the slaughter involved in</v>

1655
01:25:07.211 --> 01:25:08.830
<v Speaker 1>picking out the bones are called bone</v>
<v Speaker 1>pickers.</v>

1656
01:25:08.831 --> 01:25:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Picked up fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

1657
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that about Baghwan have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that bone China.</v>

1658
01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still bone China.</v>

1659
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:17.080
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1660
01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.500
<v Speaker 1>I thought China was always some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ceramic.</v>

1661
01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a place in Detroit on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Rogue River in Detroit that have</v>

1662
01:25:24.041 --> 01:25:25.510
<v Speaker 1>the rouge river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rogue river,</v>

1663
01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:27.760
<v Speaker 1>depending on what Dude Michigan you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to.</v>

1665
01:25:31.271 --> 01:25:36.271
<v Speaker 1>carbon works that used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're watching movies,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1667
01:25:38.441 --> 01:25:43.441
<v Speaker 1>that giant pyramid pile of buffalo</v>
<v Speaker 1>skulls that turns up in everywhere,</v>

1668
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:46.300
<v Speaker 1>every book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every movie.</v>

1669
01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.840
<v Speaker 1>That photo was taken at the Detroit</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon works and what they are producing</v>

1670
01:25:52.721 --> 01:25:55.090
<v Speaker 1>was bone fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is there more than one of those photos</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere?</v>

1672
01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't escape that picture.</v>

1673
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.960
<v Speaker 1>That's an incredible picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1674
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.830
<v Speaker 1>That's taken in Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michigan,</v>

1675
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.150
<v Speaker 1>where I'll point out was one of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>handful of states that never had buffalo</v>

1676
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:11.590
<v Speaker 1>in the history in the history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no buffalo,</v>

1677
01:26:11.610 --> 01:26:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're extra paid it out of</v>

1678
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just knows where those bones are</v>

1679
01:26:17.091 --> 01:26:20.840
<v Speaker 1>picked up in the American west ship by</v>
<v Speaker 1>rail to Minneapolis,</v>

1680
01:26:20.841 --> 01:26:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Detroit turned into bone fertilizer and</v>

1681
01:26:24.081 --> 01:26:26.720
<v Speaker 1>then shipped back out for people tilling</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the great plains.</v>

1682
01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Go back to that photo again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The photo.</v>

1683

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1684
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:32.930
<v Speaker 1>How many skulls is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my book about Buffalo,</v>

1685
01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:38.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm describing that picture and I say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the man standing on top is like an</v>

1686
01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.470
<v Speaker 1>exclamation point at the end of a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence about death and destruction</v>

1687
01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:48.230
<v Speaker 6>because I can look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like he somehow realizes the</v>

1688
01:26:48.231 --> 01:26:51.290
<v Speaker 6>weirdness of what he's involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that was post extermination.</v>

1689
01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:53.140
<v Speaker 6>There's a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1690
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:58.380
<v Speaker 6>podcasts from Dan Carlin on the wrath of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cons on the GIG economy.</v>

1691
01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:01.340
<v Speaker 6>They describe how the charisma and Shaw</v>
<v Speaker 6>sends a,</v>

1692
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:03.950
<v Speaker 6>a group to a checkout Gin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>China,</v>

1693
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:06.980
<v Speaker 6>and they got there like about a year</v>
<v Speaker 6>after getting,</v>

1694
01:27:06.981 --> 01:27:09.500
<v Speaker 6>his con had killed everyone in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>entire city,</v>

1695
01:27:09.501 --> 01:27:13.070
<v Speaker 6>over a million people and they thought</v>
<v Speaker 6>what they saw in the distance they</v>

1696
01:27:13.071 --> 01:27:16.520
<v Speaker 6>thought was a snow cap mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As they got closer,</v>

1697
01:27:16.521 --> 01:27:18.440
<v Speaker 6>they realized it was a pile of human</v>
<v Speaker 6>bones.</v>

1698
01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:23.050
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those guys are hardcore shit.</v>

1699
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:25.720

<v Speaker 6>Jonestown,</v>

1700
01:27:25.730 --> 01:27:28.030
<v Speaker 6>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then nothing but be like,</v>

1701
01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:28.700
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>minor.</v>

1702
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.230
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'd be like a car crash.</v>

1703
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:33.230
<v Speaker 6>He changed the carbon footprint of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>human race.</v>

1704
01:27:33.650 --> 01:27:36.350
<v Speaker 6>Him during his time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't know how many people they</v>

1705
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:40.010
<v Speaker 6>have the population through deep</v>
<v Speaker 6>population cooking fires.</v>

1706
01:27:40.110 --> 01:27:42.740
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they believe they killed more than 10</v>

1707
01:27:42.741 --> 01:27:47.150
<v Speaker 6>percent of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Gingiss Khan and his people through</v>

1708
01:27:47.151 --> 01:27:50.810
<v Speaker 6>his orders killed more than 10 percent</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the population of the world.</v>

1709
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:53.630
<v Speaker 6>And wasn't he the number one</v>

01:27:54.490 --> 01:27:57.670
<v Speaker 1>land conquer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just never held on anything.</v>

1711
01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conquered more in like conquered more</v>

1712

<v Speaker 1>than Napoleon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conquered more than Hitler,</v>

1713
01:28:03.761 --> 01:28:04.594
<v Speaker 1>but just didn't hold it.</v>

1714
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:06.740
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know about that,</v>

1715
01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:10.160
<v Speaker 6>but I know that they always lived in</v>
<v Speaker 6>tents and they despised people that</v>

1716
01:28:10.161 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 6>lived in homes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They thought they were pussies the</v>

1717
01:28:12.201 --> 01:28:14.880
<v Speaker 6>breath out after their life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They brought out their vulnerable to</v>

1718
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.423
<v Speaker 6>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1719
01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:17.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1720
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:20.930
<v Speaker 6>is anybody listening a wrath of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>cons?</v>

1721
01:28:20.931 --> 01:28:24.140
<v Speaker 6>It's a five part series and I think Dan</v>
<v Speaker 6>Carlin,</v>

1722
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:26.600
<v Speaker 6>he charges for them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can buy it on Itunes,</v>

1723
01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:30.420
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's only a dollar per and</v>
<v Speaker 6>is the best value over sees the World</v>

1724
01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:31.550
<v Speaker 6>War One.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1725
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and not sure what else he's done.</v>

1726
01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 6>He's done a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean his podcast is just absolutely</v>

1727
01:28:36.861 --> 01:28:40.130
<v Speaker 6>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's incredible and super humble.</v>

1728
01:28:40.131 --> 01:28:44.780
<v Speaker 6>Guy Won't call himself a historian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but meanwhile has the best history</v>

1729
01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:47.720
<v Speaker 6>educational series you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a buck,</v>

1730
01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:51.140
<v Speaker 6>a buck a piece and they were like an</v>
<v Speaker 6>hour and a half long and they're fucking</v>

1731
01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:51.974
<v Speaker 6>incredible.</v>

1732
01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:53.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a.</v>

1733
01:28:53.631 --> 01:28:56.240
<v Speaker 6>he's a real treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That guy doesn't call himself in his</v>

1734
01:28:56.241 --> 01:28:58.850
<v Speaker 6>story because he doesn't use like</v>
<v Speaker 6>primary source material or something</v>

1735
01:28:58.851 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 6>just reads popular works.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why,</v>

1736
01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:04.890
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know he who owns the name,</v>

1737
01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:08.220
<v Speaker 6>who owns the definition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's just really humble,</v>

1738
01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:14.040
<v Speaker 6>but his main focus of study,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his entire life has been history,</v>

1739
01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.590
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and when he does these things where it's</v>

1740
01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:17.441
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1741
01:29:17.441 --> 01:29:19.740
<v Speaker 6>if he calls what he does at podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I need to change.</v>

1742
01:29:19.741 --> 01:29:24.260
<v Speaker 6>What I do is I what I call a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just pales in comparison because</v>

1743
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:25.780
<v Speaker 6>we're just sitting here talking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1744
01:29:25.781 --> 01:29:27.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well he does as he prepares for these</v>

1745
01:29:27.901 --> 01:29:32.010
<v Speaker 6>things for months and sites,</v>
<v Speaker 6>different sources and different lunches</v>

1746
01:29:32.011 --> 01:29:35.760
<v Speaker 6>and then essentially does an educational</v>
<v Speaker 6>entertainment piece.</v>

1747
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:37.303
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1748
01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why he doesn't like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>term his star and his because he's not,</v>

1749
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:44.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not contributing.</v>

1750
01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:47.550
<v Speaker 1>He's not contributing to the body of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

1751
01:29:47.551 --> 01:29:48.670
<v Speaker 1>He's interpreting the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1752
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:50.100
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>

1753
01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a good point.</v>

1754
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.841
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>

1755
01:29:51.841 --> 01:29:53.760
<v Speaker 6>I think he's just super humbled to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just wouldn't,</v>

1756
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:57.930
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't say that no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but somehow,</v>

1757
01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:02.550
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why more disturbing to see</v>
<v Speaker 6>a pile of human bodies than it is to see</v>

1758
01:30:02.551 --> 01:30:04.080
<v Speaker 6>a pile of the buffalo bones.</v>

1759
01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you I'm not talking about</v>

1760
01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:11.410
<v Speaker 1>a thousand times what after the custer</v>
<v Speaker 1>massacre,</v>

1761
01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:17.370
<v Speaker 1>the guys that that were following the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other soldiers who were coming in after</v>

1762
01:30:18.131 --> 01:30:19.990
<v Speaker 1>the massacre and they didn't know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>had happened.</v>

1763
01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:24.080
<v Speaker 1>You know they hadn't got word yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that custer and his entire command had</v>

1764
01:30:24.081 --> 01:30:29.081
<v Speaker 1>been wiped out by the Sioux and northern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheyenne and they're riding up the</v>

1765
01:30:29.171 --> 01:30:33.310
<v Speaker 1>valley and they're looking off in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance and they're in there see all</v>

1766
01:30:33.311 --> 01:30:38.311
<v Speaker 1>these sort of white bloody ish things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these dark brown things and one</v>

1767
01:30:40.241 --> 01:30:43.510
<v Speaker 1>of the guys wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their initial impression looking at it</v>

1768
01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:49.110
<v Speaker 1>was that cost or must have caught the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indians in the middle of a buffalo hunt</v>

1769
01:30:50.290 --> 01:30:55.030
<v Speaker 1>and what they were seeing was it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>summertime and they were seeing fatty</v>

1770
01:30:55.031 --> 01:31:00.031
<v Speaker 1>buffalo carcasses that had been skinned</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the brown things where the</v>

1771
01:31:00.371 --> 01:31:03.160
<v Speaker 1>buffalo hides laid out next to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>carcass.</v>

1772
01:31:03.730 --> 01:31:08.440
<v Speaker 1>But when on closer inspection it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brown things were horses,</v>

1773
01:31:08.441 --> 01:31:10.840
<v Speaker 1>cavalry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horses and the white things were</v>

1774
01:31:10.841 --> 01:31:12.490
<v Speaker 1>stripped and mutilated soldiers.</v>

1775
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:18.290
<v Speaker 6>A good image wasn't one of the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the native Americans.</v>

1776
01:31:18.291 --> 01:31:22.280
<v Speaker 6>That was in the little big horn water,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever event.</v>

1777
01:31:22.730 --> 01:31:25.730
<v Speaker 6>Wasn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the guys who toured with wild</v>

1778
01:31:25.731 --> 01:31:26.810
<v Speaker 6>bill?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Many of them.</v>

1779
01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:30.000
<v Speaker 6>So they were.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had killed American soldiers and</v>

1780
01:31:30.001 --> 01:31:30.834
<v Speaker 6>then they went on this</v>

1781
01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:32.710
<v Speaker 1>entertainment tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:37.740
<v Speaker 1>It will be as though it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fucking risky comparison.</v>

1783
01:31:40.530 --> 01:31:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not even gonna say Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1784
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:44.010
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1785
01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I definitely was going to say that x is</v>
<v Speaker 1>way different.</v>

1786
01:31:45.761 --> 01:31:47.200
<v Speaker 1>It would be like a</v>

1787
01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:49.763
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1788
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the comparison.</v>

1789
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:55.580
<v Speaker 1>It will come back to haunt me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1790
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think of something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would work.</v>

1791
01:31:57.210 --> 01:31:58.011
<v Speaker 1>It will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1792
01:31:58.011 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1794

<v Speaker 3>right now in Columbia where the Farc</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now that Columbia has struck a</v>

01:32:10.751 --> 01:32:15.751
<v Speaker 3>peace accord with the FARC and the FARC</v>
<v Speaker 3>are entering into politics,</v>

1797
01:32:16.211 --> 01:32:19.990
<v Speaker 3>entering into media.</v>

1798
01:32:19.991 --> 01:32:21.970
<v Speaker 3>life fighting against the Colombia</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1799
01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Many atrocities were traded back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

1800
01:32:24.970 --> 01:32:29.650
<v Speaker 3>They now come on the Columbia or</v>

01:33:40.751 --> 01:33:42.580
<v Speaker 3>their photos taken with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1829
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:47.710
<v Speaker 3>He did selfies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Selfies with people.</v>

1830
01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:49.180
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a crazy thing.</v>

1831
01:33:49.181 --> 01:33:53.140
<v Speaker 3>That must've been quite a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had some mock war that they would do.</v>

1832
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:55.060
<v Speaker 3>They would come out and reenact the</v>
<v Speaker 3>battle.</v>

1833
01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.420
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

1834
01:33:57.530 --> 01:34:00.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you could go down and this would have</v>

1835
01:34:00.021 --> 01:34:02.960
<v Speaker 3>been in your own lifetime that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1836
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:07.760
<v Speaker 3>the families of the men killed at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>battle of little big horn could have</v>

1837
01:34:07.761 --> 01:34:12.761
<v Speaker 3>gone down and got their photo taken with</v>
<v Speaker 3>and paid to watch and interacted with</v>

1838
01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:17.990
<v Speaker 3>the gentleman who likely clover to their</v>
<v Speaker 3>father's head and with a Tomahawk.</v>

1839
01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:23.200
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not as like we are thinking about</v>

1840
01:34:23.961 --> 01:34:25.850
<v Speaker 3>how much worse we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1841
01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Is that buffalo bill up there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's him.</v>

1842
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:32.090
<v Speaker 3>That's him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's from his show.</v>

1843
01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.513
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

1844
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:36.060
<v Speaker 3>Pumps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we going to say we're not that far</v>

1845
01:34:36.061 --> 01:34:37.500
<v Speaker 3>removed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

1846
01:34:37.501 --> 01:34:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I was just saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we now think we've gotten to such a</v>

1847
01:34:40.981 --> 01:34:42.090
<v Speaker 3>weird spot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>

1848
01:34:42.091 --> 01:34:46.200
<v Speaker 3>You want to point out that people must</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been a tad more forgiving at the</v>

1849
01:34:46.201 --> 01:34:46.921
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1850
01:34:46.921 --> 01:34:49.470
<v Speaker 3>there must have been much more used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>death and murder.</v>

1851
01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was so common and it's just,</v>

1852
01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:57.770
<v Speaker 3>it was so personal because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it with hatchets axes and</v>

1853
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:02.300
<v Speaker 3>guns that don't fire very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you do it at close range shooting</v>

1854
01:35:02.301 --> 01:35:05.300
<v Speaker 3>people with muskets from and there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much more violence then.</v>

1855
01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much more depth.</v>

1856
01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:11.750
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you grow up and be so old</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and never see a dead person is just</v>

1857
01:35:11.751 --> 01:35:13.640
<v Speaker 3>a new idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is pretty crazy.</v>

1858
01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:15.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got people my age have never seen a</v>

1859
01:35:15.861 --> 01:35:17.000
<v Speaker 3>dead guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1860
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:21.080
<v Speaker 3>Well it's a real eyeopener when you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

1861
01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:24.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that haven't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even seen a dead animal.</v>

1862
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:25.040
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could sit,</v>

1863
01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:27.740
<v Speaker 3>rattle off the dead people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen so many in my mind.</v>

1864
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.860
<v Speaker 3>How many dead people have I seen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1865
01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Not 10.</v>

1866
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:40.870
<v Speaker 3>What have you seen dead people from all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw two people that were not just</v>

1867
01:35:42.121 --> 01:35:46.350
<v Speaker 3>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in bits after a plane crash I saw</v>

1868
01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:48.160
<v Speaker 3>where was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>

1869
01:35:48.230 --> 01:35:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Not even a mile from my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a little kid.</v>

1870
01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then um,</v>

1871
01:35:53.010 --> 01:35:56.070
<v Speaker 3>and then a commercial plane or like one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those little private,</v>

1872
01:35:56.071 --> 01:35:58.440
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>57 year old man and a 13 year old kid.</v>

1873
01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:03.090
<v Speaker 3>I try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried recently briefly to find time to</v>

1874
01:36:03.091 --> 01:36:04.920
<v Speaker 3>go back and find the article.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the way I,</v>

1875
01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:09.870
<v Speaker 3>here's how the story went down is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I remember a detail that I</v>

1876
01:36:09.871 --> 01:36:14.610
<v Speaker 3>remember very clearly is that this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was his neighbor kid and they,</v>

1877
01:36:14.611 --> 01:36:17.310
<v Speaker 3>he had told this kid's parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going down the wash the</v>

1878
01:36:17.311 --> 01:36:21.240
<v Speaker 3>airplane and look at the airplane and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to take the kid up for a flight.</v>

1879
01:36:21.810 --> 01:36:22.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true or not.</v>

1880
01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:25.620
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to find that article to</v>
<v Speaker 3>confirm that aspect of it.</v>

1881
01:36:25.621 --> 01:36:29.460
<v Speaker 3>But I lived on a lake called Middle Lake</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody remembers for whatever</v>

1882
01:36:29.461 --> 01:36:31.590
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy balls our lake a couple times</v>

1883
01:36:31.591 --> 01:36:35.600
<v Speaker 3>really low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy down on the east end of</v>

1884
01:36:35.610 --> 01:36:39.810
<v Speaker 3>the lake named Mr Rupert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember what was unusual about Mr</v>

1885
01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:42.750
<v Speaker 3>Rupert was he would eat freshwater</v>
<v Speaker 3>clams,</v>

1886
01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:45.240
<v Speaker 3>which we were forbidden from doing by</v>
<v Speaker 3>her dad.</v>

1887
01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:48.090
<v Speaker 3>But</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1888
01:36:48.091 --> 01:36:49.920
<v Speaker 3>it's just not as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't regard it as a good</v>

1889
01:36:49.921 --> 01:36:53.100
<v Speaker 3>practice at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the freshwater clams because the toxins,</v>

1890
01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:54.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing I haven't really</v>

1891
01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:57.410
<v Speaker 3>looked into why that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just generally don't eat fresh</v>

1892
01:36:57.411 --> 01:37:00.360
<v Speaker 3>water clans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we would go get them and cleaned</v>

1893
01:37:00.361 --> 01:37:01.260
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember we cleaned a whole</v>

1894
01:37:01.261 --> 01:37:02.490
<v Speaker 3>shitload once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my dad's like,</v>

1895
01:37:02.491 --> 01:37:04.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Mr Rupert would eat these freshwater</v>

1896
01:37:04.831 --> 01:37:05.664
<v Speaker 3>clams.</v>

1897
01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:08.100
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you go raw already cook him.</v>

1898
01:37:08.490 --> 01:37:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he would cook them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1899
01:37:11.101 --> 01:37:14.700
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that plane when a dove down over</v>

1900
01:37:14.701 --> 01:37:15.690
<v Speaker 3>the lake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it went up,</v>

1901
01:37:15.691 --> 01:37:18.150
<v Speaker 3>but then dove down again and never came</v>
<v Speaker 3>back up.</v>

1902
01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:24.720
<v Speaker 3>And he even told some neighbors this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next day when we wake up,</v>

1903
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:29.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sheriff's possy the mounted like our</v>

1904
01:37:29.041 --> 01:37:31.830
<v Speaker 3>area had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mounted like a bunch of volunteers who</v>

1905
01:37:31.831 --> 01:37:34.530
<v Speaker 3>had horses and they were like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mounted sheriff's Possy,</v>

1906
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:37.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like deputized individuals during</v>

1907
01:37:37.650 --> 01:37:42.330
<v Speaker 3>emergencies such as this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were all loading up their horses to</v>

1908
01:37:42.331 --> 01:37:46.800
<v Speaker 3>head out into the woods to look for some</v>
<v Speaker 3>plain and another detail that was told</v>

1909
01:37:46.801 --> 01:37:50.070
<v Speaker 3>to me that I wanted to verify that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to do.</v>

1910
01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:53.490
<v Speaker 3>I just need to go back and go through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the microfiche where I grew up in find</v>

1911
01:37:53.491 --> 01:37:55.080
<v Speaker 3>the article because it was something.</v>

1912
01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:00.210
<v Speaker 3>It had a signal on it and the signal was</v>
<v Speaker 3>picked up by some other country even,</v>

1913
01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:03.600
<v Speaker 3>but they knew that a plane had gone down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was a matter of fact.</v>

1914
01:38:03.601 --> 01:38:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Everyone at this point knew that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>plane had gone down</v>

1915
01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:09.780
<v Speaker 3>and we were riding around on our bikes</v>
<v Speaker 3>out in the woods.</v>

1916
01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of following the sheriff's</v>
<v Speaker 3>Posse guys.</v>

1917
01:38:12.271 --> 01:38:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Is there a sort of combing through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>woods and eventually a news helicopter</v>

1918
01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:21.140
<v Speaker 3>was hovering over a spot like right at</v>
<v Speaker 3>where a right.</v>

1919
01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:26.430
<v Speaker 3>We're at the end of white lake drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was a news helicopter hovered</v>

1920
01:38:26.431 --> 01:38:29.970
<v Speaker 3>over there and my two brothers went</v>
<v Speaker 3>directly there on their bikes now as the</v>

1921
01:38:29.971 --> 01:38:34.971
<v Speaker 3>younger and if for some reason couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>get my mom and then we drove over and we</v>

1922
01:38:35.101 --> 01:38:39.450
<v Speaker 3>got to the end of White Lake Road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had to walk into the woods and there</v>

1923
01:38:39.451 --> 01:38:44.451
<v Speaker 3>was a guy there tried to block my mom</v>
<v Speaker 3>and me from going in there and always</v>

1924
01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:45.260
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>

1925
01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:46.093
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1926
01:38:46.190 --> 01:38:47.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could go in there,</v>

1927
01:38:47.491 --> 01:38:50.010
<v Speaker 3>you better have a strong stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

1928
01:38:50.011 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my kids are in there and so we go in</v>

1929
01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:55.260
<v Speaker 3>there and Matt and Dan here to stand at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the edge of the hole there.</v>

1930
01:38:55.710 --> 01:39:00.710
<v Speaker 3>And they're trying to sort out the trend</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort out who was who inside this</v>

1931
01:39:01.921 --> 01:39:05.250
<v Speaker 3>plane into bags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not shitting you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I have some visual details I remember</v>

1934

<v Speaker 3>I remember we were at her birthday</v>
<v Speaker 3>party.</v>

1942
01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:30.450
<v Speaker 3>The cater just fell over dead in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>of everybody.</v>

1943
01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:36.680
<v Speaker 3>So like very non war related things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1944
01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:39.160
<v Speaker 3>That's what's interesting is saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1945
01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:41.650
<v Speaker 3>but you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see that these are just happen</v>

1946
01:39:41.730 --> 01:39:42.990
<v Speaker 3>chance things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1947
01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:47.280
<v Speaker 3>you can go through life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just have sort of set up now or you</v>

1948
01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:50.040
<v Speaker 3>can be hidden from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you talked to previous</v>

1949
01:39:50.041 --> 01:39:50.970
<v Speaker 3>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the,</v>

1950
01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:51.661
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1951
01:39:51.661 --> 01:39:53.320
<v Speaker 3>it was just a part of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1952
01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:56.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my old man talked about walking and he</v>

1953
01:39:56.461 --> 01:39:58.740
<v Speaker 3>grew up in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talked about walking out of a party</v>

1954
01:39:58.741 --> 01:40:00.180
<v Speaker 3>one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a dead guy at the bottom of the</v>

1955
01:40:00.181 --> 01:40:03.390
<v Speaker 3>stairs</v>
<v Speaker 3>that had been beaten to death,</v>

1956
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.340
<v Speaker 3>just like Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

1957
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.270
<v Speaker 3>then went off to world war two and saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what.</v>

1958
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:13.500
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people talk about how now were so</v>

1959
01:40:13.501 --> 01:40:15.690
<v Speaker 3>violent shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing to support that.</v>

1960
01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:16.531
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1961
01:40:16.531 --> 01:40:19.290
<v Speaker 3>It's this safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The safest time to live ever used to be</v>

1962
01:40:19.291 --> 01:40:21.510
<v Speaker 3>able to hang people from trees and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in trouble for it.</v>

1963
01:40:22.650 --> 01:40:24.970
<v Speaker 3>If they're the right color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1965
01:40:28.050 --> 01:40:30.450
<v Speaker 3>that's what's crazy about this wild bill</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hickok Shit.</v>

1966
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:32.360
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

1967
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:34.590
<v Speaker 3>70 1880.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When was it?</v>

1968
01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.050
<v Speaker 3>And what's funny is he was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>combatants.</v>

1969
01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:39.750
<v Speaker 3>So some of those guys like wild bill</v>
<v Speaker 3>coding,</v>

1970
01:40:39.751 --> 01:40:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Wild Bill Hickok Hickock actually had</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dispute over who got to have the</v>

1971
01:40:43.621 --> 01:40:44.400
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1972
01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Bill Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill cody,</v>

1973
01:40:45.601 --> 01:40:48.060
<v Speaker 3>wild bill Hickok.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some other wild bill's I</v>

1974
01:40:48.061 --> 01:40:48.740
<v Speaker 3>guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was like,</v>

1975
01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:50.190
<v Speaker 3>it was a popular name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1976
01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.030
<v Speaker 3>But they were combatants tube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they engaged in these wars and the</v>

1977
01:40:55.031 --> 01:40:57.820
<v Speaker 3>fact that you would later get both sides</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the war.</v>

1978
01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:03.480
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like if you went and got a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Germans who were defending the</v>

1979
01:41:04.931 --> 01:41:07.810
<v Speaker 3>Normandy beach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Omaha Beach,</v>

1980
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:10.030
<v Speaker 3>and you've got a bunch of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1981
01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Americans who are starving Omaha beach</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you had a traveling road show in</v>

1982
01:41:16.511 --> 01:41:21.511
<v Speaker 3>which they would pretend to inflict mass</v>
<v Speaker 3>casualties on one another for paying</v>

1983
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.720
<v Speaker 3>adoring crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How bizarre.</v>

1984
01:41:28.721 --> 01:41:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Who came up with the idea for that had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been done ever in history before?</v>

1985
01:41:33.250 --> 01:41:35.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My guess would be,</v>

1986
01:41:35.170 --> 01:41:36.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy that was the thing that</v>

1987
01:41:36.641 --> 01:41:38.760
<v Speaker 3>I've told people bunch of times no one</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever believes me to distribute.</v>

1988
01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:40.090
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1989
01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:43.210
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Niagara Falls,</v>

1990
01:41:43.211 --> 01:41:44.290

1993
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:52.690

<v Speaker 3>on its way out to the Atlanta,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Bought the zoo and bought a barge and</v>

1997
01:42:09.041 --> 01:42:14.041
<v Speaker 3>put all of the zoo animals on the barge</v>
<v Speaker 3>and charged a dollar to watch him send</v>

1998
01:42:16.241 --> 01:42:18.700
<v Speaker 3>his barge full of animals over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>falls.</v>

2019
01:43:13.911 --> 01:43:17.720
<v Speaker 3>but there were less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well under probably way less than $75.</v>

2020
01:43:17.730 --> 01:43:19.280
<v Speaker 3>Million people in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

01:43:21.951 --> 01:43:24.650

<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>

2023
01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:28.970
<v Speaker 3>18,000 spectators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventy four Indians from the Pine Ridge</v>

2024
01:43:28.971 --> 01:43:31.700
<v Speaker 3>reservation in South Dakota.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2025
01:43:31.730 --> 01:43:34.760
<v Speaker 3>18,000 spectators must have been amazing</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then.</v>

2026
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2027
01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:37.670
<v Speaker 3>But here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But think about the numbers at that</v>

2028
01:43:37.671 --> 01:43:41.780
<v Speaker 3>battle that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Historians feel that at that battle,</v>

2029
01:43:41.781 --> 01:43:46.781
<v Speaker 3>that was the largest gathering of plains</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indians to have ever occurred.</v>

2030
01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 3>An encampment of maybe 10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2031
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:56.270
<v Speaker 1>how many people were there from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's his face?</v>

2032
01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Costa Costa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote in to one end of the camp.</v>

2033
01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:03.710
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's not well understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there were other engagements going</v>

2034
01:44:03.711 --> 01:44:07.460
<v Speaker 1>on at the same time once when you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>like coster his command was annihilated.</v>

2035
01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:12.530
<v Speaker 1>There were other prongs to the attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were repelled and beaten,</v>

2036
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:16.790
<v Speaker 1>but it was only like one prong of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack that had cost her and that was an</v>

2037
01:44:16.791 --> 01:44:21.791
<v Speaker 1>isolated and how many people do you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you rode in with about 200 people</v>

2038
01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.360
<v Speaker 1>and ran into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an encampment of 10,000 individuals and</v>

2039
01:44:26.361 --> 01:44:30.260
<v Speaker 1>later some of these individuals like</v>
<v Speaker 1>gall and others in interviews said that</v>

2040
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:33.890
<v Speaker 1>even at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our understanding is that these people</v>

2041
01:44:33.891 --> 01:44:36.830
<v Speaker 1>were all hopelessly drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2042
01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Because it did not make sense what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing.</v>

2043
01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't know.</v>

2044
01:44:41.690 --> 01:44:43.820
<v Speaker 1>It's no one understood that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why custard,</v>

2045
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:47.480
<v Speaker 1>that's why there's still all these costs</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people who just debate and argue and</v>

2046
01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.850
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2047
01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:52.260
<v Speaker 1>some of his crow scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2048
01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:57.340
<v Speaker 1>He had some cree or re scouts and cro</v>
<v Speaker 1>scouts who came and told him do not.</v>

2049
01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:01.770
<v Speaker 1>You cannot go down there in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2050
01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.700
<v Speaker 1>we were playing was attack at daybreak</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they said,</v>

2051
01:45:04.701 --> 01:45:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you cannot do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes no sense.</v>

2052
01:45:07.610 --> 01:45:11.390
<v Speaker 1>He said we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did their death songs,</v>

2053
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:14.000
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of his scout sang their death songs</v>

2054
01:45:14.001 --> 01:45:16.310
<v Speaker 1>because they knew what they would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dying in the morning.</v>

2055
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:18.680
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's debated.</v>

2056
01:45:18.681 --> 01:45:21.230
<v Speaker 1>So today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what extent did he,</v>

2057
01:45:21.231 --> 01:45:22.064
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2058
01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:25.500
<v Speaker 1>did he believe what his scouts are</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling them?</v>

2059
01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was it suicide or was it huge?</v>

2060
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:32.160
<v Speaker 1>No one thinks that was suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was either that he just didn't really</v>

2061
01:45:32.161 --> 01:45:36.300
<v Speaker 1>comprehend what they were telling him or</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so,</v>

2062
01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:40.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a decorated civil war figure and</v>

2063
01:45:40.681 --> 01:45:45.681
<v Speaker 1>probably was a very ardent believer in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the superiority like of his army.</v>

2064
01:45:46.231 --> 01:45:50.670
<v Speaker 1>And they were trained soldiers with</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline that there was just one prong</v>

2065
01:45:50.671 --> 01:45:51.920
<v Speaker 1>of a three year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2066
01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:54.150
<v Speaker 1>a three prong attack or two pronged</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

2067
01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:56.040
<v Speaker 1>He was riding in the one end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>village,</v>

2068
01:45:56.310 --> 01:46:00.570
<v Speaker 1>but he does a road into the village and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just killed.</v>

2069
01:46:01.110 --> 01:46:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in independent,</v>

2070
01:46:02.410 --> 01:46:04.410
<v Speaker 1>in popular depictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always show cost her,</v>

2071
01:46:04.411 --> 01:46:06.330
<v Speaker 1>like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last guy standing like there's a</v>

2072
01:46:06.331 --> 01:46:09.080
<v Speaker 1>mountain of his dead guys around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2073
01:46:09.090 --> 01:46:13.350
<v Speaker 1>and he's still firing his revolver a</v>
<v Speaker 1>with long hair and when in fact he had</v>

2074
01:46:13.351 --> 01:46:14.250
<v Speaker 1>short hair at the time.</v>

2075
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:18.360
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people think that in looking at it,</v>

2076
01:46:18.361 --> 01:46:20.190
<v Speaker 1>he probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2077
01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:22.860
<v Speaker 1>The great one is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fell coster.</v>

2078
01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great image.</v>

2079
01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie just pulled up a crazy picture.</v>

2080
01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:31.590
<v Speaker 1>So here fell costs and contemporary</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture did say what?</v>

2081
01:46:31.710 --> 01:46:32.001
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2082
01:46:32.001 --> 01:46:34.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the old classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one that was on the anheuser</v>

2083
01:46:34.851 --> 01:46:37.460
<v Speaker 1>busch to the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2084
01:46:37.461 --> 01:46:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Here fell was a little bit later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I'm the one that was the.</v>

2085
01:46:40.581 --> 01:46:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Anheuser Busch won was by a German guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the one you had pulled</v>

2086
01:46:43.341 --> 01:46:46.280
<v Speaker 1>up that was like desert Bush had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like their poster.</v>

2087
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your fail coster wow.</v>

2088
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Which is</v>

2089
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:54.120
<v Speaker 3>considered to be a very accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was considered to be a pretty accurate</v>

2090
01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:57.300
<v Speaker 3>depiction of what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the</v>

2091
01:46:59.310 --> 01:47:01.980
<v Speaker 3>custer died early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he died earlier in the skirt,</v>

2092
01:47:01.981 --> 01:47:05.700
<v Speaker 3>but she wasn't like the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got the flowing blonde hair.</v>

2093
01:47:05.730 --> 01:47:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's dead and he's still firing</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

2094
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:11.310
<v Speaker 3>Of course he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was probably killed earlier rather</v>

2095
01:47:11.311 --> 01:47:14.790
<v Speaker 3>than later in the skirmish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny because you're right there</v>

2096
01:47:14.791 --> 01:47:15.920
<v Speaker 3>like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2097
01:47:16.890 --> 01:47:21.110
<v Speaker 6>in a different position.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so funny that,</v>

2098
01:47:21.111 --> 01:47:22.940
<v Speaker 6>that we've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2099
01:47:22.941 --> 01:47:26.950
<v Speaker 6>that people have taken what they know</v>
<v Speaker 6>most likely we're a storage really</v>

2100
01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:30.410
<v Speaker 6>inaccurate accounts and they pass them</v>
<v Speaker 6>down generation to generation.</v>

2101
01:47:30.411 --> 01:47:33.560
<v Speaker 6>And it makes you wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is what we know now because this is</v>

2102
01:47:33.561 --> 01:47:36.320
<v Speaker 6>only a hundred or so years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what,</v>

2103
01:47:36.710 --> 01:47:39.920
<v Speaker 6>what are we getting when we're getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>some version of something that happened</v>

2104
01:47:39.921 --> 01:47:41.870
<v Speaker 6>a thousand years ago or thousand years</v>
<v Speaker 6>ago?</v>

2105
01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:43.490
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how distorted</v>

2106
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:45.620
<v Speaker 3>insanely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2107
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:50.150
<v Speaker 3>But the problem we have as a culture I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think is when someone goes to fix,</v>

2108
01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:56.380
<v Speaker 3>when someone goes to challenge our</v>
<v Speaker 3>popular perceptions,</v>

2109
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:59.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2110
01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:02.980
<v Speaker 3>it's branded as revisionist and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>like loses,</v>

2111
01:48:04.210 --> 01:48:06.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes almost like a,</v>

2112
01:48:06.461 --> 01:48:09.170
<v Speaker 3>it's credentials or tarnished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do.</v>

2113
01:48:09.190 --> 01:48:11.020
<v Speaker 3>Remember the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember what politician,</v>

2114
01:48:11.021 --> 01:48:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll pull it up.</v>

2115
01:48:11.861 --> 01:48:13.370
<v Speaker 3>There was a politician who said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2116
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:15.930
<v Speaker 3>he famously said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2117
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:19.100
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we realized that Paul revere the,</v>

2118
01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:20.940
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ride of Paul revere was,</v>

2119
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:23.290
<v Speaker 3>didn't really happen like fabricated</v>
<v Speaker 3>from whole cloth.</v>

2120
01:48:23.291 --> 01:48:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2121
01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:25.900
<v Speaker 3>There was a politician said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Paul Revere.</v>

2122
01:48:25.901 --> 01:48:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Whether he wrote or not.</v>

2123
01:48:30.090 --> 01:48:30.631
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2124
01:48:30.631 --> 01:48:32.490
<v Speaker 6>when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were taught Columbus,</v>

2125
01:48:32.491 --> 01:48:33.700
<v Speaker 6>discovered the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2126
01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:35.700
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we didn't figure that out until.</v>

2127
01:48:35.710 --> 01:48:38.790
<v Speaker 6>It's still amazing that it wasn't like</v>
<v Speaker 6>the West indies.</v>

2128
01:48:39.230 --> 01:48:42.270
<v Speaker 6>And to this day it's still amazing that</v>
<v Speaker 6>they celebrate that guy when you find</v>

2129
01:48:42.271 --> 01:48:44.180
<v Speaker 6>out that he was a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2130
01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:45.390
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was it?</v>

2131
01:48:45.391 --> 01:48:47.280
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe it was a,</v>

2132
01:48:47.281 --> 01:48:52.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm a minister or someone who has some</v>
<v Speaker 6>religious person who came with them at</v>

2133
01:48:52.111 --> 01:48:53.130
<v Speaker 6>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2134
01:48:53.150 --> 01:48:57.660
<v Speaker 6>left a journal about the atrocities</v>
<v Speaker 6>committed directly by Columbus and his</v>

2135
01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:01.410
<v Speaker 6>men when they hacked off arms for</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

2136
01:49:01.411 --> 01:49:02.700
<v Speaker 6>couldn't bring them back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gold.</v>

2137
01:49:02.701 --> 01:49:04.320
<v Speaker 6>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just horrific shit.</v>

2138
01:49:04.321 --> 01:49:06.600
<v Speaker 6>Smash babies on rocks did it right in</v>
<v Speaker 6>front of them.</v>

2139
01:49:06.810 --> 01:49:10.230
<v Speaker 6>And this guy was a firsthand account of</v>
<v Speaker 6>what we're supposed to believe.</v>

2140
01:49:10.770 --> 01:49:13.320
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who knows how much of what he's saying</v>

2141
01:49:13.321 --> 01:49:15.510
<v Speaker 6>is accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if any of it is accurate,</v>

2142
01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:17.440
<v Speaker 6>Columbus was a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2143
01:49:17.590 --> 01:49:20.800
<v Speaker 3>I think there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it stems from is that from the</v>

2144
01:49:20.801 --> 01:49:25.630
<v Speaker 3>perspective in Europe at the time he</v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

2145
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:31.190
<v Speaker 3>he had solidified and put some shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>together that people had been kind of</v>

2146
01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:32.890
<v Speaker 3>pecking around the edges of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2147
01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's continental existed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2148
01:49:35.691 --> 01:49:36.041
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2149
01:49:36.041 --> 01:49:37.140
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

2150
01:49:37.190 --> 01:49:40.400
<v Speaker 3>just had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like a leap forward at the time.</v>

2151
01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How crazy is that?</v>

2152
01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:46.390
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that it becomes that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2153
01:49:47.050 --> 01:49:50.140
<v Speaker 3>Did he like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that in some people's minds,</v>

2154
01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:53.290
<v Speaker 3>like somehow established America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2155
01:49:53.770 --> 01:49:55.510
<v Speaker 3>And that we take a day off of school</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of it.</v>

2156
01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.490
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre.</v>

2157
01:49:57.550 --> 01:50:01.240
<v Speaker 3>Columbus Day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we still to this day it's 2017</v>

2158
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:02.860
<v Speaker 3>kids get Columbus Day off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't they?</v>

2159
01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:05.050
<v Speaker 3>But now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>

2160
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:10.440
<v Speaker 3>now that no one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that now that sort of the consensus,</v>

2161
01:50:11.141 --> 01:50:13.660
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the popular consensus is that,</v>

2162
01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a one of many players involved in</v>

2163
01:50:20.591 --> 01:50:25.591
<v Speaker 3>sort of putting together what was here</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sort of outlining where it was and</v>

2164
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.260
<v Speaker 3>how to get here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2165
01:50:28.710 --> 01:50:31.860
<v Speaker 3>he was one of a bunch of players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2166
01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.510
<v Speaker 3>almost certainly not the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2167
01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.940
<v Speaker 3>no one cares about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meaning what they mean is you're like</v>

2168
01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:43.020
<v Speaker 3>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I uphold the idea of western</v>

2169
01:50:44.621 --> 01:50:48.820
<v Speaker 3>civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>annexation of the new world as being a</v>

2170
01:50:48.821 --> 01:50:49.654
<v Speaker 3>good thing.</v>

2171
01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:54.940
<v Speaker 3>So when someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone gets pissed at the</v>

2172
01:50:54.941 --> 01:50:58.480
<v Speaker 3>revisionists for questioning the</v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimacy of Columbus,</v>

2173
01:50:58.630 --> 01:51:02.140
<v Speaker 3>they're not actually talking about what</v>
<v Speaker 3>he specifically did.</v>

2174
01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:07.200
<v Speaker 3>It's become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's become a proxy for the cultural</v>

2175
01:51:07.571 --> 01:51:10.120
<v Speaker 3>annexation of the new world and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2176
01:51:10.121 --> 01:51:11.740
<v Speaker 3>I hate Columbus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an asshole.</v>

2177
01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:14.350
<v Speaker 3>They take it to me and you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2178
01:51:14.351 --> 01:51:15.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2179
01:51:15.971 --> 01:51:19.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're questioning our claim on the</v>

2180
01:51:19.121 --> 01:51:20.860
<v Speaker 3>western hemisphere and that it was a bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2181
01:51:21.130 --> 01:51:23.110
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why people are annoyed by</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2182
01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:26.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people were too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>annoyed by it anymore because the thing</v>

2183
01:51:26.951 --> 01:51:28.210
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty much been established</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2184
01:51:28.211 --> 01:51:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Columbus is a really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one's gone in and undid the day</v>

2185
01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:32.323
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have they.</v>

2186
01:51:32.380 --> 01:51:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Is there any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any kind of change them around,</v>

2187
01:51:35.021 --> 01:51:35.711
<v Speaker 3>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2188
01:51:35.711 --> 01:51:37.510
<v Speaker 3>they should probably come up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>another name for it.</v>

2189
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:40.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Api a.</v>

2190
01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:43.450
<v Speaker 3>it's still a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2191
01:51:43.451 --> 01:51:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure.</v>

2192
01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:47.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is kinda crazy though.</v>

2193
01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:49.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not here to defend the day,</v>

2194
01:51:49.931 --> 01:51:52.740
<v Speaker 3>but I do understand that kind of how</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit came to beat.</v>

2195
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:53.583
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand it.</v>

2196
01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:57.580
<v Speaker 3>It just seems pretty incredible that</v>
<v Speaker 3>just 500 years ago here it goes to war</v>

2197
01:51:57.581 --> 01:51:59.200
<v Speaker 3>against Columbus Day and the Washington</v>
<v Speaker 3>Post.</v>

2198
01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's waged by the same people who were</v>

2199
01:52:00.971 --> 01:52:04.080
<v Speaker 3>waging a war against Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His is really.</v>

2200
01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:10.540
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indigenous People's Day in favor of</v>

2201
01:52:10.541 --> 01:52:11.730
<v Speaker 3>indigenous peoples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2202
01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:13.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense.</v>

2203
01:52:14.650 --> 01:52:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Give us a day off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll take it.</v>

2204
01:52:16.210 --> 01:52:20.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm generally like little movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like little cultural movements like</v>

2205
01:52:20.291 --> 01:52:23.080
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm generally not a receptive.</v>

2206
01:52:23.081 --> 01:52:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't try to read too much into them.</v>

2207
01:52:25.450 --> 01:52:27.840
<v Speaker 3>If I woke up tomorrow and telling me</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we had decided,</v>

2208
01:52:27.850 --> 01:52:31.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people got together and decided</v>

2209
01:52:31.271 --> 01:52:33.460
<v Speaker 3>against Columbus Day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't like do a lot of soul</v>

2210
01:52:33.461 --> 01:52:36.670
<v Speaker 3>searching on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2211
01:52:36.671 --> 01:52:38.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't work a traditional job</v>

2212
01:52:38.261 --> 01:52:40.180
<v Speaker 3>anywhere or go to school where you take</v>
<v Speaker 3>that day.</v>

2213
01:52:40.181 --> 01:52:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people that lost the day,</v>

2214
01:52:42.071 --> 01:52:43.150
<v Speaker 3>they're like too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my day,</v>

2215
01:52:43.151 --> 01:52:43.871
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2216
01:52:43.871 --> 01:52:47.330
<v Speaker 3>It's just hard to imagine as I hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>walleyes my buddy doug every year.</v>

2217
01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:48.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be bumped.</v>

2218
01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:50.990
<v Speaker 6>It's just hard to imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2219
01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:56.020
<v Speaker 6>500 plus years ago they really didn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>know in Europe about the continental</v>

2220
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:57.460
<v Speaker 6>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2221
01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.910
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's amazing.</v>

2222
01:53:00.230 --> 01:53:02.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about earlier talking</v>

2223
01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:07.010
<v Speaker 3>about violence or violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more violent than I think that we're so</v>

2224
01:53:07.011 --> 01:53:12.011
<v Speaker 3>tripped up by the upheaval caused by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>digital age.</v>

2225
01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everything.</v>

2226
01:53:14.931 --> 01:53:15.471
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2227
01:53:15.471 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 3>I just changed our sleep practices and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just everything.</v>

2228
01:53:19.090 --> 01:53:20.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a major upheaval.</v>

2229
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But picture that picture that in your</v>

2230
01:53:25.671 --> 01:53:28.100
<v Speaker 3>lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all like,</v>

2231
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:30.050
<v Speaker 3>you become aware</v>

2232
01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:32.443
<v Speaker 10>that</v>

2233
01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:33.760
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2234
01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:37.100
<v Speaker 6>the earth did see that there are,</v>

2235
01:53:37.690 --> 01:53:40.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three times as many or whatever as many</v>

2236
01:53:40.571 --> 01:53:43.000
<v Speaker 3>civilizations on earth is that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought there were.</v>

2237
01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:48.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a huge thing to grapple</v>

2238
01:53:48.701 --> 01:53:49.320
<v Speaker 3>with</v>

2239
01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.900
<v Speaker 6>a huge thing to grapple with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People that had history,</v>

2240
01:53:52.170 --> 01:53:55.230
<v Speaker 6>people that had boats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were seafaring had more history</v>

2241
01:53:55.231 --> 01:53:56.070
<v Speaker 6>than you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2242
01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.420
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

2243
01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:00.810
<v Speaker 3>Or to think that one day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not too long ago,</v>

2244
01:54:01.290 --> 01:54:03.540
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of our grandparents remember this,</v>

2245
01:54:03.630 --> 01:54:08.630
<v Speaker 3>to think that one day we had devised the</v>
<v Speaker 3>contraption that was capable of ending</v>

2246
01:54:11.181 --> 01:54:16.010
<v Speaker 3>life on earth and that these</v>
<v Speaker 3>contraptions could be initiated by the</v>

2247
01:54:16.011 --> 01:54:17.870
<v Speaker 3>distant actions of a handful of people</v>

2248
01:54:19.890 --> 01:54:20.520
<v Speaker 10>that</v>

2249
01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:23.340
<v Speaker 6>that's a change,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2250
01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:25.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The nuclear era.</v>

2251
01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:27.840
<v Speaker 6>Here's the craziest change in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>nuclear era,</v>

2252
01:54:27.930 --> 01:54:31.830
<v Speaker 6>from the invention of an airplane to</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone dropping a nuclear bomb from an</v>

2253
01:54:31.831 --> 01:54:35.910
<v Speaker 6>airplane is less than 50 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think Wright brothers 19.</v>

2254
01:54:35.911 --> 01:54:36.181
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three,</v>

2255
01:54:36.181 --> 01:54:36.800
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nineteen,</v>

2256
01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:37.760
<v Speaker 6>six,</v>
<v Speaker 6>93,</v>

2257
01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:40.560
<v Speaker 6>early 1900.</v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] sustained a flight with a</v>

2258
01:54:40.561 --> 01:54:45.450
<v Speaker 6>heavier than air vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then in 1945 they dropped an atomic</v>

2259
01:54:45.451 --> 01:54:46.710
<v Speaker 6>bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

2260
01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:48.900
<v Speaker 6>That's inside my life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone was like,</v>

2261
01:54:48.901 --> 01:54:50.760
<v Speaker 6>I knew this airplane shit was going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>take off,</v>

2262
01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:57.680
<v Speaker 6>but that is probably one of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 6>changes ever in terms of like the amount</v>

2263
01:54:57.721 --> 01:55:02.721
<v Speaker 6>of in 50 years in the world to go from</v>
<v Speaker 6>no air travel at all to dropping a</v>

2264
01:55:03.481 --> 01:55:07.530
<v Speaker 6>nuclear bomb out of an airplane in less</v>
<v Speaker 6>than 50 years.</v>

2265
01:55:07.531 --> 01:55:07.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2266
01:55:07.810 --> 01:55:10.030
<v Speaker 3>And to then have it be that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>staple of,</v>

2267
01:55:10.031 --> 01:55:10.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2268
01:55:10.810 --> 01:55:12.520
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of American life,</v>

2269
01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:15.340
<v Speaker 3>they did not just with other people like</v>
<v Speaker 3>space travel.</v>

2270
01:55:15.730 --> 01:55:16.541
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2271
01:55:16.541 --> 01:55:20.470
<v Speaker 3>it's this flood of information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not affect me.</v>

2272
01:55:20.471 --> 01:55:23.320
<v Speaker 3>But with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like that's now how you get around.</v>

2273
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2274
01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:29.020
<v Speaker 3>that you like at a time when you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cross the country,</v>

2275
01:55:29.950 --> 01:55:33.310
<v Speaker 3>you would lose a large percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your party to death.</v>

2276
01:55:33.370 --> 01:55:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to plan ahead who would take</v>

2277
01:55:35.321 --> 01:55:37.570
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many months to being just a thing.</v>

2278
01:55:37.571 --> 01:55:42.571
<v Speaker 3>You just do on a whim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I do believe like I accept that we</v>

2279
01:55:42.641 --> 01:55:46.560
<v Speaker 3>are a state of upheaval right now and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think there were probably impacting</v>

2280
01:55:46.561 --> 01:55:50.280
<v Speaker 3>ourselves in ways we don't fully</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand how so digital devices.</v>

2281
01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.413
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2282
01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just how you run your day.</v>

2283
01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt.</v>

2284
01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:56.190
<v Speaker 3>How you spend your time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you run your day will ever go to a</v>

2285
01:55:56.191 --> 01:55:58.890
<v Speaker 3>restaurant and you see a whole group of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just staring at their phone.</v>

2286
01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2287
01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:02.520
<v Speaker 3>We're laughing with their day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're staying at the baggage claim,</v>

2288
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:04.210
<v Speaker 3>not looking at your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will think you're nuts.</v>

2289
01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:08.790
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My friend is looking around trying to</v>

2290
01:56:08.791 --> 01:56:09.930
<v Speaker 6>make conversation with people.</v>

2291
01:56:09.970 --> 01:56:11.400
<v Speaker 3>My friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a conversation.</v>

2292
01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:15.270
<v Speaker 3>His life has happened with some over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was in starbucks drink and a coffee</v>

2293
01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:17.890
<v Speaker 3>just sitting there and staring at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wall like a fucking lunatic.</v>

2294
01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:24.850
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they out to you?</v>

2295
01:56:24.851 --> 01:56:27.040
<v Speaker 3>They're going to start killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing anything with their</v>

2296
01:56:27.041 --> 01:56:28.060
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2297
01:56:28.570 --> 01:56:30.070
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big thing.</v>

2298
01:56:30.071 --> 01:56:33.460
<v Speaker 3>But what are the helpful thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess one of the help it just bring it</v>

2299
01:56:33.461 --> 01:56:35.590
<v Speaker 3>full circle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the helpful things</v>

2300
01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:41.530
<v Speaker 3>you know about traveling or about like</v>
<v Speaker 3>just reading about history is you stop,</v>

2301
01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:46.560
<v Speaker 3>you lose some of that sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>specialness about thinking that the life</v>

2302
01:56:47.231 --> 01:56:49.210
<v Speaker 3>you're living in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the moment you're living it as this</v>

2303
01:56:49.211 --> 01:56:52.920
<v Speaker 3>great test of humanity or some like</v>
<v Speaker 3>super peculiar thing going out when you</v>

2304
01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:56.170
<v Speaker 3>realize that people have always been</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved with and struggle with</v>

2305
01:56:56.171 --> 01:56:59.660
<v Speaker 3>cataclysmic upheaval,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2306
01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:04.770
<v Speaker 3>and then to go in to indigo witness some</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people in some version of that</v>

2307
01:57:05.981 --> 01:57:09.820
<v Speaker 3>transition</v>
<v Speaker 3>is pretty healthy man.</v>

2308
01:57:10.810 --> 01:57:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Maybe in the long term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just traveling,</v>

2309
01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:15.520
<v Speaker 3>going to see how other people do stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unsettling,</v>

2310
01:57:15.521 --> 01:57:16.690
<v Speaker 3>but probably ultimately pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:17.950
<v Speaker 6>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2312
01:57:17.951 --> 01:57:20.890
<v Speaker 6>I think it's very good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just anything that enhances perspective,</v>

2313
01:57:20.891 --> 01:57:24.820
<v Speaker 6>it gives you like another layer that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>could consider when you think about life</v>

2314
01:57:24.821 --> 01:57:27.610
<v Speaker 6>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're so used to our own environment,</v>

2315
01:57:27.850 --> 01:57:30.910
<v Speaker 6>our own ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you were talking about talking</v>

2316
01:57:30.911 --> 01:57:35.740
<v Speaker 6>to these people and asking them like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why don't you eat monkeys and now we're</v>

2317
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:38.470
<v Speaker 6>stony monkeys have.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Has He ever been to a supermarket?</v>

2318
01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:43.330
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple of years ago when I was</v>

2319
01:57:43.331 --> 01:57:45.670
<v Speaker 3>mentioning that I had mentioned to you</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2320
01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:47.380
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2321
01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:50.110

<v Speaker 3>that a couple of American companies who</v>

<v Speaker 3>have a to have like some conservation</v>
<v Speaker 3>spending,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they were training some guys from real</v>

2324
01:57:56.900 --> 01:58:00.010
<v Speaker 3>village.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were training some of them to,</v>

2325
01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:04.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just how to interface with Westerners.</v>

2326
01:58:04.630 --> 01:58:07.600
<v Speaker 3>And as part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went up to,</v>

2327
01:58:07.601 --> 01:58:12.601
<v Speaker 3>he might have even gone up to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bahamas to go for a couple days to a fly</v>

2328
01:58:12.670 --> 01:58:14.740
<v Speaker 3>fishing lodge.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2331
01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:22.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm just so pleased to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's peculiar in that way now I've</v>

2332
01:58:22.181 --> 01:58:24.310
<v Speaker 3>brought up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to talk him into coming up</v>

<v Speaker 3>and going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to take them on ice fishing trip</v>

01:58:26.770 --> 01:58:31.770
<v Speaker 3>so I'll take loads your Alaska fish to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice because what I want him to</v>

2335
01:58:32.591 --> 01:58:33.990
<v Speaker 3>understand is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2336
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm so uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 3>with him physically uncomfortable with</v>

2337
01:58:40.610 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with</v>

2338
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:45.280
<v Speaker 1>everything biting me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just everything.</v>

2339
01:58:45.281 --> 01:58:48.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just extremely uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to him at standard,</v>

2340
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:49.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's comfortable,</v>

2341
01:58:49.151 --> 01:58:52.930
<v Speaker 1>but he's never like if he hadn't done</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trip or you know,</v>

2342
01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:55.590
<v Speaker 1>or just all of his siblings and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's village,</v>

2343
01:58:55.591 --> 01:58:56.620
<v Speaker 1>they never experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2344
01:58:56.621 --> 01:58:58.600
<v Speaker 1>they never experienced 50 degrees</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fahrenheit.</v>

2345
01:58:58.810 --> 01:59:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Now what is it like to them when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to bugs so they have any sort of</v>

2346
01:59:01.751 --> 01:59:04.300
<v Speaker 1>resistance to mosquitoes or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>

2347
01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:07.420
<v Speaker 1>They don't care about it nearly as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we care about it.</v>

2348
01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Do they get the same amount of bytes</v>
<v Speaker 1>though too?</v>

2349
01:59:09.081 --> 01:59:12.040
<v Speaker 1>They get chewed up like we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They complain about tick bites and</v>

2350
01:59:12.041 --> 01:59:14.260
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally it doesn't seem to bother</v>

2351
01:59:14.261 --> 01:59:15.880
<v Speaker 1>me like we do because it's just a part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everyday life.</v>

2352
01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:18.060
<v Speaker 1>But you got to get used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2353
01:59:18.061 --> 01:59:20.140
<v Speaker 1>and like and like hanging out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia.</v>

2354
01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:25.320
<v Speaker 1>You get bit by bees and wasps at about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same rate that you'd get bit by</v>

2355
01:59:28.991 --> 01:59:32.980
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes if you rat like some fourth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of July thing out at your uncle's pond,</v>

2356
01:59:32.981 --> 01:59:35.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting fireworks off at night on the</v>

2357
01:59:35.171 --> 01:59:38.170
<v Speaker 1>edge of a cat tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marsh was like your skin a bit just like</v>

2358
01:59:38.171 --> 01:59:41.290
<v Speaker 1>wake up and you start getting bit by</v>
<v Speaker 1>bees and wasps so they just get,</v>

2359
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:44.110
<v Speaker 1>just kind of used to it and then you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>say like,</v>

2360
01:59:44.111 --> 01:59:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I got stung by a bullet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and asking like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even begin to guess how many</v>

2363
01:59:51.131 --> 01:59:53.680
<v Speaker 1>times I've been stung by a bullet dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

2364
01:59:53.681 --> 01:59:56.140
<v Speaker 1>but they just suffer different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I want to do is I want him to</v>

2365
01:59:56.141 --> 02:00:01.120
<v Speaker 1>experience suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>while watching me not suffer.</v>

2366

<v Speaker 1>So like I want him to look at me with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2367
02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to do this I want them to come up</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's bourbon everywhere.</v>

2400
02:01:27.791 --> 02:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>So does it tastes like lobster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that why they call it a poor milk?</v>

2401
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>The reason they call it poor man's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lobster,</v>

2402
02:01:32.591 --> 02:01:36.940
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't really tastes like lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's suitable for boiling it and</v>

2403
02:01:36.941 --> 02:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>dipping it in butter and cocktail sauce</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eating.</v>

2404
02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:40.011
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2405
02:01:40.011 --> 02:01:41.780
<v Speaker 1>But y'all should make fish sandwiches</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

2406
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even sell that shit commercially.</v>

2407
02:01:44.690 --> 02:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Bourbon guys that have like guys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a native American.</v>

2408
02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:53.150
<v Speaker 1>So in the northern Great Lakes you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Jibo to Jibo.</v>

2409
02:01:53.151 --> 02:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I Indians still carry on White Lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fish for great lakes,</v>

2410
02:01:57.891 --> 02:01:59.750
<v Speaker 1>white fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They trap net,</v>

2411
02:01:59.751 --> 02:02:00.710
<v Speaker 1>great legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>White Fish.</v>

2412
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>They're able to sell a bycatch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bourbon and they have restaurants and</v>

2413
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>like in the cup I got some friends that</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it and they got restaurants in the</v>

2414
02:02:09.801 --> 02:02:12.300
<v Speaker 1>ups that they sell their bourbon into</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they make burgers.</v>

2415
02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Sandwiches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2416
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Freshwater link to take them on ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing trip.</v>

2417
02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:19.700
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for him to leave,</v>

2418
02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>like he doesn't go into Georgetown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the capital of this country.</v>

2419
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:27.530
<v Speaker 1>He'd have to go into Georgetown and</v>
<v Speaker 1>start like trying to figure out some</v>

2420
02:02:27.531 --> 02:02:32.531
<v Speaker 1>kind of a visa situation and a passport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he have a birth certificate?</v>

2421
02:02:34.190 --> 02:02:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he has.</v>

2422
02:02:35.650 --> 02:02:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I told him that I would try to help him</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all that,</v>

2423
02:02:37.911 --> 02:02:41.120
<v Speaker 1>but he said it's like a very daunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that you would like go and leave</v>

2424
02:02:41.121 --> 02:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>the country for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd go in and stay in Georgetown,</v>

2425
02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:47.330
<v Speaker 1>but he has been on a commercial flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did that trip.</v>

2426
02:02:47.590 --> 02:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has done it yet.</v>

2427
02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:53.030
<v Speaker 1>He has done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had to get a passport in order to</v>

2428
02:02:53.031 --> 02:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His passport didn't last long and now he</v>

2429
02:02:55.971 --> 02:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>has no passport anymore is what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me when I was asking him about</v>

2430
02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:03.170
<v Speaker 1>the feasibility of this and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need a visa for there,</v>

2431
02:03:03.171 --> 02:03:06.170
<v Speaker 1>but he needed a visa to come here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to figure it out.</v>

2432
02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I want to have them up so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2433
02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Him and his brother Dennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that surprised,</v>

2434
02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:14.870
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things you get is um,</v>

2435
02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're from what state were you born in?</v>

2436
02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2437
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:20.160
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you've been all over the</v>

2438
02:03:20.370 --> 02:03:21.203
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2439
02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you hunted and fished and</v>

2440
02:03:24.751 --> 02:03:27.390
<v Speaker 1>farm and that's all you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're always on the land.</v>

2441
02:03:27.410 --> 02:03:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've done it all within a 25 mile,</v>

2442
02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:37.680
<v Speaker 1>a 20 mile radius of your home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're outside hunting and fishing or</v>

2443
02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:43.400
<v Speaker 1>farming or gathering in the jungle every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and you're in your thirties or</v>

2444
02:03:43.651 --> 02:03:48.651
<v Speaker 1>forties and you've done it in a radius</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 20 miles to what level you understand</v>

2445
02:03:50.551 --> 02:03:55.551
<v Speaker 1>your spot and without the distractions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the digital shit and without the</v>

2446
02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>distractions of an occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2447
02:03:59.681 --> 02:04:01.440
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't work at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

2448
02:04:01.610 --> 02:04:02.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he did.</v>

2449
02:04:02.411 --> 02:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>He guides a little bit every year for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fish.</v>

2450
02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>He guides a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but typically not like most days he's</v>

2451
02:04:08.891 --> 02:04:13.891
<v Speaker 1>not engaged in that activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the spatial awareness as the thing</v>

2452
02:04:14.531 --> 02:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>that's most striking to me in spending</v>
<v Speaker 1>time with,</v>

2453
02:04:18.610 --> 02:04:21.000
<v Speaker 1>with these individuals is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2454
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>everything I'm interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they noticed and what they never</v>

2455
02:04:29.421 --> 02:04:30.254
<v Speaker 1>miss</v>

2456
02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:35.230
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you realize that all of the</v>

2457
02:04:35.231 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>bits of information that you're able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>contain your head to allow you to</v>

2458
02:04:38.161 --> 02:04:39.630
<v Speaker 1>function and carry on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2459
02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:45.380
<v Speaker 1>You're like a comedian and you do shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>with mma and you have a very successful</v>

2460
02:04:45.631 --> 02:04:48.450
<v Speaker 1>podcast and you have a family and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>digitally very astute.</v>

2461
02:04:48.451 --> 02:04:50.220
<v Speaker 1>And you have opinions about fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

2462
02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.950
<v Speaker 1>write all this shit you're widely read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2463
02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:58.160
<v Speaker 1>That's like all your sort of fill up</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain with as much as it can hold.</v>

2464
02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>But for them it's like it seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my perspective is like all of that</v>

2465
02:05:02.821 --> 02:05:06.300
<v Speaker 1>breadth of knowledge but crammed into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural world</v>

2466
02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:11.640
<v Speaker 1>to where every plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every tree,</v>

2467
02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:16.700
<v Speaker 1>water its use as what are the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and it's like they know as much</v>

2468
02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:22.940
<v Speaker 1>like they know as much as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just focused in a way that our</v>

2469
02:05:24.031 --> 02:05:25.290
<v Speaker 1>breadth of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

2470
02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:28.740
<v Speaker 1>which would probably be astounding to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them if they realize all the shit we</v>

2471
02:05:28.741 --> 02:05:31.410
<v Speaker 1>knew about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all that,</v>

2472
02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:35.670
<v Speaker 1>all those bits of information or just</v>
<v Speaker 1>applied in a different way down to like</v>

2473
02:05:35.671 --> 02:05:37.860
<v Speaker 1>a granular understanding of the jungle.</v>

2474
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:40.230
<v Speaker 1>It would probably be very bizarre for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to see us.</v>

2475
02:05:40.231 --> 02:05:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Like walk out to this parking lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2476
02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:47.550
<v Speaker 1>a little patches of like plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a fucking clue what they</v>

2477
02:05:47.551 --> 02:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pass through them like they,</v>

2478
02:05:49.290 --> 02:05:50.940
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just peripheral.</v>

2479
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.440
<v Speaker 1>There is no like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>

2480
02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2481
02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:55.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know everything and there's</v>

2482
02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:58.410
<v Speaker 1>toxicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many thousands and thousands of</v>

2483
02:05:58.411 --> 02:06:02.790
<v Speaker 1>different varieties of plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no at various times there's 1500</v>

2484
02:06:02.791 --> 02:06:05.100
<v Speaker 1>species of birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2485
02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was never a moment when I heard a</v>

2486
02:06:08.641 --> 02:06:11.250
<v Speaker 1>bird call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a.</v>

2487
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:12.181
<v Speaker 1>I'd never said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2488
02:06:12.181 --> 02:06:15.360
<v Speaker 1>what's that bird that everyone there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't say what the bird was.</v>

2489
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Bird sounds just from sounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2490
02:06:22.690 --> 02:06:25.350
<v Speaker 1>like in the shit that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it,</v>

2491
02:06:25.550 --> 02:06:27.840
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost something you have to go see</v>

2492
02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:31.620
<v Speaker 1>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to just like move through</v>

2493
02:06:31.621 --> 02:06:34.410
<v Speaker 1>the jungle and notice everything now.</v>

2494
02:06:34.410 --> 02:06:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Are they like the people in Bolivia</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're barefoot most of the time?</v>

2495
02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:38.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2496
02:06:38.371 --> 02:06:40.470
<v Speaker 1>that's another bummer is getting more</v>
<v Speaker 1>into shoes,</v>

2497
02:06:40.471 --> 02:06:43.710
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A row has still likes to take his shoes</v>

2498
02:06:43.711 --> 02:06:46.920
<v Speaker 1>off when he goes into the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went into the jungle after some curse</v>

2499
02:06:46.921 --> 02:06:48.550
<v Speaker 1>out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

2500
02:06:48.551 --> 02:06:50.520
<v Speaker 1>he pulled his shoes off to be extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet.</v>

2501
02:06:51.390 --> 02:06:53.700
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he'll now and then put flip flops on</v>

2502
02:06:53.701 --> 02:06:55.230
<v Speaker 1>now and before it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

2503
02:06:55.630 --> 02:06:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they still have the weird feet that</v>

2504
02:06:57.661 --> 02:07:00.540
<v Speaker 1>are all this catalyst and tozer spread</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out?</v>

2505
02:07:00.710 --> 02:07:03.930
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange the way their feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>look real strange.</v>

2506
02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2507
02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:09.780
<v Speaker 1>and I was in the Philippines one time in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highlands where people are just</v>

2508
02:07:10.050 --> 02:07:12.050
<v Speaker 1>hiking mountain trails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2509
02:07:12.570 --> 02:07:15.810
<v Speaker 1>severe topography on rocky ground and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feet there,</v>

2510
02:07:15.811 --> 02:07:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>barefoot.</v>

2511
02:07:18.590 --> 02:07:22.220
<v Speaker 1>It's almost unrecognizable as a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot really from your perspective of</v>

2512

2519

<v Speaker 3>There's probably some high resolution</v>
<v Speaker 3>national geographic's if this,</v>

2522
02:07:54.131 --> 02:07:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Another thing I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>share as you had mentioned,</v>

2523

<v Speaker 3>a sort of a surreal image is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was just the beginning of the rainy</v>
<v Speaker 3>season,</v>

2529
02:08:15.341 --> 02:08:17.860
<v Speaker 3>sort of some rain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everything is in bloom and he's</v>

<v Speaker 3>variety,</v>

2531
02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:23.730

<v Speaker 3>you'll pass through.</v>

2532
02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:28.760
<v Speaker 3>It just has this like warm floral smell</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just,</v>

2533
02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:32.620
<v Speaker 3>it's astounding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm it remind me of,</v>

2535
02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:39.160
<v Speaker 3>Kurt's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Captain Willard finally catches up</v>

2536
02:08:39.161 --> 02:08:43.780
<v Speaker 3>with Kurtz and Kurtz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask them where he's from and he mentions</v>

2537
02:08:43.781 --> 02:08:48.781
<v Speaker 3>Ohio and Kurt's tells him about a river</v>
<v Speaker 3>trip he took with his father on the Ohio</v>

2538
02:08:49.451 --> 02:08:51.310
<v Speaker 3>river when the guardian he wearing in</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloom,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he talks about the smell in the end of</v>

2540
02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:55.420
<v Speaker 3>apocalypse now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these flowers and smell like that.</v>

2541
02:08:55.690 --> 02:08:57.830
<v Speaker 3>But when the rain would come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to.</v>

2542

<v Speaker 3>Here's a.</v>

2545
02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:10.060
<v Speaker 3>So it would rain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would knock the all the flowers into</v>

2546
02:09:10.061 --> 02:09:14.170
<v Speaker 3>the river</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well from grasping.</v>

2549
02:09:20.650 --> 02:09:23.350
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like almost like a gorilla's</v>

2550
02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:23.861
<v Speaker 3>feed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2551
02:09:23.861 --> 02:09:28.210
<v Speaker 3>from like from wrapping your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like wrapping your feet around thing</v>

2552
02:09:28.211 --> 02:09:32.310
<v Speaker 3>rocks and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one in the middle's I saw,</v>

2553
02:09:32.550 --> 02:09:34.520
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw like a number,</v>

2554
02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:38.770
<v Speaker 3>like not yet quite a few people that had</v>
<v Speaker 3>faith resembled that from,</v>

2555
02:09:39.630 --> 02:09:40.450
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

2556
02:09:40.450 --> 02:09:42.520
<v Speaker 3>from [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

2557
02:09:42.521 --> 02:09:45.850
<v Speaker 3>down in the Amazon and other areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just walking on soft ground,</v>

2558
02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:47.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but imagine if you're just like walking</v>

2559
02:09:47.561 --> 02:09:52.561
<v Speaker 3>on slippery rocks and you're using your</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet in a way that's not even uncommon.</v>

2560
02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:55.160
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at for people that are</v>

2561
02:09:55.161 --> 02:09:59.410
<v Speaker 3>just listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like at the middle of their foot,</v>

2562
02:09:59.411 --> 02:10:01.540
<v Speaker 3>especially that one foot in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the right.</v>

2563
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:04.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's taking a turn,</v>

2564
02:10:04.541 --> 02:10:07.810
<v Speaker 3>like a hard turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a 15 degree plus turn.</v>

2565
02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:12.880
<v Speaker 3>Why do those seem like disembodied feet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's just photograph in the</v>

2566
02:10:12.881 --> 02:10:13.714
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess</v>

2567
02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:18.430
<v Speaker 3>real old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like a big article about people</v>

2568
02:10:18.431 --> 02:10:20.560
<v Speaker 3>from the Philippines at thing from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same area.</v>

2569
02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So wow,</v>

2570
02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:24.460
<v Speaker 3>go back to it for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

2571
02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:29.700
<v Speaker 3>because what we're seeing in this is um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this massive spacing between the big toe</v>

2572
02:10:30.671 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 3>and then the first toe to the point</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's like an opposable.</v>

2573
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:35.690
<v Speaker 6>That's an opposable toe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2574
02:10:35.691 --> 02:10:38.120
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems like almost like an opposable</v>

2575
02:10:38.121 --> 02:10:38.541
<v Speaker 6>toe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2576
02:10:38.541 --> 02:10:40.670
<v Speaker 6>Almost like a thumb now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure.</v>

2577
02:10:40.671 --> 02:10:42.510
<v Speaker 6>What's at play there too?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really fucked.</v>

2578
02:10:42.540 --> 02:10:45.740
<v Speaker 6>I could make you wonder like at one</v>
<v Speaker 6>point in time was it like that,</v>

2579
02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:47.000
<v Speaker 6>that</v>

2580
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.580
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing is you wonder is and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know the answer to this,</v>

2581
02:10:49.581 --> 02:10:54.581
<v Speaker 3>but my guess would be that over time you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know that they're not starting out with</v>

2582
02:10:58.761 --> 02:11:01.280
<v Speaker 3>your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like over time,</v>

2583
02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:04.340
<v Speaker 3>that that's been something that's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>selected for.</v>

2584
02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:06.370
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a population?</v>

2585
02:11:06.371 --> 02:11:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2586
02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:11.220
<v Speaker 6>People like height or like he did just</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this guy's feet.</v>

2587
02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:13.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

2588
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:19.020
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're what we're looking at what looks</v>

2589
02:11:19.021 --> 02:11:19.670
<v Speaker 6>like frog,</v>

2590
02:11:19.670 --> 02:11:22.370
<v Speaker 3>but that's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not even crazy shoe.</v>

2591
02:11:22.371 --> 02:11:23.450
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that a,</v>

2592
02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:28.900
<v Speaker 6>that's North America people feet and</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy were h u a o r a n I.</v>

2593
02:11:31.410 --> 02:11:32.990
<v Speaker 6>How do you pronounce that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Harani.</v>

2594
02:11:33.370 --> 02:11:36.740
<v Speaker 6>I'd have to check where that is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's bizarre,</v>

2595
02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:42.040
<v Speaker 6>but it really does show you from fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>wearing shoes your whole life and given</v>

2596
02:11:42.681 --> 02:11:45.740
<v Speaker 6>the different environment like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's insane.</v>

2597
02:11:46.010 --> 02:11:48.800
<v Speaker 6>Like what we're looking at here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they literally look like thumbs,</v>

2598
02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:53.210
<v Speaker 6>like they're sticking out of the side,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's the same structure as a human</v>

2599
02:11:53.211 --> 02:11:55.670
<v Speaker 6>foot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>meaning that it's the same length of</v>

2600
02:11:55.730 --> 02:11:59.810
<v Speaker 6>toes and just you see that from using it</v>
<v Speaker 6>that way.</v>

2601
02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:03.140
<v Speaker 6>They've just developed this incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what's really crazy?</v>

2602
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:07.140
<v Speaker 6>What is one of the hallmarks of</v>
<v Speaker 6>civilization that shows like a really</v>

2603
02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:10.820
<v Speaker 6>poor choice and footwear when your feet</v>
<v Speaker 6>go the other way,</v>

2604
02:12:11.090 --> 02:12:13.070
<v Speaker 6>when they go in an ineffective</v>
<v Speaker 6>direction,</v>

2605
02:12:13.071 --> 02:12:15.890
<v Speaker 6>they they get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get that hammertoe and they climb</v>

2606
02:12:15.891 --> 02:12:17.510
<v Speaker 6>over each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These is,</v>

2607
02:12:17.511 --> 02:12:22.010
<v Speaker 6>these people have functional feet to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>point where you know they could probably</v>

2608
02:12:22.011 --> 02:12:23.450
<v Speaker 6>hold something with their feet.</v>

2609
02:12:23.710 --> 02:12:25.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I look at a.</v>

2610
02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:30.200
<v Speaker 3>When I look at my wife's feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like she's got a foot disease</v>

2611
02:12:30.230 --> 02:12:33.280
<v Speaker 3>very much shaped by a lifetime of office</v>
<v Speaker 3>footwear.</v>

2612
02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:36.540
<v Speaker 6>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially with women.</v>

2613
02:12:36.570 --> 02:12:39.440
<v Speaker 6>They get that Hammertoe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that Bunyan thing where their,</v>

2614
02:12:39.450 --> 02:12:42.540
<v Speaker 6>their toes are kind of crossed over to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the center of that thing.</v>

2615
02:12:42.541 --> 02:12:43.950
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so weird.</v>

2616
02:12:44.350 --> 02:12:49.290
<v Speaker 6>It's a weird choice that someone is</v>
<v Speaker 6>decided that women should shove their</v>

2617
02:12:49.291 --> 02:12:50.940
<v Speaker 6>toes into these pointy things.</v>

2618
02:12:51.190 --> 02:12:53.110
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2619
02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:57.520
<v Speaker 3>just like with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I saw the,</v>

2620
02:12:57.910 --> 02:13:02.910
<v Speaker 3>a group of individuals lock onto</v>
<v Speaker 3>polarized sunglasses as being the shit.</v>

2621
02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2622
02:13:05.530 --> 02:13:08.650
<v Speaker 3>if you went back in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

2623
02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:11.380
<v Speaker 3>instead of bringing beaten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being barefoot was gonna be wearing</v>

2624
02:13:11.381 --> 02:13:12.214
<v Speaker 3>shoes.</v>

2625
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:15.040
<v Speaker 6>What if you got those women high heel</v>
<v Speaker 6>shoes and said,</v>

2626
02:13:15.041 --> 02:13:16.780
<v Speaker 6>this is what all the women in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>stretch.</v>

2627
02:13:17.230 --> 02:13:19.050
<v Speaker 6>Of course you could take awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you get.</v>

2628
02:13:19.110 --> 02:13:20.600
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's disgusting though.</v>

2629
02:13:20.601 --> 02:13:22.980
<v Speaker 6>That's foot banding is fucked up right</v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

2630
02:13:22.981 --> 02:13:24.240
<v Speaker 6>That's just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you tell them,</v>

2631
02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:28.210
<v Speaker 6>looking at your toes from binding your</v>
<v Speaker 6>feet,</v>

2632
02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:30.210
<v Speaker 6>foot binding in China?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2633
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:33.360
<v Speaker 6>Well you soft tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very flexible.</v>

2634
02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:34.500
<v Speaker 6>So go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2635
02:13:34.530 --> 02:13:36.930
<v Speaker 6>go to Cirque du Solei.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at those people could do their</v>

2636
02:13:36.931 --> 02:13:39.870
<v Speaker 6>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The human body is pretty bizarre and its</v>

2637
02:13:39.871 --> 02:13:41.420
<v Speaker 6>ability to adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it,</v>

2638
02:13:41.490 --> 02:13:41.881
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2639
02:13:41.881 --> 02:13:45.720
<v Speaker 3>those groups that used to bind their</v>
<v Speaker 3>children's head to that back to flag in</v>

2640
02:13:45.770 --> 02:13:46.570
<v Speaker 3>your head out,</v>

2641
02:13:46.570 --> 02:13:49.510
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how about those people and what part of</v>

2642
02:13:49.511 --> 02:13:54.511
<v Speaker 6>the world was it a where they have that</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the incas,</v>

2643
02:13:56.260 --> 02:14:00.040
<v Speaker 6>the where they have those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Nazca lines,</v>

2644
02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:02.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they found all these skulls from</v>

2645
02:14:02.051 --> 02:14:04.690
<v Speaker 6>people back then were they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it stretched their heads out,</v>

2646
02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:07.150
<v Speaker 6>almost made their heads look like</v>
<v Speaker 6>aliens.</v>

2647
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:08.103
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there you go.</v>

2648
02:14:09.070 --> 02:14:09.700
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2649
02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:14.700
<v Speaker 6>see if you find the Inca Inca skulls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so much so that a lot of the really</v>

2650
02:14:15.071 --> 02:14:16.300
<v Speaker 6>loony people said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2651
02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:19.240
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to be like the aliens</v>
<v Speaker 6>that have come down and given them</v>

2652
02:14:19.241 --> 02:14:21.210
<v Speaker 6>knowledge and.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2653
02:14:21.211 --> 02:14:22.000
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2654
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.320
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever been down to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2655
02:14:24.130 --> 02:14:26.220
<v Speaker 3>do you remember those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

2656
02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:27.910
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're held in Salta,</v>

2657
02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to see him one time.</v>

2658
02:14:29.921 --> 02:14:34.420
<v Speaker 3>But those children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did they found that were in tombed at</v>

2659
02:14:34.421 --> 02:14:36.820
<v Speaker 3>the top of a mountain and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically freeze dried?</v>

2660
02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:38.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's perfectly preserved.</v>

2661
02:14:38.741 --> 02:14:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would happen to them?</v>

2662
02:14:40.810 --> 02:14:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were taken up and given as the</v>

2663
02:14:43.091 --> 02:14:46.960
<v Speaker 3>offering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first it seems based on the stuff</v>

2664
02:14:46.961 --> 02:14:51.850
<v Speaker 3>they had with them that they were prayed</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the incan empire and people</v>

2665
02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:55.090
<v Speaker 3>lavish them with gifts and when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the isotopes and their bodies,</v>

2666
02:14:55.091 --> 02:14:57.340
<v Speaker 3>it's like their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their whole lives,</v>

2667
02:14:57.341 --> 02:15:00.290
<v Speaker 3>they had just had potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you can see the,</v>

2668
02:15:00.291 --> 02:15:03.370
<v Speaker 3>toward the end of their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very well fed with meat and fish</v>

2669
02:15:03.371 --> 02:15:07.300
<v Speaker 3>and all kinds of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they had just innumerable treasures,</v>

2670
02:15:08.190 --> 02:15:13.190
<v Speaker 3>a gold pieces carved pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were taking it seems as though</v>

2671
02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:15.280
<v Speaker 3>they were taken throughout the empire.</v>

2672
02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:16.870
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really funny about this,</v>

2673
02:15:16.871 --> 02:15:18.760
<v Speaker 3>speaking of Columbus earlier is it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2674
02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:24.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like as best they haven't dated</v>

2675
02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:25.900
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it seems like,</v>

2676
02:15:26.110 --> 02:15:27.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems like we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2677
02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:29.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbus 1492.</v>

2678
02:15:29.261 --> 02:15:31.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're talking about 1491.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2679
02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:35.690
<v Speaker 3>So the height of this empire at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the,</v>

2680
02:15:35.890 --> 02:15:40.330
<v Speaker 3>the height of the empire butting up</v>
<v Speaker 3>against it's dramatic and sudden</v>

2681
02:15:40.331 --> 02:15:43.070
<v Speaker 3>collapse with European contact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they took a.</v>

2682
02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:43.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to see.</v>

2683
02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:46.440
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was the only,</v>

2684
02:15:46.450 --> 02:15:49.600
<v Speaker 3>they made a deal with indigenous people</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they only put one on display at a</v>

2685
02:15:49.601 --> 02:15:51.430
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was on display when I was there</v>

2686
02:15:51.550 --> 02:15:55.440
<v Speaker 3>and what do they have their encapsuled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they took them,</v>

2687
02:15:56.660 --> 02:15:58.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you how they came to be first.</v>

2688
02:15:58.151 --> 02:16:01.540
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were finally dressed,</v>

2689
02:16:01.630 --> 02:16:05.930
<v Speaker 3>had a lot of ornaments and things with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them had been very well fed and the,</v>

2690
02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:09.070
<v Speaker 3>the older group and they took them out</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the high peak,</v>

2691
02:16:09.130 --> 02:16:12.280
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember how they might've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>14 or 15,000 feet above sea level.</v>

2692
02:16:12.610 --> 02:16:16.600
<v Speaker 3>And they built a little tune for him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sat him in the tomb.</v>

2693
02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:18.670
<v Speaker 3>They were drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a lot of rice wine in their</v>

2694
02:16:18.671 --> 02:16:20.770
<v Speaker 3>bodies when they died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2695
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:24.950
<v Speaker 3>the oldest one mostly putting up some</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of struggle because she was hitting</v>

2696
02:16:24.970 --> 02:16:29.970
<v Speaker 3>the head with a hammer and acts and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were just laid out in this thing and</v>

2697
02:16:30.401 --> 02:16:34.630
<v Speaker 3>then kept over with rocks and it's very</v>
<v Speaker 3>stable environment.</v>

2698
02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:36.940
<v Speaker 3>So they froze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2699
02:16:37.090 --> 02:16:38.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we use now like backpacking food is</v>

2700
02:16:38.921 --> 02:16:40.490
<v Speaker 3>freeze dried food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2701
02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.940
<v Speaker 3>They used to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to do a very similar thing</v>

2702
02:16:43.210 --> 02:16:48.210
<v Speaker 3>with by just taking potatoes and storing</v>
<v Speaker 3>them at high elevations were what?</v>

2703
02:16:49.451 --> 02:16:54.451
<v Speaker 3>Freeze drying is your liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you freeze something and then</v>

2704
02:16:54.821 --> 02:16:57.730
<v Speaker 3>expel the liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where liquid goes from a gaseous</v>

2705
02:16:58.350 --> 02:17:03.100
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] goes from a solid to a gas</v>
<v Speaker 3>without passing through its liquid</v>

2706
02:17:03.101 --> 02:17:05.350
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you freeze dry food,</v>

2707
02:17:05.351 --> 02:17:07.600
<v Speaker 3>you like freeze dry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put it in a freezer and get super</v>

2708
02:17:07.601 --> 02:17:09.310
<v Speaker 3>cold and then you start.</v>

2709
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Then you start putting it under a vacuum</v>
<v Speaker 3>to point where all the water goes</v>

2710
02:17:15.071 --> 02:17:18.370
<v Speaker 3>immediately to a gash state doesn't pass</v>
<v Speaker 3>through a liquid state,</v>

2711
02:17:18.371 --> 02:17:22.690
<v Speaker 3>so it holds its form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all the water's gone.</v>

2712
02:17:23.290 --> 02:17:25.450
<v Speaker 3>If it goes to a liquid state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it collapses,</v>

2713
02:17:25.451 --> 02:17:28.150
<v Speaker 3>but just hold it's form in the non</v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

2714
02:17:28.151 --> 02:17:33.070
<v Speaker 3>Parts of the cells just stay bound in</v>
<v Speaker 3>their natural shape.</v>

2715
02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:36.850
<v Speaker 3>So they were in this position and</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually just like expelled tons of</v>

2716
02:17:36.851 --> 02:17:39.580
<v Speaker 3>water without ever thrown out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when they found them,</v>

2717
02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:43.060
<v Speaker 3>you can even see the that they had been</v>
<v Speaker 3>chewing cocoa leaves because the high</v>

2718
02:17:43.061 --> 02:17:45.700
<v Speaker 3>elevation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids still have dried coca leaves on</v>

2719
02:17:45.701 --> 02:17:46.900
<v Speaker 3>their lips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2720
02:17:46.901 --> 02:17:48.220
<v Speaker 3>it's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2721
02:17:48.221 --> 02:17:49.540
<v Speaker 3>Me and my wife went there to look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2722
02:17:49.570 --> 02:17:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Where does it now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in Salta,</v>

2723
02:17:51.161 --> 02:17:52.900
<v Speaker 3>Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2724
02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:55.660
<v Speaker 3>Near the border was very near the border</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Bolivia.</v>

2725
02:17:55.940 --> 02:17:57.770
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to ask you something totally</v>
<v Speaker 6>unrelated,</v>

2726
02:17:57.771 --> 02:18:00.440
<v Speaker 6>but it came up because you've talked</v>
<v Speaker 6>about freeze dried foods.</v>

2727
02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:03.260
<v Speaker 6>I know you cook a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but have you ever.</v>

2728
02:18:03.261 --> 02:18:05.060
<v Speaker 6>I know you eat those mountain house</v>
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>

2729
02:18:05.180 --> 02:18:06.470
<v Speaker 6>but have you ever tried to make your</v>
<v Speaker 6>own.</v>

2730
02:18:06.471 --> 02:18:08.870
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever tried to dehydrate some of</v>
<v Speaker 6>your wild game?</v>

2731
02:18:08.871 --> 02:18:09.950
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm dehydrated.</v>

2732
02:18:10.010 --> 02:18:11.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean anytime you make jerky or</v>
<v Speaker 6>dehydrate and stuff,</v>

2733
02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:15.260
<v Speaker 6>but have you ever made chili and things</v>
<v Speaker 6>like that where you could rehydrated in</v>

2734
02:18:15.261 --> 02:18:17.630
<v Speaker 6>the field trial they've ever made</v>
<v Speaker 6>dehydrated?</v>

2735
02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:21.230
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've assembled a lot of dehydrated</v>

2736
02:18:21.231 --> 02:18:24.500
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've never d like at what point,</v>

<v Speaker 3>something before it becomes like a</v>

<v Speaker 3>recipe?</v>

2740
02:18:34.550 --> 02:18:39.290
<v Speaker 3>Pemmican pulverize meet with liquid fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>poured over the top of it.</v>

2741
02:18:39.530 --> 02:18:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Did you know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2742
02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:42.800
<v Speaker 3>People.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that up all the time.</v>

2743
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:45.020
<v Speaker 3>What feminine is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of it before,</v>

2744
02:18:45.021 --> 02:18:48.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like the original road food.</v>

2745
02:18:48.141 --> 02:18:52.190
<v Speaker 3>You dry meat into Jerky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>air-dry a Jerky,</v>

2746
02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:57.020
<v Speaker 3>then you pull it into what looks like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sawdust and then you take in stirred and</v>

2747
02:18:57.021 --> 02:19:00.560
<v Speaker 3>liquified fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made some from a buffalo kill and I</v>

2748
02:19:00.561 --> 02:19:03.370
<v Speaker 3>wrote my buffalo book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made Pemmican from that and I was.</v>

2749
02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:05.480
<v Speaker 3>And I had it in my fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This as an experiment.</v>

2750
02:19:05.481 --> 02:19:06.830
<v Speaker 3>I kept it for seven years.</v>

2751
02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:10.060
<v Speaker 3>Survival food that can last 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not pemmican.</v>

2752
02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:12.890
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like it looks like jerky</v>

2753
02:19:12.891 --> 02:19:16.460
<v Speaker 3>sticks because it's not pulverized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just now started all of a sudden</v>

2754
02:19:16.461 --> 02:19:17.540
<v Speaker 3>call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

2755
02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:21.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying everybody missed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardly everybody messes up,</v>

2756
02:19:21.681 --> 02:19:23.180
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a thing that gets messed</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2757
02:19:23.570 --> 02:19:25.810
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2758
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:27.410
<v Speaker 3>what was I getting at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are asking about?</v>

2759
02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:30.680
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asking you to hydrate or dehydrate a</v>

2760
02:19:30.681 --> 02:19:35.681
<v Speaker 3>bunch of different things and combined</v>
<v Speaker 3>it into a recipe that I then bring with</v>

2761
02:19:37.011 --> 02:19:40.250
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason I like the reason I used the</v>

2762
02:19:40.251 --> 02:19:44.660
<v Speaker 3>hydrated food and a lot of backpack</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunters use dehydrated food is because</v>

2763
02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:48.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a a,</v>

2764
02:19:48.551 --> 02:19:51.810
<v Speaker 3>a dish made up of dehydrated</v>
<v Speaker 3>ingredients.</v>

2765
02:19:52.050 --> 02:19:55.170
<v Speaker 3>They have different hydration times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2766
02:19:55.290 --> 02:19:59.970
<v Speaker 3>So if you do beans like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a piece of meat is going to be</v>

2767
02:20:00.090 --> 02:20:04.720
<v Speaker 3>digestible to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My piece of dehydrated meat that's then</v>

2768
02:20:04.721 --> 02:20:06.430
<v Speaker 3>hydrated is going to be digestible to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2769
02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:08.260
<v Speaker 3>A dehydrated being,</v>

2770
02:20:09.350 --> 02:20:09.800
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2771
02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:12.920
<v Speaker 3>Might take 30 or 40 minutes before it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be in a condition and it</v>

2772
02:20:12.921 --> 02:20:17.180
<v Speaker 3>doesn't rip you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you fuck yourself up,</v>

2773
02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:19.910
<v Speaker 3>eat straight dried beans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>

2774
02:20:20.210 --> 02:20:21.530
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just you're off.</v>

2775
02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:22.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

2776
02:20:22.341 --> 02:20:23.480
<v Speaker 3>You're someone doesn't know what to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it,</v>

2777
02:20:23.481 --> 02:20:24.920
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well knows what to do with.</v>

2778
02:20:24.921 --> 02:20:29.650
<v Speaker 3>It starts producing voluminous amounts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of gas,</v>

2779
02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:31.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's off,</v>

2780
02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:32.740
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with,</v>

2781
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:35.360
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could,</v>

2782
02:20:35.390 --> 02:20:38.690
<v Speaker 3>if you take food and cook it to a ready</v>
<v Speaker 3>to eat steak</v>

2783
02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:43.310
<v Speaker 3>and then freeze dry it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2784
02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:44.353
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2785
02:20:44.450 --> 02:20:47.300
<v Speaker 3>you can rehydrate it Kinda like</v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously if you do everything</v>

2786
02:20:47.301 --> 02:20:49.220
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One word were like a hamburger,</v>

2787
02:20:49.221 --> 02:20:51.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're hydrated a hamburger and then</v>

2788
02:20:51.201 --> 02:20:53.630
<v Speaker 3>you add water to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to wind up with a soggy ass</v>

2789
02:20:53.631 --> 02:20:57.020
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the trick is like finding things that</v>

2790
02:20:57.230 --> 02:21:01.910
<v Speaker 3>are gonna in a hot water bath are going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to all come back to life kind of at the</v>

2791
02:21:01.911 --> 02:21:05.180
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But places that make backpack food out</v>

2792
02:21:05.181 --> 02:21:10.181
<v Speaker 3>of just dehydrated but not freeze dried</v>
<v Speaker 3>ingredients is a recipe for disaster.</v>

2793
02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people liked that shit.</v>

2794
02:21:12.051 --> 02:21:14.630
<v Speaker 3>But for day in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day out consumption,</v>

2795
02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:19.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a freeze dry man and it's freeze</v>

2796
02:21:19.491 --> 02:21:20.720
<v Speaker 3>dried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something you can do at home,</v>

2797
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:24.200
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to buy a sublimation chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So No.</v>

2798
02:21:24.350 --> 02:21:26.120
<v Speaker 3>What does the sublimation chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that look?</v>

2799
02:21:26.121 --> 02:21:28.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a chamber in which sublimation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what it looks like.</v>

2800
02:21:28.430 --> 02:21:30.500
<v Speaker 3>It looks like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a submarine,</v>

2801
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:33.770
<v Speaker 3>really small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very heavy duty because we are</v>

2802
02:21:33.771 --> 02:21:35.510
<v Speaker 3>doing is you're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking food,</v>

2803
02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:39.390
<v Speaker 3>you take ready foods and freeze it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2804
02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:44.030
<v Speaker 3>And then you put it into a sublimation</v>
<v Speaker 3>chamber and pull a very strong vacuum on</v>

2805
02:21:44.031 --> 02:21:48.050
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the air pressure gets to a point</v>

2806
02:21:48.051 --> 02:21:53.051
<v Speaker 3>where the liquid cellmates and goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>directly to a gas state and you condense</v>

2807
02:21:53.091 --> 02:21:55.010
<v Speaker 3>it on another surface inside the</v>
<v Speaker 3>chamber,</v>

2808
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:57.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's out of the food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you take the food out and it's like</v>

2809
02:21:57.891 --> 02:22:00.200
<v Speaker 3>glass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can shatter it.</v>

2810
02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:04.730
<v Speaker 3>That's freeze dried food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it rehydrates in a real nice way.</v>

2811
02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:09.980
<v Speaker 3>I have heard we a lot of it because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a lot of back country trips.</v>

2812
02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I've heard everyone's complaints about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2813
02:22:12.381 --> 02:22:17.000
<v Speaker 3>but it's like from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I will argue is a well informed</v>

2814
02:22:17.390 --> 02:22:18.080
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

2815
02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:22.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's the lesser of two evils.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that bad for day in,</v>

2816
02:22:22.730 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 3>day out consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the companies that are do</v>

2817
02:22:25.771 --> 02:22:30.600
<v Speaker 3>freeze dry it just better in my opinion</v>
<v Speaker 3>now when I say that these children are</v>

2818
02:22:30.601 --> 02:22:32.100
<v Speaker 3>freeze dried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some people,</v>

2819
02:22:32.101 --> 02:22:33.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are going to challenge that</v>

2820
02:22:33.661 --> 02:22:35.040
<v Speaker 3>because it's not technically freeze</v>
<v Speaker 3>dried,</v>

2821
02:22:35.041 --> 02:22:40.041
<v Speaker 3>but like a similar thing going on where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're keeping their form but shedding</v>

2822
02:22:40.591 --> 02:22:43.920
<v Speaker 3>their water and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>shedding water,</v>

2823
02:22:43.921 --> 02:22:46.800
<v Speaker 3>keeping their form of being frozen and</v>
<v Speaker 3>preserved for a long time.</v>

2824
02:22:47.310 --> 02:22:49.560
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a trip because I was reading a</v>

2825
02:22:49.561 --> 02:22:52.950
<v Speaker 3>podcast or reading a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to a podcast rather with this</v>

2826
02:22:52.951 --> 02:22:55.140
<v Speaker 3>guy was talking about how he's doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that with his own food,</v>

2827
02:22:55.141 --> 02:22:57.190
<v Speaker 3>for backpacking trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dehydrating it.</v>

2828
02:22:57.200 --> 02:22:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

2829
02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Things like Chili or things along those</v>
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>

2830
02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:03.450
<v Speaker 3>It's busy cooking Chili and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>dehydrate or just dehydrating the</v>

2831
02:23:03.451 --> 02:23:04.284
<v Speaker 3>components.</v>

2832
02:23:04.290 --> 02:23:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Think dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The components.</v>

2833
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:09.240
<v Speaker 3>I think he was talking about dehydrating</v>
<v Speaker 3>the meat and dehydrating pasta.</v>

2834
02:23:09.260 --> 02:23:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Like like something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2835
02:23:10.951 --> 02:23:15.660
<v Speaker 3>like taking some meat with sauce and</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it together with the pasta.</v>

2836
02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:18.510
<v Speaker 3>Now my brother one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a very,</v>

2837
02:23:18.511 --> 02:23:21.240
<v Speaker 3>a frugal man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't realize is that the right</v>

2838
02:23:21.241 --> 02:23:23.820
<v Speaker 3>word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just hates a to see food,</v>

2839
02:23:23.821 --> 02:23:25.980
<v Speaker 3>go to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He one time had a bunch of roommates and</v>

2840
02:23:25.981 --> 02:23:28.830
<v Speaker 3>they all moved out and left a ton of</v>
<v Speaker 3>rice and you got sick of cooking rice</v>

2841
02:23:29.370 --> 02:23:34.370
<v Speaker 3>because it takes too long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He cooked all the rice and then spread</v>

2842
02:23:34.861 --> 02:23:38.430
<v Speaker 3>it out on sheets and dehydrated it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a hydrator and,</v>

2843
02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:39.290
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2844
02:23:39.290 --> 02:23:42.780
<v Speaker 3>and reverse engineered instant rice.</v>

2845
02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:47.820
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it take that long?</v>

2846
02:23:47.850 --> 02:23:49.290
<v Speaker 3>What does rice tastes like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty minutes?</v>

2847
02:23:49.291 --> 02:23:51.630
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it takes more time to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that talk to him.</v>

2848
02:23:51.631 --> 02:23:55.650
<v Speaker 3>So this is the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this the same guy that found the</v>

2849
02:23:55.651 --> 02:23:57.650
<v Speaker 3>hobos underwear and stole it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2850
02:23:57.780 --> 02:23:59.610
<v Speaker 3>And the same guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2851
02:24:00.090 --> 02:24:01.950
<v Speaker 3>one time our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our dear,</v>

2852
02:24:01.951 --> 02:24:06.951
<v Speaker 3>late friend was getting married and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his bride,</v>

2853
02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:13.530
<v Speaker 3>his bride at the wedding was at his</v>
<v Speaker 3>bride to b's House and a neighbor was</v>

2854
02:24:13.531 --> 02:24:16.580
<v Speaker 3>away on vacation and the neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 3>was away on vacation,</v>

2855
02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:17.650
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2856
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:20.760
<v Speaker 3>since we're out of town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you guys want to use our home for</v>

2857
02:24:20.761 --> 02:24:24.090
<v Speaker 3>some of your wedding guests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

2858
02:24:24.810 --> 02:24:29.810
<v Speaker 3>And so all the groomsmen were lodged up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this house of this man.</v>

2859
02:24:31.171 --> 02:24:33.990
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know who was a neighbor of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>wife's parents.</v>

2860
02:24:34.350 --> 02:24:36.870
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why,</v>

2861
02:24:36.871 --> 02:24:40.440
<v Speaker 3>but my brother got the snooping around</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this guy freezer and found that he</v>

2862
02:24:40.441 --> 02:24:40.920
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>

2863
02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:45.120
<v Speaker 3>He had a bull elk in there that had been</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there for seven years and he had like</v>

2864
02:24:45.121 --> 02:24:49.200
<v Speaker 3>this crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this moral crisis where he's trying to</v>

2865
02:24:49.201 --> 02:24:54.201
<v Speaker 3>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it morally worse to steal or morally</v>

2866
02:24:54.331 --> 02:24:56.730
<v Speaker 3>worse to allow this man to waste this</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet?</v>

2867
02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:58.890
<v Speaker 3>How long was it built?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll book stay.</v>

2868
02:24:58.891 --> 02:24:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you freeze it,</v>

2869
02:24:59.761 --> 02:25:01.620
<v Speaker 3>you were fucking pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A seven years.</v>

2870
02:25:01.621 --> 02:25:05.070
<v Speaker 3>Seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is what is commonly agreed</v>

2871
02:25:05.071 --> 02:25:07.470
<v Speaker 3>upon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends who you ask.</v>

2872
02:25:07.471 --> 02:25:11.700
<v Speaker 3>If you asked me the way I treat trim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I cut trim and rap,</v>

2873
02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:16.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't even blink at two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two years is fine.</v>

2874
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:18.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way I cut trim and rap.</v>

2875
02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:20.160
<v Speaker 3>But when you start seeing for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a little weird.</v>

2876
02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing that I don't let it go.</v>

2877
02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:23.560
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done it.</v>

2878
02:25:23.561 --> 02:25:25.900
<v Speaker 3>I would have to think it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>start to go [inaudible] the texture,</v>

2879
02:25:25.930 --> 02:25:27.220
<v Speaker 3>the texture will change.</v>

2880
02:25:27.310 --> 02:25:28.860
<v Speaker 3>The texture will change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2881
02:25:29.650 --> 02:25:31.630
<v Speaker 3>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two things going on.</v>

2882
02:25:31.631 --> 02:25:33.610
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're borderline until you're starting</v>

2883
02:25:33.611 --> 02:25:35.620
<v Speaker 3>to get the idea that this guy isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna eat that thing,</v>

2884
02:25:35.650 --> 02:25:36.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2885
02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:40.600
<v Speaker 3>So he waited out in his head and when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>left he had a bunch of that meet with</v>

2886
02:25:40.601 --> 02:25:42.700
<v Speaker 3>them and took them home and aid because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just hated to see,</v>

2887
02:25:42.701 --> 02:25:43.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

2888
02:25:43.250 --> 02:25:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Outgoing waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did it tastes?</v>

2889
02:25:44.821 --> 02:25:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Seven years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember we did the ask them.</v>

2890
02:25:46.990 --> 02:25:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But his standard of good is different</v>

2891
02:25:49.121 --> 02:25:52.990
<v Speaker 3>than your standard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his standard of good as acceptable in</v>

2892
02:25:52.991 --> 02:25:56.710
<v Speaker 3>cases like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's a weird crisis though.</v>

2893
02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:57.870
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>

2894
02:25:57.910 --> 02:26:00.040
<v Speaker 3>throughout his whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he always is running into these</v>

2895
02:26:00.041 --> 02:26:05.041
<v Speaker 3>situations like where he cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he cannot let food go to waste.</v>

2896
02:26:06.220 --> 02:26:08.050
<v Speaker 3>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I talk to him right now,</v>

2897
02:26:08.051 --> 02:26:10.450
<v Speaker 3>there's probably 10 more things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that have happened to them since I</v>

2898
02:26:10.451 --> 02:26:14.650
<v Speaker 3>talked to him last where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he found like he found in his</v>

2899
02:26:14.651 --> 02:26:18.070
<v Speaker 3>alleyway one time and he living in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana and still lives in my town</v>

2900
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:20.380
<v Speaker 3>living in Bozeman founder and his</v>
<v Speaker 3>alleyway,</v>

2901
02:26:20.410 --> 02:26:25.410
<v Speaker 3>like a discarded a discarded cash from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>homeless man and ate all that guys food.</v>

2902
02:26:29.710 --> 02:26:32.080
<v Speaker 3>And he was a phd candidate at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

2903
02:26:35.710 --> 02:26:38.920
<v Speaker 3>You grew up with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've ever understand him.</v>

2904
02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:42.670
<v Speaker 3>The first time he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's where he kind of like,</v>

2905
02:26:42.730 --> 02:26:46.810
<v Speaker 3>we're not where it came from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he drew a bear tag when we were in</v>

2906
02:26:46.811 --> 02:26:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Michigan and it was hard to get a bear</v>
<v Speaker 3>take at the time.</v>

2907
02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:51.490
<v Speaker 3>And he drew a bear tag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the only way to hunt bears and the</v>

2908
02:26:51.491 --> 02:26:53.210
<v Speaker 3>ups is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2909
02:26:53.230 --> 02:26:54.840
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to spot stock him</v>

2910
02:26:54.850 --> 02:26:56.530
<v Speaker 3>because it's flat ground and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>see shit.</v>

2911
02:26:56.590 --> 02:26:57.570
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2912
02:26:57.580 --> 02:26:59.590
<v Speaker 3>you use dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you gonna use bait.</v>

2913
02:26:59.730 --> 02:27:01.000
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never see a bear.</v>

2914
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:05.020
<v Speaker 3>So he started to bait pound way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was feeding his bait pile ahead of</v>

2915
02:27:05.021 --> 02:27:09.790
<v Speaker 3>the season was just dumpster diving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as he's dumpster diving,</v>

2916
02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:13.960
<v Speaker 3>it's like he's living off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only is he baiting the bear with the</v>

2917
02:27:13.961 --> 02:27:16.720
<v Speaker 3>dumpster food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's like living off the dumpster</v>

2918
02:27:16.721 --> 02:27:18.600
<v Speaker 3>dive and food that he found to because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he liked,</v>

2919
02:27:18.601 --> 02:27:20.530
<v Speaker 3>discovered this great richmond November</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2920
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:25.540
<v Speaker 3>He found on that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He found this big box of boxes of</v>

2921
02:27:25.541 --> 02:27:28.480
<v Speaker 3>expired bugles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know those little crackers?</v>

2922
02:27:28.570 --> 02:27:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people like put cheese with shoot</v>

2923
02:27:30.881 --> 02:27:32.740
<v Speaker 3>Cheez whiz into the open ended that</v>
<v Speaker 3>bugle.</v>

2924
02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:36.010
<v Speaker 3>And I've got a picture of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just walking the walk through the</v>

2925
02:27:36.011 --> 02:27:39.760
<v Speaker 3>woods with boxes of bugles under his arm</v>
<v Speaker 3>and get out.</v>

2926
02:27:39.761 --> 02:27:43.390
<v Speaker 3>And he'd be like dumping them out for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bear and just eating the vehicles</v>

2927
02:27:43.391 --> 02:27:45.290
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he'll walk back with a handful</v>

2928
02:27:45.291 --> 02:27:47.080
<v Speaker 3>of bugles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just hate to see wasted food.</v>

2929
02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:51.150
<v Speaker 3>His old girlfriend had a job cooking</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the brown food and the Albertson's,</v>

2930
02:27:51.151 --> 02:27:53.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the display case where they fry all</v>

2931
02:27:53.021 --> 02:27:55.440
<v Speaker 3>it was like burritos and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2932
02:27:56.470 --> 02:27:58.600
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was bringing all that home and they</v>

2933
02:27:58.601 --> 02:28:02.350
<v Speaker 3>were living off the food that was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the garbage and they came to her and</v>

2934
02:28:02.351 --> 02:28:03.520
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't steal this food.</v>

2935
02:28:03.521 --> 02:28:05.110
<v Speaker 3>And then she started stealing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>quietly.</v>

2936
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't stand to see food go to waste.</v>

2937
02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Well that's probably noble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2938
02:28:11.321 --> 02:28:13.360
<v Speaker 3>it's extra nice is he works for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usta.</v>

2939
02:28:14.470 --> 02:28:19.470
<v Speaker 3>So it's good to know that a person like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is involved and um,</v>

2940
02:28:21.690 --> 02:28:22.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2941
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:26.420
<v Speaker 6>is at least in the room with people who</v>
<v Speaker 6>are thinking about food systems.</v>

2942
02:28:28.990 --> 02:28:32.170
<v Speaker 6>Is it good?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it seems like you'll fucking</v>

2943
02:28:32.210 --> 02:28:33.890
<v Speaker 6>anything dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He will.</v>

2944
02:28:34.610 --> 02:28:38.480
<v Speaker 6>He's on a different level,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on a different level of toughness and</v>

2945
02:28:38.481 --> 02:28:40.970
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's the guy who was arm and shrinking</v>

2946
02:28:40.971 --> 02:28:42.470
<v Speaker 6>because morale is trying to hook you up</v>
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>

2947
02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:43.290
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2948
02:28:43.290 --> 02:28:45.920
<v Speaker 6>He's got a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did he do anything about that?</v>

2949
02:28:45.921 --> 02:28:47.240
<v Speaker 6>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Jesus,</v>

2950
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:48.950
<v Speaker 6>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2951
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:51.800
<v Speaker 6>Once you get that atrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a very tough to get it back.</v>

2952
02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:55.190
<v Speaker 6>The ways nerves regenerate takes a long</v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2953
02:28:55.191 --> 02:28:57.890
<v Speaker 6>It's like a half an inch a year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He chronicles.</v>

2954
02:28:57.891 --> 02:29:02.891
<v Speaker 6>It's decay by taking a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got a 30 pound a kettle bell and</v>

2955
02:29:05.871 --> 02:29:08.480
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was chronicling his decay by watching</v>

2956
02:29:08.481 --> 02:29:12.640
<v Speaker 6>how many just tricep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So County Hmi,</v>

2957
02:29:12.650 --> 02:29:14.060
<v Speaker 6>tricep curls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He could do it.</v>

2958
02:29:14.061 --> 02:29:15.960
<v Speaker 6>That kettlebell with one arm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one with the other.</v>

2959
02:29:15.970 --> 02:29:19.790
<v Speaker 6>And I think last time we were talking to</v>
<v Speaker 6>him it was 30 or something like 30 on</v>

2960
02:29:19.791 --> 02:29:21.350
<v Speaker 6>one side and 10 on the other side.</v>

2961
02:29:21.410 --> 02:29:22.640
<v Speaker 6>Oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's bad.</v>

2962
02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:23.460
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2963
02:29:23.460 --> 02:29:28.220
<v Speaker 6>that's a neck issue then he's like a c,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three or c four or something like that.</v>

2964
02:29:28.610 --> 02:29:30.200
<v Speaker 6>He's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's gone.</v>

2965
02:29:30.390 --> 02:29:31.790
<v Speaker 6>He hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I shouldn't say he hasn't done anything</v>

2966
02:29:31.791 --> 02:29:32.624
<v Speaker 6>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's probably,</v>

2967
02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:35.240
<v Speaker 6>if he's listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's probably cringing because he would</v>

2968
02:29:35.241 --> 02:29:39.760
<v Speaker 6>feel that he has.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I'm tell him if he's listening this</v>

2969
02:29:40.350 --> 02:29:42.050
<v Speaker 6>a couple things you need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it's,</v>

2970
02:29:42.051 --> 02:29:44.150
<v Speaker 6>it seems to me like it's a neck issue</v>
<v Speaker 6>because,</v>

2971
02:29:44.151 --> 02:29:44.661
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

2972
02:29:44.661 --> 02:29:49.430
<v Speaker 6>when you start getting elbows and things</v>
<v Speaker 6>where your arm starts atrophying,</v>

2973
02:29:49.431 --> 02:29:52.100
<v Speaker 6>usually it's a cervical disc which is</v>
<v Speaker 6>somewhere up in here.</v>

2974
02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:53.360
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

2975
02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:56.990
<v Speaker 6>what he should do is get a neck</v>
<v Speaker 6>decompression device.</v>

2976
02:29:56.991 --> 02:29:58.940
<v Speaker 6>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're inexpensive.</v>

2977
02:29:59.150 --> 02:30:02.240
<v Speaker 6>They hook over a door,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you put it on with Velcro,</v>

2978
02:30:02.241 --> 02:30:03.410
<v Speaker 6>you strap it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I have one,</v>

2979
02:30:03.770 --> 02:30:04.490
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2980
02:30:04.490 --> 02:30:06.960
<v Speaker 6>it hangs on a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're hanging yourself by</v>

2981
02:30:06.961 --> 02:30:09.890
<v Speaker 6>your Chin may get some room in there for</v>
<v Speaker 6>all those nerves.</v>

2982
02:30:10.130 --> 02:30:11.600
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And well,</v>

2983
02:30:11.780 --> 02:30:14.390
<v Speaker 6>same principles,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these toes spreading out.</v>

2984
02:30:14.690 --> 02:30:16.820
<v Speaker 6>And then other also toasts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>smashing up.</v>

2985
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:22.000
<v Speaker 6>You can kind of soft tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stretch out your neck and decompress all</v>

2986
02:30:22.161 --> 02:30:24.680
<v Speaker 6>those areas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people have it from bad</v>

2987
02:30:24.681 --> 02:30:26.750
<v Speaker 6>posture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people have from athletics.</v>

2988
02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:29.630
<v Speaker 6>I got it from Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from all this,</v>

2989
02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:31.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting your neck yanked on.</v>

2990
02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:32.930
<v Speaker 6>See that thing right there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that lady has.</v>

2991
02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:34.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a shitty one because that one's</v>

2992
02:30:34.641 --> 02:30:37.550
<v Speaker 6>working on a bag of water that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>work with a neck like mine.</v>

2993
02:30:37.610 --> 02:30:39.790
<v Speaker 6>You need,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you need to be able to hang on,</v>

2994
02:30:39.900 --> 02:30:41.790
<v Speaker 6>hang on rhino on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a,</v>

2995
02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:43.340
<v Speaker 6>I have a thing where I go like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just click,</v>

2996
02:30:43.370 --> 02:30:43.910
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>

2997
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:44.450
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>

2998
02:30:44.450 --> 02:30:45.170
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>

2999
02:30:45.170 --> 02:30:49.560
<v Speaker 6>and then I let myself hang from my neck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

3000
02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:52.760
<v Speaker 6>it's just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just like that.</v>

3001
02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:56.360
<v Speaker 6>See how that guy's just sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 6>reading a magazine and you can adjust</v>

3002
02:30:56.361 --> 02:30:56.570
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3003
02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:58.100
<v Speaker 6>So there's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a cord.</v>

3004
02:30:58.120 --> 02:31:01.550
<v Speaker 6>It's tough to see in this photo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's a cord you pull sorta like a</v>

3005
02:31:01.551 --> 02:31:03.270
<v Speaker 6>plunger on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I was old school toilets,</v>

3006
02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:04.220
<v Speaker 6>he pulled that click,</v>
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>

3007
02:31:04.221 --> 02:31:04.671
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>

3008
02:31:04.671 --> 02:31:05.121
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>
<v Speaker 6>click,</v>

3009
02:31:05.121 --> 02:31:06.330
<v Speaker 6>click CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's pulling it right there.</v>

3010
02:31:06.331 --> 02:31:09.800
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you just relax and you just</v>

3011
02:31:09.850 --> 02:31:12.200
<v Speaker 6>gotta learn how to go with it and sort</v>
<v Speaker 6>of relaxed.</v>

3012
02:31:12.201 --> 02:31:15.500
<v Speaker 6>And it feels weird at first because a</v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of pressure but it's pulling your</v>

3013
02:31:15.501 --> 02:31:17.600
<v Speaker 6>neck literally pulling your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can feel.</v>

3014
02:31:17.601 --> 02:31:20.550
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes when I'm really relaxed I feel</v>
<v Speaker 6>like pop.</v>

3015
02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:24.540
<v Speaker 6>I feel like something pop little tissue</v>
<v Speaker 6>separation's in there.</v>

3016
02:31:24.570 --> 02:31:26.820
<v Speaker 6>Does it have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you feel that it's gotten better</v>

3017
02:31:26.930 --> 02:31:28.020
<v Speaker 6>longterm?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

3018
02:31:28.021 --> 02:31:30.480
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it feels like really relaxing,</v>

3019
02:31:30.810 --> 02:31:32.680
<v Speaker 6>like after it's over I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3020
02:31:33.060 --> 02:31:34.620
<v Speaker 6>I feel like it just takes a weight off</v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

3021
02:31:34.621 --> 02:31:36.990
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a tremendous amount.</v>

3022
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:38.690
<v Speaker 6>I think sitting is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These,</v>

3023
02:31:38.720 --> 02:31:42.000
<v Speaker 6>these seats that we're in right now are</v>
<v Speaker 6>exceptional because they're ergonomic</v>

3024
02:31:42.030 --> 02:31:43.950
<v Speaker 6>chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You use them right if you use them.</v>

3025
02:31:43.951 --> 02:31:46.770
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty cautious about sitting up</v>

3026
02:31:46.771 --> 02:31:49.860
<v Speaker 6>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But from back injuries I've been very,</v>

3027
02:31:49.861 --> 02:31:54.180
<v Speaker 6>very cautious about working out all the</v>
<v Speaker 6>muscles around my back,</v>

3028
02:31:54.210 --> 02:31:57.180
<v Speaker 6>which I didn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just worked out and figure those</v>

3029
02:31:57.181 --> 02:31:59.940
<v Speaker 6>things to take care of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now are treat them as like a,</v>

3030
02:32:00.030 --> 02:32:04.140
<v Speaker 6>just like brushing my teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like my spinal column and all those</v>

3031
02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:07.260
<v Speaker 6>supporting muscles in the spine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are huge.</v>

3032
02:32:07.290 --> 02:32:08.760
<v Speaker 6>They need,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they need to be exercised.</v>

3033
02:32:09.150 --> 02:32:12.720
<v Speaker 6>And especially if you do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you guys pack out a lot of weight.</v>

3034
02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:14.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a big one.</v>

3035
02:32:14.520 --> 02:32:19.520
<v Speaker 6>And that's where he feels that</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had SCIATICA.</v>

3036
02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:20.880
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's lower.</v>

3037
02:32:20.881 --> 02:32:22.530
<v Speaker 6>That's a yard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was a different thing.</v>

3038
02:32:22.531 --> 02:32:23.550
<v Speaker 6>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3039
02:32:24.030 --> 02:32:29.030
<v Speaker 6>he knows he liked traces that</v>
<v Speaker 6>to a specific animal that he's packing</v>

3040
02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:32.760
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

3041
02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:35.520
<v Speaker 6>Make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because Sciatica is,</v>

3042
02:32:35.550 --> 02:32:38.490
<v Speaker 6>what's Attica is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is a disc that's bulging,</v>

3043
02:32:38.491 --> 02:32:42.420
<v Speaker 6>meaning the disc,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the soft tissue in between the two hard</v>

3044
02:32:42.421 --> 02:32:47.421
<v Speaker 6>bones is pushing out and it's pressing</v>
<v Speaker 6>up against the nerve and causes pain</v>

3045
02:32:47.521 --> 02:32:51.240
<v Speaker 6>that shoots down your ass and your lower</v>
<v Speaker 6>legs and a lot of people don't even</v>

3046
02:32:51.241 --> 02:32:54.480
<v Speaker 6>recognize it as a lower back issue</v>
<v Speaker 6>because maybe their back is not really</v>

3047
02:32:54.481 --> 02:32:57.480
<v Speaker 6>that painful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the last leg in the ass as painful,</v>

3048
02:32:57.780 --> 02:33:02.190
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a similar issue with my neck where</v>

3049
02:33:02.191 --> 02:33:05.970
<v Speaker 6>it was pushing on my older nerve and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>was getting this elbow pain and I was</v>

3050
02:33:05.971 --> 02:33:06.780
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

3051
02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:10.500
<v Speaker 6>this really hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like down my arm and in the back of my</v>

3052
02:33:10.501 --> 02:33:12.750
<v Speaker 6>tricep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I started getting numbness in</v>

3053
02:33:12.751 --> 02:33:15.240
<v Speaker 6>my fingers and that's when I started</v>
<v Speaker 6>figuring out what was going on.</v>

3054
02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:18.440
<v Speaker 6>Then I went to a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to a chiropractor first,</v>

3055
02:33:18.450 --> 02:33:19.920
<v Speaker 6>which is a fucking giant mistake.</v>

3056
02:33:19.950 --> 02:33:22.650
<v Speaker 6>I spent a year,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but do not believe in chiropractors.</v>

3057
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:27.130
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe in chiropractors at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's 98 percent horseshit.</v>

3058
02:33:27.690 --> 02:33:29.000
<v Speaker 6>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

3059
02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:31.650
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think chiropractors that are</v>

3060
02:33:31.651 --> 02:33:33.900
<v Speaker 6>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they incorporate things that I think are</v>

3061
02:33:33.901 --> 02:33:34.830
<v Speaker 6>beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cold,</v>

3062
02:33:34.831 --> 02:33:37.230
<v Speaker 6>laser massage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of different things.</v>

3063
02:33:37.231 --> 02:33:39.060
<v Speaker 6>But I think that manipulation that they</v>
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>

3064
02:33:39.061 --> 02:33:43.140
<v Speaker 6>unless you have like some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 6>significant scoliosis or something,</v>

3065
02:33:43.141 --> 02:33:45.660
<v Speaker 6>they're attempting to slowly put back</v>
<v Speaker 6>into position.</v>

3066
02:33:46.140 --> 02:33:48.810
<v Speaker 6>I think most of the time it's just</v>
<v Speaker 6>popping your neck and it just feels</v>

3067
02:33:48.811 --> 02:33:51.840
<v Speaker 6>good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I just like in an immediate sense,</v>

3068
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:55.590
<v Speaker 6>I went to a guy that's a very nice guy</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he was trying to tell me that I</v>

3069
02:33:55.591 --> 02:33:58.230
<v Speaker 6>didn't have a bulging disc because he</v>
<v Speaker 6>was pushing down on the top of my head</v>

3070
02:33:58.470 --> 02:34:00.540
<v Speaker 6>and it didn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3071
02:34:00.541 --> 02:34:02.430
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I was listening to him.</v>

3072
02:34:02.490 --> 02:34:05.040
<v Speaker 6>I listened to this guy for like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking year.</v>

3073
02:34:05.070 --> 02:34:07.830
<v Speaker 6>I had treatment with him and I still</v>
<v Speaker 6>have these neck problems and back</v>

3074
02:34:07.831 --> 02:34:09.730
<v Speaker 6>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then finally I got an MRI and</v>

3075
02:34:09.731 --> 02:34:10.021
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3076
02:34:10.021 --> 02:34:13.560
<v Speaker 6>you got a bulging disc.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I remember being angry.</v>

3077
02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:17.530
<v Speaker 6>I remember being angry because I was</v>
<v Speaker 6>angry that I was being treated by who is</v>

3078
02:34:17.531 --> 02:34:20.380
<v Speaker 6>a professional that really didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck they were talking about</v>

3079
02:34:20.470 --> 02:34:23.530
<v Speaker 6>and they were treating something that</v>
<v Speaker 6>was a significant issue that I was</v>

3080
02:34:23.531 --> 02:34:27.640
<v Speaker 6>experiencing a real deterioration of my</v>
<v Speaker 6>function,</v>

3081
02:34:27.970 --> 02:34:31.030
<v Speaker 6>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't able to do Jujitsu correctly.</v>

3082
02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:33.280
<v Speaker 6>There was a lot of a lot of problems</v>
<v Speaker 6>that I was dealing with.</v>

3083
02:34:33.281 --> 02:34:33.821
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3084
02:34:33.821 --> 02:34:35.230
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how to?</v>

3085
02:34:35.410 --> 02:34:38.800
<v Speaker 6>And then I started talking to doctors</v>
<v Speaker 6>about it and when you have a bulging</v>

3086
02:34:38.801 --> 02:34:42.200
<v Speaker 6>disc man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they want to cut you open like like</v>

3087
02:34:42.310 --> 02:34:43.330
<v Speaker 6>European,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jada,</v>

3088
02:34:43.331 --> 02:34:44.420
<v Speaker 6>and you got to golden silence.</v>

3089
02:34:44.450 --> 02:34:47.970
<v Speaker 6>That's a thing that my bros talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>about is the procedure.</v>

3090
02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:52.980
<v Speaker 6>He's very nervous about a procedure that</v>
<v Speaker 6>he could or could not do well for some</v>

3091
02:34:53.171 --> 02:34:56.650
<v Speaker 6>people it's not a bad move depending on</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether or not your brother's willing to</v>

3092
02:34:56.651 --> 02:35:00.910
<v Speaker 6>do all the different things that can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's got a lot of atrophy already,</v>

3093
02:35:00.970 --> 02:35:03.730
<v Speaker 6>which is a real bad thing is noticeable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3094
02:35:03.970 --> 02:35:06.280
<v Speaker 6>That's not good because that shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't grow back.</v>

3095
02:35:06.370 --> 02:35:10.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bas rutten has it real bad boss route</v>

3096
02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:14.650
<v Speaker 6>and former UFC heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He fucked his neck up and went through a</v>

3097
02:35:14.651 --> 02:35:18.100
<v Speaker 6>bunch of different treatments and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>eventually wound up getting fused.</v>

3098
02:35:18.220 --> 02:35:18.930
<v Speaker 6>He's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3099
02:35:18.930 --> 02:35:23.560
<v Speaker 6>I believe two discs in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe more in his neck fused together</v>

3100
02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:27.280
<v Speaker 6>where he doesn't have any disc tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just screw the bones and together</v>

3101
02:35:27.281 --> 02:35:29.590
<v Speaker 6>and remove the disc tissue and stabilize</v>
<v Speaker 6>the area,</v>

3102
02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:33.910
<v Speaker 6>but his right arm is significantly</v>
<v Speaker 6>smaller than his left arm to the point</v>

3103
02:35:33.911 --> 02:35:36.880
<v Speaker 6>where he calls it baby arm and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 6>former UFC heavyweight champion of the</v>

3104
02:35:36.881 --> 02:35:37.714
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

3105
02:35:37.780 --> 02:35:41.650
<v Speaker 6>And what's ironic is that Sullivan came</v>
<v Speaker 6>from fighting,</v>

3106
02:35:41.651 --> 02:35:45.460
<v Speaker 6>but the last thing came from doing a</v>
<v Speaker 6>stunt on sons of anarchy.</v>

3107
02:35:45.980 --> 02:35:47.910
<v Speaker 6>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in some sort of a fight believer,</v>

3108
02:35:47.930 --> 02:35:50.800
<v Speaker 6>sons of anarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a fight scene where they</v>

3109
02:35:50.801 --> 02:35:53.830
<v Speaker 6>were doing some things and some guy was</v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to like throw them on the</v>

3110
02:35:53.831 --> 02:35:54.880
<v Speaker 6>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He landed on his head.</v>

3111
02:35:55.090 --> 02:35:57.070
<v Speaker 6>So all of that actual flight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you get fucked up,</v>

3112
02:35:57.071 --> 02:36:01.270
<v Speaker 6>pretend fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's bad man.</v>

3113
02:36:01.271 --> 02:36:03.520
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's slowly starting to come back,</v>

3114
02:36:03.521 --> 02:36:08.130
<v Speaker 6>but I've known boss to have this issue</v>
<v Speaker 6>for a we.</v>

3115
02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:13.200
<v Speaker 6>We worked together on a movie before my</v>
<v Speaker 6>seven year old daughter was born and he</v>

3116
02:36:15.131 --> 02:36:19.530
<v Speaker 6>had the issue then and so for seven</v>
<v Speaker 6>years and still now does.</v>

3117
02:36:19.531 --> 02:36:22.240
<v Speaker 6>It still does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's coming back slowly.</v>

3118
02:36:22.510 --> 02:36:25.750
<v Speaker 6>But when I'm talking about is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's some that like the way</v>

3119
02:36:25.751 --> 02:36:29.620
<v Speaker 6>that your nerves regenerate is extremely</v>
<v Speaker 6>slow.</v>

3120
02:36:29.890 --> 02:36:32.920
<v Speaker 6>They can deteriorate quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the attribute can happen pretty</v>

3121
02:36:32.921 --> 02:36:35.620
<v Speaker 6>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the way it regenerates is extremely</v>

3122
02:36:35.621 --> 02:36:37.660
<v Speaker 6>slow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they say once you have atrophy,</v>

3123
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:40.480
<v Speaker 6>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you gotta act on it right away.</v>

3124
02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:43.210
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing they told me when I had</v>
<v Speaker 6>lyme disease.</v>

3125
02:36:43.211 --> 02:36:47.110
<v Speaker 6>Is that</v>
<v Speaker 6>a thing that fucks you up as the nerve</v>

3126
02:36:47.111 --> 02:36:48.010
<v Speaker 6>damage?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3127
02:36:48.370 --> 02:36:51.490
<v Speaker 6>and then people peep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Allow people to think that they always</v>

3128
02:36:51.491 --> 02:36:54.610
<v Speaker 6>have it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Put the like you had a thing.</v>

3129
02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:56.410
<v Speaker 6>It's treated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's gone,</v>

3130
02:36:56.800 --> 02:37:00.070
<v Speaker 6>but it will live with you for so long</v>
<v Speaker 6>because of the damage to your nerves.</v>

3131
02:37:00.071 --> 02:37:03.820
<v Speaker 6>It's just so slow to recuperate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I talked to a doctor about lyme disease</v>

3132
02:37:03.821 --> 02:37:05.800
<v Speaker 6>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not just a lyme disease you're</v>

3133
02:37:05.801 --> 02:37:08.440
<v Speaker 6>dealing with said lyme disease is this</v>
<v Speaker 6>overall term.</v>

3134
02:37:08.740 --> 02:37:12.280
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can get a tick that has 100</v>

3135
02:37:12.281 --> 02:37:14.290
<v Speaker 6>pathogens in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you look at that list of Shit,</v>

3136
02:37:14.291 --> 02:37:14.990
<v Speaker 6>it gets scary.</v>

3137
02:37:14.990 --> 02:37:18.410
<v Speaker 6>It's scary as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they connected it to more jealous.</v>

3138
02:37:18.411 --> 02:37:21.830
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what more gentleman's is?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No challenge challenges a disease that a</v>

3139
02:37:21.831 --> 02:37:25.130
<v Speaker 6>lot of times they think of psychosomatic</v>
<v Speaker 6>because there is some sort of a neuro</v>

3140
02:37:25.131 --> 02:37:29.320
<v Speaker 6>toxicity involved in lyme disease and</v>
<v Speaker 6>all these people that have more jealous,</v>

3141
02:37:29.650 --> 02:37:33.400
<v Speaker 6>a almost without a doubt have lyme</v>
<v Speaker 6>disease as well and wouldn't.</v>

3142
02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:36.800
<v Speaker 6>More gallons is is they have they start</v>
<v Speaker 6>itching it themselves and they think</v>

3143
02:37:36.801 --> 02:37:39.770
<v Speaker 6>they have fibers growing out of their</v>
<v Speaker 6>body and they start hallucinating.</v>

3144
02:37:40.190 --> 02:37:42.800
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most most of the time it's treated as a</v>

3145
02:37:42.801 --> 02:37:45.680
<v Speaker 6>psychosomatic disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they'll get carpet fibers in their</v>

3146
02:37:45.681 --> 02:37:48.920
<v Speaker 6>body and they'll claim these carpet</v>
<v Speaker 6>fibers are coming out of their body and</v>

3147
02:37:48.921 --> 02:37:51.980
<v Speaker 6>growing others jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I talked to this doctor who was the</v>

3148
02:37:51.981 --> 02:37:53.840
<v Speaker 6>only loose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>had person that's sort of explained it</v>

3149
02:37:53.841 --> 02:37:57.440
<v Speaker 6>to me because he's a doctor and he has</v>
<v Speaker 6>more jealous and he was saying,</v>

3150
02:37:57.441 --> 02:38:00.110
<v Speaker 6>and he also has lyme disease and he says</v>
<v Speaker 6>to a person,</v>

3151
02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:01.740
<v Speaker 6>they all have lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3152
02:38:01.890 --> 02:38:05.030
<v Speaker 6>that he's encountered at least,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he was saying that he was looking at</v>

3153
02:38:05.031 --> 02:38:08.480
<v Speaker 6>himself in the mirror and he saw</v>
<v Speaker 6>something moving across the surface of</v>

3154
02:38:08.481 --> 02:38:12.080
<v Speaker 6>his eye and he knew it was a</v>
<v Speaker 6>hallucination and he realized it was a</v>

3155
02:38:12.081 --> 02:38:15.800
<v Speaker 6>hallucination as a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as an educated man and medicine and</v>

3156
02:38:15.801 --> 02:38:18.260
<v Speaker 6>still was seeing it and was freaking</v>
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

3157
02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:19.560
<v Speaker 6>And then that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then he realized,</v>

3158
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:21.500
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's some sort of an extreme</v>

3159
02:38:21.710 --> 02:38:24.980
<v Speaker 6>neurotoxic effect that this stuff has,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

3160
02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:28.490
<v Speaker 6>And then he started doing like some</v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty deep investigation into what</v>

3161
02:38:28.491 --> 02:38:30.110
<v Speaker 6>constitutes lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>

3162
02:38:30.111 --> 02:38:30.950
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not like,</v>

3163
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:32.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3164
02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:34.170
<v Speaker 6>you have herpes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

3165
02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:35.120
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not like that.</v>

3166
02:38:35.390 --> 02:38:39.170
<v Speaker 6>Because like you get bit by something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got a bunch of shit in that cocktail</v>

3167
02:38:39.290 --> 02:38:41.420
<v Speaker 6>of whatever that disgusting tickets</v>
<v Speaker 6>carrying around.</v>

3168
02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:43.100
<v Speaker 6>And it's variable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3169
02:38:43.101 --> 02:38:46.340
<v Speaker 6>you might get it from one part of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>east coast and it has,</v>

3170
02:38:46.341 --> 02:38:47.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>50 things,</v>

3171
02:38:47.271 --> 02:38:49.890
<v Speaker 6>you might get it from another as 13</v>
<v Speaker 6>things and,</v>

3172
02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:53.030
<v Speaker 6>but he's saying with the people that</v>
<v Speaker 6>have more gentleman's what he believes</v>

3173
02:38:53.031 --> 02:38:56.690
<v Speaker 6>is they're suffering from hallucinations</v>
<v Speaker 6>brought on by lyme disease.</v>

3174
02:38:56.970 --> 02:38:58.860
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing about lying that I</v>

3175
02:38:58.861 --> 02:39:00.240
<v Speaker 3>found was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3176
02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:05.290
<v Speaker 3>about medicine and about people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>about mysterious diseases.</v>

3177
02:39:05.340 --> 02:39:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I quit doing it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would get in arguments with people</v>

3178
02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:12.210
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to deal with it and finding</v>

3179
02:39:12.211 --> 02:39:14.360
<v Speaker 3>out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people were telling me like,</v>

3180
02:39:14.410 --> 02:39:15.510
<v Speaker 3>here's what's happening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3181
02:39:15.511 --> 02:39:17.550
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was told that's not how it works</v>

3182
02:39:17.910 --> 02:39:22.610
<v Speaker 3>because there's so much a scent that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring up earlier about a doctor or</v>

3183
02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:23.790
<v Speaker 3>chiropractor telling you the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3184
02:39:24.150 --> 02:39:25.300
<v Speaker 3>There's so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3185
02:39:27.180 --> 02:39:30.150
<v Speaker 3>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>subjectivity in the fucking medical</v>

3186
02:39:30.151 --> 02:39:34.590
<v Speaker 3>world that it's like on one hand all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people were sort of going through</v>

3187
02:39:34.591 --> 02:39:35.424
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3188
02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:38.250
<v Speaker 3>this regimen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this educational regimen,</v>

3189
02:39:38.730 --> 02:39:40.080
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3190
02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:42.090
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's like government</v>
<v Speaker 3>oversight.</v>

3191
02:39:42.540 --> 02:39:44.400
<v Speaker 3>There's certain criteria you need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet,</v>

3192
02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:46.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things needed to pass.</v>

3193
02:39:46.830 --> 02:39:49.680
<v Speaker 3>And you think you already sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>have this unifying effect,</v>

3194
02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:54.210
<v Speaker 3>but people come out on the other end who</v>
<v Speaker 3>have gone through kind of the same</v>

3195

<v Speaker 3>one guy's going to do a surgery and the</v>

3198
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:05.011
<v Speaker 3>next day I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I think Andrew Santina.</v>

3203

<v Speaker 6>He had assistant his balls and he</v>

3204
02:40:21.691 --> 02:40:25.620
<v Speaker 6>thought he had bowel cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>went to a doctor and one doctor told him</v>

3205
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:29.070
<v Speaker 6>that he has excess come stored up in his</v>
<v Speaker 6>balls,</v>

3206
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:33.210
<v Speaker 6>sperm that stored up in his balls and</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what's causing this not.</v>

3207
02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:36.570
<v Speaker 6>He went home to his wife and said he</v>
<v Speaker 6>went to another doctor now he wasn't</v>

3208
02:40:36.571 --> 02:40:40.960
<v Speaker 6>married at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was young man that went head.</v>

3209
02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:44.640
<v Speaker 6>And the second doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who the fuck was that doctor?</v>

3210
02:40:44.641 --> 02:40:48.300
<v Speaker 6>That guy should lose his ability to</v>
<v Speaker 6>practice like you don't get calm stored</v>

3211
02:40:48.301 --> 02:40:52.770
<v Speaker 6>up in your balls and it makes some sort</v>
<v Speaker 6>of a not like he's saying,</v>

3212
02:40:52.890 --> 02:40:56.400
<v Speaker 6>who told you this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A fucking real practicing doctor told</v>

3213
02:40:56.401 --> 02:40:57.234
<v Speaker 6>him that.</v>

3214
02:40:57.630 --> 02:40:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to go into it when I was younger.</v>

3215
02:40:59.820 --> 02:41:04.820
<v Speaker 3>I'd go into it thinking it was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to those like going to get an oil</v>

3216
02:41:04.951 --> 02:41:05.784
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3217
02:41:06.290 --> 02:41:07.970
<v Speaker 3>You could have 20 people in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All good.</v>

3218
02:41:07.980 --> 02:41:11.820
<v Speaker 3>Change your oil like the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we do is we drain it and put new</v>

3219
02:41:11.821 --> 02:41:13.020
<v Speaker 3>shit in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3220
02:41:13.021 --> 02:41:15.120
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I realize that Mr. fucking roll the</v>

3221
02:41:15.121 --> 02:41:17.810
<v Speaker 3>dice man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roll the dice and here's what you're</v>

3222
02:41:17.820 --> 02:41:20.340
<v Speaker 3>going to try to mitigate that by doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>some research,</v>

3223
02:41:20.610 --> 02:41:22.230
<v Speaker 3>but it really is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have the guys going to tell him</v>

3224
02:41:22.231 --> 02:41:23.330
<v Speaker 3>he's not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me the same thing there guys.</v>

3225
02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Gonna tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The big thing</v>

3226
02:41:24.850 --> 02:41:28.030
<v Speaker 6>comes to health and this is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>things that I have a big problem with</v>

3227
02:41:28.031 --> 02:41:32.020
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to anything dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 6>the back is preventative maintenance is</v>

3228
02:41:32.021 --> 02:41:34.870
<v Speaker 6>like one of the most important things</v>
<v Speaker 6>for back health.</v>

3229
02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:38.710
<v Speaker 6>We're sitting in desks all day and most</v>
<v Speaker 6>people are not sitting up straight.</v>

3230
02:41:38.711 --> 02:41:40.060
<v Speaker 6>They're not sitting a book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good thing.</v>

3231
02:41:40.061 --> 02:41:43.360
<v Speaker 6>It's like one of those balls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those Jim balls was big balance balls.</v>

3232
02:41:43.361 --> 02:41:46.270
<v Speaker 6>Those are great to sit on because they</v>
<v Speaker 6>forced you to kind of stabilize yourself</v>

3233
02:41:46.300 --> 02:41:50.650
<v Speaker 6>and use your core muscles or some sort</v>
<v Speaker 6>of an ergonomic chair forcing you to</v>

3234
02:41:50.651 --> 02:41:53.530
<v Speaker 6>stabilize,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but doctor's not telling you,</v>

3235
02:41:53.531 --> 02:41:55.810
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got to take a yoga class a couple</v>

3236
02:41:55.810 --> 02:41:57.580
<v Speaker 6>days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to do something to straighten</v>

3237
02:41:57.581 --> 02:42:00.160
<v Speaker 6>out your posture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to do something to make sure</v>

3238
02:42:00.161 --> 02:42:02.750
<v Speaker 6>that your spine is strong enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>caring about.</v>

3239
02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:05.920
<v Speaker 6>You can't slump forward because you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>putting undue pressure on these</v>

3240
02:42:05.921 --> 02:42:07.090
<v Speaker 6>different portions of your back.</v>

3241
02:42:07.260 --> 02:42:10.150
<v Speaker 6>Is that a significant amount of doctors</v>
<v Speaker 6>are just not fucking telling you that.</v>

3242
02:42:10.220 --> 02:42:10.871
<v Speaker 6>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

3243
02:42:10.871 --> 02:42:13.540
<v Speaker 6>your disc is bulging.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to have to do a disectomy.</v>

3244
02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:16.180
<v Speaker 6>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's outpatient is outpatient procedure,</v>

3245
02:42:16.330 --> 02:42:19.840
<v Speaker 6>but then not telling you is they're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're chopping off of a chunk of this</v>

3246
02:42:19.900 --> 02:42:22.540
<v Speaker 6>finite material.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a small amount of material that</v>

3247
02:42:22.541 --> 02:42:24.700
<v Speaker 6>separates your discs and when they talk</v>
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

3248
02:42:24.701 --> 02:42:27.460
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have disc degenerative disorder,</v>

3249
02:42:27.610 --> 02:42:29.240
<v Speaker 6>it's a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my disc,</v>

3250
02:42:29.270 --> 02:42:31.630
<v Speaker 6>no stop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not a disease.</v>

3251
02:42:31.690 --> 02:42:36.010
<v Speaker 6>What's going on is you're compressing</v>
<v Speaker 6>your body through weightlifting through</v>

3252
02:42:36.370 --> 02:42:40.060
<v Speaker 6>extreme exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your body is slowly getting smushed</v>

3253
02:42:40.061 --> 02:42:42.030
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not allowing it to recover.</v>

3254
02:42:42.031 --> 02:42:44.590
<v Speaker 6>You're not stretching it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not strengthening all those core</v>

3255
02:42:44.591 --> 02:42:46.390
<v Speaker 6>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not giving it some time off.</v>

3256
02:42:46.420 --> 02:42:50.330
<v Speaker 6>You're probably engaging the same</v>
<v Speaker 6>damaging activity over and over again</v>

3257
02:42:50.331 --> 02:42:52.780
<v Speaker 6>and toughing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If there's one thing you should never</v>

3258
02:42:52.781 --> 02:42:54.940
<v Speaker 6>fucking tough out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a back issue.</v>

3259
02:42:55.270 --> 02:42:56.920
<v Speaker 6>Anytime there's something going on with</v>
<v Speaker 6>your back,</v>

3260
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:59.620
<v Speaker 6>don't tough it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't try to work through it,</v>

3261
02:42:59.650 --> 02:43:01.810
<v Speaker 6>just don't because you're going to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 6>it up worse,</v>

3262
02:43:01.811 --> 02:43:04.900
<v Speaker 6>and then it's going to get to a point</v>
<v Speaker 6>where it just does not recover it and</v>

3263
02:43:04.901 --> 02:43:06.250
<v Speaker 6>then you're going to have to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>surgery.</v>

3264
02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:09.810
<v Speaker 3>This is all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is making me super self conscious</v>

3265
02:43:09.811 --> 02:43:12.160
<v Speaker 3>about how I like Larry King,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man</v>

3266
02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:15.880
<v Speaker 6>so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a chair and I used to much more.</v>

3267
02:43:15.881 --> 02:43:19.390
<v Speaker 6>I do try to sit up as much as I can now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but these chairs have been here.</v>

3268
02:43:19.391 --> 02:43:21.970
<v Speaker 6>I went away for a couple of days trying</v>
<v Speaker 6>to sit straighter,</v>

3269
02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:24.940
<v Speaker 6>staring at you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting all nice for three hours.</v>

3270
02:43:25.150 --> 02:43:26.170
<v Speaker 6>I try,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3271
02:43:26.171 --> 02:43:29.410
<v Speaker 6>I didn't always used to be good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to slump quite a bit before I had</v>

3272
02:43:29.411 --> 02:43:30.900
<v Speaker 6>back issues.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to catch up.</v>

3273
02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:34.930
<v Speaker 6>These chairs are called a capisce co</v>
<v Speaker 6>chairs there from Ergo depot.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I've been on,</v>

<v Speaker 6>and there's a pad against your Shin?</v>

3278

<v Speaker 6>I'm guilty because I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3304
02:44:48.190 --> 02:44:50.800
<v Speaker 6>I traffic in those stories and when I</v>
<v Speaker 6>hear those stories I'm like,</v>

3305
02:44:50.801 --> 02:44:51.634
<v Speaker 6>right on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bro.</v>

3306
02:44:53.430 --> 02:44:54.670
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know how hard it is.</v>

3307
02:44:54.671 --> 02:44:58.120
<v Speaker 6>That's why when you've done a pack out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a real packout,</v>

3308
02:44:58.180 --> 02:44:58.601
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3309
02:44:58.601 --> 02:45:01.300
<v Speaker 6>hardest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember when we shot that mule deer</v>

3310
02:45:01.301 --> 02:45:04.210
<v Speaker 6>right there in Montana and we only</v>
<v Speaker 6>walked like,</v>

3311
02:45:04.211 --> 02:45:06.370
<v Speaker 6>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two miles maybe,</v>

3312
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:11.140
<v Speaker 6>and we had the meat split up between</v>
<v Speaker 6>like three of us,</v>

3313
02:45:11.410 --> 02:45:14.740
<v Speaker 6>so it was probably only like 50 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 6>on everybody's back.</v>

3314
02:45:14.741 --> 02:45:16.120
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

3315
02:45:16.390 --> 02:45:19.210
<v Speaker 6>Once he finally got to camp two miles</v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty,</v>

3316
02:45:19.211 --> 02:45:21.220
<v Speaker 6>pretty flat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't that hilly.</v>

3317
02:45:21.370 --> 02:45:22.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're not accustomed to this</v>

3318
02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:24.100
<v Speaker 6>exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3319
02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:26.770
<v Speaker 6>So if you're not accustomed to getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>bit by bs six times a day,</v>

3320
02:45:26.771 --> 02:45:27.760
<v Speaker 6>it's overwhelming.</v>

3321
02:45:27.790 --> 02:45:28.930
<v Speaker 6>So I should tell people that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3322
02:45:28.931 --> 02:45:31.540
<v Speaker 6>the outdoorsman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know a company that you liked their</v>

3323
02:45:31.541 --> 02:45:34.830
<v Speaker 6>products as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They make an atlas trainer now it's a</v>

3324
02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:36.770
<v Speaker 6>salary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were messing with that fucking</v>

3325
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:37.601
<v Speaker 6>grind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You gotta wait,</v>

3326
02:45:37.601 --> 02:45:38.440
<v Speaker 6>you put out?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3327
02:45:38.441 --> 02:45:42.580
<v Speaker 6>It's like an Olympic late slides in post</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it clamps down.</v>

3328
02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:44.200
<v Speaker 6>I thought maybe you rig that up</v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself.</v>

3329
02:45:44.230 --> 02:45:44.861
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3330
02:45:44.861 --> 02:45:46.220
<v Speaker 6>they're selling it now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's their thing.</v>

3331
02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:47.480
<v Speaker 6>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3332
02:45:47.481 --> 02:45:49.780
<v Speaker 6>that I thought it was like you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought you'd gone down to the</v>

3333
02:45:49.781 --> 02:45:53.020
<v Speaker 6>hardware store.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I knew I knew the frame,</v>

3334
02:45:53.021 --> 02:45:55.600
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't recognize the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know guys do it,</v>

3335
02:45:55.601 --> 02:45:59.140
<v Speaker 6>but usually they use sand bags,</v>
<v Speaker 6>put sand bags in their backpack and get</v>

3336
02:45:59.141 --> 02:46:01.090
<v Speaker 6>used to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It makes a big difference and it's an</v>

3337
02:46:01.091 --> 02:46:04.780
<v Speaker 6>incredible work and it doesn't shift.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't shift at all and you really lock</v>

3338
02:46:04.781 --> 02:46:06.520
<v Speaker 6>it in place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't have the risk of like</v>

3339
02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:08.020
<v Speaker 6>tweaking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3340
02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 6>Like it's strength,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not.</v>

3341
02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:12.800
<v Speaker 6>Because when you shits wiggling around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then it like,</v>

3342
02:46:12.980 --> 02:46:14.550
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if it doesn't really make</v>
<v Speaker 6>you stronger,</v>

3343
02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:16.910
<v Speaker 6>it makes you more inclined to like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck something up and yeah.</v>

3344
02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:18.170
<v Speaker 6>To twist funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3345
02:46:18.171 --> 02:46:18.860
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>

3346
02:46:18.860 --> 02:46:21.840
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I just think poor people just please</v>

3347
02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:23.810
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just exercise your back,</v>

3348
02:46:23.811 --> 02:46:26.930
<v Speaker 6>treat it like it's like brushing your</v>
<v Speaker 6>teeth just to take yoga.</v>

3349
02:46:27.210 --> 02:46:30.080
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to take anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just get some youtube videos.</v>

3350
02:46:30.081 --> 02:46:31.970
<v Speaker 6>They're free,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're available everywhere.</v>

3351
02:46:32.510 --> 02:46:34.250
<v Speaker 6>Just do something to strengthen your</v>
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>

3352
02:46:34.251 --> 02:46:36.530
<v Speaker 6>You will prevent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most people don't want to listen to this</v>

3353
02:46:36.531 --> 02:46:38.330
<v Speaker 6>and they're not going to do it because</v>
<v Speaker 6>people are lazy as fuck.</v>

3354
02:46:38.590 --> 02:46:42.950
<v Speaker 6>But you will prevent a host of issues</v>
<v Speaker 6>that people have just by exercising your</v>

3355
02:46:42.951 --> 02:46:44.730
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Simple stuff there.</v>

3356
02:46:44.740 --> 02:46:46.480
<v Speaker 6>There's the atlas trainer right there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3357
02:46:46.490 --> 02:46:48.270
<v Speaker 6>You could do chin ups on if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking savage.</v>

3358
02:46:48.270 --> 02:46:51.890
<v Speaker 6>Like this guy is an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

3359
02:46:52.130 --> 02:46:54.200
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could carry up to 90 pounds that</v>

3360
02:46:54.201 --> 02:46:56.700
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it will take to a pedophile,</v>

3361
02:46:56.720 --> 02:46:59.690
<v Speaker 6>take 100 pound plates to under just</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't know if the plates designed for</v>

3362
02:46:59.691 --> 02:47:01.370
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If the pack or others designed for it,</v>

3363
02:47:01.490 --> 02:47:03.680
<v Speaker 6>that's a good idea to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pull up that sumbitch on.</v>

3364
02:47:03.770 --> 02:47:05.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I use a weight belt,</v>

3365
02:47:06.140 --> 02:47:08.600
<v Speaker 6>put like a belt and a hang a kettle bell</v>
<v Speaker 6>in between my legs.</v>

3366
02:47:08.601 --> 02:47:11.880
<v Speaker 6>I put a 50 pound Kettlebell on a chain</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I do chin ups like that.</v>

3367
02:47:12.150 --> 02:47:15.650
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's hanging where it's right between</v>

3368
02:47:15.651 --> 02:47:18.560
<v Speaker 6>my legs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it's a big leather straps fall</v>

3369
02:47:18.561 --> 02:47:22.370
<v Speaker 6>across your legs in between the straps</v>
<v Speaker 6>on my back or my hip like this.</v>

3370
02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:26.030
<v Speaker 6>And then there's like a chain in between</v>
<v Speaker 6>my legs and the Kettlebell hangs in</v>

3371
02:47:26.031 --> 02:47:28.130
<v Speaker 6>which we might legs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's not getting your scroll at all.</v>

3372
02:47:28.190 --> 02:47:28.641
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3373
02:47:28.641 --> 02:47:29.150
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3374
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:30.980
<v Speaker 6>Swinging low swing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It got gotta,</v>

3375
02:47:30.981 --> 02:47:34.100
<v Speaker 6>make sure your legs are separated so</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not cracking against your knees,</v>

3376
02:47:34.101 --> 02:47:37.520
<v Speaker 6>but you know when you're doing chin ups,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just hanging there.</v>

3377
02:47:37.580 --> 02:47:38.560
<v Speaker 6>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3378
02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:42.770
<v Speaker 6>they say that that's the best way to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>more reps in with your chin ups is not</v>

3379
02:47:42.771 --> 02:47:47.660
<v Speaker 6>to try like 1920.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The actually the best way is do less,</v>

3380
02:47:47.900 --> 02:47:50.450
<v Speaker 6>but with heavy weights do like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3381
02:47:50.510 --> 02:47:54.710
<v Speaker 6>put a weight vest on or hang a 70 pound</v>
<v Speaker 6>kettle bell in between your legs.</v>

3382
02:47:54.830 --> 02:47:58.250
<v Speaker 6>Just that three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But again,</v>

3383
02:47:58.670 --> 02:48:00.680
<v Speaker 6>you run the risk of injury because it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>your.</v>

3384
02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:03.110
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's why I've never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3385
02:48:03.111 --> 02:48:05.300
<v Speaker 6>you're putting a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've got to build yourself up to it,</v>

3386
02:48:05.301 --> 02:48:06.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what also one of the big things</v>

3387
02:48:06.861 --> 02:48:09.410
<v Speaker 6>that happens to people when they start</v>
<v Speaker 6>to exercise and they just try to go too</v>

3388
02:48:09.411 --> 02:48:09.800
<v Speaker 6>hard too.</v>

3389
02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:12.020
<v Speaker 6>They go to full balls is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as I remember,</v>

3390
02:48:12.021 --> 02:48:12.531
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3391
02:48:12.531 --> 02:48:15.710
<v Speaker 6>various times not running for long time</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they'd be like,</v>

3392
02:48:15.711 --> 02:48:16.840
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to start running and growing a</v>

3393
02:48:16.850 --> 02:48:21.850
<v Speaker 6>five mile run.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been running now for just a little</v>

3394
02:48:21.861 --> 02:48:24.800
<v Speaker 6>over a month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got a friend who's a runner and I'm</v>

3395
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.520
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3396
02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:29.090
<v Speaker 6>he's a hobbyist but runs marathons and</v>
<v Speaker 6>he never did before,</v>

3397
02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:32.760
<v Speaker 6>but he was saying</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was talking,</v>

3398
02:48:32.780 --> 02:48:34.010
<v Speaker 6>he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a writer,</v>

3399
02:48:34.011 --> 02:48:36.770
<v Speaker 6>so he's been writing about that a little</v>
<v Speaker 6>bit and he was saying he just wrote a</v>

3400
02:48:36.771 --> 02:48:40.790
<v Speaker 6>piece about</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't run to get in shape.</v>

3401
02:48:40.980 --> 02:48:42.350
<v Speaker 6>You gotta get shaped.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then start running.</v>

3402
02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:45.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a good idea to smart.</v>

3403
02:48:45.580 --> 02:48:47.860
<v Speaker 6>We say there's some steps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's some.</v>

3404
02:48:47.990 --> 02:48:49.970
<v Speaker 6>If you're just like a Slob,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3405
02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:55.480
<v Speaker 6>There's some things you need to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>taken care of before you embark on that</v>

3406
02:48:56.030 --> 02:48:59.570
<v Speaker 6>smart ground.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's groundwork that needs to be done</v>

3407
02:49:00.170 --> 02:49:01.430
<v Speaker 6>to get ready for the run.</v>

3408
02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.980
<v Speaker 6>I talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like to ever discourage people</v>

3409
02:49:03.981 --> 02:49:06.410
<v Speaker 6>from doing Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I talked to a buddy of mine who just</v>

3410
02:49:06.411 --> 02:49:11.411
<v Speaker 6>did Jujitsu from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's 43 years of slaving behavior,</v>

3411
02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:17.010
<v Speaker 6>no exercise whatsoever other than the</v>
<v Speaker 6>occasional pickup basketball game for</v>

3412
02:49:17.011 --> 02:49:19.680
<v Speaker 6>like seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then he started doing Jujitsu and</v>

3413
02:49:19.681 --> 02:49:21.090
<v Speaker 6>immediately his body's falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3414
02:49:21.091 --> 02:49:23.340
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know this is going to be hard for you</v>

3415
02:49:23.341 --> 02:49:25.740
<v Speaker 6>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you really want to do it,</v>
