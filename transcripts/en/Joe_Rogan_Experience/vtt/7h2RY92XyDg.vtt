00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing reason to going on right</v>

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.000
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reasonable consideration of</v>

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>the pros and cons of this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no one's,</v>

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.050
<v Speaker 1>there's no one's stepping in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like the FBI and apple dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's like.</v>

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got it all on one side.</v>

7
00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 2>You've got all on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is,</v>

8
00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could have found a solution here</v>

9
00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 2>somewhere if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

11
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we'd been added on,</v>

12
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although who knows,</v>

13
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple seems to be inclined to draw a</v>

14
00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 2>line under this protection</v>

15
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.240
<v Speaker 1>killer issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Issue is they're trying to get into that</v>

16
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>guy's phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The killer who killed those people in</v>

17
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>San Bernandino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to get into his phone and uh,</v>

18
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>the FBI wants apple to engineer some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a back door.</v>

19
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

20
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 2>here's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy,</v>

21
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>side for had,</v>

22
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.330
<v Speaker 2>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 2>three phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least that we know about,</v>

24
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 2>two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he destroyed.</v>

25
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 2>He completely destroyed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

26
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.991
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

27
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 2>the bureau's been looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did nothing recoverable off those</v>

28
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've asked a lot of people for</v>

29
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:04.480
<v Speaker 2>assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had the other phone,</v>

30
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 2>which was in his truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is his work phone.</v>

31
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 2>It was belonged to the county.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they went to the county bureau,</v>

32
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 2>did they went to the county when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled his phone out of the truck and</v>

33
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to get the information off of</v>

34
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 2>this thing because you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a phone,</v>

35
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 2>a phone nowadays everybody keeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything on their phone.</v>

36
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they uh,</v>

37
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 2>they got the support they pulled and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found out that he had shut off the</v>

38
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 2>function that a uploads data to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cloud,</v>

39
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in October.</v>

40
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 2>And so they were able to get everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to October,</v>

41
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 2>but then that's two full months prior to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attack.</v>

42
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.031
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

43
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 2>well we can't get this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

44
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the phone has,</v>

45
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:42.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this default position where if you try</v>

46
00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.560
<v Speaker 2>the password 10 times in a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

47
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.140
<v Speaker 2>So they took the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bureau took the f,</v>

48
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 2>the phone to apple and this was well</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they had to go and get a court</v>

49
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well before it became public knowledge,</v>

50
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 2>they actually went and had numerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet conversations with apple and they</v>

51
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:59.450
<v Speaker 2>went to apple and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally set,</v>

52
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you can take the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it on your campus,</v>

53
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 2>keep it in your facility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it,</v>

54
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>

55
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever put in your lab,</v>

56
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 2>all we're asking is for you to create a</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems information file that you can</v>

57
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 2>force on that phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one phone and pull the tech,</v>

58
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 2>which then allows you to brute force the</v>
<v Speaker 2>password,</v>

59
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

60
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.070
<v Speaker 2>And get the texts off of there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the data off of there and exists.</v>

61
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 2>And then you can destroy the sif,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the systems information file.</v>

62
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 2>You can keep the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even need to touch it.</v>

63
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.210
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

64
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 2>whatever you just give us the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on the phone.</v>

65
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 2>An apple has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been helpful in the past.</v>

66
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 2>They've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been helpful in the past and</v>

67
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.520
<v Speaker 2>this time for some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever motivation they've decided</v>

68
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 2>to draw a line in the sand and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

69
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not as if they haven't been</v>

70
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:50.720
<v Speaker 2>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's an ongoing dialogue.</v>

71
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.720
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's disingenuous to say that apple is</v>

72
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:54.620
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bulwark for privacy because they</v>

74
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 2>have been in the past and they will</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to be helpful,</v>

75
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I suppose in their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for this particular phone,</v>

76
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>for this one time where they could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>held onto the phone,</v>

77
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 2>created that Sif destroyed the sif at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that moment that they've pulled the</v>

78
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 2>texts officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

79
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 2>That's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now what Tim Cook is saying is not</v>

80
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>that it's creating a backdoor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not saying that he's saying it</v>

81
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 2>creates a precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the precedent was already that if</v>

82
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 2>the bureau goes through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

83
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 2>the process the congress has set and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then goes through that process and gets</v>

84
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 2>a court order and the court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it looks at it and says,</v>

85
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got probable cause you've got</v>

86
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 2>reasonable concern here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

87
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 2>they provide a court order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they go and they make this request</v>

88
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 2>for assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're also talking about a dead guy</v>

89
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 2>talking about a guy who shot 14 paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>was killed,</v>

90
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>14 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

91
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 2>I've heard all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people say to me,</v>

92
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

93
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong,</v>

94
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 2>because I understand fully the</v>
<v Speaker 2>importance of finding the right place on</v>

95
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 2>the pendulum for Security and privacy.</v>

96
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

97
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's an important discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's not,</v>

98
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should always have that</v>

99
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of that is then during the</v>

100
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 2>course of that conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress,</v>

101
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 2>the courts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make those decisions.</v>

102
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:12.870
<v Speaker 2>Where does that pendulum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 2>settle between security and privacy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that settles here.</v>

104
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

105
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Then that's what the bureau or whomever</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to go through to get approval to get</v>

106
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 2>some assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where it stands.</v>

107
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that because now you've got all</v>

108
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 2>three branches of government have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

109
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 2>we think that really we could use this</v>
<v Speaker 2>information off of this phone.</v>

110
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 2>But I've heard everybody say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

111
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 2>why don't they just do the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation?</v>

112
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course they fucking done the rest of</v>

113
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 2>the investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't all the other investigative</v>

114
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 2>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are you're saying in a situation</v>

115
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:42.844
<v Speaker 2>like this?</v>

116
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want them to do 80% of the</v>

117
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you've got,</v>

118
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've got material on here who,</v>

119
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 2>which may lead to operational activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

120
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in finding other people who were</v>

121
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 2>involved or finding people overseas who</v>
<v Speaker 2>were in somehow assisting or whatever it</v>

122
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 2>may be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're saying,</v>

123
00:04:59.051 --> 00:04:59.711
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just know,</v>

124
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of this,</v>

125
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 2>we're not asking for a back door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're asking for that.</v>

126
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one phone,</v>

127
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 2>and that's where this whole thing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really headed south and it's become this</v>

128
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:10.630
<v Speaker 2>idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 2>which is erroneous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I understand what Tim Cook is saying</v>

130
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 2>about the precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although not really,</v>

131
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done this before.</v>

132
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 2>For some reason for this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're drawing a line.</v>

133
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

134
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't they just do the rest of the</v>

135
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 2>investigation and skip this part?</v>

136
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 2>What I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

137
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't follow that logic train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other people,</v>

138
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.581
<v Speaker 2>other people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

139
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 2>why don't they just get it off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>metadata?</v>

140
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's another one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people never believed what the</v>

141
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>government was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the metal fucking data was numbers</v>

142
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 2>and volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

143
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 2>There was no information to be had</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

144
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 2>You could sit in a fucking room full of</v>
<v Speaker 2>metadata and not know what the hell</v>

145
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to go through the court process</v>

146
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 2>to then get that particular numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

147
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

148
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>So here's my question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is what came up with the</v>

149
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Edward Snowden thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were saying that the government is</v>

150
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>monitoring all cell phone data</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly and they can get information</v>

151
00:05:59.511 --> 00:05:59.961
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

152
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>this kind of proves that not to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>But people don't look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

154
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't make that leap back and say,</v>

155
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that was a fallacy.</v>

156
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

157
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>The metadata was sweeping up all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those numbers and volume.</v>

158
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not enough to what end.</v>

159
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so some people would say,</v>

160
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>once they realize what it was actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

161
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:19.221
<v Speaker 1>then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

162
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're just collecting this shit in</v>

163
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not doing any good.</v>

164
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>So they shouldn't even collect that</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

165
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>So what Edward Snowden was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>is essentially just when it pertains to</v>

166
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

167
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 1>he said they're collecting all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that the NSA is collecting</v>

168
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 1>all this information in regards to cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone data,</v>

169
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>the recording,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every phone call,</v>

170
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:42.560
<v Speaker 1>the recording,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these text messages.</v>

171
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

172
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.620
<v Speaker 1>so is that not true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

173
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I frankly,</v>

174
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course nobody's going to,</v>

175
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very emotive,</v>

176
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's all these people out there,</v>

177
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>they're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

178
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the fuck are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about?</v>

179
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

180
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 1>there is nobody right now unless you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrorist,</v>

181
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>a terrorist suspect or a criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

182
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 1>nobody in the government hooks up fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>

183
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to tell you your Dick pics or</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe ladies and Gentlemen,</v>

184
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Dick Pics are absolutely safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jina pictures that you've been floating</v>

185
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:12.040
<v Speaker 1>around telling your boyfriend or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay girls,</v>

186
00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:14.360
<v Speaker 1>it's secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's going to route those around</v>

187
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And are you out for those as a piece of</v>

188
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:19.640
<v Speaker 1>shit and UNAMERICAN in the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really eyeopening thing though</v>

190
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 1>because this case kind of throws that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all into jeopardy cause everybody was</v>

191
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 1>like concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

192
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government can check in on all your</v>

193
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 1>phone calls and all your text messages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this would clearly be a case where</v>

194
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 1>they would want to do that so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

195
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.900
<v Speaker 1>if they can't do it here without the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the judge granting this order and</v>

196
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tell me why did,</v>

197
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 1>there was a recent court order there</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruled in favor of apple.</v>

198
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.990
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was in New York and that was an</v>

199
00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:49.150
<v Speaker 2>interesting case as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably going to set a</v>

200
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:52.780
<v Speaker 2>precedent for maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we'll see cause it's a little bit</v>

201
00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:56.080
<v Speaker 2>different what the judge essentially was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying in that case and it involved,</v>

202
00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

203
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

204
00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 2>narco trafficking investigation that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

205
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.190
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't just for terrorism.</v>

206
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what if this was for Pete</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ophelia,</v>

207
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine a large Pete Ophelia ring.</v>

208
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.740
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

209
00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:12.100
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to catch those fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Douche bags that are involved in that</v>

210
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.770
<v Speaker 2>because privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

211
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I understand the privacy aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but each case has to be looked at on its</v>

212
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:20.800
<v Speaker 2>merits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you say through the courts and</v>

213
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.750
<v Speaker 2>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the congress that these are the</v>

214
00:08:22.751 --> 00:08:25.570
<v Speaker 2>hoops that the bureau has to jump</v>
<v Speaker 2>through and they jumped through those</v>

215
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.340
<v Speaker 2>hoops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then what?</v>

216
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Then it's up to each company to decide</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they want to support it or not.</v>

217
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems strange.</v>

218
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.010
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point being is that the one in New</v>

219
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.390
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the judge essentially was saying,</v>

220
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:35.260
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want us,</v>

221
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.470
<v Speaker 2>you want the courts to make a decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this for something that Congress</v>

222
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:40.620
<v Speaker 2>should really make a decision on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>

223
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.750
<v Speaker 2>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his decision was a pushback against the</v>

224
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:45.060
<v Speaker 2>concept of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

225
00:08:45.061 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bureau was basing this on,</v>

226
00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:49.390
<v Speaker 2>which is a very old law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the judge is saying,</v>

227
00:08:49.391 --> 00:08:52.030
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're relying on a law that's a couple</v>

228
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.280
<v Speaker 2>of hundred years old or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

229
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe instead we should be having this</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at it through the legislature.</v>

230
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 2>And so there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an interesting sort of</v>

231
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 2>legality to his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his response to this,</v>

232
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely,</v>

233
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite apple and,</v>

234
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and sure.</v>

235
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's legislate it.</v>

236
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that just maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

237
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>there are times when from an operational</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

238
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 2>you might want to move a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>quicker than asking Congress to take up,</v>

239
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue and debate it and then maybe</v>

240
00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:25.490
<v Speaker 2>eventually come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe occasionally you're going to</v>

241
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 2>have moments like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the San Bernardino shooting where you've</v>

242
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 2>got a phone in your hand and all you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking apple to do is take possession of</v>

243
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who knows?</v>

244
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Maybe their problem is they're worried</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if they create the sif at that</v>

245
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to steal it from them.</v>

246
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I met one of their employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe they got an internal security</v>

247
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 2>issue because then they can destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bureau is not asking for that phone</v>

248
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:47.010
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not asking for that Sif.</v>

249
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.030
<v Speaker 2>They're not asking them for to do it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>any other,</v>

250
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:49.600
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

251
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Sif is a systems information file.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

252
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 2>So you just force it onto that phone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bypasses the capacity.</v>

253
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Essentially what the court has done is</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a very conservative,</v>

254
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 2>conservative interpretation of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

255
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.910
<v Speaker 2>And basically saying that this needs to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

256
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 2>this is a place with the courts should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be deciding,</v>

257
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 2>we believe you should be taking this to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress.</v>

258
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 2>And so therefore I don't see why you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>legislating or asking us to make a</v>

259
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 2>decision on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

260
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 2>I understand the common person's</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

261
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 2>They don't trust the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole Edward Snowden leaks thing.</v>

262
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's freaking out about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they look at this saying,</v>

263
00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the slippery slope.</v>

264
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing that if the government</v>

265
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:30.930
<v Speaker 2>has access to your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're talking about a fucking mass</v>

266
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 2>murderer and a guy who's already dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have one phone.</v>

267
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

268
00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

269
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.480
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so to say that you're going to only</v>

270
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:42.210
<v Speaker 2>do a limited investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you know you've got</v>

271
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:43.680
<v Speaker 2>potential information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

272
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 2>And your way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on an individual basis,</v>

273
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 2>just one phone only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're asking for.</v>

274
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're asking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But can it be that you could never grant</v>

275
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:53.180
<v Speaker 2>ag?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

276
00:10:53.181 --> 00:10:54.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

277
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't want to get access to that</v>

278
00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 2>guy's fucking data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's where I think going back to</v>

279
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 2>that overriding theme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is nothing resides in the center</v>

280
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

281
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 2>We do have to be concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 2>privacy.</v>

282
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 2>And I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

283
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:08.880
<v Speaker 2>what happens if you don't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Brother.</v>

284
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 2>But there are times when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

285
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 2>operational concerns probably override</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

286
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.940
<v Speaker 2>at least an element of this where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have common pr or a reason to,</v>

287
00:11:19.301 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 2>people can exist in the comment in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle and say,</v>

288
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this occasion,</v>

289
00:11:23.431 --> 00:11:26.370
<v Speaker 2>because you've gone through all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these orders and because we've set up</v>

290
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:27.480
<v Speaker 2>this protection now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

291
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:28.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apple holds onto it and have it,</v>

292
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:29.980
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

293
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way it works.</v>

294
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.310
<v Speaker 2>And so therefore apple comes out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>says there,</v>

295
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.780
<v Speaker 2>and then the misinformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

296
00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:36.690
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to create a backdoor to</v>
<v Speaker 2>our apple devices.</v>

297
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think apple does with their</v>

298
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:42.090
<v Speaker 2>devices that they sell in China?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the Chinese government</v>

299
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.180
<v Speaker 2>would allow apple if someone's got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about this in the media,</v>

300
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 2>do you think the Chinese government</v>
<v Speaker 2>would allow apple to sell devices that</v>

301
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:50.050
<v Speaker 2>they can't get into?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

302
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could ask.</v>

303
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
