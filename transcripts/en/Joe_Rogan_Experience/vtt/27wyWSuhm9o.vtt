<v Speaker 1>Look for him like this is a win win.</v>

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy's.</v>

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>He's theater hulk.</v>

00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Hogan is theater.</v>

7
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Everything is theater.</v>

8
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear the part?</v>

9
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>And as in the questioning about his a 10 inch penis that he said yeah,</v>

10
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>his hogs not as big as the games.</v>

11
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.541
<v Speaker 1>The game,</v>

12
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.830
<v Speaker 1>the game doesn't even have to go to court.</v>

13
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like look bitch know how big my dick is.</v>

14
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's a fake Dick,</v>

15
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>the only thing they could do is they'd have to have some sort of a deposition</v>

16
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:30.984
<v Speaker 1>would pull it out,</v>

17
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.853
<v Speaker 1>shows you,</v>

18
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>but he might be a shower and not a group or a grower and not a shower.</v>

19
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>So like he might have to get worked up to prove it or you're completely right or</v>

20
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:40.441
<v Speaker 1>it's just fake.</v>

21
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>He just grabbed some girls Dildo,</v>

22
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:42.661
<v Speaker 1>put in his shorts,</v>

23
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>tick a photo just to make everyone go home and go to the copy.</v>

24
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.241
<v Speaker 1>You have a ticket.</v>

25
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've seem to connect.</v>

26
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Well that's you though.</v>

27
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>You gotta understand you're unusual and it's not.</v>

28
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>It's connected.</v>

29
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Like the Dick is connected to them.</v>

30
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.201
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at it,</v>

31
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously like it doesn't look like a.</v>

32
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>If it was a Dildo,</v>

33
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>there'd be like a dropoff point at the base and you're like,</v>

34
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

35
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>how exactly is this thing attached?</v>

36
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

37
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't have the ones that you stick onto the side of the wall of the</v>

38
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:07.490
<v Speaker 1>shower maybe just went like on his.</v>

39
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.333
<v Speaker 1>Should be,</v>

40
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>could be like he talked,</v>

41
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>he talked and had that one too.</v>

42
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>But even if he stuck it in,</v>

43
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>it would be going forward.</v>

44
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:15.430
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be off to the side like that.</v>

45
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>When you have spandex,</v>

46
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>he probably just put it to the side.</v>

47
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those long double ended ones.</v>

48
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>You know that the long snake one.</v>

49
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not connected though.</v>

50
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.871
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

51
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:23.071
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

52
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

53
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I stared at his dick very carefully</v>

54
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

55
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>from what I'm seeing it's a real dick and it goes with his body.</v>

56
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

57
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not like Tony Hinchcliffe has a fucking oatmeal box in his pants.</v>

58
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's quaker oats box.</v>

61
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.040

<v Speaker 2>I'll look on the ground.</v>

169
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.370

180
00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:27.540
<v Speaker 2>I would smash people's iphones and just stomp on them.</v>

205
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you'd deal with this?</v>

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.690
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

233
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

234
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.711
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

235
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 1>So I got high one night and when I was at this one place,</v>

236
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>they gave me some edibles.</v>

237
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 1>They gave me a bag of popcorn.</v>

238
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.843
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

239
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to stand out and I just want something to eat.</v>

240
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:02.390
<v Speaker 1>So I opened up the popcorn.</v>

241
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.943
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

242
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Now the next day Valerie is.</v>

243
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>She can't figure out why I'm not waking up.</v>

244
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 1>I slept for 19 hours and she found the wrapper under the bed.</v>

245
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:18.210
<v Speaker 1>She was starting to panic like what happened to it?</v>

246
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I slept till till midnight the next day.</v>

247
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.301
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

248
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:24.380
<v Speaker 1>you wait for so big.</v>

249
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:26.150

250
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I just want some need.</v>

251
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:28.131
<v Speaker 1>It was popcorn.</v>

252
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think they really like Hadley even getting into popcorn.</v>

253
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 1>They make it with the butter,</v>

254
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>the cannabis butter and they pop it in the butter and then they might even</v>

255
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>sprinkle some butter on top of it.</v>

256
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Some cannabis butter and fuck you up.</v>

257
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.513
<v Speaker 1>Take on.</v>

258
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Now they had a benefit of pot benefit at the store and they were handing out</v>

259
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:48.044
<v Speaker 1>those bags,</v>

260
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 1>bags of that popcorn.</v>

261
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking death.</v>

262
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Death.</v>

263
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.011
<v Speaker 1>We'll open it up.</v>

264
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 1>It smells like scared.</v>

265
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Pure fucking weed.</v>

266
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I felt so vulnerable.</v>

267
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I just love how open it is now.</v>

268
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

269
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.231
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

270
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:01.580
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about a.</v>

271
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.640
<v Speaker 1>you're popping them like 10 packs,</v>

272
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 1>but dice not everywhere else.</v>

273

<v Speaker 1>but I have no reason to be in Texas.</v>

277
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't do shows in Texas?</v>

278
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.813
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in it.</v>

279
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

280
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.650

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>You know where you don't know what you do it.</v>

00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>You could perform on the weeds.</v>

319
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>You go bang on the weed.</v>

320
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 1>You could bang more on the wheels.</v>
