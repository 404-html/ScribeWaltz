00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>hundreds by a volcano.</v>

<v Speaker 1>national,</v>

13
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>natural disaster has been identified in a small area of east London.</v>

14
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible,</v>

15

<v Speaker 1>That is amazing shit.</v>

17
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>we don't know too much.</v>

19
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>You know when they,</v>

20
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>when they really talk about history,</v>

21
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>like what we really know about the past,</v>

22
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.181
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

23
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know that much.</v>

24
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

25
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>We just make a fucking assumptions</v>

26
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>and every other week we come up with a new fucking assumption.</v>

27
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how much we're fine,</v>

00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>but that fucking tape a Mars either that looks,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>

46
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>you spend money on scientific innovation for space travel,</v>

47
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with the cream of the crop of people that are trying to figure</v>

48
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:34.491
<v Speaker 1>out how to manipulate space and matter and transport things and how to,</v>

49
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>

64

<v Speaker 1>You got billions of dollars to go to model.</v>

78
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Give a fuck about eyes.</v>

79
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you get this excited about the wars?</v>

80
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Because that costs a thousand times.</v>

81
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.260
<v Speaker 1>Don't get excited about and all that shit because it doesn't have to.</v>

82
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.181
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

83
00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Not that they'd been fighting for 10 years and I'm still paying $5 for fucking</v>

84
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:45.040
<v Speaker 1>gas guy that I didn't do.</v>

85
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>The money we're spending on the war is a billion,</v>

86
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>billion,</v>

87
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.370
<v Speaker 1>billions and billions of dollars.</v>

88
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Every fucking year I'm going to Mars,</v>

89
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>

90
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Mars,</v>

91
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.951
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

92
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:56.850
<v Speaker 1>a positive thing.</v>

93
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:57.684
<v Speaker 1>The Mars thing,</v>

94
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.750
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get innovation out of this project.</v>

95
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I need them in,</v>

96
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>in everything else.</v>

97
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>It's going to eventually lead to who knows what kind of space travel.</v>

98
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Eventually we're going to have</v>

99
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.050
<v Speaker 1>to do with us.</v>

100
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what the problem say is we can't buy shit that got not in the pocket door</v>

101
00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>that this is why I care about it,</v>

102
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:16.070
<v Speaker 1>because it's cool as fuck.</v>

103
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>When that thing lands on Mars and starts taking pictures and sending it through</v>

104
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>the sky and I see a room full of people who've worked on nothing but this for</v>

105
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>years jumping up and down here,</v>

106
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking awesome and I pick up an envelope at the thing.</v>

107
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.380
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

108
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>you're going to jump up and down to somebody landed and mark kick a bunch of</v>

109
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:37.280
<v Speaker 1>fucking gigs that they were white with blue shirts on and shit jumping up and</v>

114
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago we hung out for years and you would talk about the moon landing was</v>

116
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>fake.</v>

117

<v Speaker 1>give me a fucking break.</v>

120
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.560
<v Speaker 1>What are they all connected system</v>

121
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>that goes out of her day?</v>

122
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>It's waste of thought.</v>

123
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>We've got bigger things to fry.</v>

124
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Gas is $5 a tech.</v>

125
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.111
<v Speaker 1>We got this note,</v>

141
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>We know we don't have somebody to both for the next four years and we're worried</v>

142
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>about fucking Mars.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's great land on your fucking time.</v>

00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>but what's going on in God cast is sponsored by ear doctors all across America</v>

197
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:17.171
<v Speaker 1>and the conspiracy copters and hired Julie to make people blow their ear drums</v>

<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

206
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.561
<v Speaker 1>Joey,</v>

207
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I said I support your hubris on us and listen bro,</v>

208
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind.</v>

209
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>We've got to send pre Puerto Ricans.</v>

210
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I would establish a ride.</v>

211
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what needs to be done.</v>

212
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to blow up a fucking building or three black guys establish a wrap.</v>

213
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.253
<v Speaker 1>That's what it needs to be done.</v>

214
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Wore his money to fucking bottom line.</v>

215
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>The square root of war guy is Didas and we've all known that Adidas,</v>

216
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the square root of money.</v>

217
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any DDAS and us going to Mars except taking a bunch of rich people</v>

218
00:06:58.341 --> 00:06:59.430
<v Speaker 1>and charge them to take them to,</v>

219
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.011
<v Speaker 1>there's a quilt.</v>

220
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain to you.</v>

221
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Got To every fucking drone is flying in Pakistan and taken out al Qaeda.</v>

222
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.370
<v Speaker 1>If you believe in that shit bills every,</v>

223
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I agreed by scientists and that's beautiful and I'm with you.</v>

224
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>If you want to argue about keeping people safe,</v>

225
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>the best way to keep people safe.</v>

226
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:15.471
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

227
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:15.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a,</v>

228
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that I advocate drones because fuck load of civilians have died</v>

229
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>from the use of drone attack,</v>

230
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>but they eventually get that shit wired to the point where they can kill</v>

231
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 1>everybody they want to kill.</v>

232
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.440
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's the scientists that are involved in making that shit at the</v>

233
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 1>same scientists that are involved in making all sorts of,</v>

234
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I love in spacecraft Aircrafts and loving that.</v>

235
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Then making the technology.</v>

236
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:37.041
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

237
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:37.851
<v Speaker 1>you want to kill somebody?</v>

238
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 1>You make up.</v>

239
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the bullet that don't need a gun for it.</v>

240
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:42.310
<v Speaker 1>I just got to go like business and a hitching.</v>

241
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Your head blows up.</v>

242
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate the scientist,</v>

243
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>but not right now.</v>

244
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Billions of dollars to go to Mars.</v>

245
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>We're only that Joey.</v>

246
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:52.200
<v Speaker 1>That is a fraction of what our military budget.</v>

247
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a title attached fighting for our freedom.</v>

248
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>What does Mars has to do with us?</v>

249
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a Martian going to come back to Vegas,</v>

250
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>so that's a crazy thing to say.</v>

251
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.110
<v Speaker 1>You are sending them it die.</v>

252
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.020
<v Speaker 1>One though.</v>

253
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 1>The military is fighting for our freedom.</v>

254
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Is that why we're in countries that have absolutely nothing to do with and he's,</v>

255
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 1>that's why and we invaded down.</v>

256
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:08.651
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

257
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

258
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.360
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy side.</v>

259
00:08:10.361 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 1>So that's fucking flag brother.</v>

260
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:12.561
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>

261
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 1>We're bad.</v>

262
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 1>We got to kill some much.</v>

263
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:16.980
<v Speaker 1>You got to break a fucking few omelets stuff to fucking make an album.</v>

264
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 1>You got to break some eggs to make a few amens.</v>

265
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they're doing,</v>

266
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot better than fucking,</v>

267
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>they're selling drugs.</v>

268
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 1>The CIU sells coke at least that make them money,</v>

269
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:25.963
<v Speaker 1>Mars and got another,</v>

270
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.221
<v Speaker 2>here's the big thing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

272
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.540
<v Speaker 2>And every time,</v>

273
00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:31.990
<v Speaker 2>every time they send something to like Mars or the urge do these missions,</v>

274
00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:36.700
<v Speaker 2>they are also doing hundreds of experiments and these experiments are</v>

275
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:38.860
<v Speaker 2>experiments that we can't do,</v>

276
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:39.803
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

277
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:45.390
<v Speaker 2>down on earth where in a lot of these experiments lead to other things that do</v>

278
00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:46.211
<v Speaker 2>help us out,</v>

279
00:08:46.211 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 2>like cures for cancer and fucking time travel.</v>

280
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:48.931
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

281
00:08:48.931 --> 00:08:50.130
<v Speaker 2>let's get the cool listen,</v>

282
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 2>judge,</v>

283
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.880
<v Speaker 2>to be a dollar fit's going to be,</v>

284
00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 2>it's going to come a point in time if we follow the path that we're on now where</v>

285
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 1>we might not be living on this fucking planet anymore,</v>

286
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.370
<v Speaker 1>we're human beings might pollute this motherfucker.</v>

287
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>The point where we're going to want to escape and what they're going to do,</v>

288
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>is it going to send shit to Mars,</v>

289
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 1>to terraform just like they did in the movie aliens and they're going to put a</v>

290
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:12.540
<v Speaker 1>fucking fake atmosphere on Mars and that's going to bear a little escape colony.</v>

291
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

292
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask you the question?</v>

293
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

294
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>what's he got to do with us?</v>

295
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be dead.</v>

296
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.321
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

297
00:09:18.321 --> 00:09:18.871
<v Speaker 1>He'll be fine.</v>

298
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what else to do it.</v>

299
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm alive right now.</v>

300
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 1>And when something lands on Mars,</v>

301
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I get geeked out.</v>

302
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

303
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to just see that shit.</v>

304
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I get names out.</v>

305
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Looking at the photos.</v>

306
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that,</v>

307
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 1>that land.</v>

308
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Has it ever been seen before?</v>

309
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.481
<v Speaker 1>Is it like,</v>

310
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>is there have been people that have walked on looks like fuck it,</v>

311
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Arizona as well?</v>

312
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

313
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.850
<v Speaker 1>it does look like Arizona,</v>

314
00:09:34.851 --> 00:09:36.020
<v Speaker 1>but there is,</v>

315
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a real theory that's a fascinating theory that Mars used to inhabit life</v>

316
00:09:41.171 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 1>and then it used to had an atmosphere,</v>

317
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>but it was hit by an asteroid.</v>

318
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

319
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons why they want to keep sending things there and get to</v>

320
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:48.211
<v Speaker 1>task.</v>

321
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Because if it was above a planet that supported life like ours,</v>

322
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.160
<v Speaker 1>but then it was hit by an asteroid,</v>

323
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.560
<v Speaker 1>we realized that we've,</v>

324
00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 1>we've had mass extinctions on this planet,</v>

325
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.850
<v Speaker 1>at least two of them that were caused by asteroids,</v>

326
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:00.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of years ago and then 65 million years ago.</v>

328
00:10:02.941 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 1>And they know that there's been some just doozies that have landed,</v>

329
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible that one could land that just kills the whole thing.</v>

330
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:09.571
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap.</v>

331
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:10.321
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you something,</v>

332
