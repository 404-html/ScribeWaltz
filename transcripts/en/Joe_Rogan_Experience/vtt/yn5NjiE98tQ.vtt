<v Speaker 3>looks like Ricky's riding a subway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad,</v>

123
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:49.681
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he just got air freezes going on</v>

124
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:51.314
<v Speaker 3>about how am I brother Tom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loved the outdoors and he loved </v>

125
00:04:54.621 --> 00:04:56.690
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I went on after the breeze,</v>

126
00:04:56.691 --> 00:04:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I go farther.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be,</v>

127
00:04:58.551 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impolite.</v>

128
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.180
<v Speaker 3>But my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my brother liked to kill animals.</v>

129
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.620
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of deer right now in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>woods going,</v>

130
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.270
<v Speaker 4>whoo,</v>

132
00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:14.510

<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when,</v>

<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

199
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.250

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

203
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.850
<v Speaker 3>my mother was sweet because she would </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

204
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 3>only know their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

206
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 3>hello shithead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It would be like low life.</v>

209
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 3>Showed up with a shirt that said </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harley's the best fucked her ass.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And he's like low life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in my house.</v>

211
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.300
<v Speaker 3>So I was a GE and they had turned the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shirt or not.</v>

212
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.143
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I grew up with bikers and it wasn't </v>

213
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 3>until later on I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

214
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:40.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some bikers aren't Rad.</v>

215
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:42.550
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

216
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.410
<v Speaker 3>oh I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like I'm,</v>

217
00:08:44.411 --> 00:08:45.101
<v Speaker 3>I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

218
00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:45.771
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you?</v>

219
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Like you're a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so useless to me.</v>

220
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 3>They're always nice being like cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

221
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 3>And my brother had a lot of clout in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that world.</v>

222
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:53.750
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone was cool.</v>

223
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 3>But then later on I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh some of these guys aren't so awesome.</v>

224
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 2>But so basically bikers are like bears </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the dump.</v>

225
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Like they look cool but stay in the car </v>
<v Speaker 2>or New York case.</v>

226
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.613
<v Speaker 2>I had an idea that I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know and you're not going to go with </v>

227
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it reminds me of a,</v>

228
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.713
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I was reading people's tweets in </v>

229
00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.280

<v Speaker 2>for the next movie.</v>

231
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 2>But there was a movie I wrote that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>even thought of you,</v>

232
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 2>but I know you don't act in everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't even walk on it.</v>

233
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't do it.</v>

234
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 2>But I it is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't do it.</v>

235
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.560

<v Speaker 2>Well I don't know,</v>

236
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's not an alcoholic clown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

237
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

326
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

330
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 3>And growing up in central New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do that,</v>

331
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:54.184
<v Speaker 3>but not here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or my daughter wouldn't allow me to do </v>

332
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:57.304
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would,</v>

333

<v Speaker 3>she just made it really clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

334
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.930
<v Speaker 3>there's just so much fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just,</v>

335
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem worth the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

336
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 3>It's bad here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that you,</v>

337
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:09.440
<v Speaker 3>so you had a maniac brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

338
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 3>so that's a lot of people's perception </v>
<v Speaker 3>of hunters is a hunters are crazy people</v>

339
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:15.580
<v Speaker 3>that just like kimberly was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside.</v>

340
00:13:15.581 --> 00:13:16.414
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

341
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.680
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of people like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

342
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 3>that are hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hunters want to deny,</v>

343
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 3>but my brother also still had his </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethics,</v>

344
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:25.090
<v Speaker 3>like he ate what?</v>

345
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.030
<v Speaker 3>He killed this guy and he's sold at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

346
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:28.631
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

347
00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:29.830
<v Speaker 3>he was a trapper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

348
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just didn't like the man.</v>

349
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one time where he was eluding the</v>

350
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.750
<v Speaker 3>warden and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

351
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.510

<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

352
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 3>it's just all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they took off on a lake,</v>

353
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 3>which wasn't thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

355
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 3>They drove on a lake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took acid,</v>

356
00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.240
<v Speaker 3>and went fishing in the swan because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had these big carpet in there.</v>

357
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.863
<v Speaker 3>So he's tripping balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like a public pond or </v>

358
00:14:05.921 --> 00:14:06.800
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

359
00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like where you'd go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

360
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 3>Take your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the moon night out for the,</v>

361
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember once,</v>

362
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:14.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

363
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.140
<v Speaker 3>what was that guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Mitch.</v>

364
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:22.141
<v Speaker 3>We W I went to an almond brothers </v>
<v Speaker 3>concert when I was like 12 and Mitch had</v>

365
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:28.690
<v Speaker 3>been the nom and he was tripping and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was totally,</v>

366
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.950
<v Speaker 3>he was seeing Charlie in the parking lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>while he's driving the car.</v>

367
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

368
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

369
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 3>So that was my upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

370
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.450
<v Speaker 3>So we got on this from hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

371
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:48.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>

372
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Vegan,</v>

373
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 3>but I have more respect for people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually kill the animal,</v>

374
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.100
<v Speaker 3>which would eat eggs from my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not anymore.</v>

375
00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:58.963
<v Speaker 3>I mean I did for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not like a opposed to other </v>

376
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 3>people doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I actually,</v>

377
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.123
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to kiss your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have respect for people to kill it </v>

378
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 3>because then they're not removed from </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

379
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this weird thing when you just,</v>

380
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 3>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the weird part to me.</v>

381
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.363
<v Speaker 3>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

382
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 3>well it's dark because you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it came from.</v>

383
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:17.864
<v Speaker 3>So that's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it reduces your responsibility and you </v>

384
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 3>don't really have to look into where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>man from.</v>

385
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 3>And then that's where factory farming </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from him because we're,</v>

386
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:30.260
<v Speaker 3>we're sort of ignorant to it.</v>

387
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:35.280
<v Speaker 3>And I grew up eating game venison where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's seven people in the family.</v>

388
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:36.374
<v Speaker 3>So why wouldn't you eat eggs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you don't like the idea of </v>

389
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:41.560
<v Speaker 3>chickens and captivity or you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>them for health reasons.</v>

390
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I just stopped eating m and a it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

391
00:15:45.021 --> 00:15:47.200
<v Speaker 3>I had a heart attack a little bit a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while ago and,</v>

392
00:15:47.201 --> 00:15:50.060
<v Speaker 3>and part of it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got off of that stuff,</v>

393
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my heart's in great shape,</v>

394
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.470
<v Speaker 3>which when I had the heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I wasn't dying.</v>

395
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.910
<v Speaker 3>And I've truly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just recently done in May,</v>

396
00:15:59.911 --> 00:16:01.670
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

397
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.500
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my thoughts weren't like,</v>

398
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.610
<v Speaker 3>oh I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My thought was I'm going to have to lose</v>

399
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was really angry.</v>

400
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like furious over that idea.</v>

401
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.780
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

402
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:15.920
<v Speaker 3>we talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stage,</v>

403
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:16.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>

404
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.203
<v Speaker 3>One of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

405
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] like after a few weeks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking,</v>

406
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 3>an hour after dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was out.</v>

407
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:22.941
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care,</v>

408
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:23.750
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

409
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.583
<v Speaker 3>but a cat was missing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood and that would motivate me </v>

410
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:29.600
<v Speaker 3>to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh to look for the cat.</v>

411
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.180
<v Speaker 3>I was going to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no missing cats.</v>

412
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know was coyote.</v>

413
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.173
<v Speaker 3>But I found a cat that I thought was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cat and then I carried it about maybe a </v>

414
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.730
<v Speaker 3>quarter of a mile back to the telephone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul,</v>

415
00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 3>who's the wrong cat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

416
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:46.370
<v Speaker 3>And I'm still a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all to bring it back.</v>

417
00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:47.151
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause yeah,</v>

418
00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I love animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

419
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.273
<v Speaker 3>so I brought it to the house where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it lived at and then I knocked </v>

420
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:56.330
<v Speaker 3>on this woman's door and I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she opened the door and the cat</v>

421
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:58.310
<v Speaker 3>ran and I swear to God and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman goes,</v>

422
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 3>she looks left and right and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

423
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:02.591
<v Speaker 3>It goes in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

424
00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:04.060
<v Speaker 3>I guess the cat's not going on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

425
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.630
<v Speaker 3>And then I just didn't know you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

426
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I didn't want to go,</v>

427
00:17:10.041 --> 00:17:11.650
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I stole your cash.</v>

428
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Thought the fucking cat knocked on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>

429
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.480
<v Speaker 3>I call bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they have furry little knuckles.</v>

430
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.080
<v Speaker 3>She wouldn't hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well when I let my cat out,</v>

431
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 3>he will me out cause I don't let them </v>
<v Speaker 3>out for long periods of time.</v>

432
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.453
<v Speaker 3>But I'll let him out during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to wander around the yard </v>

433
00:17:27.111 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 3>cause he'll just hang around in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

434
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.740
<v Speaker 3>But I worry about hawks hawks or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

435
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 3>we have coyote and I'm in my back yard </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I live in silver lake.</v>

436
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cartoons are everywhere.</v>

437
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.860
<v Speaker 3>They're all throughout the entire 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>

438
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.580
<v Speaker 3>If there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're interested in the,</v>

439
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.553
<v Speaker 3>the history of the coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an amazing podcast called the </v>

440
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.770
<v Speaker 3>mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's by this Guy Steve,</v>

441
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 3>and he interviews</v>

442
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 5>this Guy Dan Flores,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's a historian,</v>

443
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:53.783
<v Speaker 5>wildlife historian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a professor and he wrote a book </v>

444
00:17:57.151 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 5>recently on coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coyotes were originally,</v>

445
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.153
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>only western animals and they used to </v>

446
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 5>call them prairie wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they used to call them.</v>

447
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:07.950
<v Speaker 5>They're actually a type of wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a small wolf.</v>

448
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.813
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when people started hunting coyotes </v>

449
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:12.324
<v Speaker 5>kit and killing coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then reintroducing gray wolves into </v>

450
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:19.140
<v Speaker 5>like yellowstone park and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 5>areas in Idaho and North America,</v>

451
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.243
<v Speaker 5>that's when the coyote spread across the</v>
<v Speaker 5>entire range of the continental United </v>

452
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 5>States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now there's coyotes in every city in the</v>

453
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>

454
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.263
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's coyotes in the adirondacks in </v>

455
00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:29.634
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>

456
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.710
<v Speaker 5>We'll have more babies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what's crazy.</v>

457
00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.590
<v Speaker 5>Like when you hear coyote screaming at </v>
<v Speaker 5>900,</v>

458
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.153
<v Speaker 5>what they're doing is like roll call </v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently according to this Dan Flores </v>

459
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:40.363
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they call out and when there's less </v>

460
00:18:42.761 --> 00:18:44.410
<v Speaker 5>response,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when one of them is missing,</v>

461
00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.740
<v Speaker 5>it triggers a response in the female to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have larger litters.</v>

462
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.720
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Significantly larger.</v>

463
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.960
<v Speaker 5>That crying is the equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bueller.</v>

464
00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:54.843
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

465
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.193
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they had apparently us a number of </v>

466
00:18:59.501 --> 00:19:02.530
<v Speaker 5>coyotes that they had estimated in </v>
<v Speaker 5>yellowstone.</v>

467
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:03.483
<v Speaker 5>Then they brought in the gray wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the gray wolves are different than </v>

468
00:19:05.921 --> 00:19:06.754
<v Speaker 5>red wolves and a couple other wolves </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are pretty much stet stayed and </v>

469
00:19:10.331 --> 00:19:11.270
<v Speaker 5>steady,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

470
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.450
<v Speaker 5>population numbers in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

471
00:19:13.451 --> 00:19:16.090
<v Speaker 5>when the gray wolves came back in North </v>
<v Speaker 5>America,</v>

472
00:19:16.091 --> 00:19:19.030
<v Speaker 5>they didn't treat coyotes like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like friends.</v>

473
00:19:19.031 --> 00:19:21.730
<v Speaker 5>They killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so when they started killing them as</v>

474
00:19:21.731 --> 00:19:24.370
<v Speaker 5>opposed to interbreeding with them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you've heard of a Koi Wolf,</v>

475
00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:26.830
<v Speaker 5>do you know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big thing on the east coast,</v>

476
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.440
<v Speaker 5>which mostly red wolves and coyotes are </v>
<v Speaker 5>breeding.</v>

477
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:30.423
<v Speaker 5>They creating a larger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>smarter coyote and it's because the </v>

478
00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:35.500
<v Speaker 5>coyote is really our wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when they started doing this,</v>

479
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.363
<v Speaker 5>they killed 50% of the coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The coyote population dropped down to </v>

480
00:19:38.981 --> 00:19:39.814
<v Speaker 5>50%.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then because they have larger </v>

481
00:19:41.501 --> 00:19:42.970
<v Speaker 5>litters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when one of them gets killed,</v>

482
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.720
<v Speaker 5>now it's ramped up in 20 years higher </v>
<v Speaker 5>than it was before.</v>

483
00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:47.860
<v Speaker 5>The reintroduction of the wolves.</v>

484
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

485
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.120
<v Speaker 3>survivor matt and I have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>

486
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.030
<v Speaker 3>they're creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

487
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.990
<v Speaker 3>when you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they move,</v>

488
00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.120
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen when I saw one scale,</v>

489
00:19:59.121 --> 00:19:59.954
<v Speaker 3>a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just climb over and killed one of </v>

490
00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:04.610
<v Speaker 3>my chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw it run over a wall with my chicken</v>

491
00:20:04.611 --> 00:20:06.700
<v Speaker 3>six foot wall and they climb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nothing.</v>

492
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:07.521
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

493
00:20:07.521 --> 00:20:08.354
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

494
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.840
<v Speaker 3>it's like human in the way it walks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Superintelligent.</v>

495
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have to say I as scary as they are</v>

496
00:20:14.961 --> 00:20:15.711
<v Speaker 3>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

497

<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

538
00:21:28.331 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 3>and I have to say that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't like,</v>

539
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:33.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm a prude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

540
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.260
<v Speaker 3>and she's a very sweet person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was like,</v>

541
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 3>I know where she was going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

542
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>

543
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:43.400
<v Speaker 3>she surprised me with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

544
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know was like that.</v>

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any crops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

548
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

549
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.660
<v Speaker 3>So here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

550
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:54.840
<v Speaker 3>I make this joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which drew,</v>

551
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I retired from acting the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People stopped hiring me.</v>

552
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:01.120
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't like to act.</v>

553
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.200
<v Speaker 3>I understand how you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't like it either.</v>

556
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 3>And no one believes you when you say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

557
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:09.034
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think you're just think you're </v>

558
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:12.040
<v Speaker 3>lying and they think I'm lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love directing.</v>

559
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 3>I love writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love being behind the scenes.</v>

560
00:22:13.991 --> 00:22:16.290
<v Speaker 3>I love making stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like doing standup,</v>

561
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.950
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's hard.</v>

562
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.660
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

563
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 3>when I was in movies going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that wasn't acting,</v>

564
00:22:23.261 --> 00:22:24.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I forgot a line,</v>

565
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go.</v>

566
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:28.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know if that was acting,</v>

567
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:30.910
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was like,</v>

568
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

569
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.850
<v Speaker 3>So when she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

570
00:22:33.851 --> 00:22:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I like to be dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that meant now,</v>

571
00:22:35.981 --> 00:22:38.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an acting part,</v>

572

<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to be done and I'm like,</v>

573

<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

574
00:22:45.611 --> 00:22:46.910

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

575
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.490
<v Speaker 3>and this sounds very almost borscht </v>
<v Speaker 3>belt,</v>

576
00:22:51.491 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 3>but I did say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

577
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.880
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been a bad girl.</v>

578
00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:56.530
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

579
00:22:56.531 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I did say that.</v>

583
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:06.520
<v Speaker 3>And then we laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would just rather,</v>

592
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.760
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't get the connection.</v>

593
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean I get where someone could get the</v>
<v Speaker 5>connection.</v>

594
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.750
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to a friend of mine,</v>

595
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.200
<v Speaker 5>my friend Chris Ryan who wrote this book</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sex at dawn,</v>

596
00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:34.560
<v Speaker 5>he's a professor or a phd and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>really interesting guy.</v>

597
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:35.603
<v Speaker 5>And he was talking about where people </v>
<v Speaker 5>get fetishes from and then when you're </v>

598
00:23:38.671 --> 00:23:42.060
<v Speaker 5>sort of imprinted at a young age,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you're going through puberty,</v>

599
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:45.920
<v Speaker 5>sometimes very odd things will happen </v>
<v Speaker 5>and those things will happen.</v>

600
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 5>You'll connect those things because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>happened with you sexually and they sort</v>

601
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 5>of imprint in your system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he used it as a,</v>

602
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:53.474
<v Speaker 5>and as an example of how someone could </v>
<v Speaker 5>get their dick sucked by a guy when </v>

603
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 5>they're like 13 or 14 and not even be </v>
<v Speaker 5>gay,</v>

604
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 5>but really like getting your Dick sucked</v>
<v Speaker 5>by.</v>

605
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 5>Guys like you get turned on by like guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>sucking guys dicks or something.</v>

606
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:09.620
<v Speaker 5>Like you can actually like imprint in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your mind,</v>

607
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.573
<v Speaker 5>but meanwhile you're attracted to women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have this like weird kink for </v>

608
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 5>this one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very strange.</v>

609
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.670
<v Speaker 3>But give me an example of other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

610
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

611
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.250
<v Speaker 3>how's that way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you,</v>

612
00:24:20.251 --> 00:24:22.380
<v Speaker 3>why would you get in the feet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

613
00:24:22.381 --> 00:24:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody rubbed their feet on you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right before you had sex.</v>

614
00:24:25.381 --> 00:24:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Like some girl rubbed her feet on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick and was into it,</v>

615
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just playing around.</v>

616
00:24:29.641 --> 00:24:30.560
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that does,</v>

617
00:24:30.561 --> 00:24:32.130
<v Speaker 3>it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

618
00:24:32.131 --> 00:24:32.964
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure anything can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously there's things going on </v>

619
00:24:35.071 --> 00:24:35.904
<v Speaker 3>between like a person like you or I who </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want to hit anybody with a whip </v>

620
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.870
<v Speaker 3>and someone who's like really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

621
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Also though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

622
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is something different to happen,</v>

623
00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.380
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

624
00:24:47.381 --> 00:24:50.820
<v Speaker 3>that's disgusting and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't do anything for me.</v>

625
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.760
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just takes me out of the game.</v>

626
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:54.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

627
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 3>Why don't I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever want to</v>

628
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.343
<v Speaker 5>associate sex and violence together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think that's a good </v>

629
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:01.480
<v Speaker 5>combination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In My,</v>

630
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 5>my world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like it,</v>

631
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 5>but I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I have a buddy of mine who,</v>

632
00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:06.614
<v Speaker 5>him and his girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they put ball gags on each other and </v>

633
00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:10.100
<v Speaker 5>beat the shit out of each other and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>love each other.</v>

634
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.153
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

635
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't really,</v>

636
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.010
<v Speaker 3>they don't come away marked or anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

637
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.740
<v Speaker 3>but there's some hair Poland and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>smacking around.</v>

638
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

639
00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:22.080
<v Speaker 3>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're a fighter,</v>

640
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.140
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know what I mean?</v>

641
00:25:25.141 --> 00:25:29.820
<v Speaker 3>So it's to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's,</v>

642
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:34.110
<v Speaker 3>it's ruining something you love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

643
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess in that way.</v>

644
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.800
<v Speaker 3>Different things in your mind</v>

645
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.420
<v Speaker 5>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the way I look at that,</v>

646
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't see like that's the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>violence was like,</v>

647
00:25:44.261 --> 00:25:45.011
<v Speaker 5>someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hit me,</v>

648
00:25:45.011 --> 00:25:48.430
<v Speaker 5>I want you to hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that is not martial arts.</v>

649
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.380
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm saying?</v>

650
00:25:50.381 --> 00:25:51.214
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that's not remotely the same </v>

651
00:25:53.081 --> 00:25:53.914
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if it's not even connected with </v>

652
00:25:54.851 --> 00:25:55.684
<v Speaker 5>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want have anything to do with </v>

653
00:25:56.351 --> 00:25:58.810
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the idea of martial arts is someone</v>

654
00:25:58.811 --> 00:26:01.240
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want to be hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're trying to hit them and it becomes</v>

655
00:26:01.241 --> 00:26:03.790
<v Speaker 5>this crazy game with extreme </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequences,</v>

656
00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:07.830
<v Speaker 5>extreme health consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing that's,</v>

657
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.733
<v Speaker 5>that's so different than holding someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>down with a rape joke and just smacking </v>

658
00:26:12.121 --> 00:26:12.954
<v Speaker 5>him in the face over and over again </v>
<v Speaker 5>until they start crying while you're </v>

659
00:26:15.401 --> 00:26:16.234
<v Speaker 5>fucking them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like people are into weird shit like </v>

660
00:26:18.821 --> 00:26:19.654
<v Speaker 5>that and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my brain doesn't understand those </v>

661
00:26:21.731 --> 00:26:23.830
<v Speaker 5>connections,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some people do.</v>

662
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:24.663
<v Speaker 5>Like that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the CBC radio host in Canada that had </v>

663
00:26:28.481 --> 00:26:29.314
<v Speaker 5>all these girls saying that he just was </v>
<v Speaker 5>into beaten him up and he would say he </v>

664
00:26:32.141 --> 00:26:33.970
<v Speaker 5>wants to have rough sex and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought,</v>

665
00:26:33.971 --> 00:26:34.481
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

666
00:26:34.481 --> 00:26:35.314
<v Speaker 5>it'd be a little hair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Poland spank me when he's punching him </v>

667
00:26:37.391 --> 00:26:39.370
<v Speaker 5>in the face and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

668
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.080
<v Speaker 5>I allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

669
00:26:41.081 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 5>I dunno who's apparently he the trial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

670
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 5>They dismissed the case and so now </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to retry him,</v>

671
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 5>I guess under some other case or other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

672
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.080
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

673
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.943
<v Speaker 5>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was some lying apparently by the </v>

674
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:55.494
<v Speaker 5>girls and also they had 5,000 text </v>
<v Speaker 5>messages between the two of them going </v>

675
00:26:59.791 --> 00:27:00.624
<v Speaker 5>back and forth about the details of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>case and what they should say and what </v>

676
00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:05.430
<v Speaker 5>they shouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So obviously there was some collusion.</v>

677
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.270
<v Speaker 5>Obviously there was some deception or </v>
<v Speaker 5>allegedly some deception,</v>

678
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.250
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what the fuck is it?</v>

679
00:27:11.251 --> 00:27:14.010
<v Speaker 5>And this guy was like identified as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>male feminist.</v>

680
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.350
<v Speaker 5>He was like mister soft spook in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

681
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.900
<v Speaker 5>but you're liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's true.</v>

682
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
<v Speaker 5>That's actually a crown drop is this </v>
<v Speaker 5>really recently.</v>

683
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he signed a peace bond in the crown,</v>

684
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:30.450
<v Speaker 5>drops a sexual assault case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>

685
00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.820
<v Speaker 5>What does a peace bond?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some Canadian shit.</v>

686
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:34.763
<v Speaker 5>What does a peace bond click on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>common and critical Cesa first </v>

687
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.120
<v Speaker 5>highlighted up at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

688
00:27:39.121 --> 00:27:39.954
<v Speaker 5>there you go.</v>

689
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.130
<v Speaker 5>What does a peace bond?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're fairly common in criminal cases.</v>

690
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:44.964
<v Speaker 5>Defense lawyer says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that poor guy lost like 10 years of </v>

691
00:27:46.741 --> 00:27:49.830
<v Speaker 5>his life through his whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Peace Bond isn't usual.</v>

692
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:53.580
<v Speaker 5>Is isn't unusual as a way to resolve a </v>
<v Speaker 5>criminal case as a lawyer.</v>

693
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:56.560
<v Speaker 5>In the wake of the news that former CBC </v>
<v Speaker 5>broadcast or John Gomez,</v>

694
00:27:56.561 --> 00:28:00.840
<v Speaker 5>she is expected to sign one to conclude </v>
<v Speaker 5>his second sexual assault case.</v>

695
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.183
<v Speaker 5>A source who did not want to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>identified told CBC News of the case </v>

696
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 5>will not go to trial in June as </v>
<v Speaker 5>previously scheduled.</v>

697
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:07.434
<v Speaker 5>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the charges is expect to be dealt with </v>

698
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Speaker 5>on Wednesday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The incident is alleged to have happened</v>

699
00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:13.980
<v Speaker 5>in 2008 counselors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Counselors,</v>

700
00:28:13.981 --> 00:28:17.010
<v Speaker 5>cases are resolved via a peace bond.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck that means.</v>

701
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.830
<v Speaker 5>A resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does a peace plan?</v>

702
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.610
<v Speaker 5>It's still not saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

703
00:28:20.611 --> 00:28:22.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's an odd dude though,</v>

704
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.570
<v Speaker 5>because he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mister,</v>

705
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.300
<v Speaker 5>Mister liberal classic.</v>

706
00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:27.841
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

707
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:30.190
<v Speaker 5>Those clash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

708
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:31.063
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

709
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

710
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.980
<v Speaker 5>there's those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those guys,</v>

711
00:28:34.981 --> 00:28:38.610
<v Speaker 5>but you know how many of those guys have</v>
<v Speaker 5>rage issues?</v>

712
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That that,</v>

713
00:28:40.351 --> 00:28:43.070
<v Speaker 5>that real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many of that.</v>

714
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:48.410
<v Speaker 5>Folks like these hippie folks and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have this rage.</v>

715
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.780
<v Speaker 5>It's just really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

716
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:52.933
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

717
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.760
<v Speaker 5>well also I find that a lot of guys who </v>
<v Speaker 5>identify as male feminists,</v>

718
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.760
<v Speaker 5>what happened for a lot of them is </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're there.</v>

719
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.310
<v Speaker 5>They had rough childhoods and they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>rejected by women.</v>

720
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.810
<v Speaker 5>So they become this like savior of women</v>
<v Speaker 5>from all these other asshole ish men.</v>

721
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:07.663
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they become the guy that's </v>

722
00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:10.410
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they're womanizers.</v>

723
00:29:10.411 --> 00:29:11.244
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not even that they're womanizers </v>

724
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.013
<v Speaker 5>what they are is they just a guy but </v>
<v Speaker 5>there a weak guy and they're suffering </v>

725
00:29:16.291 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 5>from the trauma of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a friend,</v>

726
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.393
<v Speaker 5>it's not a friend anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I had a friend when I was younger </v>

727
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.860
<v Speaker 5>who had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

728
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.840
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't an attractive guy and he would</v>
<v Speaker 5>have real issues with women,</v>

729
00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:28.470
<v Speaker 5>not like him.</v>

730
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.560
<v Speaker 5>He would get so upset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he started,</v>

731
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.290
<v Speaker 5>over the course of the six or seven </v>
<v Speaker 5>years I knew him,</v>

732
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.513
<v Speaker 5>he started associating women with pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they would reject him and they </v>

733
00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 5>would be mean to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was going all the wrong places,</v>

734
00:29:42.131 --> 00:29:43.680
<v Speaker 5>like going to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

735
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.260
<v Speaker 5>hotspots and getting bottle service and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

736
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.310
<v Speaker 5>and that was the type of people you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>attracting.</v>

737
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.353
<v Speaker 5>And so they just wanted to have his </v>
<v Speaker 5>drinks and not wanna have sex with him </v>

738
00:29:51.971 --> 00:29:56.971
<v Speaker 5>and he would associate women with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with pain and frustration and rejection.</v>

739
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.353
<v Speaker 5>And so he started becoming this angry </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy and I watched this sort of </v>

740
00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:03.130
<v Speaker 5>metamorphosis and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

741
00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:05.240
<v Speaker 5>and I was trying to analyze it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

742
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.930
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to do like the Louis Leakey</v>
<v Speaker 5>anthropology thing.</v>

743
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.033
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to figure out what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>is causing this stress and pain and </v>

744
00:30:12.341 --> 00:30:12.910
<v Speaker 5>anger.</v>

745
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.280
<v Speaker 5>And it's just purely as association </v>
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>

746
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.383
<v Speaker 5>It's like how some people start looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>at Hollywood like Hollywood's all </v>

747
00:30:18.491 --> 00:30:19.350
<v Speaker 5>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

748
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:20.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm tired as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

749
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.260
<v Speaker 5>Well because you keep going to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>auditions and they keep turning it down.</v>

750
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.640
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you just decide,</v>

751
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:26.290
<v Speaker 5>well fuck this place man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's places fake.</v>

752
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:27.483
<v Speaker 5>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you got scooped up when you're 20 </v>

753
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:30.680
<v Speaker 5>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

754
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.340
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would love this place.</v>

755
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.490
<v Speaker 5>It'd be the guy at the red carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would be like the toast of the town,</v>

756
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.473
<v Speaker 5>you'd be so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I think a lot of these guys that </v>

757
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.470
<v Speaker 5>identify as male feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they're just pussies.</v>

758
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.140
<v Speaker 5>And what happened is when they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>young,</v>

759
00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:48.870
<v Speaker 5>they got walked over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got trampled,</v>

760
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.713
<v Speaker 5>and they're trying to figure out what is</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pattern of behavior that I have to </v>

761
00:30:52.991 --> 00:30:53.824
<v Speaker 5>follow for me to separate myself from </v>
<v Speaker 5>these men that have ruined these girls' </v>

762
00:30:57.401 --> 00:30:58.234
<v Speaker 5>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I'll offer myself up as the </v>

763
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 5>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as a feminist,</v>

764
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like it's just really been </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked over.</v>

765
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.230
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

766
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.860
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of things I run into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other guys who,</v>

767
00:31:09.861 --> 00:31:11.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crimmins has it term,</v>

768
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:13.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminized,</v>

769
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.760
<v Speaker 2>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are acting,</v>

770
00:31:16.761 --> 00:31:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll sensitive but still pulling mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

771
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.600
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

772
00:31:20.601 --> 00:31:22.360
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand it.</v>

773
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.680
<v Speaker 5>The same guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same guy.</v>

774
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.170
<v Speaker 5>Different Hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

775
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.170
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

776
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Feminizing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

777
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.590
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

778
00:31:31.591 --> 00:31:33.140
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist,</v>

779
00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:33.781
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

780
00:31:33.781 --> 00:31:34.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic human rights.</v>

781
00:31:34.981 --> 00:31:37.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

782
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.183
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is that the definition and </v>

783
00:31:40.511 --> 00:31:42.730
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] and those guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

784
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:44.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I questioned there.</v>

785
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.000
<v Speaker 5>Integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

786
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.910
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>men are very difficult in that regard.</v>

787
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.560
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult while they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>sexually viable because they,</v>

788
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:55.480
<v Speaker 5>they're looking for attention,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to score and when they're</v>

789
00:31:55.481 --> 00:31:56.314
<v Speaker 5>trying to score,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they try any sort of combination of </v>

790
00:31:57.941 --> 00:31:58.870
<v Speaker 5>words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

791
00:31:58.871 --> 00:31:59.704
<v Speaker 5>It might be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I met this one guy said he's a </v>

792
00:32:01.151 --> 00:32:03.790
<v Speaker 5>feminist and then he told me he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>polyamorous.</v>

793
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.110
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

794
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.900
<v Speaker 5>you're a pussy hat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I see how,</v>

795
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.570
<v Speaker 5>I just know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't want to control my woman.</v>

796
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to read.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I respect her pleasure,</v>

797
00:32:13.241 --> 00:32:17.470
<v Speaker 5>her right to seek pleasure fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You fucker.</v>

798
00:32:17.471 --> 00:32:21.450
<v Speaker 5>I see you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I respect her,</v>

799
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I uh,</v>

800
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

801
00:32:24.091 --> 00:32:25.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

802
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when the,</v>

803
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.520
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

804
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.890
<v Speaker 5>there's what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when did men start becoming feminists?</v>

805
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.290
<v Speaker 5>Was it Alan Alda?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did he pulled that shit first?</v>

806
00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

807
00:32:35.511 --> 00:32:37.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

808
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seventies,</v>

809
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.690
<v Speaker 5>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just started saying it.</v>

810
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure like Warren Beatty was,</v>

811
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:47.200
<v Speaker 5>even though I guarantee he was such a </v>
<v Speaker 5>pussy.</v>

812
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

813
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:50.370
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee he was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

814
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

815
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 5>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't like the term egalitarian.</v>

816
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:57.050
<v Speaker 5>They think it's a cop out like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>

817
00:32:57.051 --> 00:32:57.351
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

818
00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:58.610
<v Speaker 5>If you really cared about women's </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights,</v>

819
00:32:58.611 --> 00:33:00.230
<v Speaker 5>you'd identify yourself as a feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

820
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:00.840
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

821
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.500
<v Speaker 5>I like humans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like all of them I like,</v>

822
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.480
<v Speaker 5>I like nice women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like Nice Ben.</v>

823
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.120
<v Speaker 5>I liked pink Barbie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously major things,</v>

824
00:33:08.121 --> 00:33:08.831
<v Speaker 5>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

825
00:33:08.831 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

826
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.240
<v Speaker 5>the pay gap is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a,</v>

827
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:12.560
<v Speaker 5>is a real good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's tricky.</v>

828
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.410
<v Speaker 5>You're looking at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of political bullshit,</v>

829
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 5>the actual reality pay gap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very minor.</v>

830
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.760
<v Speaker 5>There's only a few jobs where women </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually do get paid less than men.</v>

831
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.833
<v Speaker 5>What the pay gap is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is overall judging how much money women </v>

832
00:33:28.551 --> 00:33:29.384
<v Speaker 5>make versus how much money men make and </v>
<v Speaker 5>not taking into account what jobs they </v>

833
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:32.660
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

834
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.380
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

835
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:38.380
<v Speaker 5>what jobs men tend to gravitate towards </v>
<v Speaker 5>naturally versus what jobs women tend to</v>

836
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:39.284
<v Speaker 5>gravitate towards naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when they're in the same job with </v>

837
00:33:41.511 --> 00:33:46.400
<v Speaker 5>the same sort of production there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their actual payscale is very similar.</v>

838
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:51.790
<v Speaker 5>It's real tricky man because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>deny that some people that are a certain</v>

839
00:33:52.251 --> 00:33:53.084
<v Speaker 5>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they gravitate towards certain </v>

840
00:33:54.501 --> 00:33:57.410
<v Speaker 5>occupations and those occupations might </v>
<v Speaker 5>have higher risk,</v>

841
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.740
<v Speaker 5>they might have a higher pay ceilings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

842
00:34:00.741 --> 00:34:01.574
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of variables and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to take into account women taking </v>

843
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:06.860
<v Speaker 5>time off for raising children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for being pregnant,</v>

844
00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 5>all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having babies,</v>

845
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:09.314
<v Speaker 5>maternity leave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That all gets factored in when you're </v>

846
00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:15.170
<v Speaker 5>talking about how much time or how much </v>
<v Speaker 5>money people actually make.</v>

847
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.273
<v Speaker 5>So if you say women should be paid </v>
<v Speaker 5>maternity leave and they should get x </v>

848
00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:21.734
<v Speaker 5>amount of money from a corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're dealing with a totally </v>

849
00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:23.810
<v Speaker 5>different argument.</v>

850
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 5>And if you do that then the pay scale </v>
<v Speaker 5>changes,</v>

851
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.070
<v Speaker 5>then it goes up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you say,</v>

852
00:34:28.071 --> 00:34:32.510
<v Speaker 5>well everybody should get paid for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same exact same exact money for the same</v>

853
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:33.344
<v Speaker 5>job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even still more men want to do certain </v>

854
00:34:36.081 --> 00:34:36.914
<v Speaker 5>jobs in engineering and science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when it comes to like really </v>

855
00:34:39.441 --> 00:34:41.090
<v Speaker 5>dangerous jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

856
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.580
<v Speaker 5>men are much more likely to die on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>job.</v>

857
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.060
<v Speaker 5>Men are much more likely to be murdered </v>
<v Speaker 5>by other men.</v>

858
00:34:47.061 --> 00:34:51.890
<v Speaker 5>There's like a lot of weird shit that </v>
<v Speaker 5>get has to get factored in when you talk</v>

859
00:34:51.891 --> 00:34:52.724
<v Speaker 5>about a payscales and apparently it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those political things where </v>

860
00:34:56.301 --> 00:34:57.134
<v Speaker 5>people say it and then I it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then someone corrected me on it and </v>

861
00:35:00.951 --> 00:35:01.784
<v Speaker 5>then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I heard Obama say it because Obama </v>

862
00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:04.034
<v Speaker 5>was talking about the glass ceiling and </v>
<v Speaker 5>how much money and the disparity in </v>

863
00:35:06.201 --> 00:35:06.800
<v Speaker 5>income.</v>

864
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.150
<v Speaker 5>And then I started actually looking into</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

865
00:35:08.151 --> 00:35:08.781
<v Speaker 5>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

866
00:35:08.781 --> 00:35:09.614
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is complicated because it's one of </v>

867
00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:13.100
<v Speaker 5>those things where you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>insensitive.</v>

868
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 5>So you don't want to say that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

869
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:16.640
<v Speaker 5>Women don't get paid any less than men </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

870
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.190
<v Speaker 5>But when you actually do look at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>real numbers,</v>

871
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:23.030
<v Speaker 5>that's where they're getting it from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like there's a hundred lawyers.</v>

872
00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.650
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's use an example about,</v>

873
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.440
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

874
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.273
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

875
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.650
<v Speaker 5>in Showbiz.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause,</v>

876
00:35:27.651 --> 00:35:28.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

877
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.680
<v Speaker 5>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a big difference an actresses and actors</v>

878
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.380
<v Speaker 5>pays.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are there your top actors?</v>

879
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.333
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that can sell the most </v>

880
00:35:38.521 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 5>tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get the most money.</v>

881
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.560
<v Speaker 5>Like Jennifer Lawrence gets paid shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>piles of money.</v>

882
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.513
<v Speaker 5>And there was that thing where she was </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that she was upset that she </v>

883
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:47.250
<v Speaker 5>didn't get as which one is Bradley </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cooper,</v>

884
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.100
<v Speaker 5>but Bradley Cooper was in way more </v>
<v Speaker 5>scenes than her.</v>

885
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 5>He was in way more of the movie and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a bigger star at the time.</v>

886
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:54.923
<v Speaker 5>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's real tricky because of Jennifer </v>

887
00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 5>Lawrence was in a movie with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She get paid way more than you.</v>

888
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be,</v>

889
00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.380
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I probably would pull more money,</v>

890
00:36:04.381 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying,</v>

891
00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:07.993
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if someone is a huge </v>

892
00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:10.310
<v Speaker 1>superstar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

893
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's her name from friends?</v>

894
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Aniston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Aniston in her prime,</v>

895
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:16.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

896
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:17.784
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

897
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.090
<v Speaker 5>the Matt and Mike and Molly Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the girl's name?</v>

898
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.190
<v Speaker 5>Miss Melissa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Melissa McCarthy.</v>

899
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't think she makes more than him?</v>

900
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:26.730
<v Speaker 5>Of course she does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's more popular.</v>

901
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.160
<v Speaker 5>She's more famous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She does these giant movies.</v>

902
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 5>She gets paid tons of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amy Schumer gets paid tons of money.</v>

903
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.340
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to just change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>

904
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I was thinking of back to your </v>

905
00:36:37.251 --> 00:36:40.790
<v Speaker 1>bears and movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was your take on revenue?</v>

906
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

907
00:36:42.621 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Speaker 1>it's all based on an actual true story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

908
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.983
<v Speaker 1>this Guy Steve Rinella from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediator podcast who actually a </v>

909
00:36:48.231 --> 00:36:50.720
<v Speaker 1>historian himself in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me the story,</v>

910
00:36:50.721 --> 00:36:52.790
<v Speaker 1>the actual story where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

911
00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:53.683
<v Speaker 1>they really did leave this guy for dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he really did crawl for a couple of </v>

912
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.330
<v Speaker 1>miles and figured out a way to survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and got to that guy and killed them.</v>

913
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a real true story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

914
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

915
00:37:03.141 --> 00:37:04.160
<v Speaker 1>It's three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

916
00:37:04.161 --> 00:37:04.994
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's actually been relatively </v>

917
00:37:06.261 --> 00:37:09.680
<v Speaker 1>close to a wild bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you make of the scenes?</v>

918
00:37:09.681 --> 00:37:11.900
<v Speaker 1>People do see it looked really </v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic.</v>

919
00:37:11.901 --> 00:37:14.930
<v Speaker 1>People do occasionally survive bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks like that.</v>

920
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.973
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of times the bears are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to protect themselves or they're </v>

921
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:21.470
<v Speaker 1>trying to protect her because you fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

922
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.630
<v Speaker 1>You get to close their cubs that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it.</v>

923
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

924
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:25.543
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about bears is that you may not know </v>

925
00:37:28.251 --> 00:37:29.690
<v Speaker 1>that you're between the cub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

926
00:37:29.691 --> 00:37:31.160
<v Speaker 1>You might not have any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

927
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:35.780
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be super careful and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about you,</v>

928
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

929
00:37:38.901 --> 00:37:40.280
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of risk.</v>

930
00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.980
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last one is no,</v>

931
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:44.270
<v Speaker 1>watch me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm doing.</v>

932
00:37:44.271 --> 00:37:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me try this.</v>

933
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't go where grizzlies are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay with the black bears are like,</v>

934
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.053
<v Speaker 1>if I do see a grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking out of there pretty </v>

935
00:37:51.441 --> 00:37:53.780
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotta be careful,</v>

936
00:37:53.781 --> 00:37:55.370
<v Speaker 1>but there's a certain amount of risk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

937
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Did you see grizzly man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

938
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many times.</v>

939
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I always want to for the bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

940
00:38:01.391 --> 00:38:02.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

941
00:38:02.031 --> 00:38:02.510
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

942
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I was the same thing as I go there.</v>

943
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.113
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting case because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy is obviously mentally allianced </v>

944
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:11.263
<v Speaker 1>willow creek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably more than any other movie </v>

945
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.570
<v Speaker 1>really will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people haven't seen it.</v>

946
00:38:14.571 --> 00:38:15.404
<v Speaker 1>It's Bob's bigfoot movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're going to get back to big </v>

947
00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:18.920
<v Speaker 1>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

948
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:19.763
<v Speaker 1>when Willow Creek came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the middle of my big flip </v>

949
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.450
<v Speaker 1>phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

950
00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.760
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just ending.</v>

951
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.390
<v Speaker 1>And what killed it for me was when I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Scifi show with Duncan trussell and</v>

952
00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:32.600
<v Speaker 1>we went to the Pacific northwest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hung out with a few big foot hunters for</v>

953
00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:34.490
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after a while we're like,</v>

954
00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.413
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

955
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 3>we realized it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a joke about it.</v>

956
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:40.930
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what you don't find.</v>

957
00:38:40.931 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 3>When you go looking for bigfoot black </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

958
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.283
<v Speaker 3>you're more likely to find big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you are black people looking for </v>

959
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:47.674
<v Speaker 3>bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you find is hordes of unfuckable </v>

960
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:53.080
<v Speaker 3>white dudes out camping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

961
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:57.220
<v Speaker 3>this is an undeniable statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to lie.</v>

962
00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.870
<v Speaker 3>That was something I noticed this </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend at the Ohio big foot conference.</v>

963
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Honest to God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

964
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.630
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

965
00:39:04.631 --> 00:39:06.780
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

966
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.380
<v Speaker 3>it was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

967
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:10.363
<v Speaker 3>at one point I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the brothers that they don't </v>

968
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:14.500
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was two guys,</v>

969
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.020
<v Speaker 3>there was two black guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

970
00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:17.660
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

971
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:19.890
<v Speaker 3>they were lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were looking for.</v>

972
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.970
<v Speaker 3>They are looking for a car show.</v>

973
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 3>It's this thing that men do get that </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

974
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I truly was because I shot some stuff,</v>

975
00:39:31.961 --> 00:39:33.400
<v Speaker 3>Megan to document.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

976
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.020
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need some people of color,</v>

977
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:40.090

<v Speaker 3>You have to cast him.</v>

978
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Did you try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you try women?</v>

979
00:39:43.991 --> 00:39:44.824
<v Speaker 3>Did you get any women?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all like the same kind of like </v>

981
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:50.323
<v Speaker 3>what am I favorite makeup?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite interviews was a gal </v>

982
00:39:53.801 --> 00:39:56.140
<v Speaker 3>who was 16 years old and she was quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>

983
00:39:56.141 --> 00:39:57.280
<v Speaker 3>I really loved her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>

984
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:58.201
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

985
00:39:58.201 --> 00:40:00.550
<v Speaker 3>she was my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite interviews,</v>

986
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 3>talk to Les Stroud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should talk to less who I wasn't,</v>

987
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:07.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing it like a definitive big </v>
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>

988
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.350
<v Speaker 3>I want him to do out of short about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>festival,</v>

989
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:14.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's conference and uh,</v>

990
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:16.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the idea.</v>

991
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

992
00:40:17.471 --> 00:40:19.090
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bob Gimlin was there.</v>

993
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

994
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.430
<v Speaker 3>your buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did He,</v>

995
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.030
<v Speaker 3>did you ask him about the story and of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course what it,</v>

996
00:40:24.031 --> 00:40:26.320
<v Speaker 3>what does he say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tells the story,</v>

997
00:40:26.321 --> 00:40:27.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tells it like it actually happened.</v>

998
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.833
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things interesting about him </v>

999
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:30.964
<v Speaker 3>is that he talks about the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time he actually got to see big foot </v>

1000
00:40:34.061 --> 00:40:37.180
<v Speaker 3>versus a Roger Paris and who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>scrambling around with the camera.</v>

1001
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.340
<v Speaker 3>And what'd he say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1002
00:40:39.341 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 3>he was just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1003
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:43.540
<v Speaker 3>he felt that he didn't film a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1004
00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:47.180
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's only 942 of the frame.</v>

1005
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.180
<v Speaker 3>Or he did because he helped the guy get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking suit on.</v>

1007
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.470
<v Speaker 3>So obviously to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:40:56.471 --> 00:40:59.580
<v Speaker 3>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did we talk about the um,</v>

1009
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] no,</v>

1010
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:03.243
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we duck up.</v>

1011
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.500
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But did you the John Landis,</v>

1012
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.680
<v Speaker 3>John Landis though the film director.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about them?</v>

1013
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1014
00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm really sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was up since 4:00 AM,</v>

1015
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:14.390
<v Speaker 3>who was the guy in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1016
00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Argo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

1017
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the movie where John Goodman is</v>

1018
00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:22.810
<v Speaker 3>playing the makeup effects guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe I saw that movie.</v>

1019
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1020
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.450
<v Speaker 3>so that's a real guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1021
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:31.390
<v Speaker 3>he worked too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe we worked with land is yeah,</v>

1022
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 3>John Chambers and he'd worked with land </v>
<v Speaker 3>is and</v>

1023
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was a rumor that John Land is,</v>

1024
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 1>is in the patty suit in the actual big </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot suit itself.</v>

1025
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard.</v>

1026
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.860
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote to John Landis,</v>

1027
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I asked that's not go well.</v>

1028
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.343
<v Speaker 3>I say to my agents because they are how </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's looking for me to try to do </v>

1029
00:41:59.441 --> 00:42:01.240
<v Speaker 3>something that makes money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go,</v>

1030
00:42:01.241 --> 00:42:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got this idea for a TV show.</v>

1031
00:42:03.201 --> 00:42:05.430
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk to John Landis about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what John Landis,</v>

1032
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't have an idea for a TV joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you get me his email?</v>

1033
00:42:07.901 --> 00:42:12.901
<v Speaker 3>So they get me John Landis and email and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write him and spoke play.</v>

1034
00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing an article for magazine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering if you'd like to talk to</v>

1035
00:42:17.921 --> 00:42:22.921
<v Speaker 3>me about this rumor about you possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in the Patterson Gimlin footage.</v>

1036
00:42:24.161 --> 00:42:24.731
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1037
00:42:24.731 --> 00:42:28.300
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a suit playing patty five minutes,</v>

1038
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I can get an answer back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets,</v>

1039
00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.180
<v Speaker 3>how did you get my email?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it starts.</v>

1040
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.033
<v Speaker 3>Who are you writing an article for her </v>
<v Speaker 3>and most certainly not in a big foot </v>

1041
00:42:40.361 --> 00:42:41.194
<v Speaker 3>suit at the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went back and forth and kind of </v>

1042
00:42:44.441 --> 00:42:45.940
<v Speaker 3>calmed him down a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1043
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.330
<v Speaker 1>it's such a bad suit too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad suit.</v>

1044
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:51.840
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

1045
00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 1>he keeps saying it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it about that footage?</v>

1046
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.080
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1047
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:02.890
<v Speaker 1>you know why it's obviously a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1048
00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:03.893
<v Speaker 1>Because it looks like a man in a suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other animal that looks like </v>

1049
00:43:07.381 --> 00:43:09.420
<v Speaker 1>a man in a suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't look at a giraffe and go,</v>

1050
00:43:09.421 --> 00:43:11.370
<v Speaker 1>that looks like a fucking dude in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>giraffe suit.</v>

1051
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.470
<v Speaker 1>But you look at that big foot and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1052
00:43:13.471 --> 00:43:16.890
<v Speaker 1>that looks like a fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's walking like a man.</v>

1053
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:21.150
<v Speaker 1>It has the same sort of stride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just has longer arms because he's got</v>

1054
00:43:21.151 --> 00:43:21.984
<v Speaker 1>football helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder pads or football shoulder pads </v>

1055

1096
00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 1>let's talk again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger Patterson,</v>

1097
00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.940
<v Speaker 1>the guy wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a con man.</v>

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.470
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] man who was the guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to pay for the very camera.</v>

1100
00:45:12.551 --> 00:45:15.110
<v Speaker 1>They used to film big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a known con man.</v>

1101
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Bob Hieronymus should get the video of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Heran.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No blocking around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His footage,</v>

1103
00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:25.760
<v Speaker 1>you never see his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you mean watch?</v>

1104
00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:30.280
<v Speaker 1>His feet are crapped out so it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you the same height as patty,</v>

1105
00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:31.920
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have to.</v>

1106
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:32.933
<v Speaker 1>Thing isn't big there that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimated that thing to be about six </v>

1107
00:45:35.651 --> 00:45:37.360
<v Speaker 1>foot three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big.</v>

1108
00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:39.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1109
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.410
<v Speaker 1>You really think it's real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1131
00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1133
00:46:31.811 --> 00:46:32.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1134
00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying what do I believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes you say</v>

1135
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:37.120
<v Speaker 2>the amount of people that I've talked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

1136
00:46:37.121 --> 00:46:37.954
<v Speaker 2>that I'm looking at him and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's no reason for them to be </v>

1137
00:46:40.601 --> 00:46:42.520
<v Speaker 2>lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

1138
00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.413
<v Speaker 2>it's basically the stories that I hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over where the sincerity I </v>

1139
00:46:46.901 --> 00:46:51.370
<v Speaker 2>don't get if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what the,</v>

1140
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:53.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1141
00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1142
00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this mass thing that I'm,</v>

1143
00:46:57.161 --> 00:46:57.994
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1144
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:59.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1145
00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I've had guys after the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1146
00:47:02.501 --> 00:47:05.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't have like people that come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me and they're almost like,</v>

1147
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:06.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1148
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're trying to get a connection</v>

1149
00:47:08.651 --> 00:47:11.320
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also feel like they're relieved to</v>

1150
00:47:11.321 --> 00:47:12.400
<v Speaker 2>tell someone this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1151
00:47:12.401 --> 00:47:14.200
<v Speaker 2>did they see big foot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1152
00:47:14.201 --> 00:47:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's their imagination and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a lot of these stories,</v>

1153
00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.860
<v Speaker 2>but just the amount of the stories is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating to me.</v>

1154
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.841
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1155
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:22.674
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they've realized </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly recently is that black bears in </v>

1156
00:47:25.621 --> 00:47:28.440
<v Speaker 1>particular tend to walk on their hind </v>
<v Speaker 1>legs a lot.</v>

1157
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot more than anybody ever thought.</v>

1158
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Not only that they and they'll knock a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree down towards you.</v>

1159
00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can walk on there.</v>

1160
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:39.960
<v Speaker 1>They can walk on their hind legs for </v>
<v Speaker 1>great distances and they,</v>

1161
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:42.220
<v Speaker 1>they're incredibly strong and especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big ones.</v>

1162
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1163
00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:48.180
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine shot one the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a hunt in Alaska that was seven foot,</v>

1164
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.670
<v Speaker 1>almost eight foot long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1165
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:52.504
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you a picture of him </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding this fucking thing up and you </v>

1166
00:47:55.091 --> 00:48:00.091
<v Speaker 1>think about this animal standing up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>its hind legs and what,</v>

1167
00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.100
<v Speaker 1>what it would look like if that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>was walking towards you.</v>

1168
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Now my friend John is six foot five and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

1169
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Speaker 1>now that's clearly someone in a suit.</v>

1170
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.401
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1171
00:48:12.401 --> 00:48:12.761
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1172
00:48:12.761 --> 00:48:13.091
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1173
00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:14.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a bear bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1174
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1175
00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1176
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I totally see how enormous that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1177
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:24.424
<v Speaker 1>and I agree that the majority of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who see big foot and eight foot </v>

1178
00:48:30.251 --> 00:48:32.350
<v Speaker 1>long black bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that does stand,</v>

1179
00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:35.680
<v Speaker 1>that just walks around as a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior that people attribute it to.</v>

1180
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Big Food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what they're seeing.</v>

1181
00:48:37.661 --> 00:48:39.940
<v Speaker 1>And also I think you're also dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with woods.</v>

1182
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.630
<v Speaker 1>The Pacific northwest with a sightings </v>
<v Speaker 1>are primarily occurring,</v>

1183
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:44.763
<v Speaker 1>is insanely dense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way I described it when we went up </v>

1184
00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:48.070
<v Speaker 1>to I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been on rain here,</v>

1185
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like cue tips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1186
00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a box of cute tips.</v>

1187
00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.213
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trees look like you can't see 2030 </v>

1188
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:55.330
<v Speaker 1>yards in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>

1189
00:48:55.331 --> 00:48:55.841
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1190
00:48:55.841 --> 00:48:57.430
<v Speaker 1>you can't just treat anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1191
00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:00.370
<v Speaker 1>And so the canopy keeps light from </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in.</v>

1192
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.590
<v Speaker 1>So if you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1193
00:49:02.591 --> 00:49:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the fear that would go through your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

1194
00:49:04.391 --> 00:49:06.550
<v Speaker 1>If you saw a seven foot black bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking on a time,</v>

1195
00:49:06.551 --> 00:49:09.160
<v Speaker 1>legs through the woods and you saw it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>between trees,</v>

1196
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:13.900
<v Speaker 1>your mind would fill in the blanks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>big foot has become this architectural,</v>

1197
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 1>archetypical cultural cultural icon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is something that I,</v>

1198
00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:22.840
<v Speaker 1>not only big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but almost all archetypal characters.</v>

1199
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:23.733
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1200
00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the devil and all these things.</v>

1201
00:49:27.011 --> 00:49:27.844
<v Speaker 1>I am fascinated with this as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as someone who does write screenplays </v>

1202
00:49:32.291 --> 00:49:34.450
<v Speaker 1>and tell stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder,</v>

1203
00:49:34.451 --> 00:49:35.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1204
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.630
<v Speaker 1>what in the subconscious are they </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplying?</v>

1205
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Is it just something is from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1206
00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.760
<v Speaker 1>from our ancestors that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1207
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Then some or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or does it supply,</v>

1208
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:48.160
<v Speaker 1>this is how you told your kids not to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the woods.</v>

1209
00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:49.513
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am fascinated by what these different </v>

1210
00:49:51.731 --> 00:49:54.730
<v Speaker 1>archetypal characters are and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're created,</v>

1211
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 1>if they are created and things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1212
00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was an animal at one time.</v>

1213
00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:02.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was an animal at one time.</v>

1214
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows it's a hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

1215
00:50:04.481 --> 00:50:06.190
<v Speaker 1>There was animal called gigantic pithy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1216
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.120
<v Speaker 1>We all know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1217
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.550
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ingrained in us that,</v>

1218
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:10.384
<v Speaker 1>that our fear of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that thing lived alongside </v>

1219
00:50:12.941 --> 00:50:13.774
<v Speaker 1>people for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think when you talk about like </v>

1220
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:18.760
<v Speaker 1>native American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1221
00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.750
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're their folklore or when they</v>

1222
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:24.070
<v Speaker 1>talking about big foot and they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently they have many,</v>

1223
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:25.870
<v Speaker 1>many words for sasquatch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1224
00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that</v>

1225
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.540
<v Speaker 5>what they're probably doing is passing </v>
<v Speaker 5>on thousands of years of data.</v>

1226
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:33.523
<v Speaker 5>We don't know when the last time </v>
<v Speaker 5>gigantic epiphysis was alive because </v>

1227
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:41.510
<v Speaker 5>they didn't know Jack [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was even an animal until the 1920s,</v>

1228
00:50:41.511 --> 00:50:42.344
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They went to an apothecary shop and </v>

1229
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:45.700
<v Speaker 5>China and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1230
00:50:45.701 --> 00:50:46.534
<v Speaker 5>an anthropologist found a tooth that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't attribute to any other known </v>

1231
00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:50.294
<v Speaker 5>primate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He asked the people where they got it </v>

1232
00:50:51.231 --> 00:50:52.670
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They told them where they got it from.</v>

1233
00:50:52.671 --> 00:50:53.504
<v Speaker 5>They went to the actual area where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>got these bones and they found jawbones </v>

1234
00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.510
<v Speaker 5>that would indicate the animals by </v>
<v Speaker 5>pedal.</v>

1235
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:00.523
<v Speaker 5>And that's where things get really </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting because you're dealing with </v>

1236
00:51:02.241 --> 00:51:07.241
<v Speaker 5>some bipedal enormous animal that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>most likely a at least eight feet tall.</v>

1237
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.910
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a huge eight foot tall primate.</v>

1238
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.983
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know the gorillas are huge and we </v>

1239
00:51:13.491 --> 00:51:14.324
<v Speaker 5>know that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1240
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:15.283
<v Speaker 5>there's the Bondo eight which has this </v>
<v Speaker 5>enormous chimpanzee that has just </v>

1241
00:51:17.751 --> 00:51:20.450
<v Speaker 5>recently been confirmed to live in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Congo.</v>

1242
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:23.350
<v Speaker 5>They have a chimpanzee and the Congo </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like six feet tall,</v>

1243
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:25.760
<v Speaker 5>400 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so enormous champ.</v>

1244
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:28.660
<v Speaker 5>So there are like variables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's V,</v>

1245
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:29.503
<v Speaker 5>there's different kinds of primates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know about the hobbit man and </v>

1246
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:34.730
<v Speaker 5>Flores that lived as recently as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to say,</v>

1247
00:51:34.731 --> 00:51:36.480
<v Speaker 5>14,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1248
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:38.430
<v Speaker 5>that thing that lived on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>

1249
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:43.430
<v Speaker 5>that's fascinating little tiny people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they think also cannibalized humans</v>

1250
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:46.790
<v Speaker 5>and they think that human beings might </v>
<v Speaker 5>have driven them to extinction.</v>

1251
00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:49.430
<v Speaker 5>They use tools.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were like an enemy,</v>

1252
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:53.810
<v Speaker 5>little tiny person thing that killed </v>
<v Speaker 5>people perhaps.</v>

1253
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:54.763
<v Speaker 5>So I think a lot of our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our thoughts about like leprechauns and </v>

1254
00:51:57.471 --> 00:52:00.300
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like a really good healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it does.</v>

1255
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:03.520
<v Speaker 5>It's also people that believe that </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals still exists or that,</v>

1256
00:52:03.521 --> 00:52:04.200
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1257
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.750
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that small creature,</v>

1258
00:52:05.751 --> 00:52:09.620
<v Speaker 5>the Orang deck is a one I think is in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Vietnam.</v>

1259
00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.420
<v Speaker 5>They believe that this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1260
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:14.600
<v Speaker 5>this animal's still exists and people </v>
<v Speaker 5>still have sightings of this.</v>

1261
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.673
<v Speaker 5>And I think that that little little guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>is probably more likely still alive and </v>

1262
00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.510
<v Speaker 5>then the gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1264
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:28.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

1265
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.660
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1266
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.400
<v Speaker 3>for me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1267
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:32.303
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1268
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not copping out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1269
00:52:34.131 --> 00:52:34.964
<v Speaker 3>I do believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also love the whole whole idea of </v>

1270
00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:40.334
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've been in the woods and you </v>

1271
00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:45.590
<v Speaker 3>know you can't see three feet in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of you.</v>

1272
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:49.070
<v Speaker 3>And I love it when I'm out with folks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and theirs,</v>

1273
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 3>they'll hear an owl that sounds like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like an ape screaming.</v>

1274
00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:56.600
<v Speaker 3>And then the man that's as know and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

1275
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Then I hear something else and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

1276
00:52:59.651 --> 00:53:01.010
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds like a coyote.</v>

1277
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.120
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1278
00:53:02.121 --> 00:53:05.540
<v Speaker 3>you know a juvie squat sometime </v>
<v Speaker 3>impersonate other animals,</v>

1279
00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.120
<v Speaker 3>juveniles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>June squatch,</v>

1280
00:53:08.121 --> 00:53:08.954
<v Speaker 3>Juvi squatch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Frank Kelly Andro of a dose of the </v>

1281
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:16.880
<v Speaker 3>sasquatch was a bit from my last special</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I did.</v>

1282
00:53:16.881 --> 00:53:19.440
<v Speaker 3>That was a real conversation I had with </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of these big foot hunters.</v>

1283
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.593
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one time I was walking in the woods and </v>

1284
00:53:22.191 --> 00:53:25.290
<v Speaker 3>I heard this bull frog that was near a </v>
<v Speaker 3>blackberry Bush,</v>

1285
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.573
<v Speaker 3>and I was thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is a bull frog near a blackberry </v>

1286
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:30.804
<v Speaker 3>Bush?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I got home and I realized that </v>

1287
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:37.701
<v Speaker 3>was a squatch and he was dead serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe was just a fucking frog.</v>

1288
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was just a frog in his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to be a sasquatch,</v>

1289
00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:44.544
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to that part of the story that </v>

1290
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:51.670
<v Speaker 3>quick because when you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1291
00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:54.600
<v Speaker 3>it took a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] you go,</v>

1292
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:57.960
<v Speaker 3>have you had any encounters?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that goes,</v>

1293
00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.333
<v Speaker 3>I'm five foot six and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now the date was 1972 and I would like </v>

1294
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:05.343
<v Speaker 3>it had a brand new pair of shoes and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had just broken one lace and what tobby </v>

1295
00:54:08.581 --> 00:54:09.980
<v Speaker 3>other lace up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking to myself,</v>

1296
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:12.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm so upset with the way they're making</v>
<v Speaker 3>these lasers these days.</v>

1297
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:14.000
<v Speaker 3>They've shipped off the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charles,</v>

1298
00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.020
<v Speaker 3>that's neither here nor there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1299
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm on a long backpacking trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever watch the bionic man?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh with big?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No big foot was not in that.</v>

1301
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:25.730

<v Speaker 3>it's never point a to b.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to me it's a microcosm of faith.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the people that see it and </v>

1313
00:54:52.201 --> 00:54:54.180

<v Speaker 3>seen it.</v>

1314
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.930

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1327
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 3>they think that he can sense where </v>
<v Speaker 3>cameras are.</v>

1328
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

1330
00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.413
<v Speaker 3>those are the same folks who believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's travelling and portals to travel </v>

1331
00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.090
<v Speaker 3>some worm holes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1332
00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:49.310
<v Speaker 3>SASQUATCH is interdimensional creature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met many people that can sense when</v>

1333
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.160
<v Speaker 3>a camera's on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>

1334
00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:58.080
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing that I ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What evidence at all,</v>

1335
00:55:58.110 --> 00:55:58.943
<v Speaker 3>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compels you to think it's even possible </v>

1336
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:05.490
<v Speaker 3>that this animal exists besides that </v>
<v Speaker 3>footprint that I have over there.</v>

1337
00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Do you see one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got one of those.</v>

1339
00:56:09.811 --> 00:56:12.000
<v Speaker 3>encounters.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I hate to bum you out.</v>

1341
00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:17.630

<v Speaker 3>Patterson Gimlin track wave.</v>

1342
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:19.463

1366
00:57:12.891 --> 00:57:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1368
00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.440
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is pretty happy with that.</v>

1369
00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:19.333
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we shot that scene it was 3:00 AM </v>

1370
00:57:21.621 --> 00:57:22.454
<v Speaker 3>2:33 AM and I shot it at at uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allows camp between last camp and Bluff </v>

1371
00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:27.613
<v Speaker 3>Creek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I shot it where the footage was </v>

1372
00:57:28.371 --> 00:57:31.220
<v Speaker 3>filmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well and we'd seen a mountain lion.</v>

1373
00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:32.093
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can check to a guy who's seen a </v>

1374
00:57:32.871 --> 00:57:33.591
<v Speaker 3>mountain lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1375
00:57:33.591 --> 00:57:34.690
<v Speaker 3>That's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1376
00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

1377
00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen with Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she too.</v>

1378
00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw one run across the road and that </v>

1379
00:57:39.711 --> 00:57:40.544
<v Speaker 3>was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we saw one in the woods and </v>

1380
00:57:42.801 --> 00:57:43.820
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1381
00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:47.540
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it would have killed us,</v>

1382
00:57:47.541 --> 00:57:50.000
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't want it to because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

1383
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:52.610
<v Speaker 3>any of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were just really close to just got up</v>

1384
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.340
<v Speaker 3>and just like walked away like a house.</v>

1385
00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:55.613
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't worry about people because </v>

1386
00:57:56.551 --> 00:57:59.190
<v Speaker 5>they haven't been hunted in California </v>
<v Speaker 5>since the 90s.</v>

1387
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.760
<v Speaker 5>So all these animals that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiencing,</v>

1388
00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:05.250
<v Speaker 5>they don't view people as nearly as much</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a threat as they used to.</v>

1389
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:08.850
<v Speaker 5>But if you're like an Arizona or places </v>
<v Speaker 5>that have a hunting season,</v>

1390
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.710
<v Speaker 5>you're not gonna see any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>mountain lions.</v>

1391
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:11.573
<v Speaker 5>They see people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get the fuck out of there cause </v>

1392
00:58:12.841 --> 00:58:15.300
<v Speaker 5>they get there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they understand the threat,</v>

1393
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:17.850
<v Speaker 5>and they get used to the threat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they escape and they run away.</v>

1394
00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:19.230
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a perfect example.</v>

1395
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:20.333
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yellowstone people haven't hunted in </v>

1396
00:58:22.771 --> 00:58:25.950
<v Speaker 5>yellowstone and over a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you go to yellowstone,</v>

1397
00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:30.570
<v Speaker 5>you could pull your car up to a herd of </v>
<v Speaker 5>elk and they're right there hanging out,</v>

1398
00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:31.443
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can get out of your car and you </v>

1399
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:35.010
<v Speaker 5>could see them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're in Colorado,</v>

1400
00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:37.410
<v Speaker 5>you're in the mountains and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting and you see an elk.</v>

1401
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.210
<v Speaker 5>They bark and they fucking bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They see you.</v>

1402
00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 5>They go like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they let all the other elk knows,</v>

1403
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:47.700
<v Speaker 5>they recognize the threat and they take </v>
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>

1404
00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:48.301
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1405
00:58:48.301 --> 00:58:51.390
<v Speaker 5>because we don't hunt in California,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't hunt mountain lions.</v>

1406
00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:53.010
<v Speaker 5>Why you never see any deer.</v>

1407
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.540
<v Speaker 3>That was really terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1408
00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:59.210
<v Speaker 3>and we filmed the scene to just film </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1409
00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.210
<v Speaker 3>the Mount Mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1410
00:59:00.211 --> 00:59:02.250
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we film there cause they go,</v>

1411
00:59:02.251 --> 00:59:04.440
<v Speaker 3>where did I go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well let's just go to the left.</v>

1412
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.660
<v Speaker 3>And they go and Bryce Johnson's in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>film,</v>

1413
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:08.970
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't we just get in the car?</v>

1414
00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:11.590
<v Speaker 3>And so he was scared of the mountain and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we said,</v>

1415
00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:12.421
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1416
00:59:12.421 --> 00:59:14.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really big.</v>

1417
00:59:14.401 --> 00:59:16.800
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing I didn't realize it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lion.</v>

1418
00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1419
00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:21.710
<v Speaker 3>it's big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we're filming the scene that,</v>

1420
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1421
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.470
<v Speaker 2>the long scene in the tent and the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>

1422
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:26.720
<v Speaker 2>it's 19 minutes long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that's in the movie,</v>

1423
00:59:26.721 --> 00:59:29.900
<v Speaker 2>the first take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started crying while we were filming.</v>

1424
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's scared of them.</v>

1425
00:59:31.341 --> 00:59:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Outline a was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1426
00:59:32.871 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 2>it was the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1427
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:35.480
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that nature,</v>

1428
00:59:35.481 --> 00:59:38.530
<v Speaker 2>that scene is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and a,</v>

1429
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:39.650
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really good take,</v>

1430
00:59:39.651 --> 00:59:41.990
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think your character would </v>
<v Speaker 2>cry.</v>

1431
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.180
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my character is not crying.</v>

1432
00:59:44.181 --> 00:59:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are we here?</v>

1433
00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:47.450
<v Speaker 2>We could shoot this in a hotel parking </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

1434
00:59:47.451 --> 00:59:50.060
<v Speaker 2>No one knows where the fuck I go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really good.</v>

1435
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Use that intensity in the indices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't cry.</v>

1436
00:59:53.901 --> 00:59:54.734
<v Speaker 2>We're going again.</v>

1437
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aye.</v>

1438
01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Crimmons at the same</v>

1439
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.860
<v Speaker 2>thing with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1440
01:00:02.861 --> 01:00:04.570
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he laughed really hard.</v>

1441
01:00:04.571 --> 01:00:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I think I live a fairly honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

1442
01:00:07.721 --> 01:00:10.420
<v Speaker 2>but when I'm in production mode it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just I'm going to get it done.</v>

1443
01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I have to truly though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and its constraints.</v>

1444
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:18.790
<v Speaker 2>And when we were filming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call me lucky the doc,</v>

1445

1447
01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:26.040
<v Speaker 2>out on the lake and the ice started </v>
<v Speaker 2>cracking and uh,</v>

1448
01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:28.720
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys was from ice truckers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he knew the noise.</v>

1449
01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:29.411
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1450
01:00:29.411 --> 01:00:32.020
<v Speaker 2>we got to get off the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it was like boom,</v>

1451
01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:32.913
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounded like someone tuning and drum </v>

1452
01:00:34.151 --> 01:00:34.984
<v Speaker 2>pill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever,</v>

1454
01:00:35.861 --> 01:00:36.990

1458
01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:44.980
<v Speaker 2>20 feet between each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1459
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:46.023
<v Speaker 2>like we made a line but we were far away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from each other and it went from fat </v>

1460
01:00:49.421 --> 01:00:52.540
<v Speaker 2>guys and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it actually did like a split,</v>

1461
01:00:52.541 --> 01:00:54.700
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then like snow blew up,</v>

<v Speaker 2>through this Kravis cars.</v>

1463

<v Speaker 2>and there's this jetty and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I really am actually right now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on um,</v>

1500
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.070
<v Speaker 3>a couple different things I'm not going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to discuss,</v>

1501
01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:34.590
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things I can discuss is </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing a,</v>

1502
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:35.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1503
01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:39.650
<v Speaker 3>a short doc on the Washington generals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1504
01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.130
<v Speaker 3>the team that played the gloved writers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>

1505
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:44.993
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the team that lost three and a </v>

1506
01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:48.360
<v Speaker 3>half thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was roughly,</v>

1507
01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:52.200
<v Speaker 3>because they played the globe drought </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly in the fake games.</v>

1508
01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:54.780

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1510
01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:59.220
<v Speaker 3>here's what I'm learning is really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like,</v>

1511
01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:01.740
<v Speaker 3>officially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were never told to take a dive,</v>

1512
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.000
<v Speaker 3>but they knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1513
01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:05.710
<v Speaker 3>And then they fucked up once in 71,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'd be like,</v>

1514
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.920

<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

1631
01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.840
<v Speaker 3>it's a universal too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1632
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.000
<v Speaker 3>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got,</v>

1633
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:00.903
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1634
01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.260
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really good.</v>

1635
01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:05.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that I remember that one.</v>

1636
01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it had banana bread.</v>

1637
01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Who did it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1638
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.420
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It blows banana smell on you.</v>

1639
01:08:10.421 --> 01:08:15.421
<v Speaker 3>You blow bananas because it's come full </v>
<v Speaker 3>circle.</v>

1640
01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Let me get back to this big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big foot conflicts.</v>

1641
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:24.670
<v Speaker 3>What makes you think that any of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this stupid fake footprint in front</v>

1642
01:08:25.251 --> 01:08:26.550
<v Speaker 3>of us here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes you,</v>

1643
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:27.590
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1644
01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:31.070
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's impossible.</v>

1645
01:08:31.071 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 3>They can see that American Werewolf in </v>
<v Speaker 3>London than I have out there.</v>

1646
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's,</v>

1647
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:35.773
<v Speaker 3>if that they could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would make you think they couldn't </v>

1648
01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:38.750
<v Speaker 3>do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1649
01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:40.420
<v Speaker 3>thermo ridges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1650
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.450
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

1651
01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.000
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1652
01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:43.853
<v Speaker 3>am I saying it's not impossible because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was people being pulled behind a </v>

1653
01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:47.390
<v Speaker 3>truck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1654
01:08:47.391 --> 01:08:48.530
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1655
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.393
<v Speaker 3>with a rope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the spacing and the feet and then </v>

1656
01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:51.884
<v Speaker 3>you've got enough force because you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to put a lot of pressure and to </v>

1657
01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:55.844
<v Speaker 3>make this.</v>

1658
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:58.850
<v Speaker 3>But here's the weird part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1659
01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.590
<v Speaker 3>and this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is improved,</v>

1660
01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:02.600
<v Speaker 3>but at what I was really a surprise </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1661
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:05.090
<v Speaker 3>cause we made footprints in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1662
01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:07.640
<v Speaker 3>in Willow Creek and did it the way you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would think,</v>

1663
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.533
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carved would put them on your feet </v>

1664
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:15.560
<v Speaker 3>really hard to take that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that second stride.</v>

1665
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:19.640
<v Speaker 3>It's really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like anti a snow shoes to the point</v>

1666
01:09:19.641 --> 01:09:22.550
<v Speaker 3>where I got stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's because I'm a fat ass,</v>

1667
01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:25.090
<v Speaker 3>but we had to get like a stick to get me</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1668
01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.120
<v Speaker 3>It's not saying it's not impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was really way Dif.</v>

1669
01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:33.710
<v Speaker 3>More difficult than I could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fairly difficult.</v>

1670
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:38.090
<v Speaker 3>But still that's the best piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence is just impressions and dirt.</v>

1671
01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:40.700
<v Speaker 3>Just tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a body,</v>

1672
01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:43.210
<v Speaker 3>there's never been a trail cam </v>
<v Speaker 3>photograph of them.</v>

1673
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.053
<v Speaker 3>Mean Hunter's set up trail camp photos </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere now that people have phones </v>

1674
01:09:46.921 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 3>on with cameras on them.</v>

1675
01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:49.543
<v Speaker 3>There's people hiking and hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone has cameras and but yet folks </v>

1676
01:09:53.031 --> 01:09:55.370
<v Speaker 3>who have footage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what footage is any good?</v>

1677
01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.773
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other than that fake footage that we </v>

1678
01:09:57.621 --> 01:10:00.530
<v Speaker 3>watched or what footage is any good </v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1679
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:02.743
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roger Patterson also was Abraham </v>

1680
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Zapruder cause it's the same camera </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he had one.</v>

1681
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.430
<v Speaker 3>He had one thing he did really well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That gigli camera.</v>

1682
01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well when they leveled it out,</v>

1683
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1684
01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.350
<v Speaker 3>it's not compelling at all to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think it's fake.</v>

1685
01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1686
01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.920
<v Speaker 3>but I wish it wasn't greeted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree,</v>

1687
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:29.360
<v Speaker 3>but I wish it wasn't a really do like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want it to be real.</v>

1688
01:10:29.361 --> 01:10:34.361
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my all time favorite myths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you would be thrilled if absolve.</v>

1689
01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Thrilled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that'd be so happy.</v>

1690
01:10:37.101 --> 01:10:39.590
<v Speaker 3>I probably sleep for days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you do about,</v>

1691
01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that,</v>

1692
01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.170
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's weird too.</v>

1693
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.903
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what people are seeing if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not seeing bigfoot because I </v>

1694
01:10:47.271 --> 01:10:48.440
<v Speaker 3>think they're seeing bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1695
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:49.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're seeing bipedal bears </v>

1696
01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:51.573
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or bullshit or the crazy or they're </v>

1697
01:10:53.661 --> 01:10:55.790
<v Speaker 3>making things up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of these people are lonely</v>

1698
01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.400
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an archetypal story.</v>

1699
01:10:58.401 --> 01:11:02.270
<v Speaker 3>It's just fascinated too though about </v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I went to the mosque men,</v>

1700
01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1701
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:04.760
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

1702
01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.110
<v Speaker 3>If it isn't this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1703
01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:08.630
<v Speaker 3>so why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it,</v>

1704
01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:13.100
<v Speaker 3>is it the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're getting ridiculed for coming</v>

1705
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.430
<v Speaker 3>with a story,</v>

1706
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:18.630
<v Speaker 1>why is it like over a hundred actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reports,</v>

1707
01:11:18.631 --> 01:11:19.464
<v Speaker 1>police reports and stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I on this phenomenon where people </v>

1708
01:11:21.841 --> 01:11:22.710
<v Speaker 1>are seeing the month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1709
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:25.170
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it's fake or board,</v>

1710
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 1>but they're in Kentucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meth,</v>

1711
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:28.253
<v Speaker 1>West Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they're out of mind out of the </v>

1712
01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:33.020
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:38.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not there since that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties.</v>

1715
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1716
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:45.050
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what uh,</v>

1717
01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:46.543
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that story there by saying these are </v>

1718
01:11:49.741 --> 01:11:52.170
<v Speaker 1>the wrong questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying by saying no mess.</v>

1719
01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Kind of new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1720
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:56.760
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1721
01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:58.550
<v Speaker 1>what's the right question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1722
01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 1>the right questions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1723
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:01.523
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's wrong questions because </v>

1724
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:08.120
<v Speaker 1>all of this is eye witness testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the absolute worst,</v>

1725
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.250
<v Speaker 1>most unreliable piece of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>

1726
01:12:11.251 --> 01:12:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in awe.</v>

1727
01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:14.970
<v Speaker 1>How many guys on death row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

1728
01:12:14.971 --> 01:12:15.804
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I witnessed when I was in </v>

1729
01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hunting bear.</v>

1730
01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:21.930
<v Speaker 1>The first time I was up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I saw a wolf.</v>

1731
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:23.183
<v Speaker 1>It was a squirrel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for two seconds I thought it was a </v>

1732
01:12:25.321 --> 01:12:26.154
<v Speaker 1>fucking wolf because I saw in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it moving through this incredibly </v>

1733
01:12:29.431 --> 01:12:31.220
<v Speaker 1>dense brush and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

1734
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:32.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a squirrel.</v>

1735
01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:35.550
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was scared.</v>

1736
01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 1>My senses were heightened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking in the wall.</v>

1737
01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:38.963
<v Speaker 1>We'll confer a wolf and because they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit that squirreled didn't </v>

1738
01:12:41.521 --> 01:12:42.354
<v Speaker 1>commit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any crime in your mind starts to feel </v>

1739
01:12:44.311 --> 01:12:45.144
<v Speaker 1>that is Max.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not the wolf that stole my </v>

1740
01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:49.830
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a squirrel.</v>

1741
01:12:49.831 --> 01:12:54.000
<v Speaker 1>You're on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're buying fills in blanks and they I</v>

1742
01:12:54.001 --> 01:12:55.380
<v Speaker 1>believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1743
01:12:55.381 --> 01:12:56.214
<v Speaker 1>it absolutely does happen and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have put suggestions into people's head </v>

1744
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:00.323
<v Speaker 1>and then put them in certain situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're mine actually sees </v>

1745
01:13:03.241 --> 01:13:04.440
<v Speaker 1>things that aren't there.</v>

1746
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Your mind fills in blanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also when you have memories of things,</v>

1747
01:13:08.971 --> 01:13:11.460
<v Speaker 1>if your memory's correspond with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's memories,</v>

1748
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:12.443
<v Speaker 1>you'll adjust your memories to </v>
<v Speaker 1>correspond to an iconic or archetypal </v>

1749
01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.200
<v Speaker 1>type of story that people were passing </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1750
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:20.243
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have a story that emanates</v>
<v Speaker 1>from one particular region and one guy </v>

1751
01:13:23.341 --> 01:13:24.990
<v Speaker 1>shows up at the corner store and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

1752
01:13:24.991 --> 01:13:26.430
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ain't going won't believe this.</v>

1753
01:13:26.431 --> 01:13:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I saw a dude with moth wings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a man who was a moth.</v>

1754
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Like Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about Bob,</v>

1755
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:32.753
<v Speaker 1>he's all mouth man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people started getting crazy </v>

1756
01:13:34.591 --> 01:13:36.720
<v Speaker 1>and they're sitting around drinking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing you know,</v>

1757
01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:38.010
<v Speaker 1>pd saw them off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1758
01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I was coming home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was leaving the bar,</v>

1759
01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.453
<v Speaker 1>I was all mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden I saw a man with </v>

1760
01:13:43.891 --> 01:13:46.140
<v Speaker 1>moth's wings and I stopped thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about my own troubles.</v>

1761
01:13:46.141 --> 01:13:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1762
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:49.320
<v Speaker 1>this might be a demonic area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got pitch.</v>

1763
01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And the next thing you know another dude</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees the moth man,</v>

1764
01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:54.270
<v Speaker 1>then it spreads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those stories are,</v>

1765
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:58.050
<v Speaker 1>they become 10 years old and 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old and it goes on and on and on.</v>

1766
01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.153
<v Speaker 1>People are full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the very specific time it was for </v>

1767
01:14:03.901 --> 01:14:04.734
<v Speaker 1>one year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were seeing all these mosman or </v>

1768
01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:09.360
<v Speaker 1>one moth man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1769
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:12.160
<v Speaker 1>And then same time</v>

1770
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.993
<v Speaker 3>there's Ufos in this area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then people were being visited by </v>

1771
01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:17.884
<v Speaker 3>men and black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then this bridge collapsed and they </v>

1772
01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:22.414
<v Speaker 3>believed that the moth man is some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of banshee that shows up to warn people </v>

1773
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:27.820
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1774
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:30.820
<v Speaker 3>something terrible is about to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems totally logical.</v>

1775
01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fill in the blanks.</v>

1803
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:40.583
<v Speaker 3>storytellers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's one of the reasons why Les </v>

1804
01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:43.023
<v Speaker 3>Stroud becomes interesting because less </v>
<v Speaker 3>drought is add two experiences and one </v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put that shit on the show and he </v>

1859
01:18:07.191 --> 01:18:10.580
<v Speaker 1>had some like so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a caveat like what does he</v>

1860
01:18:10.581 --> 01:18:11.710
<v Speaker 1>say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>

1861
01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.550
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he say that that's real.</v>

1862
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:14.683
<v Speaker 1>It all becomes very problematic when yo </v>
<v Speaker 1>money tied into whether you can't talk </v>

1863
01:18:19.701 --> 01:18:22.850
<v Speaker 1>too much shit cause it's on his show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes money off that show.</v>

1864
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:27.170
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Survivorman bigfoot massive ratio.</v>

1865
01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.910
<v Speaker 1>It gets bigger ratings than regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>survivor man.</v>

1866
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:30.763
<v Speaker 1>Like we dropped some stuff off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Africa by himself with a butter </v>

1867
01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:35.540
<v Speaker 1>knife like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's impressive.</v>

1868
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:38.930
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done some real aim and that doesn't</v>

1869
01:18:38.931 --> 01:18:42.590
<v Speaker 1>get nearly the ratings at this hanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with his fake bigfoot guy does,</v>

1870
01:18:43.190 --> 01:18:44.023
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1871
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Well it's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well so,</v>

1872
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:50.570
<v Speaker 1>so well they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they buried there.</v>

1873
01:18:50.571 --> 01:18:51.980
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there maybe.</v>

1874
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:53.610
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a,</v>

1875
01:18:53.611 --> 01:18:54.444
<v Speaker 1>this guy todd does hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a biologist and we did some tests </v>

1876
01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:01.250
<v Speaker 1>on all these different things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people thought were big foot shit,</v>

1877
01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.350
<v Speaker 1>big foot hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all bears.</v>

1878
01:19:03.351 --> 01:19:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Bears are dogs or coyotes or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1879
01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:07.950
<v Speaker 1>But all of it we did actual for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

1880
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.861
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1881
01:19:08.861 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 1>we all went to a real lab at Nyu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a real tests.</v>

1882
01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.330
<v Speaker 1>It's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing,</v>

1883
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:15.183
<v Speaker 1>there's not one piece of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was that lady who was </v>

1884
01:19:17.911 --> 01:19:21.440
<v Speaker 1>that lady from Texas who was calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>their name DNA.</v>

1885
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all got to catch him.</v>

1886
01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.273
<v Speaker 1>Catch him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was saying that she found DNA that </v>

1887
01:19:25.791 --> 01:19:29.110
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was some sort of nonhuman primate.</v>

1888
01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:30.740
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tainted.</v>

1889
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:31.783
<v Speaker 1>But she's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's kind of ostracized in the big </v>

1890
01:19:34.671 --> 01:19:36.740
<v Speaker 1>football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've cast her aside.</v>

1891
01:19:36.741 --> 01:19:40.160
<v Speaker 1>That's how you know you're full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big foot communities,</v>

1892
01:19:40.161 --> 01:19:44.530
<v Speaker 1>like this bitch is too crazy for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kick rocks.</v>

1893
01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Melba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1894
01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:48.470
<v Speaker 1>It's telling you're a fucking horse shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>

1895
01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Go Penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

1896
01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:54.050
<v Speaker 1>You better have your shoe bags.</v>

1897
01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1898
01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.240
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to agree on that.</v>

1899
01:19:59.241 --> 01:20:00.780
<v Speaker 1>That's why I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1900
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't discount the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only did that animal exist,</v>

1901
01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:08.400
<v Speaker 1>but maybe even could still exist because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific northwest,</v>

1902
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.530
<v Speaker 2>incredibly dense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a massive event.</v>

1903
01:20:11.531 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird environment part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually the part,</v>

1904
01:20:14.671 --> 01:20:17.880
<v Speaker 2>one of the things when you get out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you truly,</v>

1905
01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean they lose planes in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1906
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:22.040
<v Speaker 2>And they don't find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1907
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:25.230
<v Speaker 2>you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in places where I'm like,</v>

1908
01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:27.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lost.</v>

1909
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:28.770
<v Speaker 2>And you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1910
01:20:28.810 --> 01:20:32.730
<v Speaker 2>and it's a question of like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 feet like that dense.</v>

1911
01:20:32.731 --> 01:20:34.690
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what that is</v>

1912
01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:35.923
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Insane amounts of acreage that people </v>

1913
01:20:37.241 --> 01:20:41.920
<v Speaker 5>just don't live in from Oregon all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way down the northern California ranch.</v>

1914
01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.090
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the part that,</v>

1915
01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:44.963
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started going around and I went </v>

1916
01:20:46.581 --> 01:20:47.840
<v Speaker 2>in that deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1917
01:20:47.841 --> 01:20:48.830
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1918
01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:51.830
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy how remote that is.</v>

1919
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.600
<v Speaker 5>It makes it compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

1920
01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:56.820
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the shitty stories,</v>

1921
01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.730
<v Speaker 5>the fake footage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fake footprints,</v>

1922
01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:00.564
<v Speaker 5>all the fakeness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes me wonder if you're just </v>

1923
01:21:02.911 --> 01:21:03.744
<v Speaker 5>dealing with a myth that is kind of cool</v>
<v Speaker 5>to talk about because it exists in this </v>

1924
01:21:07.121 --> 01:21:08.280
<v Speaker 5>very strange environment.</v>

1925
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1926
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1927
01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree that I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1928
01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And since I was a kid,</v>

1929
01:21:15.101 --> 01:21:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm always been fascinated by these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different kinds of characters and,</v>

1930
01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.410
<v Speaker 2>and who are they and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1931
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:21.840
<v Speaker 2>what do they mean to us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1932
01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:23.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's really key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1933
01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll be writing a screenplay that it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with Frankenstein.</v>

1934
01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.370
<v Speaker 2>And I realized later on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1935
01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.233
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1936
01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:33.640
<v Speaker 2>this was Frankenstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1937
01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.260
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is someone who,</v>

1938
01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.340
<v Speaker 2>who was rebuilt after being marred and </v>
<v Speaker 2>became,</v>

1939
01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:40.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and come to the fire and became this </v>

1940
01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:46.330
<v Speaker 2>monster that is unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have to get finished writing.</v>

1941
01:21:46.331 --> 01:21:46.901
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1942
01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.710
<v Speaker 2>I just wrote Frankenstein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddammit.</v>

1943
01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:49.593
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1944
01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1945
01:21:50.801 --> 01:21:52.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm fascinated by,</v>

1946
01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:53.843
<v Speaker 2>by that.</v>

1947
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.850
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1948
01:21:54.850 --> 01:21:55.683
<v Speaker 5>it's also the fact that native Americans</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't really have a lot of fake animals </v>

1949
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.140
<v Speaker 5>in their folklore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not a lot of,</v>

1950
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:06.260
<v Speaker 5>but this one is incredibly prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:07.070
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1952
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.903
<v Speaker 5>I really think it has to do with jug and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Opeth Agus and if you follow where Chai </v>

1953
01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.450
<v Speaker 5>Candle pithiness was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jack [inaudible] was in Asia and uh,</v>

1954
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:16.850
<v Speaker 5>just like all the other animals came </v>
<v Speaker 5>across the bering strait,</v>

1955
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:17.703
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they did come across the bering </v>

1956
01:22:18.391 --> 01:22:19.224
<v Speaker 5>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would be exactly in the area where </v>

1957
01:22:22.281 --> 01:22:26.180
<v Speaker 5>the sightings are from Alaska all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way down the Pacific northwest,</v>

1958
01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:28.790
<v Speaker 5>Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>northern bc,</v>

1959
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:31.940
<v Speaker 5>those are the areas where you have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>BC rockies,</v>

1960
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:33.740
<v Speaker 5>those are areas you have the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>sidings.</v>

1961
01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.230
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but those are areas where the bears are,</v>

1962
01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the same range as these black bear.</v>

1963
01:22:39.411 --> 01:22:44.411
<v Speaker 5>So I think it's entirely possible that </v>
<v Speaker 5>at one point in time there was something</v>

1964
01:22:44.841 --> 01:22:48.770
<v Speaker 5>like that that made it over here along </v>
<v Speaker 5>with um,</v>

1965
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:50.090
<v Speaker 5>with human beings.</v>

1966
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:52.650
<v Speaker 2>And you believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1967
01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.680
<v Speaker 2>this is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1968
01:22:55.681 --> 01:22:56.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1969
01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:01.440
<v Speaker 5>I just sense memory that has gone from </v>
<v Speaker 5>generation to generation.</v>

1970
01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:02.493
<v Speaker 5>I think he's just stories that get </v>
<v Speaker 5>passed down and those stories become in </v>

1971
01:23:05.531 --> 01:23:06.364
<v Speaker 5>our head and then we go looking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's entirely possible that </v>

1972
01:23:09.221 --> 01:23:13.540
<v Speaker 5>written language is like how long has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long has spoken language been around</v>

1973
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:14.740
<v Speaker 5>for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to say,</v>

1974
01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:18.670
<v Speaker 5>I want to say it's like 40,000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I might be wrong.</v>

1975
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.350
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think language is like,</v>

1976
01:23:20.351 --> 01:23:22.150
<v Speaker 5>it was spoken language is like 40,000 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years old,</v>

1977
01:23:22.151 --> 01:23:24.530
<v Speaker 5>which is not really that long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

1978
01:23:24.531 --> 01:23:25.364
<v Speaker 5>which means spoken language most likely </v>
<v Speaker 5>was around somewhere around the time </v>

1979
01:23:31.121 --> 01:23:31.954
<v Speaker 5>that animal exists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like if they didn't know that </v>

1980
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:33.874
<v Speaker 5>gigantic pithy is a gigantic pithiness </v>
<v Speaker 5>existed at all until the 1920s and the </v>

1981
01:23:39.251 --> 01:23:40.084
<v Speaker 5>bones that they got from this one area </v>
<v Speaker 5>were dated at about a hundred thousand </v>

1982
01:23:44.230 --> 01:23:45.063
<v Speaker 5>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's entirely feasible that these </v>

1983
01:23:46.631 --> 01:23:49.690
<v Speaker 5>animals could have survived another 30,</v>
<v Speaker 5>40,</v>

1984
01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:50.524
<v Speaker 5>50,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows how many thousands of years </v>

1985
01:23:52.031 --> 01:23:53.680
<v Speaker 5>until it eventually became extinct.</v>

1986
01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:54.813
<v Speaker 5>So if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people probably experienced </v>

1987
01:23:57.401 --> 01:23:59.140
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably came in contact with them.</v>

1988
01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:01.360
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>

1989
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:02.343
<v Speaker 5>there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a bunch of different bears </v>

1990
01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.070
<v Speaker 5>that existed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1991
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:10.870
<v Speaker 5>was it a flathead or a flat face bear?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what it's called.</v>

1992
01:24:10.871 --> 01:24:11.704
<v Speaker 5>Flat nose bear flat face bear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was a prehistoric bear that </v>

1993
01:24:14.981 --> 01:24:18.190
<v Speaker 5>existed in the place to scene that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1994
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.650
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1995
01:24:19.690 --> 01:24:23.590
<v Speaker 5>such a formidable Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently according to Dan Flores,</v>

1996
01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:28.800
<v Speaker 5>that he thinks it impeded the progress </v>
<v Speaker 5>of people from Asia to North America.</v>

1997
01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:31.270
<v Speaker 5>There was a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the biggest barrier,</v>

1998
01:24:31.271 --> 01:24:35.560
<v Speaker 5>like as big as a Kodiak Grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that these enormous bears,</v>

1999
01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:37.840
<v Speaker 5>flathead bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Short face bear.</v>

2000
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:39.070
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

2001
01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:41.200
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the size of this fucking thing.</v>

2002
01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:44.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is an absolutely enormous bear.</v>

2003
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:49.830
<v Speaker 5>That was the Apex Predator of North </v>
<v Speaker 5>America that went extinct.</v>

2004
01:24:50.110 --> 01:24:50.891
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find out when it,</v>

2005
01:24:50.891 --> 01:24:52.450
<v Speaker 5>when it's double the size of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a big,</v>

2006
01:24:52.451 --> 01:24:54.580
<v Speaker 5>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2007
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.460
<v Speaker 5>it's a fucking monstrous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>monstrous,</v>

2008
01:24:57.461 --> 01:24:58.540
<v Speaker 5>predatory animal.</v>

2009
01:24:58.840 --> 01:24:59.673
<v Speaker 5>And did this animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was the preeminent a Predator in North </v>

2010
01:25:03.761 --> 01:25:05.380
<v Speaker 5>America?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what year was that?</v>

2011
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 5>Not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2012
01:25:06.821 --> 01:25:08.770
<v Speaker 5>while humans were alive for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2013
01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:09.731
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

2014
01:25:09.731 --> 01:25:12.400
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find out when it went extinct.</v>

2015
01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:15.100
<v Speaker 5>It's a 11,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That ain't shit,</v>

2016
01:25:15.190 --> 01:25:18.790
<v Speaker 5>nothing and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that would also be,</v>

2017
01:25:18.791 --> 01:25:23.050
<v Speaker 5>especially if it like the black bear and</v>
<v Speaker 5>like many grizzlies walks on two legs.</v>

2018
01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:23.973
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if that thing was out there walking </v>

2019
01:25:24.641 --> 01:25:26.110
<v Speaker 5>around on two legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would,</v>

2020
01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:27.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>native Americans,</v>

2021
01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.660
<v Speaker 5>native Americans have some weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships with bears too.</v>

2022
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:34.510
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the few animals that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>refuse to hunt.</v>

2023
01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:35.950
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't hunt them.</v>

2024
01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:39.910
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of the first nation people up </v>
<v Speaker 5>in Canada,</v>

2025
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.863
<v Speaker 5>like I have a buddy of mine who lives up</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Canada and he hunts bears and he </v>

2026
01:25:45.071 --> 01:25:47.770
<v Speaker 5>trades with first nation people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They won't hunt bears,</v>

2027
01:25:47.771 --> 01:25:48.604
<v Speaker 5>but they want bear fat for their </v>
<v Speaker 5>medicine and they use it to make pies </v>

2028
01:25:52.241 --> 01:25:53.260
<v Speaker 5>and a bunch of different things.</v>

2029
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.900
<v Speaker 5>You're like Bayer Lard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like very prized.</v>

2030
01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:56.734
<v Speaker 5>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why weren't they smell weird religious </v>

2031
01:25:59.171 --> 01:26:01.750
<v Speaker 5>stuff like [inaudible] or do they play </v>
<v Speaker 5>drum stuff?</v>

2032
01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:04.400
<v Speaker 5>They believe guys like an ancestor </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's coming back.</v>

2033
01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.270
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have some,</v>

2034
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:08.900
<v Speaker 5>some interesting ideas about their </v>
<v Speaker 5>answers are delicious.</v>

2035
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:10.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well the kids good if they eat the right</v>

2036
01:26:10.941 --> 01:26:13.280
<v Speaker 5>foods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you find a bear that's a coastal bear</v>

2037
01:26:13.281 --> 01:26:14.114
<v Speaker 5>that's been eating a lot of salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not fun to eat because they eat </v>

2038
01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:18.230
<v Speaker 5>a lot of rotten fish and they taste </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible apparently.</v>

2039
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:19.783
<v Speaker 5>But the bears that I've eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've only been the ones that live in </v>

2040
01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:25.690
<v Speaker 5>these dense woods and their diets were </v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the country,</v>

2041
01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:26.533
<v Speaker 5>Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where you go bear at northern </v>

2042
01:26:27.801 --> 01:26:28.880
<v Speaker 5>Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2043
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:32.300
<v Speaker 5>mostly what they're eating is berries </v>
<v Speaker 5>and twit end each other.</v>

2044
01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:35.270
<v Speaker 5>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really 100%.</v>

2045
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:38.360
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the big things about bears</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that especially the males,</v>

2046
01:26:38.361 --> 01:26:41.030
<v Speaker 5>which is the ones you go after and kill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they eat cubs.</v>

2047
01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:42.561
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2048
01:26:42.561 --> 01:26:45.440
<v Speaker 5>Like all of them do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like one of the main things they go</v>

2049
01:26:45.441 --> 01:26:48.140
<v Speaker 5>looking for once they come out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>hibernation.</v>

2050
01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:49.910
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All apologies to my dead.</v>

2051
01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:50.893
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's been a lot worse hours and </v>

2052
01:26:54.231 --> 01:26:56.420
<v Speaker 5>there's two theories about the cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have another bobby,</v>

2053
01:26:56.421 --> 01:26:59.480
<v Speaker 5>if I cry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so full.</v>

2054
01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:05.420
<v Speaker 5>It's a awful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it happened when we were there two years</v>

2055
01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:06.710
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of our,</v>

2056
01:27:06.711 --> 01:27:07.544
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of one of the guys who was a guide </v>

2057
01:27:08.511 --> 01:27:11.420
<v Speaker 5>there saw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we saw two bears fight.</v>

2058
01:27:11.421 --> 01:27:14.540
<v Speaker 5>I saw with my own eyes a bear trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill this,</v>

2059
01:27:14.541 --> 01:27:15.374
<v Speaker 5>a females cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she fought him off and she kept </v>

2060
01:27:18.531 --> 01:27:20.600
<v Speaker 5>fighting him off and he kept coming in </v>
<v Speaker 5>and she kept fighting off.</v>

2061
01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.520
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her babies were up in trees,</v>

2062
01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.473
<v Speaker 5>the babies ran up and trees like we were</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching her move around and she was </v>

2063
01:27:27.621 --> 01:27:28.454
<v Speaker 5>kind of aware of us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we were far enough away from our </v>

2064
01:27:29.891 --> 01:27:32.630
<v Speaker 5>work and we weren't moving where she </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't think we were a threat,</v>

2065
01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.120
<v Speaker 5>but then all of a sudden the baby bears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2066
01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:35.963
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they piped up and they fucking just ran </v>

2067
01:27:38.001 --> 01:27:38.834
<v Speaker 5>up a tree and we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck's going on in this big </v>

2068
01:27:41.451 --> 01:27:45.500
<v Speaker 5>male bear came in and the two of them </v>
<v Speaker 5>just started duking it out and they were</v>

2069
01:27:45.501 --> 01:27:46.334
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like a UFC fight 50 yards away </v>

2070
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.000
<v Speaker 5>and should me these two bears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2071
01:27:50.001 --> 01:27:50.810
<v Speaker 5>they'd go on a war.</v>

2072
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:53.030
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really fascinating.</v>

2073
01:27:53.031 --> 01:27:57.980
<v Speaker 5>It was too dark even for us to shoot the</v>
<v Speaker 5>big male bear because it was just,</v>

2074
01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:58.814
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was enough visibility wouldn't be </v>

2075
01:27:59.631 --> 01:28:01.760
<v Speaker 5>ethical to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was fascinating to watch.</v>

2076
01:28:01.761 --> 01:28:04.610
<v Speaker 5>Like she was protecting her babies from </v>
<v Speaker 5>predication,</v>

2077
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:08.420
<v Speaker 5>from another band and she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she scared it up.</v>

2078
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.570
<v Speaker 5>But here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not with this bear,</v>

2079
01:28:11.571 --> 01:28:12.404
<v Speaker 5>but in that same time we were there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one bear came in and one of the guides </v>

2080
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:17.990
<v Speaker 5>saw it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got ahold of one of the cubs,</v>

2081
01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.510
<v Speaker 5>killed it in front of everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating it,</v>

2082
01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:24.290
<v Speaker 5>then she chased him off and then she </v>
<v Speaker 5>finished her own cub.</v>

2083
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:27.103
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a hard scrabble world up there </v>

2084
01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.480
<v Speaker 5>living in the woods of northern Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's no joke.</v>

2085
01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:33.440
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2086
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:35.720
<v Speaker 5>It's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's scary shit.</v>

2087
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:37.243
<v Speaker 5>And so that's the reality of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals and the population up there is </v>

2088
01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:42.733

<v Speaker 5>the population is very high.</v>

2100
01:29:10.741 --> 01:29:15.741
<v Speaker 5>And also they encourage it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want you to kill two large males.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember once my brother,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

<v Speaker 2>clean the deer in the garage and he had </v>

2123
01:30:04.311 --> 01:30:08.120
<v Speaker 2>this idea that he was going to take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin off.</v>

2124
01:30:08.690 --> 01:30:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>year and a half star</v>

2131

<v Speaker 2>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2132
01:30:29.681 --> 01:30:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's why I'm a Vegan and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2133
01:30:32.471 --> 01:30:35.050
<v Speaker 2>and I'm gonna like tiny little boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2136
01:30:43.901 --> 01:30:44.734
<v Speaker 2>bug.</v>

2137
01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:45.923
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had this conversation with these guys </v>

2138
01:30:46.851 --> 01:30:47.684
<v Speaker 5>from this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this documentary cowspiracy and it was </v>

2139
01:30:50.241 --> 01:30:52.340
<v Speaker 5>all like really heavy and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2140
01:30:52.341 --> 01:30:54.950
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about factory farming,</v>

2141
01:30:54.951 --> 01:30:57.540
<v Speaker 5>which I think is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think pretty much everybody does.</v>

2142
01:30:57.541 --> 01:31:00.890
<v Speaker 5>And The AG gag laws,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are even more disgusting,</v>

2143
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:04.700
<v Speaker 5>which are these laws that are in place </v>
<v Speaker 5>to keep you from taking video footage of</v>

2144
01:31:04.701 --> 01:31:05.450
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2145
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:06.283
<v Speaker 5>harm atrocities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I went home and I turned on </v>

2146
01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:13.400
<v Speaker 5>that Steve Rinella guys show and he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>showing how to butcher a deer.</v>

2147
01:31:13.670 --> 01:31:14.503
<v Speaker 5>And one of the ways they did it was they</v>
<v Speaker 5>take like a rock and they wrapped the </v>

2148
01:31:19.731 --> 01:31:24.731
<v Speaker 5>hide up in this rock and then tie it off</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then tie that rope on that rock to a</v>

2149
01:31:26.001 --> 01:31:29.960
<v Speaker 5>truck and then pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it just looks so fucked up.</v>

2150
01:31:30.170 --> 01:31:33.530
<v Speaker 5>Is deer hanging by?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like honches.</v>

2151
01:31:33.550 --> 01:31:33.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2152
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:36.110
<v Speaker 5>And then they just strip the skin off of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2153
01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:38.360
<v Speaker 5>have like a sheet and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2154
01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:39.283
<v Speaker 5>is it safe and safe?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they're cutting it up and </v>

2155
01:31:42.351 --> 01:31:43.184
<v Speaker 5>slicing it and turning it into roasts </v>
<v Speaker 5>and chops and steaks and hamburger meat </v>

2156
01:31:48.891 --> 01:31:49.790
<v Speaker 5>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

2157
01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.073
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cold reality of what meat is and </v>

2158
01:31:54.591 --> 01:31:57.560
<v Speaker 5>where it comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which has escaped us.</v>

2159
01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:02.680
<v Speaker 5>It is like it left the consciousness of </v>
<v Speaker 5>most people who eat meat,</v>

2160
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:04.690
<v Speaker 5>they don't experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't see it.</v>

2161
01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:07.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the things that's insidious,</v>

2162
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:08.263
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about a lack of information because of </v>

2163
01:32:10.290 --> 01:32:14.230
<v Speaker 5>the lack of information changes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the actual context.</v>

2164
01:32:14.231 --> 01:32:17.830
<v Speaker 5>It changes what a thing is to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the things I think is really</v>

2165
01:32:17.831 --> 01:32:18.664
<v Speaker 5>devious about what the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 5>administration did when they pass laws </v>

2166
01:32:22.271 --> 01:32:25.450
<v Speaker 5>that kept people from taking photographs</v>
<v Speaker 5>of coffins.</v>

2167
01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:26.470
<v Speaker 5>Just coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2168
01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:30.510
<v Speaker 5>They made a law against press taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>photos around.</v>

2169
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:33.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is crazy because they're not only,</v>

2170
01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.114
<v Speaker 5>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're filtering and controlling the </v>

2171
01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:42.190
<v Speaker 5>narrative so much that you can't even </v>
<v Speaker 5>see an American flag draped coffin.</v>

2172
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:43.103
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very dark because then I remember </v>

2173
01:32:44.891 --> 01:32:46.300
<v Speaker 5>when name mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2174
01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:48.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In your mind only means war.</v>

2175
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:50.980
<v Speaker 5>If you lost your friend or if you lost </v>
<v Speaker 5>your husband,</v>

2176
01:32:50.981 --> 01:32:53.080
<v Speaker 5>or if you've lost your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it becomes war.</v>

2177
01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:55.480
<v Speaker 5>But if it's just somebody you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2178
01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.700
<v Speaker 5>then it allows you to just keep going on</v>

2179
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:58.930
<v Speaker 3>number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

2180
01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:01.740
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a number and it's very,</v>

2181
01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2182
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:05.280
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2183
01:33:05.281 --> 01:33:08.030
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that got us out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam was the,</v>

2184
01:33:08.031 --> 01:33:11.590
<v Speaker 3>the footage that was on the news every </v>
<v Speaker 3>night when you're having dinner and you,</v>

2185
01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2186
01:33:12.451 --> 01:33:13.290
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2187
01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.450
<v Speaker 3>that was what ended it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2188
01:33:15.451 --> 01:33:16.220
<v Speaker 3>what do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

2189
01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:18.240
<v Speaker 3>that felt like when I handed it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.990
<v Speaker 5>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2191
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:23.060
<v Speaker 5>here we are 15 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're still in Afghanistan.</v>

2192
01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

2193
01:33:25.410 --> 01:33:29.730
<v Speaker 3>And there's never any footage Navarro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I was a kid,</v>

2194
01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:31.013
<v Speaker 3>when I was at a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was what was on during the news </v>

2195
01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:38.540
<v Speaker 3>while we're having dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was what I saw my parents turn,</v>

2196
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:42.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my parents went from cursing hippies and</v>

2197
01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:46.260
<v Speaker 3>per war protesters to go into the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

2198
01:33:46.290 --> 01:33:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2199
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:49.350
<v Speaker 3>so it must have been interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2200
01:33:49.351 --> 01:33:50.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so yeah,</v>

2202
01:33:53.190 --> 01:33:54.600

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2203
01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:55.980
<v Speaker 3>I remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2204
01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:56.940
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2205
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:57.833
<v Speaker 3>when that happened when we was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think the new administration is </v>

2206
01:34:04.431 --> 01:34:07.430
<v Speaker 3>going to fix everything for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if trump wins.</v>

2207
01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very excited about that.</v>

2208
01:34:09.091 --> 01:34:10.610
<v Speaker 3>If Hillary Clinton wins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's going to,</v>

2209
01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.980
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be all different folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be business as usual.</v>

2210
01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:14.814
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be just politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to be about money controlling </v>

2211
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:18.030
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>

2212
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.863
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care where she gets her money </v>

2213
01:34:20.341 --> 01:34:20.761
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

2214
01:34:20.761 --> 01:34:22.700
<v Speaker 3>She's got ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got oils.</v>

2215
01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Those bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could pay her hundreds of thousands</v>

2216
01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:26.310
<v Speaker 3>of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to tell them off.</v>

2217
01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2218
01:34:28.231 --> 01:34:32.250
<v Speaker 3>But it isn't an insane camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a,</v>

2219
01:34:32.251 --> 01:34:34.640
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 53 years old,</v>

2220
01:34:34.650 --> 01:34:35.483
<v Speaker 3>most insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2221
01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Barry must be loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2222
01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:37.853
<v Speaker 3>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got father three because Barry was </v>

2223
01:34:39.961 --> 01:34:41.040
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2224
01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:44.520
<v Speaker 3>and they dragged him back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2225
01:34:44.521 --> 01:34:47.100
<v Speaker 3>it's so crazy that he had to get back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

2226
01:34:47.101 --> 01:34:48.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like up in the woods.</v>

2227
01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2228
01:34:49.801 --> 01:34:51.360
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of funny.</v>

2229
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:56.750
<v Speaker 3>So we all get a gift from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Highlights how the system</v>

2230
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:02.870
<v Speaker 5>is that this is all it needs is a two </v>
<v Speaker 5>party system and the in the,</v>

2231
01:35:02.871 --> 01:35:04.460
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the fact that it's not one man,</v>

2232
01:35:04.461 --> 01:35:05.590
<v Speaker 5>one vote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2233
01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:06.573
<v Speaker 5>there's a whole lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this is also like what does our </v>

2234
01:35:08.541 --> 01:35:09.374
<v Speaker 5>society become?</v>

2235
01:35:11.961 --> 01:35:14.360
<v Speaker 5>where we pay attention to whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>spectacles on the news.</v>

2268
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:50.060
<v Speaker 5>a lot of his story apparently is </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

2269
01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:51.920
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who have looked into it,</v>

2270
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.843
<v Speaker 5>and it's one of the things that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were looking into while he was running </v>

2271
01:36:54.051 --> 01:36:56.060
<v Speaker 5>for president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like his dad.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the story of his dad.</v>

2273
01:36:57.771 --> 01:37:00.710
<v Speaker 5>His Dad came over on a raft with $100 </v>
<v Speaker 5>sewn into his underwear.</v>

2274
01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:01.653
<v Speaker 5>I get one of those stories and he made </v>
<v Speaker 5>it with good old fashioned American </v>

2275
01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:05.060
<v Speaker 5>ingenuity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

2276
01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 5>Apparently not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently he was like a rebel,</v>

2277
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:09.163
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he may have played a part in the death </v>

2278
01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:13.580
<v Speaker 5>of Lee Harvey Oswald.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2279
01:37:13.730 --> 01:37:16.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well there was a guy who was writing the</v>

2280
01:37:16.191 --> 01:37:19.520
<v Speaker 5>story about it and he wound up dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2281
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:21.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2282
01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:22.640
<v Speaker 5>the guy even wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2283
01:37:22.641 --> 01:37:23.300
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2284
01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.370
<v Speaker 5>if I'm not around anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2285
01:37:25.371 --> 01:37:27.290
<v Speaker 5>this is what happened and this is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>

2286
01:37:27.291 --> 01:37:30.140
<v Speaker 5>But people do that kind of shit before </v>
<v Speaker 5>they killed themselves.</v>

2287
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:31.770
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's your problem.</v>

2288
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:32.623
<v Speaker 5>Because they think there's a real story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that they're all </v>

2289
01:37:35.601 --> 01:37:36.434
<v Speaker 5>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think one of the things that I'm </v>

2290
01:37:37.011 --> 01:37:38.450
<v Speaker 5>gonna do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna make this story happened.</v>

2291
01:37:38.451 --> 01:37:40.790
<v Speaker 5>I'll blow my brains out and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to think that,</v>

2292
01:37:40.930 --> 01:37:41.763
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to look into this because </v>

2293
01:37:42.261 --> 01:37:44.300
<v Speaker 5>they're going to think that I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>whacked by the demand.</v>

2294
01:37:44.301 --> 01:37:45.134
<v Speaker 5>Like as if anybody is running around </v>
<v Speaker 5>killing people over Lee Harvey Oswald's </v>

2295
01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:52.400
<v Speaker 5>death today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was that Jamie?</v>

2296
01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.860
<v Speaker 5>These are the photos that they found of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ted Cruz's dad.</v>

2297
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:57.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the guy in the white shirt here.</v>

2298
01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.450
<v Speaker 5>That's Ted Cruz's dad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was an unidentified man,</v>

2299
01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:01.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the Warren Commission.</v>

2300
01:38:01.831 --> 01:38:04.260
<v Speaker 5>So they think that that's him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2301
01:38:04.650 --> 01:38:07.950
<v Speaker 5>it looks like I'm Cuban Fella and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple of pictures of it.</v>

2302
01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.390
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the link.</v>

2304
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.430
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most likely I'm going with that.</v>

2305
01:38:14.490 --> 01:38:15.323
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to run with it.</v>

2306
01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:17.250
<v Speaker 7>So it looks like now</v>

2307
01:38:18.170 --> 01:38:19.280
<v Speaker 5>that's him today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2308
01:38:19.281 --> 01:38:22.970

<v Speaker 5>his story doesn't add up when they,</v>

2309
01:38:22.971 --> 01:38:26.010
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they check out the,</v>

2311
01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he actually was here,</v>

2312
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:33.200
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of a funky business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

2313
01:38:33.201 --> 01:38:37.840
<v Speaker 5>I have a fucking very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very shallow knowledge of this story.</v>

<v Speaker 5>footage on youtube by law campaigns </v>

2334
01:39:32.001 --> 01:39:32.834
<v Speaker 5>can't coordinate with super pacs.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was just,</v>

2440
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I was more angry I think at j,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2448
01:44:57.511 --> 01:44:58.344
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think I resented him because even </v>

<v Speaker 3>though he's older than me,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2477
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:59.370
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen the car show.</v>

2478
01:45:59.750 --> 01:46:00.583
<v Speaker 5>Well a lot of comics felt betrayed </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he was this guy who was kind of </v>

2479
01:46:04.761 --> 01:46:05.594
<v Speaker 5>like the hips smart voice of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>marketing a lot of the stupid shit that </v>

2480
01:46:09.951 --> 01:46:10.784
<v Speaker 5>we saw in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then all of a sudden he gets his </v>

2481
01:46:12.591 --> 01:46:15.080
<v Speaker 5>tonight show Gig and he becomes Mr </v>
<v Speaker 5>Living Room.</v>

2482
01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was,</v>

2483
01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:17.600
<v Speaker 3>he went from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2484
01:46:17.710 --> 01:46:21.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean it looks like I'm pinging fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually,</v>

2485
01:46:22.090 --> 01:46:24.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's got this show now.</v>

2486
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in my memory I was like,</v>

2487
01:46:26.801 --> 01:46:28.750
<v Speaker 3>well that's just the little fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a pretty good,</v>

2488
01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:31.593
<v Speaker 3>see this is cause I have lighter fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what made it arson cause it was </v>

2489
01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:39.010
<v Speaker 3>premeditated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned a lot of being in the moment.</v>

2490
01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.073
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I just set it on fire with a </v>

2491
01:46:41.801 --> 01:46:44.130
<v Speaker 3>lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then yeah,</v>

2492
01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:46.050
<v Speaker 3>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why it was arson.</v>

2493
01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:48.890
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's showed that he's doing now.</v>

2494
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.930
<v Speaker 5>It's like something that he actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>cares about and we talked about it.</v>

2495
01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.280
<v Speaker 5>I had him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

2496
01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:54.330
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I would have these,</v>

2497
01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:55.333
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he couldn't pick who's on the tonight </v>

2498
01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:56.923
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they would put people on like from </v>

2499
01:46:57.991 --> 01:47:00.480
<v Speaker 5>reality shows and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd have to say,</v>

2500
01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:02.510
<v Speaker 5>you and Harry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you going to get married?</v>

2501
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:03.823
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2502
01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the nature of that.</v>

2503
01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:06.870
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2504
01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.730
<v Speaker 2>I think letterman made a decision after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2505
01:47:09.731 --> 01:47:11.890
<v Speaker 2>some days I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm paraphrasing,</v>

2506
01:47:11.891 --> 01:47:13.210
<v Speaker 2>but someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2507
01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:15.190
<v Speaker 2>who was on the show tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2508
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:16.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he was like,</v>

2509
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2510
01:47:18.101 --> 01:47:20.710
<v Speaker 2>That was when he decided to retire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he couldn't remember.</v>

2511
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:23.490
<v Speaker 2>I get that when I used to direct the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kimmel show.</v>

2512
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Someone say who was on last night and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't remember.</v>

2513
01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a grind.</v>

2514
01:47:28.481 --> 01:47:29.360
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2515
01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:30.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're doing,</v>

2516
01:47:30.731 --> 01:47:31.564
<v Speaker 2>is fascinated by the ego of the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember the guy who tried to blackmail </v>

2517
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:36.200
<v Speaker 2>letterman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2518
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Well he was fucking the guy's girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it was.</v>

2519
01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:40.013
<v Speaker 2>Letterman had had some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship and now this guys has a </v>

2520
01:47:43.091 --> 01:47:45.280
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

2521
01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:46.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my take on it was this guy couldn't get </v>

2522
01:47:49.151 --> 01:47:51.370
<v Speaker 2>past that.</v>

2523
01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.140
<v Speaker 2>She used to bang and probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of the,</v>

2524
01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:57.280
<v Speaker 2>and he was going through a bad divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's like,</v>

2528
01:48:05.621 --> 01:48:06.454
<v Speaker 2>he's going to blow up the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I love that letterman what the guy </v>

2529
01:48:10.031 --> 01:48:12.190
<v Speaker 2>never ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever thought of.</v>

2530
01:48:12.191 --> 01:48:13.870
<v Speaker 2>What if the guy just does the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>

01:48:56.891 --> 01:48:58.620
<v Speaker 2>hooker at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2549
01:48:58.630 --> 01:48:59.411
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't,</v>

2550
01:48:59.411 --> 01:49:01.030
<v Speaker 2>it's so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you apologize?</v>

2551
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:04.330
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but letterman didn't do a pho apology.</v>

2552
01:49:04.331 --> 01:49:05.164
<v Speaker 2>He just did the right thing and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the guy's life came down like a </v>

2553
01:49:07.981 --> 01:49:10.720
<v Speaker 2>house of cards and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it was in jail.</v>

2554
01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think when you're like,</v>

2555
01:49:12.190 --> 01:49:13.023
<v Speaker 2>I think as a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get past your partner's </v>

2556
01:49:15.281 --> 01:49:17.080
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2557
01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.210
<v Speaker 2>and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think,</v>

2558
01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something really poetic.</v>

2559
01:49:20.741 --> 01:49:21.331
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2560
01:49:21.331 --> 01:49:25.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by the story cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twist is all David Letterman did was</v>

2561
01:49:25.810 --> 01:49:26.643
<v Speaker 2>the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was shocking to this guy and </v>

2562
01:49:28.751 --> 01:49:31.990
<v Speaker 2>almost to our society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't do anything with it.</v>

2563
01:49:31.991 --> 01:49:32.824
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't exploit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't sell people magazine when </v>

2564
01:49:35.261 --> 01:49:36.760
<v Speaker 2>somebody just square.</v>

2565
01:49:36.850 --> 01:49:41.020
<v Speaker 5>He also did it the way he confessed on </v>
<v Speaker 5>television.</v>

2566
01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:44.560
<v Speaker 5>He did it like a David letterman </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>

2567
01:49:44.590 --> 01:49:45.580
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2568
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 5>I was having sex with</v>

2569
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.290
<v Speaker 11>someone to work with me.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

2570
01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:51.580
<v Speaker 11>And everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what the fuck is he doing?</v>

2571
01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:52.693
<v Speaker 11>I love that I spent so much time on all </v>
<v Speaker 11>this trying to manage stuff and staying </v>

2572
01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:03.100
<v Speaker 11>instead of actually owning something </v>
<v Speaker 11>instead of saying this is what I did,</v>

2573
01:50:03.101 --> 01:50:05.250
<v Speaker 11>this is what I did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

2574
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:07.780
<v Speaker 11>it's really knowing your business.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

2575
01:50:08.410 --> 01:50:09.243
<v Speaker 5>Well it's like when we catch someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>lying about something and then they're </v>

2576
01:50:12.401 --> 01:50:13.870
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're deceptive.</v>

2577
01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.600
<v Speaker 5>That's when people get like really into </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

2578
01:50:16.601 --> 01:50:18.970
<v Speaker 5>But when someone comes out and just owns</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2579
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:21.640
<v Speaker 5>like Charlie Sheen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Charlie Sheen,</v>

2580
01:50:21.641 --> 01:50:23.280
<v Speaker 5>like when he went on all these shows and</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell,</v>

2581
01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:24.280
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I smoke rocks.</v>

2582
01:50:24.281 --> 01:50:25.480
<v Speaker 5>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2583
01:50:25.481 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I smoke all this coke,</v>

2584
01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:28.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause uh,</v>

2585
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:29.980
<v Speaker 5>that's how I roll baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's like,</v>

2586
01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:31.780
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking love this guy.</v>

2587
01:50:32.050 --> 01:50:32.883
<v Speaker 5>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if someone had footage of him smoking </v>

2588
01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:37.000
<v Speaker 5>crack out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2589
01:50:37.001 --> 01:50:38.350
<v Speaker 5>Bang and hookers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people be like,</v>

2590
01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:40.510
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his career is over.</v>

2591
01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:43.030
<v Speaker 5>And he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to put a spin on this.</v>

2592
01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:47.380
<v Speaker 5>There would be some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of recovery.</v>

2593
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:49.630
<v Speaker 5>What's really interesting is the Charlie</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sheen thing.</v>

2594
01:50:49.631 --> 01:50:50.464
<v Speaker 5>We're finding out that the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>tailspin that he went through and like </v>

2595
01:50:53.591 --> 01:50:56.800
<v Speaker 5>2012 was because he found out he had </v>
<v Speaker 5>HIV.</v>

2596
01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:00.310
<v Speaker 5>Like that's really part of what this all</v>
<v Speaker 5>was about.</v>

2597
01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:02.530
<v Speaker 5>And that's what the most recent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2598
01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:03.880
<v Speaker 5>black male,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2599
01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:07.120
<v Speaker 5>attempts against him was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently he's paid millions of dollars</v>

2600
01:51:07.121 --> 01:51:10.360
<v Speaker 5>to quiet this down big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he had all these sexual partners and</v>

2601
01:51:10.361 --> 01:51:11.194
<v Speaker 5>didn't tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess or so there's all also of other </v>

2602
01:51:12.731 --> 01:51:14.620
<v Speaker 5>lawsuits,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of the craziness involved.</v>

2603
01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:18.280
<v Speaker 5>But that's what set him off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what made him say,</v>

2604
01:51:18.281 --> 01:51:19.114
<v Speaker 5>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to go out and tell </v>

2605
01:51:20.021 --> 01:51:22.540
<v Speaker 5>everybody everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was because he had HIV.</v>

2606
01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:25.990
<v Speaker 11>It's really nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's,</v>

2607
01:51:26.110 --> 01:51:26.943
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I was thinking of someone else's story </v>

2608
01:51:28.451 --> 01:51:31.480
<v Speaker 11>at the same time just then.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's,</v>

2609
01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:32.620
<v Speaker 11>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think,</v>

2610
01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:33.910
<v Speaker 11>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

2611
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.500
<v Speaker 11>we're just so used to this filter that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that I,</v>

2612
01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:38.413
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>when someone is just genuinely honest </v>

2613
01:51:39.941 --> 01:51:41.400
<v Speaker 11>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

2614
01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:42.633
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that that is actually the s the most </v>

2615
01:51:44.321 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 11>powerful thing and it takes all the </v>
<v Speaker 11>sting out.</v>

2616
01:51:47.561 --> 01:51:49.060
<v Speaker 11>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you don't get any,</v>

2617
01:51:49.061 --> 01:51:50.440
<v Speaker 11>there's no gossip,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

2618
01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:51.251
<v Speaker 11>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 11>yeah,</v>

2619
01:51:51.251 --> 01:51:52.084
<v Speaker 11>I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think people were way more concerned </v>

2620
01:51:54.071 --> 01:51:55.600
<v Speaker 11>with deception.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Then there are,</v>

2621
01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:56.553
<v Speaker 11>they are with folly.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They're way more dis concerned with </v>

2622
01:51:59.501 --> 01:52:00.334
<v Speaker 11>deception and the are what people </v>
<v Speaker 11>fucking up with people making mistakes </v>

2623
01:52:02.741 --> 01:52:03.670

<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>

2624
01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:04.930
<v Speaker 11>I think it's funny when,</v>
<v Speaker 11>when,</v>

2625
01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.793
<v Speaker 11>when people will talk,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean not that was a big deal that I </v>

2626
01:52:07.871 --> 01:52:08.704
<v Speaker 11>set the leno show and fire,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but people now will come up to me and </v>

2627
01:52:11.801 --> 01:52:12.970

<v Speaker 11>it wasn't that you,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you made that step I was on a week </v>

2632
01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:27.190
<v Speaker 11>later.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You decided that.</v>

2633
01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:27.930
<v Speaker 11>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right.</v>

<v Speaker 11>That's a common thing.</v>

2635
01:52:30.330 --> 01:52:31.163
<v Speaker 11>And I was of me.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I see people saying that it was banned </v>

2638
01:52:41.141 --> 01:52:42.130

<v Speaker 3>he asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buried in dirt up to my neck,</v>

2644
01:52:50.871 --> 01:52:52.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was funny.</v>

2645
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:53.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>

2646
01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:54.441
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2647
01:52:54.441 --> 01:52:55.610
<v Speaker 3>it didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2650
01:52:59.001 --> 01:53:01.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we can connect that to big foot.</v>

2651
01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:04.370
<v Speaker 3>The people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just make shit up.</v>

2652
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2653
01:53:08.370 --> 01:53:10.230
<v Speaker 3>A way to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want saying,</v>

2654
01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:12.010
<v Speaker 5>I think look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2655
01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:12.883
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

2656
01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:17.380
<v Speaker 5>I would lose sleep for days if big foot </v>
<v Speaker 5>turned out to be true.</v>

2657
01:53:17.381 --> 01:53:19.300
<v Speaker 5>I'd be so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll say this then,</v>

2658
01:53:19.301 --> 01:53:20.230
<v Speaker 5>then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then that's good.</v>

2659
01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:21.573
<v Speaker 5>Look if someone hit one with a car and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he died and they had definitive proof </v>

2660
01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:27.640
<v Speaker 5>that there is a real gigantic pythagoras</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you see some fucking,</v>

2661
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:28.783
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blank cruiser that's smashed by some </v>

2662
01:53:30.281 --> 01:53:33.220
<v Speaker 5>gigantic ape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just wandered out of the forest.</v>

2663
01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:34.840
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd be happy.</v>

2664
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.880
<v Speaker 5>Just so happy at despondent one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:37.810
<v Speaker 5>Well not even if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2666
01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:38.673
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just jumped in front of a truck going </v>

2667
01:53:41.321 --> 01:53:46.321
<v Speaker 5>through a bad breakup out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think that,</v>

2668
01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:49.653
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think I could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could honestly say it will be one of </v>

2669
01:53:53.081 --> 01:53:55.810
<v Speaker 5>the happiest moments in my life if they </v>
<v Speaker 5>found a big foot,</v>

2670
01:53:55.811 --> 01:53:58.990
<v Speaker 5>if the captured a big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if we were watching on television</v>

2671
01:53:59.170 --> 01:54:00.003
<v Speaker 5>and we were seeing like some footage </v>
<v Speaker 5>from some containment area where they </v>

2672
01:54:03.731 --> 01:54:08.731
<v Speaker 5>had these giant steel bars like Kong and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had this huge 10 foot tall one.</v>

2673
01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I like your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like your Harry and the Hendersons a a</v>

2674
01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:16.820
<v Speaker 3>one better I have was it just gets hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>by a car.</v>

2675

<v Speaker 3>I said what happened in Harry?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the Henderson.</v>

2676
01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:19.293
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure we'd rather have that </v>

2677
01:54:20.661 --> 01:54:24.320
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then this animal sadly captured,</v>

2678
01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:26.740
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of my favorite hoax stories is a guy</v>

<v Speaker 5>in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll put a Ghillie suit on.</v>

<v Speaker 5>other way.</v>

2683
01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:38.470
<v Speaker 5>So he got hit on the one side Blam on </v>
<v Speaker 5>one side of the road,</v>

2684

2747
01:57:05.010 --> 01:57:06.540
<v Speaker 3>Well that was another thing about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>

2748
01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

2749
01:57:08.221 --> 01:57:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google this.</v>

2750
01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:10.860
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2751
01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:16.160
<v Speaker 3>they found one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why people saw a Yeti</v>

2752
01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:17.993
<v Speaker 3>is that there was a bear in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Himalayas that was thought to be long </v>

2753
01:57:21.241 --> 01:57:24.480
<v Speaker 3>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out that it may not be,</v>

2754
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:27.960
<v Speaker 3>and it was a different kind of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>Asian bear,</v>

2755
01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:30.290
<v Speaker 3>some large base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a,</v>

2756
01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:31.770
<v Speaker 3>is it a white bear?</v>

2757
01:57:31.770 --> 01:57:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it like a polar bear?</v>

2758
01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:34.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2759
01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:35.760
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2760
01:57:35.761 --> 01:57:39.270
<v Speaker 3>when you're looking at things in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>snow was fascinating to me.</v>

2761
01:57:39.271 --> 01:57:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Once I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2762
01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:42.930
<v Speaker 3>I was in the woods with these guys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>

2763
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:46.110
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at trail cam footage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2764
01:57:47.170 --> 01:57:48.003
<v Speaker 3>this almost looks like a weasel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called a merit and it was supposed </v>

2765
01:57:52.861 --> 01:57:53.694
<v Speaker 3>to be extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this guy showing me this footage </v>

2766
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:59.610
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2767
01:57:59.611 --> 01:58:00.061
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2768
01:58:00.061 --> 01:58:00.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a merit.</v>

2769
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:01.823
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there hasn't been one in 50 years and </v>

2770
01:58:03.751 --> 01:58:04.584
<v Speaker 3>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

2771
01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:08.700
<v Speaker 3>but take a look at the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He buries the lead and he goes,</v>

2772
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.300
<v Speaker 3>this looks like a footprint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He clicks past it.</v>

2773
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:16.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he showed me all this footage,</v>

2774
01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:18.350
<v Speaker 3>so you've found that I shouldn't do this</v>
<v Speaker 3>down here.</v>

2775
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:19.440
<v Speaker 3>This must be extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2776
01:58:19.441 --> 01:58:20.900
<v Speaker 3>it's a merit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he'd click,</v>

2777
01:58:20.901 --> 01:58:21.570
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>

2778
01:58:21.570 --> 01:58:22.780
<v Speaker 3>take a look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2779
01:58:22.890 --> 01:58:23.723
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at a footprint in snow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not concentrating on the fact that he </v>

2780
01:58:27.301 --> 01:58:29.430
<v Speaker 3>found an extinct animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swear to God.</v>

2781
01:58:29.490 --> 01:58:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're burying the lead.</v>

2782
01:58:33.031 --> 01:58:35.400
<v Speaker 3>You found an animal that was supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be dead.</v>

2783
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.420
<v Speaker 3>But we're looking at white might be big </v>
<v Speaker 3>foot duke.</v>

2784
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:42.430
<v Speaker 3>What did he absolutely identify</v>

2785
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:43.810
<v Speaker 5>that as a merit though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2786
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:46.120
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this was a huge news.</v>

2787
01:58:46.121 --> 01:58:47.310
<v Speaker 5>Then he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2788
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:50.560
<v Speaker 5>he didn't seem to give a rat's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So did he report it?</v>

2789
01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:51.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he did.</v>

2790
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:54.160
<v Speaker 5>So now they know this animal is an </v>
<v Speaker 5>extinct.</v>

2791
01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:55.031
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2792
01:58:55.031 --> 01:58:55.990
<v Speaker 5>there's been some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2793
01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:57.050
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 2>as much as I love the big foot </v>

<v Speaker 2>tried to get them to talk about anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

2799
01:59:07.690 --> 01:59:09.200
<v Speaker 2>then I'll talk about anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't.</v>

2800
01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:10.940
<v Speaker 2>It's all of a sudden it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2801
01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:13.860
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you bring up something,</v>

2802
01:59:13.890 --> 01:59:14.211
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2805
01:59:20.290 --> 01:59:24.220
<v Speaker 5>This is this thing that they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 5>searching with no reward.</v>

2806
01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:25.293
<v Speaker 5>There's no reward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they keep looking and it never </v>

2807
01:59:26.741 --> 01:59:27.840
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I said I though you haven't gotten any </v>

2818
01:59:51.301 --> 01:59:55.080
<v Speaker 2>one of these before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see anyone's figures.</v>

2819
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2820
01:59:56.370 --> 01:59:58.170
<v Speaker 2>What is the most compelling thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

2821
01:59:58.171 --> 02:00:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Is is eye witness evidence or is there I</v>
<v Speaker 2>love that.</v>

2822
02:00:01.771 --> 02:00:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Even if someone's lying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2823
02:00:04.130 --> 02:00:05.640
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2824
02:00:05.641 --> 02:00:09.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't the listening to someone telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>me a story that,</v>

2825
02:00:09.630 --> 02:00:12.180
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe is true.</v>

2826
02:00:12.810 --> 02:00:14.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's someone lying.</v>

2827
02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:15.433
<v Speaker 5>It's my favorite part of finding big </v>
<v Speaker 5>foot when they go to some town </v>

2828
02:00:18.051 --> 02:00:18.970
<v Speaker 5>community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2829
02:00:19.190 --> 02:00:20.023
<v Speaker 5>some community and some small town and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they start talking to them and the </v>

2830
02:00:22.341 --> 02:00:25.920
<v Speaker 5>community center and ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many of you here have had a big foot</v>

2831
02:00:25.921 --> 02:00:27.590
<v Speaker 5>and counter and they know the camera's </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

2832
02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:28.433
<v Speaker 5>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All like</v>

2833
02:00:30.070 --> 02:00:31.990
<v Speaker 5>they'll raise their hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we were doing this thing,</v>

2834
02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:32.824
<v Speaker 5>I was doing this thing for CBS.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called game show in my head and </v>

2835
02:00:34.931 --> 02:00:36.250
<v Speaker 5>what it was is we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a game show.</v>

2836
02:00:36.251 --> 02:00:39.040
<v Speaker 5>We put this little earpiece in people </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the game shows.</v>

2837
02:00:39.041 --> 02:00:42.970
<v Speaker 5>We would send them out into a pre,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we created this scenario.</v>

2838
02:00:43.090 --> 02:00:45.010
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know what it was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>until they got out there,</v>

2839
02:00:45.011 --> 02:00:46.780
<v Speaker 5>so they'd be standing there and then I'd</v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

2840
02:00:46.781 --> 02:00:47.770
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the deal.</v>

2841
02:00:47.890 --> 02:00:48.723
<v Speaker 5>You are a news reporter and you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>been sent here to do report on someone </v>

2842
02:00:53.891 --> 02:00:58.891
<v Speaker 5>who has seen a Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is that person took off,</v>

2843
02:00:59.710 --> 02:01:00.543
<v Speaker 5>so you need to find a person on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>street that will admit that they saw a </v>

2844
02:01:03.581 --> 02:01:08.230
<v Speaker 5>Ufo and they have to tell you that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were taking a board that Ufo and probed.</v>

2845
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:10.390
<v Speaker 5>If you can get someone to do that on </v>
<v Speaker 5>camera,</v>

2846
02:01:10.570 --> 02:01:13.750
<v Speaker 5>you'll win you and you make the money </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it was like a series of tasks,</v>

2847
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:14.623
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2848
02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:16.240
<v Speaker 5>They all did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2849
02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:18.100
<v Speaker 5>Every one of the ass did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all fucking did it.</v>

2850
02:01:18.101 --> 02:01:18.934
<v Speaker 5>And I was watching these people and that</v>
<v Speaker 5>was the first draw in what broke the </v>

2851
02:01:22.331 --> 02:01:23.164
<v Speaker 5>camel's back to me that a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories are bullshit because I was </v>

2852
02:01:26.381 --> 02:01:30.670
<v Speaker 5>watching these people come up with these</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking stories on the fly.</v>

2853
02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:31.753
<v Speaker 5>They weren't actors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They weren't alerted of it in advance </v>

2854
02:01:34.151 --> 02:01:35.950
<v Speaker 5>where they prepared a story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>

2855
02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:37.570
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in a bind.</v>

2856
02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:38.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm a report.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2857
02:01:38.590 --> 02:01:41.720
<v Speaker 5>We were sent down here and these people </v>
<v Speaker 5>just ran out years ago.</v>

2858
02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Tom Kenny did that for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2859
02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:44.960
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2860
02:01:44.961 --> 02:01:48.020
<v Speaker 2>ask people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing the same thing,</v>

2861
02:01:48.021 --> 02:01:50.130
<v Speaker 2>saying that there's this new movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out.</v>

2862
02:01:50.131 --> 02:01:54.410
<v Speaker 2>It's during Danny to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he would just keep piling on,</v>

2863
02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:55.700
<v Speaker 2>then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2864
02:01:55.701 --> 02:01:58.690
<v Speaker 2>daddy is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's,</v>

2865
02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:00.133
<v Speaker 2>his mother dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so sad seeing Danny devito that </v>

2866
02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:05.810
<v Speaker 2>would just change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would,</v>

2867
02:02:05.811 --> 02:02:06.371
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>

2868
02:02:06.371 --> 02:02:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2869
02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:09.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2870
02:02:09.110 --> 02:02:09.943
<v Speaker 5>If people find out that they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be interviewed and they find out that </v>

2871
02:02:12.261 --> 02:02:13.094
<v Speaker 5>they're on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will do all kinds of crazy things </v>

2872
02:02:16.671 --> 02:02:19.160
<v Speaker 5>to comply with whatever the narrative </v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2873
02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:21.140
<v Speaker 5>is real weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2874
02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.273
<v Speaker 5>And so when you're interviewing people </v>
<v Speaker 5>and ask them about Ufo shows or asked </v>

2875
02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:28.490
<v Speaker 5>him about big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the camera and the fact that you're</v>

2876
02:02:28.491 --> 02:02:32.090
<v Speaker 5>filming alone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it changes the reality of whatever their</v>

2877
02:02:32.091 --> 02:02:33.640
<v Speaker 5>story would or wouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

2878
02:02:33.641 --> 02:02:35.420
<v Speaker 5>it changes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gets adjusted.</v>

2879
02:02:35.630 --> 02:02:36.463
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it becomes a giant factor in whatever </v>

2880
02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:42.440
<v Speaker 5>the story is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact that there's a camera on them.</v>

2881
02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:44.083
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe on the other side of things </v>

2882
02:02:46.101 --> 02:02:47.430
<v Speaker 2>doing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2883
02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:51.590
<v Speaker 2>after doing call me lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot about,</v>

2884
02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:53.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you probably know this,</v>

2885
02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:56.870
<v Speaker 2>obviously I already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people want to tell you their story</v>

2886
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:59.120
<v Speaker 2>and most people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2887
02:02:59.121 --> 02:03:02.180
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't even have to do too much,</v>

2888
02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:04.160
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to make someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>

2889
02:03:04.161 --> 02:03:05.990
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to even be probing too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

2890
02:03:06.230 --> 02:03:07.063
<v Speaker 2>Most people do want to be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people will tell you really </v>

2891
02:03:09.441 --> 02:03:11.060
<v Speaker 2>personal things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about Barry,</v>

2892
02:03:11.061 --> 02:03:13.020
<v Speaker 2>but I'm talking about the other folks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that supported the move.</v>

2893
02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2894
02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:16.333
<v Speaker 2>and I learned when I was doing that doc </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the key was that I had a shut up </v>

2895
02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:24.050
<v Speaker 2>and I had a listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which as a nightclub comedian was really</v>

2896
02:03:24.051 --> 02:03:29.051
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

2897
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to wrap up.</v>

2898
02:03:31.731 --> 02:03:32.564
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2899
02:03:32.770 --> 02:03:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Well let me just bring up this topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're on the road a lot.</v>

2900
02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:37.670
<v Speaker 2>When guys come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end,</v>

2901
02:03:37.671 --> 02:03:39.530
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come in the green room and there,</v>

2902
02:03:39.570 --> 02:03:40.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in their club,</v>

2903
02:03:40.731 --> 02:03:41.564
<v Speaker 2>you're in their home town and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of local guys and they're </v>

2904
02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:44.593
<v Speaker 2>nice and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when they start talking about </v>

2905
02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:48.193
<v Speaker 2>standup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it bore you to tears or are you </v>

2906
02:03:51.501 --> 02:03:52.334
<v Speaker 2>engaged in it?</v>

2907
02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:55.900
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really depends.</v>

2908
02:03:56.110 --> 02:03:58.060
<v Speaker 5>Like who's coming in the green room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Other comics.</v>

2909
02:03:58.160 --> 02:03:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2910
02:03:59.210 --> 02:04:00.043
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to come up and they want to </v>

2911
02:04:01.041 --> 02:04:05.030
<v Speaker 2>start talking to me about comedy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking smack about other comics and I'm</v>

2912
02:04:05.031 --> 02:04:06.230
<v Speaker 2>laying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2913
02:04:06.231 --> 02:04:08.990
<v Speaker 2>if you have any idea how much I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>checked out right now,</v>

2914
02:04:09.590 --> 02:04:13.250
<v Speaker 5>well for me the real problem is like </v>
<v Speaker 5>green rooms before a show.</v>

2915
02:04:13.330 --> 02:04:14.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to get my head together.</v>

2916
02:04:14.930 --> 02:04:18.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really in talking to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm into going over my notes.</v>

2917
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Figuring I want to do with the show.</v>

2918
02:04:19.770 --> 02:04:20.603
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if someone comes in and they get in </v>

2919
02:04:22.401 --> 02:04:24.500
<v Speaker 5>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's my goal,</v>

2920
02:04:24.501 --> 02:04:25.790
<v Speaker 5>you actually say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

2921
02:04:25.791 --> 02:04:28.270
<v Speaker 5>step out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't usually have very many people</v>

2922
02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:29.461
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

2923
02:04:29.461 --> 02:04:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm always hosting this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

2924
02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:34.620
<v Speaker 2>And I'm always just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2925
02:04:34.621 --> 02:04:35.454
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will talk about anything other than </v>

2926
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:38.303
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2927
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:40.980
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I shouldn't admit this publicly,</v>

2928
02:04:40.981 --> 02:04:41.830
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2929
02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:45.240
<v Speaker 2>but when people come up to me and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring up police academy,</v>

2930
02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Swell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2931
02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often I'm,</v>

2932
02:04:50.901 --> 02:04:51.734
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of committing Harry caray </v>

2933
02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.280
<v Speaker 3>while they're talking to me and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>even kidding you.</v>

2934
02:04:55.281 --> 02:04:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2935
02:04:56.271 --> 02:04:57.980
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old were you when you saw it?</v>

2936
02:04:57.981 --> 02:04:59.060
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2937
02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:00.433
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm pulling my end trails out under </v>

2938
02:05:02.121 --> 02:05:02.954
<v Speaker 3>their shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thought that carries you </v>

2939
02:05:05.001 --> 02:05:06.500
<v Speaker 3>through the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me laugh.</v>

2940
02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2941
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:09.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2942
02:05:09.021 --> 02:05:10.100
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you,</v>

2943
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.863
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just thinking that I'm pulling </v>

2944
02:05:13.551 --> 02:05:16.580
<v Speaker 3>my small intestine all over their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know there's,</v>

2945
02:05:17.050 --> 02:05:18.890

<v Speaker 3>we all do.</v>

2946
02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:19.813
<v Speaker 3>We all have that meets your factory or </v>
<v Speaker 3>faculty to start talking about most </v>

2947
02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:22.814
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fire.</v>

2948
02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:24.010

<v Speaker 3>But then after a while you're like,</v>

2951

2952
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:29.203
<v Speaker 3>It's like when they were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like in high school and you </v>

2953
02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:31.580
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear factor for me,</v>

2954

<v Speaker 3>you were when you watch police academy?</v>

2957

2961
02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:49.820

2965
02:05:55.221 --> 02:05:56.054
<v Speaker 3>creative process or writing or </v>
<v Speaker 3>roadblocks or motivation or anything </v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

02:06:00.630 --> 02:06:02.630
<v Speaker 3>I just don't like talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2968
02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:05.150
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this</v>

2969

<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like gossiping about it.</v>

2971
02:06:09.450 --> 02:06:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I like telling stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

2972
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:13.860
<v Speaker 2>I love hearing the funny stories back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth.</v>

2973
02:06:13.861 --> 02:06:15.390
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of laughs.</v>

2974
02:06:15.391 --> 02:06:18.050
<v Speaker 2>But dissecting comedy for some reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2975
02:06:18.110 --> 02:06:18.780
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2978
02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:22.500
<v Speaker 3>uninteresting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2980
02:06:23.131 --> 02:06:24.780
<v Speaker 3>it's understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2981
02:06:24.781 --> 02:06:25.614
<v Speaker 3>what'd you start in like 81 or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and when you might start with </v>

<v Speaker 3>15 and 60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got let her mom was 20.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He would be born with it,</v>

2989
02:06:41.530 --> 02:06:43.170
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you still enjoy doing it.</v>

2990
02:06:43.650 --> 02:06:44.483
<v Speaker 3>I do see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just started to like it when I </v>

2991
02:06:47.641 --> 02:06:50.700
<v Speaker 3>jettison the persona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I even remember that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like I thought I hated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I hated</v>

2993
02:06:53.740 --> 02:06:54.573
<v Speaker 2>the wacky morning shows and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taint and tea bag in the morning and I </v>

<v Speaker 2>That stuff in the clubs and this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2997
02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:04.071
<v Speaker 2>And it's was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2998
02:07:04.071 --> 02:07:05.310
<v Speaker 2>I hate this character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2999
02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I remembered the day it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was like an epiphany.</v>

3000
02:07:08.421 --> 02:07:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I was at xannies and Nashville's loved </v>

02:07:12.230 --> 02:07:14.240
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I knew that I couldn't do it.</v>

3002
02:07:14.241 --> 02:07:15.830
<v Speaker 2>I had to go on as me</v>

3003
02:07:16.650 --> 02:07:19.980
<v Speaker 3>and I made that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you went on door yelling,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3008
02:07:24.630 --> 02:07:26.710
<v Speaker 2>it changed everything shifted after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3009
02:07:26.711 --> 02:07:29.320
<v Speaker 2>And then I started this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3010
02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:31.710
<v Speaker 2>probably like 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

3011
02:07:31.711 --> 02:07:34.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3012
02:07:34.230 --> 02:07:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3013
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:39.220
<v Speaker 11>around 10 years ago and the,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and it changed for me</v>

3014
02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:42.190
<v Speaker 3>and then I liked it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>

3015
02:07:42.370 --> 02:07:43.203
<v Speaker 3>Well you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some guys who just get trapped </v>

3016
02:07:44.051 --> 02:07:44.884
<v Speaker 3>in a persona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were just talking about emo phillips </v>

3017
02:07:46.031 --> 02:07:46.864
<v Speaker 3>the other night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause emo Philips is apparently back to </v>

3018
02:07:48.671 --> 02:07:51.940
<v Speaker 3>his persona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He let it go for a long time and he just</v>

3019
02:07:51.941 --> 02:07:54.610
<v Speaker 3>started just being a guy on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about shit.</v>

3020
02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:57.790
<v Speaker 3>Apparently the people weren't into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3021
02:07:57.810 --> 02:07:59.810
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give the people what they want.</v>

3022
02:07:59.830 --> 02:08:02.950
<v Speaker 3>The story I tell about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should just clarify this is,</v>

3023
02:08:02.951 --> 02:08:04.390
<v Speaker 3>which is what I've heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen him,</v>

3024
02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:05.980
<v Speaker 3>but this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3025
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:08.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>robin was a,</v>

3026
02:08:08.810 --> 02:08:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Williams was my best pal and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3027
02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.360
<v Speaker 3>he got me a job on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

3028
02:08:13.361 --> 02:08:15.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a snickers cumbersome and I needed bread</v>

3029
02:08:16.090 --> 02:08:17.680
<v Speaker 3>and he was so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3030
02:08:17.681 --> 02:08:18.514
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3031
02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:20.000
<v Speaker 3>so I want you to use my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3032
02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:20.681
<v Speaker 3>Bobcat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3033
02:08:20.681 --> 02:08:21.700
<v Speaker 3>he's gotta be in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3034
02:08:21.701 --> 02:08:23.410
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>

3035
02:08:23.470 --> 02:08:24.303
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually put their feet on the fire </v>

3036
02:08:27.071 --> 02:08:29.830
<v Speaker 3>and they had a hire me and then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

3037
02:08:29.831 --> 02:08:30.820
<v Speaker 3>don't take the first money.</v>

3038
02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Just the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3039
02:08:32.530 --> 02:08:34.900
<v Speaker 3>tell him no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I tell them no.</v>

3040
02:08:34.901 --> 02:08:37.220
<v Speaker 3>And then they came back with more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

3041
02:08:37.221 --> 02:08:38.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3042
02:08:38.081 --> 02:08:38.891
<v Speaker 3>he was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3043
02:08:38.891 --> 02:08:40.190
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then he calls what,</v>

3044
02:08:40.230 --> 02:08:41.063
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to want you to do the </v>

3045
02:08:41.711 --> 02:08:43.180
<v Speaker 3>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you okay doing the voice?</v>

3046
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:46.330
<v Speaker 3>And I go for the amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>snickers is paying.</v>

3047
02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:50.890
<v Speaker 3>I will fuck a snickers behind camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

3048
02:08:50.891 --> 02:08:55.891
<v Speaker 3>I should say it's really good candy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's my all time favorite.</v>

3049
02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:58.001
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3050
02:08:58.001 --> 02:08:59.560
<v Speaker 3>I said I was going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something,</v>

3051
02:08:59.690 --> 02:09:00.200
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3052
02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:02.090
<v Speaker 11>we'll address a little bit and talk </v>
<v Speaker 11>about,</v>

3053
02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:03.260
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>robin had,</v>

3054
02:09:03.261 --> 02:09:03.970
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>his,</v>

3055
02:09:03.970 --> 02:09:08.950
<v Speaker 11>his coroner's report came out and he had</v>
<v Speaker 11>lewy body dementia and that is a,</v>

3056
02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:09.933
<v Speaker 11>it's a form of dementia that is very </v>
<v Speaker 11>rarely ever discovered when someone's </v>

3057
02:09:15.111 --> 02:09:17.750
<v Speaker 11>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's usually discovered in there.</v>

3058
02:09:17.810 --> 02:09:22.310
<v Speaker 11>They're a autopsy.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So he had this form of dementia.</v>

3059
02:09:22.311 --> 02:09:27.260
<v Speaker 11>I witnessed it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It was missed a diagnosis.</v>

3060
02:09:27.261 --> 02:09:29.010
<v Speaker 11>Parkinson's.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Ah,</v>

3061
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:30.223
<v Speaker 11>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I witnessed this eye witnesses </v>

3062
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:37.390
<v Speaker 11>processing reality completely different </v>
<v Speaker 11>than the way every body else does.</v>

3063
02:09:37.611 --> 02:09:39.650
<v Speaker 11>What causes it?</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's,</v>

3064
02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:42.310
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm not sure if it's a gene or what,</v>

3065
02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:44.480
<v Speaker 11>but I mean it is,</v>
<v Speaker 11>sadly,</v>

3066
02:09:44.481 --> 02:09:48.530
<v Speaker 11>his brain was riddled with this.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And so when I think about that,</v>

3067
02:09:48.531 --> 02:09:52.610
<v Speaker 11>I think about how strong he was.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>

3068
02:09:52.611 --> 02:09:53.444
<v Speaker 11>you would have like some days,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you'd have a lot of days where he was </v>

3069
02:09:57.380 --> 02:10:02.010
<v Speaker 11>doing kind of ocd stuff and processing </v>
<v Speaker 11>things incorrectly,</v>

3070
02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:03.980
<v Speaker 11>but then you'd have a day where he was </v>
<v Speaker 11>back.</v>

3071
02:10:04.100 --> 02:10:07.910
<v Speaker 11>So you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 11>oh well maybe set a bad day or no,</v>

3072
02:10:07.911 --> 02:10:11.330
<v Speaker 11>maybe it's the Parkinson's drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 11>they've got to get those dialed in.</v>

3073
02:10:11.331 --> 02:10:12.080
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he had,</v>

3074
02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:14.720
<v Speaker 11>he was going to doctors use in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he was doing,</v>

3075
02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:15.853
<v Speaker 11>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the only reason I talk about that this </v>

3076
02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:20.420
<v Speaker 11>is his brain was giving him </v>
<v Speaker 11>misinformation,</v>

3077
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:22.310
<v Speaker 11>completeness,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Information.</v>

3078
02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:28.180
<v Speaker 11>And I don't if some people die from </v>
<v Speaker 11>depression and uh,</v>

3079
02:10:29.450 --> 02:10:32.120
<v Speaker 11>and my heart goes out to them,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but that's not what killed him.</v>

3080
02:10:32.121 --> 02:10:33.160
<v Speaker 11>He,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he,</v>

3081
02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:34.273
<v Speaker 11>he really was getting misinformation </v>
<v Speaker 11>from his own brain and was suffering </v>

3082
02:10:37.701 --> 02:10:38.534
<v Speaker 11>from this disease.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So I just put that out there because I </v>

3083
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:44.160
<v Speaker 11>have folks know that we were friends in </v>
<v Speaker 11>there.</v>

3084
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:46.220
<v Speaker 11>They'll ask me about it and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>

3085
02:10:46.290 --> 02:10:50.390
<v Speaker 11>and I would like a spotlight put on the </v>
<v Speaker 11>disease.</v>

3086
02:10:50.391 --> 02:10:55.391
<v Speaker 11>That actually in my mind was what was </v>
<v Speaker 11>responsible for his demise.</v>

3087
02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:58.490
<v Speaker 11>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>a lot of people say,</v>

3088
02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:00.150
<v Speaker 11>did he ever talk about suicide?</v>

3089
02:11:00.150 --> 02:11:01.350
<v Speaker 11>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what comics?</v>

3090
02:11:01.351 --> 02:11:06.090
<v Speaker 11>We talked about suicide for 33 years.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Sometimes we talk about other shit,</v>

3091
02:11:06.091 --> 02:11:07.530
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>hey,</v>

3092
02:11:07.531 --> 02:11:09.690
<v Speaker 11>congratulations on the ASCA.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Oh thank you.</v>

3093
02:11:09.691 --> 02:11:10.530
<v Speaker 11>How would you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't know.</v>

3094
02:11:10.531 --> 02:11:12.770
<v Speaker 11>I think a car,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3095
02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:15.690
<v Speaker 11>but I just say that because he fought,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3096
02:11:15.691 --> 02:11:17.220
<v Speaker 11>that's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't know about you,</v>

3097
02:11:17.221 --> 02:11:19.140
<v Speaker 11>but a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's what we do.</v>

3098
02:11:19.141 --> 02:11:21.450
<v Speaker 11>We fight depression.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Things don't add up.</v>

3099
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:23.490
<v Speaker 11>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 11>this world doesn't seem right.</v>

3100
02:11:23.491 --> 02:11:28.350
<v Speaker 11>And we go out and we spew about it and I</v>
<v Speaker 11>feel better on a selfish level.</v>

3101
02:11:28.351 --> 02:11:31.970
<v Speaker 11>I don't really give a rat's ass,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3102
02:11:32.050 --> 02:11:34.620
<v Speaker 11>I vent and I feel like better.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And,</v>

3103
02:11:34.670 --> 02:11:37.380
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and he fought it.</v>

3104
02:11:37.410 --> 02:11:40.020
<v Speaker 11>And that wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it wasn't depression.</v>

3105
02:11:40.021 --> 02:11:41.130
<v Speaker 11>It wasn't career.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It wasn't,</v>

3106
02:11:41.630 --> 02:11:44.130
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he'd been sober most of his adult life,</v>

3107
02:11:44.210 --> 02:11:44.950
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so,</v>

3108
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:45.783
<v Speaker 11>so it's very disturbing to me that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 11>of people were trying to attribute all </v>

3109
02:11:48.581 --> 02:11:50.500
<v Speaker 11>sorts of reasons for why he did it.</v>

3110
02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:52.540
<v Speaker 11>And even there was a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

3111
02:11:52.810 --> 02:11:53.643
<v Speaker 11>well that's the main things.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Rights groups that were attributing it </v>

3112
02:11:56.110 --> 02:11:56.943
<v Speaker 11>to,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

3113
02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:58.800
<v Speaker 11>his divorce settlements,</v>
<v Speaker 11>brother.</v>

3114
02:11:58.960 --> 02:11:59.793
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>There was a whole thing where this guy </v>

3115
02:12:01.391 --> 02:12:05.120
<v Speaker 11>was doing this video and I even talked </v>
<v Speaker 11>to them about it.</v>

3116
02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:08.770
<v Speaker 11>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he had,</v>

3117
02:12:09.490 --> 02:12:10.770
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the disease.</v>

3118
02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:15.660
<v Speaker 11>He had a disease that caused dementia </v>
<v Speaker 11>that I witnessed.</v>

3119
02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:18.180
<v Speaker 11>I didn't have anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I talked to him more,</v>

3120
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:23.430
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I talked to him and text and every day I</v>

3121
02:12:23.431 --> 02:12:25.200
<v Speaker 11>didn't have a buddy that I talked to him</v>
<v Speaker 11>more.</v>

3122
02:12:25.530 --> 02:12:30.530
<v Speaker 11>So just to be it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it wasn't a divorce,</v>

3123
02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:34.130
<v Speaker 11>it wasn't his family,</v>
<v Speaker 11>wasn't it?</v>

3124
02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:37.210
<v Speaker 11>We have the same agent.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So like when this guy was saying,</v>

3125
02:12:37.230 --> 02:12:38.063
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>this is one of the reason why it pissed </v>

3126
02:12:38.491 --> 02:12:39.960
<v Speaker 11>me off because this guy was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3127
02:12:39.961 --> 02:12:41.670
<v Speaker 11>he's in financial ruins.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Like,</v>

3128
02:12:41.671 --> 02:12:42.330
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he wasn't.</v>

3129
02:12:42.330 --> 02:12:43.620
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>
<v Speaker 11>he was wealthy.</v>

3130
02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:44.550
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

3131
02:12:44.551 --> 02:12:46.080
<v Speaker 11>And also it's,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's,</v>

3132
02:12:46.081 --> 02:12:47.730
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's,</v>

3133
02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:48.510
<v Speaker 11>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

3134
02:12:48.510 --> 02:12:49.700
<v Speaker 11>no one wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

3135
02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:53.390
<v Speaker 11>because as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we're trying to make sense of,</v>

3136
02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:54.410
<v Speaker 11>of,</v>
<v Speaker 11>of,</v>

3137
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:55.303
<v Speaker 11>of one why,</v>
<v Speaker 11>why that happened and why that happened </v>

3138
02:12:58.710 --> 02:13:01.110
<v Speaker 11>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is right.</v>

3139
02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.230
<v Speaker 11>What's his brain was with no more than </v>
<v Speaker 11>you,</v>

3140
02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:06.090
<v Speaker 11>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 11>his brain was getting,</v>

3141
02:13:06.550 --> 02:13:07.383
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>misinformation and he was processing </v>

3142
02:13:09.721 --> 02:13:11.250
<v Speaker 11>reality completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

3143
02:13:11.251 --> 02:13:13.080
<v Speaker 11>I,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I won't go into details,</v>

3144
02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:14.213
<v Speaker 11>but I did witness him thinking things </v>
<v Speaker 11>that weren't real were happening to me </v>

3145
02:13:22.111 --> 02:13:23.760
<v Speaker 11>in the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And that's the other thing,</v>

3146
02:13:23.761 --> 02:13:24.391
<v Speaker 11>like people say,</v>
<v Speaker 11>oh,</v>

3147
02:13:24.391 --> 02:13:26.130
<v Speaker 11>he wasn't in the same bedroom as his </v>
<v Speaker 11>wife.</v>

3148
02:13:26.131 --> 02:13:26.551
<v Speaker 11>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>yeah,</v>

3149
02:13:26.551 --> 02:13:29.220
<v Speaker 11>because he was having seizures and he </v>
<v Speaker 11>didn't like to wake her up.</v>

3150
02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:30.713
<v Speaker 11>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's not a of somebody not getting </v>

3151
02:13:33.151 --> 02:13:35.100
<v Speaker 11>along.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I didn't mean to get so personal.</v>

3152
02:13:35.210 --> 02:13:36.043
<v Speaker 11>They don't mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And I don't mean to talk about about </v>

3153
02:13:38.131 --> 02:13:38.840
<v Speaker 11>his,</v>
<v Speaker 11>his,</v>

3154
02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:42.240
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>his home life because you know,</v>

3155
02:13:42.610 --> 02:13:46.170
<v Speaker 11>Susan's a wonderful Gal and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>

3156
02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:48.660
<v Speaker 11>and it's just sad,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know?</v>

3157
02:13:50.050 --> 02:13:50.970
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's awful.</v>

3158
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.863
<v Speaker 11>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 11>one of the scariest things is I'm </v>

3159
02:13:53.730 --> 02:13:56.490
<v Speaker 11>talking to someone who's,</v>
<v Speaker 11>whether it's a loved one,</v>

3160
02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:59.730
<v Speaker 11>a father,</v>
<v Speaker 11>mother that's losing their grip.</v>

3161
02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:03.780
<v Speaker 11>And I think people were s they were </v>
<v Speaker 11>courteous to a point,</v>

3162
02:14:03.781 --> 02:14:04.614
<v Speaker 11>but I don't think they take his,</v>
<v Speaker 11>his kids and the consideration and </v>

3163
02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:12.150
<v Speaker 11>friends and people worked with him for </v>
<v Speaker 11>all these years.</v>

3164
02:14:12.151 --> 02:14:14.040
<v Speaker 11>And I guess I can't expect them to,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3165
02:14:14.041 --> 02:14:16.830
<v Speaker 11>I mean I'm sure I've taken shots at </v>
<v Speaker 11>people when they pass away,</v>

3166
02:14:16.831 --> 02:14:17.664
<v Speaker 11>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's like people would come up and they </v>

3167
02:14:20.161 --> 02:14:21.150
<v Speaker 11>go,</v>
<v Speaker 11>did you hear?</v>

3168
02:14:21.151 --> 02:14:23.820
<v Speaker 11>What did you,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what rush limbaugh said?</v>

3169
02:14:23.821 --> 02:14:25.620
<v Speaker 11>And I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't care.</v>

3170
02:14:25.621 --> 02:14:26.454
<v Speaker 11>What were some of the says?</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm dealing with people who dealt with </v>

3171
02:14:29.371 --> 02:14:31.560
<v Speaker 11>them on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Let me ask you this,</v>

3172
02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:35.400
<v Speaker 11>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 11>What is this impulse that people have to</v>

3173
02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:37.920
<v Speaker 11>denigrate people right after they die?</v>

3174
02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:41.970
<v Speaker 11>It's almost like everyone else is,</v>
<v Speaker 11>everyone else is talking about that.</v>

3175
02:14:41.971 --> 02:14:42.804
<v Speaker 11>Like I saw a lot of that with prince </v>
<v Speaker 11>when it was revealed that prince was </v>

3176
02:14:46.051 --> 02:14:49.380
<v Speaker 11>suffering through opiate addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

3177
02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:50.543
<v Speaker 11>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well there was like gene Simmons said </v>

3178
02:14:52.291 --> 02:14:53.124
<v Speaker 11>some crazy shit and he had to apologize </v>
<v Speaker 11>and I'd seen some other people say it </v>

3179
02:14:56.321 --> 02:14:59.340
<v Speaker 11>too.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But what it's almost like it's a crunch,</v>

3180
02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:02.310
<v Speaker 11>a contrarian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Like everyone else is saying,</v>

3181
02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:04.050
<v Speaker 11>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we lost his genius.</v>

3182
02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:07.830
<v Speaker 11>Well you get heat from it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And I'm sure in Gene Simmons is,</v>

3183
02:15:08.430 --> 02:15:10.710
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm sure there's a jealousy thing,</v>

3184
02:15:10.711 --> 02:15:11.670
<v Speaker 11>but you say,</v>
<v Speaker 11>look,</v>

3185
02:15:11.671 --> 02:15:12.504
<v Speaker 11>I used to say outrageous things about </v>
<v Speaker 11>people and this bomb would go off and I </v>

3186
02:15:16.621 --> 02:15:18.750
<v Speaker 11>would get,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I would get some heat and now I get some</v>

3187
02:15:18.751 --> 02:15:22.430
<v Speaker 11>buzz and I stopped doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I made a decision,</v>

3188
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:23.743
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>realizing that these weren't just a </v>

3189
02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:27.600
<v Speaker 11>harmless things I was saying.</v>

3190
02:15:27.630 --> 02:15:28.290
<v Speaker 11>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 11>right,</v>

3191
02:15:28.290 --> 02:15:29.071
<v Speaker 11>right.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You just,</v>

3192
02:15:29.071 --> 02:15:30.560
<v Speaker 11>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

3193
02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:33.210
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it was,</v>

3194
02:15:34.650 --> 02:15:35.483
<v Speaker 11>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Cause there are a lot of that when Kurt </v>

3195
02:15:36.121 --> 02:15:38.400
<v Speaker 11>cobain died too.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But you know,</v>

3196
02:15:38.401 --> 02:15:42.600
<v Speaker 11>and that's the W W W W I wasn't best </v>
<v Speaker 11>these with Kurt,</v>

3197
02:15:42.630 --> 02:15:45.570
<v Speaker 11>but I did know him.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I toured with Nirvana,</v>

3198
02:15:45.570 --> 02:15:46.403
<v Speaker 11>Kurt,</v>
<v Speaker 11>like my standup and asked me to go on </v>

3199
02:15:47.671 --> 02:15:48.504
<v Speaker 11>the road with them.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I did a bunch of days then we talked </v>

3200
02:15:50.671 --> 02:15:51.420
<v Speaker 11>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But,</v>

3201
02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:52.253
<v Speaker 11>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean it wasn't like the situation was </v>

3202
02:15:53.881 --> 02:15:54.660
<v Speaker 11>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but,</v>

3203
02:15:54.660 --> 02:15:55.493
<v Speaker 11>but I did have times in my life where I </v>
<v Speaker 11>spent hours with Kurt when the o </v>

3204
02:15:59.981 --> 02:16:02.970
<v Speaker 11>announce sitting around talking and </v>
<v Speaker 11>laughing,</v>

3205
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:05.040
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

3206
02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:07.710
<v Speaker 11>I don't know why we want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think,</v>

3207
02:16:07.711 --> 02:16:11.840
<v Speaker 11>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think we try to make sense of it.</v>

3208
02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:13.710
<v Speaker 11>I think we tried to make sense of it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think.</v>

3209
02:16:13.950 --> 02:16:16.770
<v Speaker 11>I think that's where a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 11>conspiracies come from.</v>

3210
02:16:16.770 --> 02:16:17.603
<v Speaker 11>I think when when someone who's in our </v>
<v Speaker 11>mind reach the American dream and then </v>

3211
02:16:22.591 --> 02:16:26.790
<v Speaker 11>they die or look or come or take their </v>
<v Speaker 11>life or overdose,</v>

3212
02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:28.351
<v Speaker 11>we have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

3213
02:16:28.351 --> 02:16:29.184
<v Speaker 11>they had it all and that's what we </v>
<v Speaker 11>believe is the ultimate fulfillment and </v>

3214
02:16:33.071 --> 02:16:33.940
<v Speaker 11>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>

3215
02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:37.060
<v Speaker 11>America is the People's Republic of </v>
<v Speaker 11>spring break.</v>

3216
02:16:37.061 --> 02:16:39.010
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>where no one's pursuing fulfillment.</v>

3217
02:16:39.011 --> 02:16:42.010
<v Speaker 11>Everyone's pursuing happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>

3218
02:16:42.011 --> 02:16:44.980
<v Speaker 11>there's two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm really fulfilled.</v>

3219
02:16:44.981 --> 02:16:46.780
<v Speaker 11>Am I happy?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Am I laughing all day?</v>

3220
02:16:46.781 --> 02:16:49.300
<v Speaker 11>Am I know?</v>
<v Speaker 11>But you're happy sometimes I'm happy.</v>

3221
02:16:49.301 --> 02:16:50.134
<v Speaker 11>A lot of the time I've never not talk.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Like if I didn't know that you're this </v>

3222
02:16:54.191 --> 02:16:55.024
<v Speaker 11>nuance guy that's very thoughtful and </v>
<v Speaker 11>you have a lot of opinions and you're </v>

3223
02:16:57.851 --> 02:17:00.430
<v Speaker 11>always considering all answered.</v>
<v Speaker 11>If I just took,</v>

3224
02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:05.460
<v Speaker 11>like if I tried to form a view of you </v>
<v Speaker 11>based on you and I talking,</v>

3225
02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:07.360
<v Speaker 11>we're always laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

3226
02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:08.380
<v Speaker 11>I would say bobcat.</v>

3227
02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:10.420
<v Speaker 11>So jolly.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Every time we talk to them,</v>

3228
02:17:10.421 --> 02:17:14.170
<v Speaker 11>it's like laughs and hugs and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but it is true and it's,</v>

3229
02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:16.200
<v Speaker 11>and it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

3230
02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:18.250
<v Speaker 11>cause we never see each other before </v>
<v Speaker 11>noon,</v>

3231
02:17:18.310 --> 02:17:22.060
<v Speaker 11>first of all.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But it's a,</v>

3232
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:24.730
<v Speaker 11>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's a daily reprieve.</v>

3233
02:17:24.731 --> 02:17:26.800
<v Speaker 11>It's a daily decision.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>

3234
02:17:26.801 --> 02:17:30.700
<v Speaker 11>I get up,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the squirrels are up before I do and I,</v>

3235
02:17:30.701 --> 02:17:35.230
<v Speaker 11>and I beat him down and then it turns </v>
<v Speaker 11>and when I'm directing on a set,</v>

3236
02:17:35.231 --> 02:17:36.064
<v Speaker 11>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I can react and fear or I can just sit </v>

3237
02:17:38.651 --> 02:17:41.860
<v Speaker 11>here for a second or two in.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It all usually works out.</v>

3238
02:17:41.890 --> 02:17:44.410
<v Speaker 11>Very rarely do I have to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Go Man,</v>

3239
02:17:44.470 --> 02:17:46.030
<v Speaker 11>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you just sit there.</v>

3240
02:17:46.450 --> 02:17:47.283
<v Speaker 11>I think so much of show business,</v>
<v Speaker 11>everything's based on fear and people </v>

3241
02:17:50.321 --> 02:17:51.154
<v Speaker 11>thinking someone's going to say you </v>
<v Speaker 11>screwed up or you didn't do it right or </v>

3242
02:17:53.171 --> 02:17:55.090
<v Speaker 11>you didn't get extra takes and all that </v>
<v Speaker 11>stuff.</v>

3243
02:17:55.570 --> 02:17:59.140
<v Speaker 11>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 11>my job is really not to to freak out.</v>

3244
02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:02.050
<v Speaker 11>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I really happy right now.</v>

3245
02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:03.910
<v Speaker 11>Well that's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 11>man.</v>

3246
02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:06.340
<v Speaker 11>I think you're doing some awesome work.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I really do.</v>

3247
02:18:06.610 --> 02:18:09.730
<v Speaker 11>I have to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>

3248
02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:12.040
<v Speaker 11>because that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that's very an American.</v>

3249
02:18:12.050 --> 02:18:13.450
<v Speaker 11>You never quit.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Never give up.</v>

3250
02:18:13.451 --> 02:18:14.410
<v Speaker 11>It's like quit,</v>
<v Speaker 11>quit,</v>

3251
02:18:14.411 --> 02:18:15.041

<v Speaker 11>quit.</v>

3252
02:18:15.041 --> 02:18:18.160
<v Speaker 11>And then until you end up someplace </v>
<v Speaker 11>where you don't want to leave,</v>

3253
02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.980
<v Speaker 11>and that's what I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Quit everything.</v>

3254
02:18:20.981 --> 02:18:22.690
<v Speaker 11>That doesn't feel right.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That doesn't,</v>

3255
02:18:22.691 --> 02:18:23.524
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>when,</v>

3256
02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:26.260
<v Speaker 11>when I made the decision not to go on </v>
<v Speaker 11>auditions,</v>

3257
02:18:26.410 --> 02:18:29.350
<v Speaker 11>it was scary and it became the best </v>
<v Speaker 11>thing that ever happened to me.</v>

3258
02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:32.740
<v Speaker 11>All of a sudden I'm freed up and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 11>writing screenplays and I'm doing,</v>

3259
02:18:32.770 --> 02:18:34.180
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's like,</v>

3260
02:18:34.181 --> 02:18:35.470

<v Speaker 11>in the public eye for a long period of </v>
<v Speaker 11>time,</v>

3314
02:20:26.571 --> 02:20:28.670
<v Speaker 11>important points that you want to make,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know?</v>

3315
02:20:28.671 --> 02:20:32.900
<v Speaker 11>And then there's mistakes and there's </v>
<v Speaker 11>impulses and we've all met those.</v>

3316
02:20:32.901 --> 02:20:33.800
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But that's,</v>

3317
02:20:33.890 --> 02:20:35.480
<v Speaker 11>that's the best part.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

3318
02:20:35.540 --> 02:20:38.670
<v Speaker 11>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 11>If I was on a set and,</v>

3319
02:20:38.690 --> 02:20:39.523
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and I felt people weren't having an </v>

3320
02:20:41.811 --> 02:20:43.240
<v Speaker 11>enjoyable time,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it would,</v>

3321
02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:45.670
<v Speaker 11>not that it needs to be a party,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but if you know,</v>

3322
02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:48.200
<v Speaker 11>people felt compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it would really bother me.</v>

3323
02:20:48.410 --> 02:20:48.981
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>for sure.</v>

3324
02:20:48.981 --> 02:20:49.814
<v Speaker 11>Look if you were having an actor to a </v>
<v Speaker 11>part that they just really didn't </v>

3325
02:20:51.891 --> 02:20:54.920
<v Speaker 11>believe in and thought the piece was </v>
<v Speaker 11>paying off the process.</v>

3326
02:20:54.921 --> 02:20:56.990
<v Speaker 11>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Was was unpleasant.</v>

3327
02:20:57.020 --> 02:20:58.160
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

3328
02:20:58.161 --> 02:21:01.070
<v Speaker 11>my sets are usually pretty ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3329
02:21:01.071 --> 02:21:02.960
<v Speaker 11>I'm the one that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 11>internalizing,</v>

3330
02:21:02.961 --> 02:21:04.730
<v Speaker 11>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3331
02:21:04.731 --> 02:21:05.900
<v Speaker 11>I can't explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Like,</v>

3332
02:21:05.901 --> 02:21:08.210
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>like when I was on Kimmel,</v>

3333
02:21:08.211 --> 02:21:09.720
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I remember once I,</v>

3334
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:12.880
<v Speaker 11>I spent $8,000 and I bought</v>

3335
02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:15.733
<v Speaker 11>10 tons of snow and put it in the </v>
<v Speaker 11>parking lot for Christmas and Jimmy </v>

3336
02:21:20.301 --> 02:21:21.260
<v Speaker 11>looks at the window,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it goes,</v>

3337
02:21:21.261 --> 02:21:23.860
<v Speaker 11>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what does that Disney have a,</v>

3338
02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:26.240
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I bought snow for everybody.</v>

3339
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:29.030
<v Speaker 11>It's like go play and stole my God.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We made,</v>

3340
02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:30.440
<v Speaker 11>we made,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we went sledding,</v>

3341
02:21:30.441 --> 02:21:32.930
<v Speaker 11>we made ramps.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We had the hugest snowball fight.</v>

3342
02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:34.460
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>life's short.</v>

3343
02:21:34.910 --> 02:21:36.980
<v Speaker 11>I remember once everybody wanted to kill</v>
<v Speaker 11>each other,</v>

3344
02:21:36.981 --> 02:21:41.670
<v Speaker 11>so I rented one of those giant balloon </v>
<v Speaker 11>bounces and you know,</v>

3345
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:44.480
<v Speaker 11>everybody just bounced around and it was</v>
<v Speaker 11>nobody,</v>

3346
02:21:44.481 --> 02:21:46.610
<v Speaker 11>there was no pressure on the set </v>
<v Speaker 11>anymore.</v>

3347
02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:48.913
<v Speaker 11>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 11>did you like doing that show or was it </v>

3348
02:21:50.751 --> 02:21:52.100
<v Speaker 11>just really,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I really,</v>

3349
02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:57.160
<v Speaker 11>I really liked it a lot and then,</v>
<v Speaker 11>then I actually loved it and then when I</v>

3350
02:21:57.951 --> 02:22:00.470
<v Speaker 11>started to realize I was,</v>

3351
02:22:01.130 --> 02:22:01.963
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3352
02:22:03.340 --> 02:22:04.173
<v Speaker 11>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'll be really honest right now when I </v>

3353
02:22:05.321 --> 02:22:07.150
<v Speaker 11>started to feel like I was starting to </v>
<v Speaker 11>phone it in,</v>

3354
02:22:07.151 --> 02:22:07.984
<v Speaker 11>I was like going,</v>
<v Speaker 11>this is not fair to my friend Brian who </v>

3355
02:22:11.261 --> 02:22:12.550

3356
02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:16.510
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we do a lot of directions,</v>

3357

<v Speaker 11>You did.</v>

3358
02:22:17.310 --> 02:22:18.010
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I ran into,</v>

3359
02:22:18.010 --> 02:22:19.470
<v Speaker 11>in New York when you were doing the </v>
<v Speaker 11>Chappelle show,</v>

3360
02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:22.840
<v Speaker 11>worked on Chappelle the very first </v>
<v Speaker 11>episode.</v>

3361
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:23.261
<v Speaker 11>It,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>

3362
02:22:23.261 --> 02:22:25.240
<v Speaker 11>I would work at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>

3363
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:26.343
<v Speaker 11>Dave Chappelle's not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's the other thing that drives me </v>

3364
02:22:28.381 --> 02:22:29.080
<v Speaker 11>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3365
02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:29.913
<v Speaker 11>cause he walked away,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I saw those people micromanage him </v>

3366
02:22:32.341 --> 02:22:34.560
<v Speaker 11>and drive him nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 11>They were so rude.</v>

3367
02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:35.730
<v Speaker 11>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 11>there's not crazy.</v>

3368
02:22:35.731 --> 02:22:37.230
<v Speaker 11>He's a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I love Dave.</v>

3369
02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:38.820
<v Speaker 11>He's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 11>very brilliant guy.</v>

3370
02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:40.260
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I very smart and aware.</v>

3371
02:22:40.261 --> 02:22:43.140
<v Speaker 11>And how's the Kahunas to do what you </v>
<v Speaker 11>said,</v>

3372
02:22:43.141 --> 02:22:45.780
<v Speaker 11>to quit,</v>
<v Speaker 11>to walk away from 50 million bucks.</v>

3373
02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:48.760
<v Speaker 11>I'm uncomfortable saying this story,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I don't know,</v>

3374
02:22:49.140 --> 02:22:51.510
<v Speaker 11>he's just trying to use,</v>
<v Speaker 11>cause I,</v>

3375
02:22:51.610 --> 02:22:55.920
<v Speaker 11>I know the semantics of the language,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'll just say what happened.</v>

3376
02:22:56.110 --> 02:22:58.350
<v Speaker 11>People can make whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But I was,</v>

3377
02:22:58.770 --> 02:22:59.603
<v Speaker 11>I was directing the show and white </v>
<v Speaker 11>comedy central executives came down and </v>

3378
02:23:02.701 --> 02:23:04.140
<v Speaker 11>asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they said,</v>

3379
02:23:04.141 --> 02:23:06.930
<v Speaker 11>can you tell Dave not the same nigger so</v>
<v Speaker 11>much?</v>

3380
02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:09.450
<v Speaker 11>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Dave,</v>

3381
02:23:09.660 --> 02:23:10.493
<v Speaker 11>the white comedy central executives in </v>
<v Speaker 11>front of him so much that goes Bobcat </v>

3382
02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:20.940
<v Speaker 11>Push Pasha,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what did you say?</v>

3383
02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:25.920
<v Speaker 11>It was really weird and awkward and then</v>
<v Speaker 11>they left.</v>

3384
02:23:25.921 --> 02:23:28.650
<v Speaker 11>Like I intentionally thought,</v>
<v Speaker 11>well this will be embarrassing for them.</v>

3385
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:30.750
<v Speaker 11>This is exactly what you told me.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Oh good.</v>

3386
02:23:30.810 --> 02:23:31.643
<v Speaker 11>Cause cause yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I don't think I've ever come forward </v>

3387
02:23:33.451 --> 02:23:34.201
<v Speaker 11>that story,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but yeah,</v>

3388
02:23:34.201 --> 02:23:36.900
<v Speaker 11>I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm witness to that insanity.</v>

3389
02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:39.620
<v Speaker 5>As the show became more and more </v>
<v Speaker 5>successful,</v>

3390
02:23:39.621 --> 02:23:40.454
<v Speaker 5>apparently what had happened was </v>
<v Speaker 5>advertisers were skittish about being </v>

3391
02:23:43.401 --> 02:23:44.630
<v Speaker 5>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though,</v>

3392
02:23:44.690 --> 02:23:47.540
<v Speaker 5>even though it's gangbusters ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they still were like,</v>

3393
02:23:47.541 --> 02:23:48.374
<v Speaker 5>he's keeps saying the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Toyota doesn't really want to be </v>

3394
02:23:52.971 --> 02:23:55.340
<v Speaker 5>involved with the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what to do.</v>

3395
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:56.663
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3396
02:23:56.810 --> 02:23:57.561
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3397
02:23:57.561 --> 02:23:59.780
<v Speaker 5>they took,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion,</v>

3398
02:23:59.781 --> 02:24:02.420
<v Speaker 5>the greatest sketch comedy show of all </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

3399
02:24:02.450 --> 02:24:04.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything that </v>
<v Speaker 5>comes close.</v>

3400
02:24:04.081 --> 02:24:07.130
<v Speaker 5>So I think it was two years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So one of my greatest accomplishments as</v>

3401
02:24:07.131 --> 02:24:07.964
<v Speaker 5>an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause I don't really like much what I </v>

3402
02:24:09.861 --> 02:24:10.694
<v Speaker 5>did except for news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but one of the greatest accomplishments </v>

3403
02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:13.753
<v Speaker 5>mean he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I was on the greatest show </v>

3404
02:24:14.541 --> 02:24:15.374
<v Speaker 5>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a couple sketches on the greatest </v>

3405
02:24:16.461 --> 02:24:17.294
<v Speaker 5>show of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really think that show was the all </v>

3406
02:24:19.401 --> 02:24:20.234
<v Speaker 5>time most innovative and hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 5>sketch comedy show ever from the haters </v>

3407
02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:25.790
<v Speaker 5>ball.</v>

3408
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:30.790
<v Speaker 5>Like the haters convention to the Black </v>
<v Speaker 5>Blind.</v>

3409
02:24:31.310 --> 02:24:36.150
<v Speaker 5>A waste of white supremacist too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could go down the list of the</v>

3410
02:24:36.151 --> 02:24:39.170
<v Speaker 5>Rick James and draft the racial draft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3411
02:24:39.171 --> 02:24:41.990
<v Speaker 5>I mean he had so many killer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>killer,</v>

3412
02:24:41.991 --> 02:24:43.220
<v Speaker 5>killer bits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were just,</v>

3413
02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:45.200
<v Speaker 5>it was so original.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's brilliant.</v>

3414
02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:47.930
<v Speaker 5>Well that's one of the most offensive </v>
<v Speaker 5>things about what's going on now.</v>

3415
02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:49.033
<v Speaker 5>Like there's so much rehashed and </v>
<v Speaker 5>regenerated and just did this take like </v>

3416
02:24:53.841 --> 02:24:54.674
<v Speaker 5>a script,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a take a sketch from mad TV and they </v>

3417
02:24:57.081 --> 02:25:01.880
<v Speaker 5>sorta rework it and spit it out today on</v>
<v Speaker 5>some new show and it's fucking gross.</v>

3418
02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:03.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what you're seeing.</v>

3419
02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:06.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what Amy Schumer's getting accused of,</v>

3420
02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:07.213
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're seeing over and over again </v>

3421
02:25:07.731 --> 02:25:08.564
<v Speaker 5>and they keep showing these sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well here was a sketch that was on mad </v>

3422
02:25:10.401 --> 02:25:11.900
<v Speaker 5>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's a sketchup was on this,</v>

02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:15.260
<v Speaker 5>here was the sketches that he never saw </v>
<v Speaker 5>that with Chappelle was Chapelle.</v>

3424
02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:17.990
<v Speaker 5>All those sketches were unique and </v>
<v Speaker 5>unusual.</v>

3425
02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:20.740
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And it was also kind of a,</v>

3426
02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:25.480
<v Speaker 11>the funny thing was also in the editing </v>
<v Speaker 11>process,</v>

3427
02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:28.760
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>following the ball,</v>

3428
02:25:28.761 --> 02:25:29.870
<v Speaker 12>like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like</v>

3429
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:34.500
<v Speaker 11>we would discover stuff that was just </v>
<v Speaker 11>funny in the in,</v>

3430
02:25:34.570 --> 02:25:35.780
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I can't explain it.</v>

3431
02:25:36.530 --> 02:25:37.363
<v Speaker 11>It's like we're cutting this a </v>
<v Speaker 11>Mitsubishi commercial and the woman </v>

3432
02:25:41.010 --> 02:25:41.843
<v Speaker 11>there,</v>
<v Speaker 11>her breasts came out during the filming </v>

3433
02:25:44.391 --> 02:25:45.224
<v Speaker 11>and not in this part of this grip.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I could dave just see that and you just </v>

3434
02:25:49.581 --> 02:25:54.581
<v Speaker 11>see Dave's eyes go right.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Then he busted himself on the,</v>

3435
02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:57.620
<v Speaker 11>during the ramp around,</v>
<v Speaker 11>showed what he done.</v>

3436
02:25:57.650 --> 02:26:00.350
<v Speaker 11>That's a little bit beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It was beautiful because he was busted.</v>

3437
02:26:00.351 --> 02:26:01.310
<v Speaker 11>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 11>yeah,</v>

3439
02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:04.640

<v Speaker 11>it was really weird for him to be,</v>

3440
02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:07.550
<v Speaker 11>it just drives me nuts when people act </v>
<v Speaker 11>like he's crazy.</v>

3441
02:26:07.551 --> 02:26:12.500

<v Speaker 11>brilliant and really nice or whatever.</v>

3442
02:26:12.501 --> 02:26:14.930
<v Speaker 11>A black guy goes to Africa and you go,</v>

3445
02:26:18.501 --> 02:26:19.550
<v Speaker 11>to try to find peace?</v>

<v Speaker 11>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 11>they offered them 50 million bucks and </v>

3455
02:26:33.921 --> 02:26:37.430
<v Speaker 11>this idea of just having a 24 hour </v>
<v Speaker 11>orgasm and,</v>

<v Speaker 11>it's,</v>

3457
02:26:39.350 --> 02:26:40.560
<v Speaker 11>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Wait,</v>

3458
02:26:40.610 --> 02:26:45.610
<v Speaker 11>we don't pursue being fulfilled,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is the whole jam.</v>

3459
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:46.610
<v Speaker 11>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>

3460
02:26:46.611 --> 02:26:47.444
<v Speaker 11>it's a tricky little dance because,</v>
<v Speaker 11>cause we have to pay bills and we have </v>

3461
02:26:50.151 --> 02:26:53.060
<v Speaker 11>to raise their kids and we have to be </v>
<v Speaker 11>responsible.</v>

3462
02:26:53.061 --> 02:26:53.871
<v Speaker 11>But,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but,</v>

3463
02:26:53.871 --> 02:26:54.800
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know this,</v>

3464
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:57.440
<v Speaker 11>every time you take that leap,</v>
<v Speaker 11>every time you go,</v>

3465
02:26:57.441 --> 02:26:58.900
<v Speaker 11>well,</v>
<v Speaker 11>this is really scary way.</v>

3466
02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:02.750
<v Speaker 11>Every time it pays off.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I've never taken the leap.</v>

3467
02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:06.830
<v Speaker 11>I've taken leaps why I did what I </v>
<v Speaker 11>thought people wanted or I thought might</v>

3468
02:27:06.831 --> 02:27:09.890
<v Speaker 11>work or might be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That always works terribly.</v>

3469
02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:12.560
<v Speaker 11>But I've just said,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I've got to tell this story because this</v>

3470
02:27:12.561 --> 02:27:16.190
<v Speaker 11>is the story that I'm interested right </v>
<v Speaker 11>now that's always paid off.</v>

3471
02:27:16.540 --> 02:27:17.620
<v Speaker 11>How's it paid off?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Is it,</v>

3472
02:27:17.621 --> 02:27:19.250
<v Speaker 11>I might do my rich and my this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>

3473
02:27:19.251 --> 02:27:20.320
<v Speaker 11>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>unfulfilled.</v>

3474
02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:24.200
<v Speaker 11>So I sit there and I connect with a </v>
<v Speaker 11>small group of people in that.</v>

3475
02:27:24.201 --> 02:27:25.940
<v Speaker 11>That's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Beautiful.</v>

3476
02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:27.073
<v Speaker 11>That's it.</v>
