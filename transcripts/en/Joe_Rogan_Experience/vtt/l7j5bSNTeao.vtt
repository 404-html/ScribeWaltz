00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Someone said this,</v>

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Terence Mckenna,</v>

3
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 1>that people have a problem with something that's real that you can't hit with a</v>

4
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>hammer.</v>

5
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a real way of putting it.</v>

7
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a real interesting because farts are real as fuck dude,</v>

8
00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>and you can't wrap your hands around them,</v>

9
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>but you know they're real.</v>

10
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Sound is real.</v>

11
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>But we accept it because we're so used to it.</v>

12
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>The idea of this invisible thing can,</v>

13
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>can transmit music and harmony and beautiful feelings and make you fucking</v>

14
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 1>pumped up and you hear it in your car singing it.</v>

15
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

16
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>What the what the fuck is that?</v>

17
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>It's invisible shit and invisible.</v>

18
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.251
<v Speaker 1>Shitty,</v>

19
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's coming for fucking satellites down.</v>

20
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>We want to think that we've got the whole world figured out who want to think</v>

21
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>that we know what's real and what's here and that all the weakened sense is all</v>

22
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>it is there.</v>

23
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.431
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

24
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:42.151
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

25
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:42.421
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

26
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:42.790
<v Speaker 1>that's sure</v>

27
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 2>did us,</v>

28
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.640
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

29
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 2>we are weird.</v>

30
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.611
<v Speaker 3>We're weird.</v>

31
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 3>And we don't realize how weird we are.</v>

32
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Like while we're being weird,</v>

33
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:00.490
<v Speaker 3>we don't realize it.</v>

34
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] you got to work on this life to make money,</v>

35
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 3>but the fuck is money.</v>

36
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.041
<v Speaker 3>Who are you?</v>

37
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

38
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing here?</v>

39
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at the resources that you have available to you being 24 hours</v>

40
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 3>in a day and a certain amount of your health,</v>

41
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 3>I think about what you dedicate most of that resources too.</v>

42
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 3>And what's your reward on that?</v>

43
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.101
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

44
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:17.934
<v Speaker 3>you got a house,</v>

45
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 3>you got a box where you can fucking pass out every night in front of the</v>

46
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:21.714
<v Speaker 3>television.</v>

47
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.793
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're doing?</v>

48
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you need to do anything stupid and people just always telling me</v>

49
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:26.521
<v Speaker 3>that you're like,</v>

50
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:26.671
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

51
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:27.361
<v Speaker 3>you need to grow up.</v>

52
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:28.194
<v Speaker 3>You need to grow up.</v>

53
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 3>What do you what to do?</v>

54
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 3>What to die,</v>

55
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 3>Dwight,</v>

56
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 3>to fall into line,</v>

57
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 3>to fucking follow a pattern.</v>

58
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to do anything.</v>

59
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:35.341
<v Speaker 3>Nobody was doing anything.</v>

60
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 3>You need to breathe,</v>

61
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 3>you need to eat food.</v>

62
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 3>The rest of his is the structure that we've sort of invented to sort of give</v>

63
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 3>ourselves something to do.</v>

64
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 3>When we wake up in the morning,</v>

65
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

66
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.061
<v Speaker 3>it's nine.</v>

67
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 3>I am trying to go to work.</v>

68
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 3>Work's not real.</v>

69
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.540
<v Speaker 3>The car's not real life,</v>

70
00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 3>not real.</v>

71
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 3>This is what's real heartbeats.</v>

72
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 3>And when those bitches stop,</v>

73
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:54.471
<v Speaker 3>all that shit that you created and stockpiled and worked for means not nothing.</v>

74
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 3>These objects that didn't even exist when you're dead,</v>

75
00:01:58.291 --> 00:01:58.741
<v Speaker 3>when you're dead,</v>

76
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go to another dimension where you can't take this shit with you,</v>

77
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

78
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>

79
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.151
<v Speaker 3>or delights you.</v>

80
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Shut off.</v>

81
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Life is about us interacting with each other and if you can contribute in any</v>

82
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

83
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that are great parents that contribute to this world by</v>

84
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 3>being a great parent,</v>

85
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 3>by raising someone who's going to influence other people,</v>

86
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of them don't necessarily get too much credit for that.</v>

87
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 3>That's an incredible resource.</v>

88
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that every one of them is just fucking up the world.</v>

89
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the world's fucked period.</v>

90
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.751
<v Speaker 3>It's we're,</v>

91
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:26.991
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

92
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:29.210
<v Speaker 3>we're 2014 all right.</v>

93
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 3>The direction that we're going in is fucked.</v>

94
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucked was too many of us.</v>

95
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 3>There's too much pollution.</v>

96
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 3>It's not changing.</v>

97
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

98
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>

99
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 3>the global warming is happening whether you like it or not,</v>

100
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 3>whether you blame it on democratic Vaginas,</v>

101
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 3>sponsors,</v>

102
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.161
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

103
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

104
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 3>whatever you do doesn't matter.</v>

105
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

106
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.320

109
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 4>I could just see that and being cut into one of those youtube videos.</v>

110
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 4>That's somebody who isn't in the background.</v>

111
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 4>There's like people walking fast than the sun rising really slow.</v>
