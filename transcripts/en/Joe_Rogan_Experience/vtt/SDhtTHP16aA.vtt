00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Fighting the nonsense of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and Gentlemen,</v>

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 1>the Godfather's back high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then anybody can get to see you.</v>

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm here in southern California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped.</v>

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I escaped minus 30 with windshield last</v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Didn't leave the house from Friday to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monday with the wind chill factors minus</v>

7
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 1>30 or it's actually minus 30 with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Windchill,</v>

8
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.470
<v Speaker 1>so I'd say it's minus 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would windshield minus 30?</v>

9
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>You guys have become too soft and</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern California.</v>

10
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.120
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean become been too soft?</v>

11
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a ridiculous place to live.</v>

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

13
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Is this is like a lottery winner place</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live.</v>

14
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like the weather lottery and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

15
00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand what weather is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just running around.</v>

16
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it gets 50 here,</v>

17
00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>people start complaining that I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>weather advisories when I used to live</v>

18
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it'd be a 10 minute spell of</v>

19
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.190
<v Speaker 1>rain and they'd be endless warnings.</v>

20
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Careful,</v>

21
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be careful.</v>

22
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>You know we go through blizzards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is one reason for that though.</v>

23
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>The oil slick on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.580
<v Speaker 1>When it doesn't rain for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the oil from people's cars,</v>

25
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.940
<v Speaker 1>the residue gets on the road and as soon</v>
<v Speaker 1>as just a little bit of water gets on</v>

26
00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>that it gets really slippery and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is reality,</v>

27
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Speaker 1>but still before we start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we said last time when I was</v>

28
00:01:23.921 --> 00:01:27.010
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on your birthday and some guy</v>

29
00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>wrote in a very non Semitic way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it goes,</v>

30
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:34.870
<v Speaker 1>God being a Jew not giving Joe Rogan a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gift on his birthday.</v>

31
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:39.871
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that I would correct that</v>
<v Speaker 1>by giving you a signed copy of one of my</v>

32
00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:42.400
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>

33
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.220
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To consuming instinct.</v>

34
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Now you can grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

35
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Juicy Burgers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferrari's pornography and gift giving</v>

36
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:53.050
<v Speaker 1>reveal about human nature.</v>

37
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.830
<v Speaker 1>There you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy,</v>

38
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>by and signed by the Godfather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very exciting.</v>

39
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you can't read those.</v>

40
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Those things that people say those mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

41
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 1>I try to avoid them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once in awhile I get sucked in and</v>

42
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.430
<v Speaker 1>they can piss me off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I always equate it to snake venom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>

44
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 1>If you get a little bit of snake venom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get you get immune to it and get</v>

45
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you get a big burst of it,</v>

46
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.330
<v Speaker 1>it can poison you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you just get a little bit of it</v>

47
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>every now and then when a big burst</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes your way,</v>

48
00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>like someone calling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved you until you go,</v>

49
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>you motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work anymore.</v>

50
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just realize there's a lot of people</v>

51
00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:35.440
<v Speaker 1>out there that a lot of the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying these mean things because</v>

52
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to find something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can say that will get you to</v>

53
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 1>respond.</v>

54
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

55
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what.</v>

56
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.380
<v Speaker 1>So recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the latest one is.</v>

57
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Speaker 1>So somebody trolls you endlessly in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very polite manner.</v>

58
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

59
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Usually I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I try to engage them,</v>

60
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 1>but I find them really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's ridiculous,</v>

61
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're again,</v>

62
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>you're an actual professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am in the legitimate university.</v>

63
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy that I would even</v>

64
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>entertain their Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once in a while I get sucked into the</v>

65
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>trap there and polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after awhile I blocked them.</v>

66
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>So these guys then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've blocked them,</v>

67
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>start going around saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

69
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>he's a supposedly a proponent of freedom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of speech,</v>

70
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>yet he blocks me as though I'm the</v>
<v Speaker 1>purveyor of freedom of speech,</v>

71
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:21.874
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

72
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not allowed to come to your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking into your house and start</v>

73
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>calling you names and if you stopped me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accuse you of not supporting free</v>

74
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

75
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in their minds,</v>

76
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>if I block them simply because I no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer want to engage them,</v>

77
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I am going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am being a hypocrite because I'm not</v>

78
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>supporting their freedom to insult me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

79
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to go back to what I said</v>

80
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you're so smart.</v>

81
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.833
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

82
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>how is this even getting into your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you what it is?</v>

83
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

84
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I find that galling that somebody could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be so insulting calling.</v>

85
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Does that word mean like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

86
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

87
00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean we interact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I with a million people a day</v>

88
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 1>with most of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're lovely.</v>

89
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:08.490
<v Speaker 1>They're sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're polite.</v>

90
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>They might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vast majority.</v>

91
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

92
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.630
<v Speaker 1>So when you get this individual who</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply can't modulate his behavior to</v>

93
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>even sort of adhere to the most basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>social norms,</v>

94
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>once in a while I just get pissed off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but usually I'm able to avoid it.</v>

95
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't even once in a while,</v>

96
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

97
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.820
<v Speaker 1>you got to realize that an anonymity is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really confusing thing for people,</v>

98
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ability to communicate with</v>

99
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anonymous has never existed before,</v>

100
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than some serial killer,</v>

101
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>making some note by cutting out little</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces of paper or the newspaper and you</v>

102
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using the words from that,</v>

103
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no anonymity man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

104
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

105
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>So when you have anonymity in the form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like you have a twitter account and</v>

106
00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>it's just an egg and you call yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck mcgee and you just start trolling.</v>

107
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>The Godfather makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

108
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.900
<v Speaker 1>that's not a normal interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

110
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.950
<v Speaker 1>there shouldn't be a method or someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>could just contact you like that because</v>

111
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.620
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our bodies and our minds and our,</v>

112
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Speaker 1>all our systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our social systems,</v>

113
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>they're just not set up for that.</v>

114
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's saying rude things without</v>

115
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 1>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

116
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>you're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're offering,</v>

117
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an evolutionary argument.</v>

118
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>

119
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.310
<v Speaker 1>But it's a completely new thing that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>really just don't have the mechanisms</v>

120
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 1>for which we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not accustomed to it.</v>

121
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>We don't really have a long history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

122
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have a history of just doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

123
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>The realistic history at the extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>level is 20 years,</v>

124
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.010
<v Speaker 1>94 dash 96 ish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around then when it started.</v>

125
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the real history is probably less</v>

126
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>than 10 of it really being incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>pervasive the way it is today.</v>

127
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Like with twitter and facebook and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this instagram comments and things along</v>

128
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

129
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

130
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I was just saying it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a new thing that we have to work</v>

131
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>out because it is a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive part of our culture.</v>

132
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>There was some statistic recently about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of data that people produce</v>

133
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>in a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldwide and the most of the data is</v>

134
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 1>lol fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is ones and zero's,</v>

136
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>binary code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

137
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>all that data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more produced in a day,</v>

138
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>then it's some staggering statistics</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the rest of human history.</v>

139
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It's something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear it.</v>

140
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Here it goes every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two point five quintillion bytes of data</v>

141
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 1>created daily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck is that?</v>

142
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of the world's data today</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been created in the last two years</v>

143
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

144
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of business schools now have</v>

145
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.530
<v Speaker 1>programs and data analytics or big data</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they try to teach students how to</v>

146
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>navigate through the complexity of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of big data sets.</v>

147
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really hot field in business</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

148
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible.</v>

149
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean the real navigate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what,</v>

150
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there's a pattern,</v>

151
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:11.231
<v Speaker 1>a very clear pattern emerging and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern is of anyone being able to</v>

152
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:17.801
<v Speaker 1>access any information at any time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's getting closer and closer to that</v>

153
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.110
<v Speaker 1>all the time and some of that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication doesn't just mean being</v>

154
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.350
<v Speaker 1>able to access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:27.050
<v Speaker 1>googling some facts or some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some knowledge.</v>

156
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 1>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being able to communicate with</v>

157
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

158
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotten to this really crazy place.</v>

159
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of Information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my doctoral dissertation more than 20</v>

160
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:42.701
<v Speaker 1>years ago was about how do people decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>when to stop acquiring additional</v>

161
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:47.360
<v Speaker 1>information and commit to a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I suppose I'm choosing between cars</v>

162
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:52.220
<v Speaker 1>or between mates or between job</v>
<v Speaker 1>applicants or between jobs to take</v>

163
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 1>whatever the decision is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just say between mates mates.</v>

164
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got like a gang of bitches for</v>

165
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should see.</v>

166
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did look at some of the comments right</v>

167
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 1>after I appeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right then I lose interest in.</v>

168
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was one guy who wrote</v>

169
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is swimming in pussy.</v>

170
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then everybody starts ganging up on</v>

171
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>that comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know what it is,</v>

172
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a beer commercial.</v>

173
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>The most interesting man in the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I looked like what it is like that</v>

174
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 1>look like it's become a thing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.090
<v Speaker 1>got the beautiful white beard and a man</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wisdom and years of.</v>

176
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.953
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

177
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in that,</v>

178
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 1>in my doctoral dissertation I had looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

179
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>well I think I'm better looking at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy knew that,</v>

180
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's Canadian too.</v>

181
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Has He?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not even really Spanish and he's</v>

182
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.180
<v Speaker 1>much older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so?</v>

183
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.161
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

184
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like 70,</v>

185
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.930
<v Speaker 1>51.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how old the guy goes.</v>

186
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

187
00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:51.834
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

188
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.630
<v Speaker 1>so the whole psychology of decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

189
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've addressed that in my research.</v>

190
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

191
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Well what is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is a different sort of a</v>

192
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.710
<v Speaker 1>decision making thing because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>

193
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>you definitely can get lost where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can just go online and you know,</v>

194
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that youtube does now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it really difficult is you</v>

195
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 1>watch a video.</v>

196
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.240
<v Speaker 1>So if I was watching some video today on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rhino slamming into a car,</v>

197
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was removed though some copyright</v>

198
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:22.170
<v Speaker 1>infringement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>

199
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 1>This rhino charge this car and slams</v>
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>

200
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.040
<v Speaker 1>The problem is once you watch a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately after that it offers up</v>

201
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.950
<v Speaker 1>another video and it starts playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll give you like 10 seconds and then</v>

202
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 1>it starts playing again and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look on the side and there's all these</v>

203
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 1>suggestions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as simple as one video.</v>

204
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 1>It's an endless web.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why by the way,</v>

205
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Internet pornography for men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such an alluring trap,</v>

206
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because our visual system and our need</v>

207
00:09:50.431 --> 00:09:55.431
<v Speaker 1>for variety seeking is there and now you</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean I can say she ate this by going</v>

208
00:09:55.891 --> 00:10:00.891
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having endless different new bile ready</v>

209
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 1>to meet women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy for our computational</v>

210
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 1>system to be personalized by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Internet.</v>

211
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.453
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

212
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>it's probably really not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not really set up to watch people.</v>

213
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the brain just doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to do with,</v>

215
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're by yourself close</v>

216
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.420
<v Speaker 1>the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

217
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's people that just will</v>

218
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Speaker 1>watch pornography 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 hours a day and it's not just a few.</v>

219
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I bet if you could highlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet if you were in a plane and you're</v>

220
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:33.930
<v Speaker 1>flying over the United States and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a light bulb that went off over</v>

221
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 1>everyone's head that jerks off 12 hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>a day,</v>

222
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 1>you can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be stunned.</v>

223
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 1>He'd be able to read by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be able to hold a magazine up to</v>

224
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.980
<v Speaker 1>the window and read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

225
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

226
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there that get it.</v>

227
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.770
<v Speaker 1>They get overwhelmed by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of doing that.</v>

228
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Like the the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

229
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>it's they don't have the discipline to</v>
<v Speaker 1>handle that and I was actually a</v>

230
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:02.070
<v Speaker 1>conversation that I was having with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Duncan the other day about</v>

231
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 1>discipline and how important discipline</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to living a good healthy life and</v>

232
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 1>that getting the things that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get done will allow you to actually</v>

233
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>enjoy your free time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you don't get those things</v>

234
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free time in those pursuits,</v>

235
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:19.280
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost become obsessions and you,</v>

236
00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you kind of dive into them to avoid the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure of getting those things done</v>

237
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.230
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes sort of counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I counterproductive.</v>

238
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going back to the pornography I had on</v>

239
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:33.210
<v Speaker 1>my youtube channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a genuine Mercedes careeredge sure.</v>

240
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met her.</v>

241
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

242
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

243
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.180
<v Speaker 1>She came to one of my shows with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I guess her husband or boyfriend</v>

244
00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

245
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart girl,</v>

246
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:43.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'd seen her on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

247
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Gavin McInnes his podcasts and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

248
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.833
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

249
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.630
<v Speaker 1>of course otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

250
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.040
<v Speaker 1>what would we have to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

251
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 1>She's an engineer's an engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's very,</v>

252
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:59.521
<v Speaker 1>very heavily vested into the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior bullshit and the</v>

253
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 1>other way we were fighting against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

254
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:04.650
<v Speaker 1>So I'd seen her on a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:12:04.651 --> 00:12:08.080
<v Speaker 1>popular podcasts and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's just normally sheep,</v>

256
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.921
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

257
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:13.170
<v Speaker 1>But so well spoken and so I had her on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show and we've communicated since</v>

258
00:12:13.171 --> 00:12:15.580
<v Speaker 1>several time and so that's been really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

259
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sort of to mimic what you do with</v>

260
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:21.610
<v Speaker 1>your podcast of bringing in so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting people and my youtube</v>

261
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had people from guys who fight</v>

262
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Islam to porn stars who used to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>former engineers,</v>

263
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 1>so it's been really fun to meet all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>

264
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a cool movement going on now</v>

265
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 1>where there's a lot of very intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are resisting nonsense where</v>

266
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:40.030
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wasting time,</v>

267
00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:43.270
<v Speaker 1>you're wasting effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also there's a lot of people that</v>

268
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 1>are attaching themselves to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous movements just because they</v>

269
00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:48.980
<v Speaker 1>have an identity in that movement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they.</v>

270
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.360
<v Speaker 1>They filled the void.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever social void they have in their</v>

271
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:57.030
<v Speaker 1>life with this new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new being an sjw.</v>

272
00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm a social justice warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an article recently about</v>

273
00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Yale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about students at Yale having a hard</v>

274
00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:07.150
<v Speaker 1>time balancing out their social</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities with.</v>

275
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what fucking activism?</v>

276
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.860
<v Speaker 1>This is an activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just holding up signs and</v>

277
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 1>complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>

279
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.100
<v Speaker 1>does not activism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>

280
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 1>You're not changing a goddamn thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than people's opinions about you.</v>

281
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the one with the site?</v>

282
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I did a lecture at University of Ottawa</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the thought police and political</v>

283
00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:25.181
<v Speaker 1>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

284
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if you saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not,</v>

285
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:27.690
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

286
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.670
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of covers the,</v>

287
00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 1>the safe spaces at the microaggressions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

288
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.080
<v Speaker 1>the trigger warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the examples that I picked,</v>

289
00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I really tried to pick some really</v>
<v Speaker 1>outlandish examples that should only</v>

290
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 1>belong in the onion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the examples was some,</v>

291
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it was some students at</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Oregon wanted to take down</v>

292
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.140
<v Speaker 1>the classic quote by Martin Luther King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:51.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a dream stuff.</v>

294
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was insufficiently inclusive</v>

295
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.570
<v Speaker 1>by him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

296
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.440
<v Speaker 1>focusing his Ayer on racism and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at whatever it is,</v>

297
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:04.870
<v Speaker 1>transgenderism and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

298
00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:06.580
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was being divisive.</v>

299
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.480
<v Speaker 1>So when Martin Luther King can draw the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ire of these guys,</v>

300
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.050
<v Speaker 1>none of us are safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one is safe.</v>

301
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

302
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 1>they're not safe either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're eating themselves,</v>

303
00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:20.680
<v Speaker 1>they're attacking ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had this a podcast where we went over</v>

304
00:14:20.681 --> 00:14:24.340
<v Speaker 1>the story about this woman who joined</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wellesley College,</v>

305
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:26.240
<v Speaker 1>which is an all girls college I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken.</v>

306
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I've spoken there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Do,</v>

307
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you know the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the woman joined Wellesley college</v>

308
00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:32.860
<v Speaker 1>and then once you joined the Wellesley</v>
<v Speaker 1>College,</v>

309
00:14:32.861 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>she decided that she's going to identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a man masculine of center,</v>

310
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Gender Queer is what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her distinction.</v>

311
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Your stick on it cracked egg up in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

312
00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I was crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

313
00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I was screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing because then she voted to be.</v>

314
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.650
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to be the head person of</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>

315
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Chairman Deborah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck</v>

316
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 2>this the title was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it had something to do with</v>

317
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:58.550
<v Speaker 2>diversity and they were boycotting her</v>
<v Speaker 2>because now she was a white man.</v>

318
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Like this is glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is glorious there.</v>

319
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.460
<v Speaker 2>They're literally eating themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're.</v>

320
00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 2>They're so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've spun around in circles and</v>

321
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:11.120
<v Speaker 2>they're biting their own assets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what's going on,</v>

322
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I truly feel though that they've sort of</v>

323
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:15.940
<v Speaker 2>reached a zenith and it's going to start</v>
<v Speaker 2>decaying.</v>

324
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy that he's going to get worse,</v>

325
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 2>crazier and crazier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's going to be.</v>

326
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.520
<v Speaker 2>There's a culture war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

327
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they've stopped.</v>

328
00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think they've started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just there right now.</v>

329
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Scrambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they don't.</v>

330
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 2>They don't hold weight amongst rational</v>
<v Speaker 2>people anymore,</v>

331
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.140
<v Speaker 2>but that's not gonna stop their</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

332
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Their movement will continue to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>irrational at a frenzied pace and they</v>

333
00:15:37.511 --> 00:15:39.560
<v Speaker 2>were literally going to cannibalize each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

334
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.570
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think is the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>trajectory?</v>

335
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean at some point it has to crash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

336
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna like it's almost like a civil</v>

337
00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:47.870
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

338
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a preposterous civil</v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

339
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:54.821
<v Speaker 2>Like I think in a sense our politics in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country have always been a civil</v>

340
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:59.921
<v Speaker 2>war just by nature of having only two</v>
<v Speaker 2>choices just by the dual party system in</v>

341
00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 2>this ridiculous idea that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent parties.</v>

342
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:04.171
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

343
00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not independent.</v>

344
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Unless trump decided to go independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to win.</v>

345
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.190
<v Speaker 2>You think is going to win the to win?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

346
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna win to Hidden Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't beat him.</v>

347
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:14.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she could beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

348
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.620
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see Bernie Sanders when</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

349
00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Speaker 2>not because of his financial policies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think are ridiculous,</v>

350
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.260
<v Speaker 2>but I think his social policies are</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting and what I should clarify</v>

351
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:24.760
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

352
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.960
<v Speaker 2>here's what's ridiculous about his</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial policies.</v>

353
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Don't make more taxes because more taxes</v>
<v Speaker 2>just means more government,</v>

354
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 2>more government is not when we fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>need right now.</v>

355
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.200
<v Speaker 2>If you want to organize charitable</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions that will legitimately help</v>

356
00:16:39.201 --> 00:16:43.430
<v Speaker 2>people and have people donate money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have people work towards,</v>

357
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.201
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

358
00:16:44.201 --> 00:16:47.240
<v Speaker 2>like these donations will actually take</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from your taxes.</v>

359
00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Let's quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's figure out some way where we make</v>

360
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:52.640
<v Speaker 2>it beneficial for people to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>charitable where we set up community</v>

361
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:54.500
<v Speaker 2>programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes some of the money that we're</v>

362
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:56.550
<v Speaker 2>spending on shit that we really don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to spend money on,</v>

363
00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 2>some subsidies that we probably don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>need that there are benefiting gigantic</v>

364
00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 2>corporations and instead use those to</v>
<v Speaker 2>help the education systems in poor</v>

365
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:07.220
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use those to try to provide jobs and</v>

366
00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:09.290
<v Speaker 2>industry and poor communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

367
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.820
<v Speaker 2>These are all really good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

368
00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm in favor of that kind of socialism.</v>

369
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm absolutely in favor of free</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities,</v>

370
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that people should get out</v>

371
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 2>of school and be a quarter million</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars in debt.</v>

372
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:26.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that's madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're going to make $50,000</v>

373
00:17:26.031 --> 00:17:26.541
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

374
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:28.940
<v Speaker 2>if you've got a really good job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make $50,000 a year,</v>

375
00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:29.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get out of school,</v>

376
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could ask school and you make 50</v>

377
00:17:31.911 --> 00:17:33.500
<v Speaker 2>grand a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking kicking ass,</v>

378
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:35.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is going great for you.</v>

379
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.060
<v Speaker 2>You're not really making 50 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make it about 34,</v>

380
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got taxes,</v>

381
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.960
<v Speaker 2>you got sales taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you live in a place like California,</v>

382
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.620
<v Speaker 2>you've got state taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're living off of somewhere in the</v>

383
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:47.780
<v Speaker 2>late twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties,</v>

384
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:52.650
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've got $250,000 of debt you've</v>

385
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 2>got to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've studied women's studies,</v>

386
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.890
<v Speaker 2>which is a very actionable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a set of skills.</v>

387
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people study that?</v>

388
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Wellesley?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple.</v>

389
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:03.923
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

390
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I just think that it's an insane burden</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put on young people,</v>

391
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 2>to have them enter into the free market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enter into the world and be already</v>

392
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:17.280
<v Speaker 2>saddled down by insane amounts of debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's gotta be a way around</v>

393
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 2>that and I don't think that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible idea to have publicly funded</v>

394
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:23.190
<v Speaker 2>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it's a terrible idea.</v>

395
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's an insurmountable</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

396
00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:27.960
<v Speaker 2>So I like Bernie Sanders and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

397
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a compassionate guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's an open minded guy.</v>

398
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I think he says a lot of really radical</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

399
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.070
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that he goes out on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>limb with this black lives matter stuff.</v>

400
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.940
<v Speaker 2>I've liked that he's making a big deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these cops shooting these young</v>

401
00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 2>black kids and then it's got to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

402
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 2>It's gotTa stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's madness.</v>

403
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.160
<v Speaker 2>How many videos have to come out before</v>
<v Speaker 2>you after a while you're like,</v>

404
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's obviously some clear problem.</v>

405
00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.450
<v Speaker 2>How is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is trump not handling this?</v>

406
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.930
<v Speaker 2>How is Hillary not handling this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

407
00:18:56.931 --> 00:18:59.760
<v Speaker 2>this is a real problem in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our society,</v>

408
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.410
<v Speaker 2>there's a divisiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this separation between these</v>

409
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 2>people that live in these communities</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are terrified of the police and</v>

410
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:11.010
<v Speaker 2>they're really worried about being shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time and then everybody else is</v>

411
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 2>on the outside looking in and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

412
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:15.360
<v Speaker 2>if you just follow the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have those problems.</v>

413
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

414
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.480
<v Speaker 2>try being born there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try being raised there.</v>

415
00:19:18.481 --> 00:19:19.314
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are not.</v>

416
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.170
<v Speaker 2>We're not on an even playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

417
00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:27.030
<v Speaker 2>and I think he's one of the few guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's addressing this imbalance,</v>

418
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.030
<v Speaker 2>this social imbalance is cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>imbalance.</v>

419
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:35.210
<v Speaker 2>This is economic imbalance that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country in a really radical way.</v>

420
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.980
<v Speaker 2>So I liked him for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be a good thing for</v>

421
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:39.630
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a guy like that,</v>

422
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:40.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would just,</v>

423
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.140
<v Speaker 2>would it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it really happen?</v>

424
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I take him over the others,</v>

425
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I'd take him over the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think trump is just,</v>

426
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.070
<v Speaker 2>he says too much crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This shit he said about Mexico,</v>

427
00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:56.090
<v Speaker 2>like they're going to pay for that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they called me up and they said,</v>

428
00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:57.750
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about this and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you say that?</v>

429
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Wall just got 10 feet higher.</v>

430
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.370
<v Speaker 2>That's not what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

431
00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:04.480
<v Speaker 2>he's not very presidential in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

432
00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.240
<v Speaker 2>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His mannerisms,</v>

433
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a real successful guy and I</v>

434
00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:13.800
<v Speaker 2>think what he's doing is he's tapping</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this real frustration that a lot of</v>

435
00:20:13.801 --> 00:20:18.180
<v Speaker 2>people have and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that don't like</v>

436
00:20:18.181 --> 00:20:21.300
<v Speaker 2>the bullshit that's involved in politics</v>
<v Speaker 2>or people aren't seeing what they're</v>

437
00:20:21.301 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 2>really think.</v>

438
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.810
<v Speaker 2>So here's this guy who comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't need anybody's money.</v>

439
00:20:24.811 --> 00:20:26.120
<v Speaker 2>He's insanely wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.790
<v Speaker 2>He's a multibillionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he could say whatever the fuck he</v>

441
00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:31.500
<v Speaker 2>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's used to say whatever the fuck</v>

442
00:20:31.501 --> 00:20:32.880
<v Speaker 2>he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every time he does it,</v>

443
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:35.040
<v Speaker 2>people cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's good too.</v>

444
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 2>It's good too because finally we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we've got an insane</v>

445
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Ross Perot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember Ross Perot,</v>

446
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Ross Perot fucked up the election for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Georgia to,</v>

447
00:20:45.031 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 2>with the big ears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucked it up for George Bush's Dad.</v>

448
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The older Bush,</v>

449
00:20:50.141 --> 00:20:50.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

450
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.500
<v Speaker 2>they slated him for a second term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people thought he was going to.</v>

451
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:57.010
<v Speaker 2>When Ross Perot came along and explained</v>
<v Speaker 2>on television,</v>

452
00:20:57.011 --> 00:21:01.060
<v Speaker 2>he bought a half an hour prime time tv</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pre-internet,</v>

453
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bought a half an hour prime time TV</v>

454
00:21:03.641 --> 00:21:06.880
<v Speaker 2>and explained to the Federal Reserve to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and explain how you're getting</v>

455
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:10.180
<v Speaker 2>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember there was no internet</v>

456
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:10.750
<v Speaker 2>back then.</v>

457
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:15.190
<v Speaker 2>So I remember me and some friends we got</v>
<v Speaker 2>together afterwards and we were,</v>

458
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.660
<v Speaker 2>we were going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you fucking see you then?</v>

459
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.553
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that right?</v>

460
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Is what he's seeing true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of had to make any sense.</v>

461
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 2>And then he was talking about how his</v>
<v Speaker 2>children were being threatened and he</v>

462
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.110
<v Speaker 2>was worried they were going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidnapped.</v>

463
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:30.580
<v Speaker 2>There's all this crazy shit and it got</v>
<v Speaker 2>me down a lot of rabbit holes,</v>

464
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like conspiracy theory,</v>

465
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:34.390
<v Speaker 2>rabbit holes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching that guy do that.</v>

466
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.720
<v Speaker 2>But I think that what Donald Trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like a more rabid informed version of</v>

467
00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:44.200
<v Speaker 2>that and more informed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning our culture is more informed,</v>

468
00:21:44.201 --> 00:21:44.741
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

469
00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:45.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

470
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.570
<v Speaker 2>we're hearing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the age of the Internet where it's,</v>

471
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.550
<v Speaker 2>if you go up on television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say something about the Federal Reserve,</v>

472
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.570
<v Speaker 2>people understand that you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about an insane institution now.</v>

473
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Whereas back then people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

474
00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.800
<v Speaker 2>What is he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Federal Reserve is not a part of the</v>

475
00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:00.820
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

476
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.130
<v Speaker 2>like nobody knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knew that federal bank was it.</v>

477
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Why is it called a Federal Bank of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not federal,</v>

478
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:07.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so confusing.</v>

479
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

480
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.660
<v Speaker 1>the main thing about trump that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are tapping into is rightly or wrongly,</v>

481
00:22:13.661 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 1>that he comes across as authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look on the,</v>

482
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.910
<v Speaker 1>on some metric of authenticity between</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary,</v>

483
00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton could not be any more</v>
<v Speaker 1>inauthentic,</v>

484
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:24.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

485
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.340
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

486
00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.010
<v Speaker 1>she freaks you out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

487
00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:30.280
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she spooky in her inability to convey,</v>

488
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 1>even if she tried to fake genuine</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

489
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Whereas on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

490
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:40.390
<v Speaker 1>whether you like him or don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump seems to speak from the heart to</v>

491
00:22:40.391 --> 00:22:43.210
<v Speaker 1>the extent that a lot of people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusioned with politicians.</v>

492
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Then this guy comes along and I can at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least tap into that and,</v>

493
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.210
<v Speaker 1>and hang on that element of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

494
00:22:49.211 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's what explains his</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

495
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also white men,</v>

496
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.300
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

497
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of white men out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>excited to have this,</v>

498
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 1>this really bold white man as a contrast</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

499
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.740
<v Speaker 1>You mean to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Obama?</v>

500
00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a contrast to Obama.</v>

501
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Definitely a contrast to Hillary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders is chumming up with the</v>

502
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:10.810
<v Speaker 1>black folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

503
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you followed our politics in</v>

504
00:23:13.841 --> 00:23:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Canada?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

505
00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:16.420
<v Speaker 1>You're trudeau guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that guy.</v>

506
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.470
<v Speaker 1>You do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

507
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I liked that guy because he's young and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seemed smart and he has nice hair.</v>

508
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.910
<v Speaker 1>He's got beautiful hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

509
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.020
<v Speaker 1>he boxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did do that.</v>

510
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.600
<v Speaker 1>But what's bad about them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

511
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.910
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that I think we both</v>
<v Speaker 1>despise social justice warriors,</v>

512
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:38.290
<v Speaker 1>the ostrich brigade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regressive left explained the</v>

513
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:41.170
<v Speaker 1>ostrich burger is a term that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>popularized,</v>

514
00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 1>which basically refers to folks who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>their head in the sand so that they</v>

515
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:48.920
<v Speaker 1>can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except some of the most basic</v>

516
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 1>regularities in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

517
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:56.930
<v Speaker 1>there is no link between Islam and any</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist act anywhere in the world to</v>

519
00:23:56.931 --> 00:23:58.970
<v Speaker 1>suggest otherwise it'd be Islamophobia.</v>

520
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somebody who,</v>

521
00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 1>who exhibits this type of behavior as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an exhibiting ostrich logic,</v>

522
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:09.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Justin Trudeau is the kingpin of the</v>

523
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Ostrich Brigade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

524
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Handsome.</v>

525
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.110
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

526
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:17.110
<v Speaker 1>he basically his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dad instituted as part of our</v>

527
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Canadian he multiculturalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Multiculturalism means two different</v>

528
00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:22.760
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Multiculturalism.</v>

529
00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:26.330
<v Speaker 1>When it's used in everyday language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that many cultures,</v>

530
00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:28.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>La is multicultural,</v>

531
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:31.550
<v Speaker 1>meaning it's pluralistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but multiculturalism as a political</v>

532
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:34.400
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is actually a very dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

533
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically says that when immigrants</v>

534
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:41.030
<v Speaker 1>come into your land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to assimilate within</v>

535
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.370
<v Speaker 1>your cultural values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather,</v>

536
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:48.490
<v Speaker 1>you allow everybody to get ghettoize</v>
<v Speaker 1>because who are we to judge the values</v>

537
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:50.150
<v Speaker 1>of another ghettoized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

538
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Like you mean like a Dominican</v>
<v Speaker 1>community?</v>

539
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.670
<v Speaker 1>The Muslims are here to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is on here here,</v>

540
00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.420
<v Speaker 1>but ghettos like poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

541
00:24:59.421 --> 00:24:59.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

542
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.210
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ghettoize in the sense that everybody</v>

543
00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:04.820
<v Speaker 1>who is of the same background lives in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that space.</v>

544
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.960
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a ghetto.</v>

545
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean the term is used in different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

546
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:11.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not ghetto in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sense of hip hop gets zero.</v>

547
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.620
<v Speaker 1>A term ghetto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

548
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.490
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've always,</v>

549
00:25:16.491 --> 00:25:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying ghetto in this country</v>

550
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:22.850
<v Speaker 1>is always referred to as a poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

551
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

552
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it has a broader meaning at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least as I understand that.</v>

553
00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say you'll get to realizing</v>

554
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:33.550
<v Speaker 1>people into different areas of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard it as a verb.</v>

555
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm here to get toe eyes.</v>

556
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.160
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

557
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New immigrants still tended to get a</v>

558
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.530
<v Speaker 1>wise in the cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

559
00:25:44.531 --> 00:25:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's exactly what I just defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

560
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.090
<v Speaker 1>What's the origin of ghetto a?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it.</v>

561
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it actually based on the word ghetto,</v>

562
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing?</v>

563
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Or is it totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like.</v>

564
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like read,</v>

565
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.330
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brace yourself folks.</v>

566
00:25:57.331 --> 00:25:58.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say a word that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing.</v>

567
00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Niggardly and it has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the n word.</v>

568
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to do with like find the origins</v>

569
00:26:08.121 --> 00:26:10.280
<v Speaker 1>of that word because I think it has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

570
00:26:10.281 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about being miserly or cheap.</v>

571
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it has nothing to do with black</v>

572
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:20.150
<v Speaker 1>history whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reluctant to give or spend stingy and</v>

573
00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.070
<v Speaker 1>miserly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

574
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.160
<v Speaker 1>and the origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the origin of it?</v>

575
00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Whereas this say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it say no?</v>

576
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have an origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let me,</v>

577
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.120
<v Speaker 1>if I could finish my point about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jessica,</v>

578
00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.550
<v Speaker 1>please do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

579
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Justin Trudeau,</v>

580
00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:39.230
<v Speaker 1>at one point when he was a member of</v>
<v Speaker 1>parliament,</v>

581
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:44.030
<v Speaker 1>someone had said that things like a fem</v>
<v Speaker 1>female genital mutilation</v>

582
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.040
<v Speaker 3>and child brides and honored killings</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the type of barbers and that we</v>

583
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:52.110
<v Speaker 3>don't need in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Justin Trudeau's position at the</v>

584
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:56.100
<v Speaker 3>time was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how dare you use the word barbarism and</v>

585
00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:58.080
<v Speaker 3>describing other people's cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

586
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 3>So he wasn't offended by having women's</v>
<v Speaker 3>clitoral says cut.</v>

587
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 3>He was offended by people who describe</v>
<v Speaker 3>that behavior as barbaric.</v>

588
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:11.150
<v Speaker 3>So he is the king of the ostriches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's not a fan of the godfathers.</v>

589
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I'm not a fan of his rather.</v>

590
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>

591
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.530
<v Speaker 3>Have you followed some of our debates</v>
<v Speaker 3>regarding,</v>

592
00:27:21.531 --> 00:27:23.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowing the,</v>

593
00:27:23.361 --> 00:27:25.020
<v Speaker 3>a sort of open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

594
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:28.110
<v Speaker 3>not the open door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but allowing massive number of Syrian</v>

595
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:29.700
<v Speaker 3>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

596
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I haven't followed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see what's going on in other</v>

597
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:35.220
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So of course in Europe they look at our</v>

598
00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:37.860
<v Speaker 3>issue and they sort of say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

599
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 3>are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have 800,000 migrants coming through</v>

600
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.260
<v Speaker 3>to Germany.</v>

601
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.440
<v Speaker 3>You're complaining about 25,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we'll look what happened with</v>

602
00:27:46.441 --> 00:27:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Cologne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

603
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Because the mayor of Cologne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after these attacks on New Year's Eve</v>

604
00:27:49.891 --> 00:27:52.020
<v Speaker 3>was telling women to dress difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

605
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 3>And stay away from men hostage brigade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking insane.</v>

606
00:27:56.161 --> 00:28:01.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean that that is a very culturally</v>
<v Speaker 3>diverse area that has existed in a very</v>

607
00:28:02.251 --> 00:28:06.930
<v Speaker 3>peaceful way for a long time until all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sudden they let in all these</v>

608
00:28:06.931 --> 00:28:10.440
<v Speaker 3>immigrants and they're having a massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with women being sexually</v>

609
00:28:10.441 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 3>assaulted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of protecting these women and</v>

610
00:28:13.051 --> 00:28:17.490
<v Speaker 3>trying to do their best to ramp up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>police force or do something to stop it</v>

611
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:19.830
<v Speaker 3>or make sure that people are safe or</v>
<v Speaker 3>really put it,</v>

612
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 3>put it out there that look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a new fucking place and if you</v>

613
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:24.100
<v Speaker 3>want to simulate in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got,</v>

614
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.520
<v Speaker 3>leave these fucking women alone or we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get rid of you.</v>

615
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Everyone who does anything to women in</v>
<v Speaker 3>our country,</v>

616
00:28:28.951 --> 00:28:31.530
<v Speaker 3>we're going to get rid of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't be here and make people feel</v>

617
00:28:31.531 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 3>unsafe instead of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But see,</v>

618
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:37.710
<v Speaker 3>that's so one of the reasons why I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>very concerned about the $25,000 coming</v>

619
00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 3>in and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well come on.</v>

620
00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 3>How many of them are likely to be Isis</v>
<v Speaker 3>members?</v>

621
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.990
<v Speaker 3>But the danger is not only people only</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of Isis members is the danger.</v>

622
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you've got 25,000 people,</v>

623
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:53.430
<v Speaker 3>of whom a very large majority will</v>
<v Speaker 3>adhere to certain values that are</v>

624
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:55.980
<v Speaker 3>perfectly antithetical to ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

625
00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.090
<v Speaker 3>What are your views on homosexuals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are your views on religious</v>

626
00:29:00.091 --> 00:29:03.810
<v Speaker 3>minorities and Jews?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we live in 25,000 Syrians at</v>

627
00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:08.130
<v Speaker 3>statistically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will they are the more likely or less</v>

628
00:29:08.131 --> 00:29:11.730
<v Speaker 3>likely that they'd be antisemitism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's an empirical statement</v>

629
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 3>that we could test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

630
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:17.940
<v Speaker 3>So it's not only about the fact that how</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of these 25,000 are isis members,</v>

631
00:29:17.941 --> 00:29:22.941
<v Speaker 3>it's how many of these 25,000 people</v>
<v Speaker 3>will hold values that are perfectly</v>

632
00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 3>congruent with ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we have every right.</v>

633
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Without having the threat of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>called racist and Islamophobia over our</v>

634
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 3>head to engage in a discussion on how do</v>
<v Speaker 3>we vet these people?</v>

635
00:29:35.551 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you find out what percentage of</v>

636
00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:41.890
<v Speaker 3>those are going to hold views that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>grotesque to us</v>

637
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 1>and then should we be letting them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what are the.</v>

638
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 1>What are the options mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

639
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.470
<v Speaker 1>How could you possibly find out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>their views are?</v>

640
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.460
<v Speaker 1>You would have to sit down with each one</v>
<v Speaker 1>individually and quiz them,</v>

641
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:57.550
<v Speaker 1>and then you would have to verify their</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims or their answers.</v>

642
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the very least,</v>

643
00:29:58.661 --> 00:30:03.661
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that you should never be</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed under the guise of your</v>

644
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:09.320
<v Speaker 1>religious practice to a spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

645
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 1>hateful things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

646
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

647
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.910
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a house of worship and that</v>

648
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:20.911
<v Speaker 1>house of worship is</v>
<v Speaker 1>praising certain things that you and I</v>

649
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:26.341
<v Speaker 1>would consider genocidal hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then my right to be free of the</v>

650
00:30:27.911 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 1>genocidal hatred that's coming my way</v>
<v Speaker 1>supersedes your right to practice your</v>

651
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:34.680
<v Speaker 1>religion of genocidally hating me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

652
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.580
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's simply has to be the rule.</v>

653
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And if we don't wake up to that reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have problems.</v>

654
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that that's a very</v>

655
00:30:43.631 --> 00:30:47.320
<v Speaker 1>reasonable statement and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people in this country</v>

656
00:30:47.321 --> 00:30:50.020
<v Speaker 1>that liked to say things like what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were claiming.</v>

657
00:30:50.021 --> 00:30:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau said about culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how dare you criticize their</v>

658
00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:56.230
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their culture is a bullshit word.</v>

659
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.750
<v Speaker 1>It's human behavior and you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at human behavior.</v>

660
00:30:59.751 --> 00:31:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Some human behavior is acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not,</v>

661
00:31:02.081 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 1>and if it's acceptable in other</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries to eat people,</v>

662
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not acceptable here.</v>

663
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.050
<v Speaker 1>You can't cook people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't eat them.</v>

664
00:31:08.051 --> 00:31:09.000
<v Speaker 1>We don't allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

665
00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let me,</v>

666
00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 1>let me add to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The part of multiculturalism is this</v>

667
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:18.520
<v Speaker 1>idea that all cultures are unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct and equal in their own right,</v>

668
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.390
<v Speaker 1>and actually that is a truly profoundly</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect statements.</v>

669
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Cultures are not equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but different cultures are</v>

670
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.380
<v Speaker 1>differentially able to engender</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness to more or less people,</v>

671
00:31:32.381 --> 00:31:32.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

672
00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

673
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.610
<v Speaker 1>so if you are part of whatever it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tali bond culture,</v>

674
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:41.910
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't on average predict that</v>
<v Speaker 1>women in that culture will be less</v>

675
00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 1>self-actualized than in western</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

676
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:46.680
<v Speaker 1>That isn't empirically demonstrable</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

677
00:31:46.681 --> 00:31:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the idea that who are we to judge</v>

678
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.270
<v Speaker 1>other cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of cultural relativism which</v>

679
00:31:52.271 --> 00:31:54.430
<v Speaker 1>has part which is endemic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiculturalism,</v>

680
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.610
<v Speaker 1>is profoundly incorrect and it has to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

681
00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:59.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a blind statement.</v>

682
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a real statement.</v>

683
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.310
<v Speaker 1>You can't really say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

684
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could look at it economically,</v>

685
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 1>you could look at it socially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at in terms of,</v>

686
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real good argument that in</v>

687
00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 1>this country there's less free freedom</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is another country's because</v>

688
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:14.010
<v Speaker 1>more people are in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

689
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.630
<v Speaker 1>You could look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look at the disproportionate</v>

690
00:32:16.631 --> 00:32:20.530
<v Speaker 1>amount of people that are in jail for</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonviolent drug offenses in this country</v>

691
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:21.521
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

692
00:32:21.521 --> 00:32:23.890
<v Speaker 1>this country is obviously a fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

693
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

694
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:31.560
<v Speaker 1>that's a legit claim as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of numerical value equal</v>

695
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.970
<v Speaker 1>making it equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all cultures are equal.</v>

696
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.950
<v Speaker 1>That's foolishness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

697
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very real thing going in the</v>

698
00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>world</v>

699
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.430
<v Speaker 2>where as the age of information washes</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon us,</v>

700
00:32:43.431 --> 00:32:47.300
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is the new age of</v>
<v Speaker 2>information that the age of pure</v>

701
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.300
<v Speaker 2>information as this wash is upon us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing massive changes in our own</v>

702
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:56.000
<v Speaker 2>country and we're seeing massive changes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our political system.</v>

703
00:32:56.001 --> 00:32:59.780
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing massive changes socially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think this is social justice</v>

704
00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:03.860
<v Speaker 2>warrior thing is sort of a side effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that were these disenfranchised</v>

705
00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:06.020
<v Speaker 2>people than some of them may be mentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>ill.</v>

706
00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:07.910
<v Speaker 2>They have a voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

707
00:33:07.911 --> 00:33:08.561
<v Speaker 2>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

708
00:33:08.561 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 2>let's not say ill imbalanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're radical because they're</v>

709
00:33:13.521 --> 00:33:17.210
<v Speaker 2>young and idealist and they haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at all the right ways.</v>

710
00:33:17.211 --> 00:33:21.290
<v Speaker 2>And then one day they'll balance out</v>
<v Speaker 2>like many people have as many young</v>

711
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 2>radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd become very rational people in</v>

712
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 2>their fifties and sixties and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>

713
00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.820
<v Speaker 2>this thing is taking place here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also taking place all over the</v>

714
00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:32.140
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

715
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where information is being resisted.</v>

716
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.220
<v Speaker 2>That's where we have problems in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

717
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:42.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where fundamental religious values are</v>

718
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.430
<v Speaker 2>superseding the age of information</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

719
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.590
<v Speaker 2>They're squashing people's ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>express themselves,</v>

720
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 2>people's ability to try new things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploring new things,</v>

721
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sexual values,</v>

722
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:54.741
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

723
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:56.840
<v Speaker 2>their identities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things.</v>

724
00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you have like an ancient</v>

725
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.540
<v Speaker 2>fucking scripture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some shit that was written on animal</v>

726
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:05.450
<v Speaker 2>skins a thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as soon as that is,</v>

727
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 2>is at the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that takes precedent over everything</v>

728
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:13.550
<v Speaker 2>else because it was supposedly the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>of God or who else?</v>

729
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Someone who talked to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is that you've got</v>

730
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:20.180
<v Speaker 2>a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real problem there because religion,</v>

731
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:25.930
<v Speaker 2>religion in and of itself is an idea and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an idea that is the only one of the</v>

732
00:34:28.071 --> 00:34:32.060
<v Speaker 2>very few ideas that we accept that</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally has no basis in reality.</v>

733
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:34.280
<v Speaker 2>There's no bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has no basis.</v>

734
00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:37.100
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has no basis in anything provable.</v>

735
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.320
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we have this concept of</v>
<v Speaker 2>faith.</v>

736
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you have religion that's</v>

737
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:46.190
<v Speaker 2>dominating information you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a problem,</v>

738
00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:50.450
<v Speaker 2>you've got a bottleneck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to put up a wall that's put up</v>

739
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.800
<v Speaker 2>for progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when people develop in that</v>

740
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:58.370
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have stifled people just like I have</v>

741
00:34:58.371 --> 00:35:03.371
<v Speaker 2>a friend and him and his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were Mormons until they were like</v>

742
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:06.320
<v Speaker 2>40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they decided to slowly.</v>

743
00:35:06.321 --> 00:35:10.490
<v Speaker 2>They literally lived overseas for a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they kind of experienced the world</v>

744
00:35:10.491 --> 00:35:11.324
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

745
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.790
<v Speaker 2>it opened their eyes to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things and they decided to</v>

746
00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:16.370
<v Speaker 2>move away from the church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking lost,</v>

747
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:17.690
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're lost.</v>

748
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're almost like grownup children.</v>

749
00:35:19.741 --> 00:35:22.550
<v Speaker 2>I think you might've told me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're wonderful people.</v>

750
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.700
<v Speaker 2>They're great people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the wife is really interesting.</v>

751
00:35:25.701 --> 00:35:28.910
<v Speaker 2>She's very self aware and she even talks</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

752
00:35:28.911 --> 00:35:32.870
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I growing up in this really</v>

753
00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:37.470
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I developed a really bad way of</v>

754
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 2>looking at things</v>

755
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.880
<v Speaker 1>where I'm easily confused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily confused and easily lead,</v>

756
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with like a charlatan could,</v>

757
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.770
<v Speaker 1>could take her over or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cult member could.</v>

758
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Chapter eight of the book I just gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

759
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.740
<v Speaker 1>it's called marketing hope by selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies.</v>

760
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:56.910
<v Speaker 1>And basically what I argued there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are different peddlers of hope</v>

761
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:01.410
<v Speaker 1>that are successful precisely because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could sell you hope and the areas</v>

762
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:04.950
<v Speaker 1>that are most important in sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian insecurities right now to be a</v>

763
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:08.730
<v Speaker 1>better lover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to live forever to be a better</v>

764
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:09.350
<v Speaker 1>parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

765
00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

766
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 1>so all of the key Darwinian pursuits</v>
<v Speaker 1>that keep us and keep us up at night,</v>

767
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.730
<v Speaker 1>there is a peddler out there who can</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you the recipe,</v>

768
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:21.180
<v Speaker 1>whether he be a self help guru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he be a medical quack,</v>

769
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.740
<v Speaker 1>whether he be religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's why those products are so</v>

770
00:36:25.741 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 1>successful because they peddle us hope.</v>

771
00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but growing up in with religion,</v>

772
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:33.060
<v Speaker 1>especially fundamentalist religion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot be questioned,</v>

773
00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:36.510
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a real problem because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these rigid areas where you're</v>

774
00:36:36.511 --> 00:36:40.440
<v Speaker 1>only allowed to think one way right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You develop these patterns in your mind.</v>

775
00:36:40.441 --> 00:36:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Then when you move to a new place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't support those ideas and you</v>

776
00:36:43.681 --> 00:36:47.850
<v Speaker 1>want to use genital mutilation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to wrap women up and fucking</v>

777
00:36:47.851 --> 00:36:52.200
<v Speaker 1>mummy cloth and make sure they can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive like you want to do that same shit</v>

778
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:55.140
<v Speaker 1>in Canada that you're doing in Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabia,</v>

779
00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.020
<v Speaker 1>you got real fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real problem.</v>

780
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:04.140
<v Speaker 1>And Justin Trudeau would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are we to judge their practices?</v>

781
00:37:04.141 --> 00:37:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Whereas what you're saying is you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>against multiculturalism because you are</v>

782
00:37:07.171 --> 00:37:09.960
<v Speaker 1>taking a position against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't like Justin Trudeau.</v>

783
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not against</v>

784
00:37:11.611 --> 00:37:13.770
<v Speaker 1>multiculturalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm against,</v>

785
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm against religious fundamentalism on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

786
00:37:17.051 --> 00:37:20.670
<v Speaker 1>on a global scale because I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>against God and this is what people have</v>

787
00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:21.210
<v Speaker 1>to understand.</v>

788
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Like I would be the last person to tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you I have any idea about something that</v>

789
00:37:27.151 --> 00:37:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I have never experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I've experienced is the afterlife.</v>

790
00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I have never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am open to the idea that this life is</v>

791
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.300
<v Speaker 1>one stage and an infinite fractal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a gigantic,</v>

792
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.980
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of experiences that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>our energy can,</v>

793
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.500
<v Speaker 1>can go through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer Jack.</v>

794
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Could that simply be the fact that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are finding an alternate way,</v>

795
00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 1>not through religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but through some alternate means to live</v>

796
00:37:59.431 --> 00:38:00.211
<v Speaker 1>on forever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

797
00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.650
<v Speaker 1>exactly right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could.</v>

798
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I could take this pill called religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will grant me a mortality or I</v>

799
00:38:05.011 --> 00:38:10.011
<v Speaker 1>could do your fractal Mumbo jumbo stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's no disrespect and that could</v>

800
00:38:10.681 --> 00:38:12.480
<v Speaker 1>still get me through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the reality of the</v>

801
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:17.250
<v Speaker 1>intellectually honest position is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really have absolutely no evidence.</v>

802
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:20.730
<v Speaker 1>This is a very small party that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>last if you're lucky,</v>

803
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:25.731
<v Speaker 1>85 years and it's profoundly fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>inducing because I want to be coming</v>

804
00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:28.170
<v Speaker 1>back on this podcast for the next 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

805
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.630
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really worries me that I won't,</v>

806
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:32.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's honest.</v>

807
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 1>To know that you've got 85 years in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense it's</v>

808
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:41.010
<v Speaker 2>liberating because it forces me and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're an atheist to really carpet dm</v>

809
00:38:41.541 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 2>at right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have to seize the day because</v>

810
00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.930
<v Speaker 2>there are no do overs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no eternity,</v>

811
00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:49.360
<v Speaker 2>there is no afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all right here.</v>

812
00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:53.740
<v Speaker 2>What we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so in a sense there is a a glory to</v>

813
00:38:53.741 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 2>the finiteness that is afforded by</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheism.</v>

814
00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.070
<v Speaker 2>You can certainly look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

815
00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 2>my perspective though is that we really</v>
<v Speaker 2>just don't know and that energy</v>

816
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 2>continues to move forward in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>

817
00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:10.480
<v Speaker 2>We see this throughout all of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas things die.</v>

818
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 2>They get reabsorbed into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The very energy and the essence that</v>

819
00:39:14.921 --> 00:39:19.750
<v Speaker 2>they had when they were alive fuels all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these different microbes and bacteria</v>

820
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 2>and the ground that it makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The soil richer,</v>

821
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.600
<v Speaker 2>grows more plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animals eat those plants that nourishes</v>

822
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.080
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

823
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.470
<v Speaker 2>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they literally the cells and the carbon</v>

824
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:33.910
<v Speaker 2>from every fucking human being on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet came from a star that exploded.</v>

825
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Death becomes life and some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange way,</v>

826
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.660
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that it's impossible</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that could be the same thing with</v>

827
00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:42.370
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with energy,</v>

828
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.100
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with whatever the fuck it is inside of</v>

829
00:39:45.101 --> 00:39:50.101
<v Speaker 2>us that makes us alive and aware and</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes our minds tune in to all of the</v>

830
00:39:50.861 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 2>possibilities in the wonders of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

831
00:39:52.811 --> 00:39:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't either.</v>

832
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:56.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

833
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.010
<v Speaker 2>no one does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

834
00:39:57.011 --> 00:39:59.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as soon as someone comes along</v>

835
00:39:59.141 --> 00:40:00.370
<v Speaker 2>and tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do know,</v>

836
00:40:00.371 --> 00:40:02.080
<v Speaker 2>and this is the only way to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterlife,</v>

837
00:40:02.081 --> 00:40:04.630
<v Speaker 2>this is the only way to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a real problem.</v>

838
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 2>You got a real problem because human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings are malleable and you can guide</v>

839
00:40:08.411 --> 00:40:12.100
<v Speaker 2>them and you can direct them and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>mold them and you could turn them into</v>

840
00:40:12.101 --> 00:40:13.210
<v Speaker 2>religious slaves.</v>

841
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:18.100
<v Speaker 2>You could turn them into ideological</v>
<v Speaker 2>slaves and we should recognize that from</v>

842
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.670
<v Speaker 2>a psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an educated perspective,</v>

843
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.760
<v Speaker 2>from a perspective of recognizing cult</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral.</v>

844
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:27.610
<v Speaker 2>I was watching this thing on this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Hassan,</v>

845
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.220
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was on our podcast before</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a cult expert.</v>

846
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.020
<v Speaker 2>He sent me an email today and I watched</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

847
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:37.360
<v Speaker 2>this piece on on cults and cult behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cults on the Internet and it's so</v>

848
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.330
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying how malleable people's</v>

849
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:44.680
<v Speaker 2>minds are and how someone who's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>unscrupulous person or unscrupulous</v>

850
00:40:44.681 --> 00:40:49.681
<v Speaker 2>person or someone who has nefarious</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas can convince people to blow</v>

851
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:52.180
<v Speaker 2>themselves up to get virgins in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterlife.</v>

852
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a reality.</v>

853
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Very earthly Darwinian things in her</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

854
00:40:56.891 --> 00:40:57.401
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

855
00:40:57.401 --> 00:41:02.401
<v Speaker 2>it's the people don't know and that's my</v>
<v Speaker 2>point and when someone comes along and</v>

856
00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:04.530
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know and this is the truth,</v>

857
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.750
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a real problem because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't fucking prove it.</v>

858
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.520
<v Speaker 2>You can't prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any facts,</v>

859
00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:11.530
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing you can measure.</v>

860
00:41:11.531 --> 00:41:14.470
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing you could way and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not saying you think you're saying,</v>

861
00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:16.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you think one thing,</v>

862
00:41:16.901 --> 00:41:18.450
<v Speaker 2>if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is it,</v>

863
00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Carpe Diem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live for the day.</v>

864
00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:22.150
<v Speaker 2>This is our only shot here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be right,</v>

865
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.560
<v Speaker 2>or this guy who's done a fucking pound</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mushrooms might've come back from the</v>

866
00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:28.060
<v Speaker 2>other side and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

867
00:41:28.061 --> 00:41:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I have this idea and I think that love</v>
<v Speaker 2>is eternal and it goes on forever,</v>

868
00:41:32.831 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>and then what we really are</v>

869
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.330
<v Speaker 1>here we are this being that's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure itself out in this very brief</v>

870
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:41.630
<v Speaker 1>amount of time and the best we can do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave behind information.</v>

871
00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:44.540
<v Speaker 1>We have this wonderful thing called</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication and language.</v>

872
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Speaker 1>We store this information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next generation comes along and</v>

873
00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:50.690
<v Speaker 1>tries to pick up where the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation left off,</v>

874
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:54.260
<v Speaker 1>gather up as much data as they can and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then move it forward a little bit before</v>

875
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:58.010
<v Speaker 1>they expire and we keep doing it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it and doing it and doing it until</v>

876
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:03.040
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we move towards some level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment as a species.</v>

877
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:03.861
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

878
00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I can repackage that in slightly more</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthly and less esoteric terms.</v>

879
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I think that we can achieve immortality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and quilts in two ways,</v>

880
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 1>right through genetic propagation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you and I have children.</v>

881
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally we are extending our</v>
<v Speaker 1>genes and also through mimetic</v>

882
00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:23.870
<v Speaker 1>propagation and mimetic propagation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

883
00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:26.960
<v Speaker 1>you read this book and now infects your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>

884
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not reading it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not effecting me man.</v>

885
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.050
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next time I come,</v>

886
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:32.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a 100 percent final exam on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

887
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.720
<v Speaker 1>So you better professor made exams right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

888
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.200
<v Speaker 1>like a cheat sheet or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm the medic.</v>

889
00:42:39.201 --> 00:42:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Propagation is basically anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be part if you like,</v>

890
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:44.690
<v Speaker 1>of your legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

891
00:42:44.691 --> 00:42:49.691
<v Speaker 1>So the collection of stuff that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can go and and watch about you as part</v>

892
00:42:50.121 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 1>of Joe Rogan's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mimetic propagation and long after you</v>

893
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 1>may be gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will be able to consume Joe</v>

894
00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Rogan's ideas and all of the wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that he's done for many,</v>

895
00:43:00.231 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 1>many years to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in that sense,</v>

896
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I think either through genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>propagation or mimetic propagation,</v>

897
00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.120
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can be immortal and that's why it is</v>

898
00:43:08.121 --> 00:43:11.060
<v Speaker 1>really important to do all the wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people do.</v>

899
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Because that is your ticket to</v>
<v Speaker 1>immortality.</v>

900
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:14.683
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

901
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:15.411
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

902
00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:16.244
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know?</v>

903
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until I have any evidence of</v>

904
00:43:19.221 --> 00:43:21.080
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take the intellectually</v>

905
00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:23.480
<v Speaker 1>honest position and say the party is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to end.</v>

906
00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

907
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.370
<v Speaker 1>let's get further than that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>immortality is nonsense.</v>

908
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:31.550
<v Speaker 1>This fucking son doesn't have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>immortal life.</v>

909
00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got it for 4 billion years,</v>

910
00:43:33.271 --> 00:43:34.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're lucky,</v>

911
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.810
<v Speaker 1>and that's assuming that we don't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit by one of these gigantic fucking</v>

912
00:43:38.811 --> 00:43:41.450
<v Speaker 1>rocks and keeps flying around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear about that one that went off</v>

913
00:43:41.451 --> 00:43:43.330
<v Speaker 1>over the Atlantic Ocean the other day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

914
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking media exploded over the</v>

915
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic Ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew about it.</v>

916
00:43:50.481 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Nobody heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew is coming.</v>

917
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Will pull this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

918
00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:57.770
<v Speaker 1>because the amount of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we hit,</v>

919
00:43:57.771 --> 00:43:58.930
<v Speaker 1>let's say New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would have happened?</v>

920
00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Everyone like Hiroshima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than here.</v>

921
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Here it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a media exposure over the Atlantic.</v>

922
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Like pull up the amount of power that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had had.</v>

923
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I had it on my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

924
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I had it on my twitter where it talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about in relationship to a Hiroshima,</v>

925
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.420
<v Speaker 1>like how big of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

926
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:22.450
<v Speaker 1>due to do 500,000 tons of TNT.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

927
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:28.820
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the one over Russia.</v>

928
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what the one who thousand tons</v>

929
00:44:31.771 --> 00:44:33.510
<v Speaker 1>of TNT.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

930
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russian one I remember from a few</v>

931
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.833
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

932
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.840
<v Speaker 1>But what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the Atlantic Ocean one will pull</v>

933
00:44:39.841 --> 00:44:42.840
<v Speaker 1>up the one that compared it to a pull up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the article that I had on my,</v>

934
00:44:42.841 --> 00:44:44.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my twitter because it's,</v>

935
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:47.550
<v Speaker 1>it compared it to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nuclear bomb.</v>

936
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

937
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.740
<v Speaker 1>well these are really common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

938
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:54.960
<v Speaker 1>and I had this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randall Carlson on the podcast a few</v>

939
00:44:54.961 --> 00:44:59.961
<v Speaker 1>times and he's dedicated his life to</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the signs of</v>

940
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:03.720
<v Speaker 1>asteroidal impacts all throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>history and all throughout the world.</v>

941
00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And astronomer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

942
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 1>and he believes that what's happened is</v>
<v Speaker 1>all throughout human history,</v>

943
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:12.870
<v Speaker 1>there's been these resets where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated a lot of data,</v>

944
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:16.320
<v Speaker 1>they learned a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>society move forward and then boom,</v>

945
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:20.190
<v Speaker 1>we got hit and then a lot of people died</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they had to regroup,</v>

946
00:45:20.191 --> 00:45:22.320
<v Speaker 1>start all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of evidence in the</v>

947
00:45:22.321 --> 00:45:23.870
<v Speaker 1>physical form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stuff called [inaudible],</v>

948
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called Triton night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called new,</v>

949
00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.600
<v Speaker 1>its nuclear glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it.</v>

950
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:32.700
<v Speaker 1>It's the same substance that they find</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they do nuclear tests in the desert</v>

951
00:45:32.701 --> 00:45:36.510
<v Speaker 1>and stuff and they found it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout Europe and Asia and they find</v>

952
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 1>it when they do core samples between</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 and 12,000 years.</v>

953
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's exactly the same time as the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ice age coincides with the end of</v>

954
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:48.981
<v Speaker 1>the ice age and with these these like</v>
<v Speaker 1>puzzling moments in civilization where</v>

955
00:45:49.501 --> 00:45:52.030
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll find things like go Beckley</v>

956
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.420
<v Speaker 1>tappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these beautiful structures that are</v>

957
00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:56.640
<v Speaker 1>really complex that are 14,000 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

958
00:45:56.641 --> 00:45:57.780
<v Speaker 1>12,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

959
00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.840
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck was building this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then when we thought people were</v>

960
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:03.660
<v Speaker 1>hunter gatherers and then right after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

961
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.480
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get hit by rocks.</v>

962
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Most people die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people die and then they have</v>

963
00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:13.800
<v Speaker 1>to regroup again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that that's most likely</v>

964
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:17.790
<v Speaker 1>going to be the end of humanity just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was the end of the dinosaurs 65</v>

965
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:22.790
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more common then we would then</v>

966
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:26.940
<v Speaker 1>we really would like to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So definitely don't sweat it.</v>

967
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Don't sweat the small stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:46:28.351 --> 00:46:31.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no and mortality as far as this</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

969
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna happen.</v>

970
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:35.010
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want me to tell you a bit about the</v>

971
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.410
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary roots of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

972
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.830
<v Speaker 1>how you would study religion as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionist.</v>

973
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:41.723
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Ready?</v>

974
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one argument is based on,</v>

975
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:45.720
<v Speaker 1>it's an adaptive argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

976
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:50.250
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is if religion exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that confer an adaptive advantage</v>

977
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:53.130
<v Speaker 1>to people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was some work done by a</v>

978
00:46:53.131 --> 00:46:55.710
<v Speaker 1>good friend of Mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Wilson and evolutionary biologist</v>

979
00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:01.320
<v Speaker 1>where he argues using a group selection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's argument that that groups that are</v>

980
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:05.970
<v Speaker 1>religious out survive groups that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by virtue of them being more</v>

981
00:47:05.971 --> 00:47:07.590
<v Speaker 1>communal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cohesive,</v>

982
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.460
<v Speaker 1>more abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that argument is an adaptive argument</v>

983
00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:15.030
<v Speaker 1>for why religion exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another argument by other</v>

984
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:17.910
<v Speaker 1>evolutionists that is based on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>exaltation arguing.</v>

985
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard that term except</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptation.</v>

986
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.520
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a byproduct of evolution.</v>

987
00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.430
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that evolved not because</v>

988
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.160
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it confers an adaptive advantage.</v>

989
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Rather it's piggybacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

990
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:33.670
<v Speaker 1>the fact that your skeletal system is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the color that it is,</v>

991
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:37.630
<v Speaker 1>that itself is not adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a byproduct of other evolutionary</v>

992
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:39.910
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from that perspective,</v>

993
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:45.370
<v Speaker 1>religion piggybacks on computational</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems in our brains that evolved for</v>

994
00:47:45.371 --> 00:47:46.740
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You follow me,</v>

995
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.520
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coalitional thinking,</v>

996
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.550
<v Speaker 1>the idea of viewing the world as US</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus them,</v>

997
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:55.690
<v Speaker 1>blue team versus red team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is an innate part of our psychology</v>

998
00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.750
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now religion piggybacks on that,</v>

999
00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:00.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes that computational system that</v>

1000
00:48:00.761 --> 00:48:04.210
<v Speaker 1>already exists in us and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it puts it on steroids,</v>

1001
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think about the Abrahamic</v>

1002
00:48:05.561 --> 00:48:06.394
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1003
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Every one of them has us versus them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the Jews,</v>

1004
00:48:10.181 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 1>the gentiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the believers,</v>

1005
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 1>the preferred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1006
00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:18.350
<v Speaker 1>And so at agency detection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>detecting agency and things is something</v>

1007
00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:19.570
<v Speaker 1>that is innate to us.</v>

1008
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Religion plays on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The agent becomes God,</v>

1009
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:26.440
<v Speaker 1>and so that's an argument that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>proposed by Pascal where he's basically</v>

1010
00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:30.370
<v Speaker 1>saying that religion did not</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically evolve because itself self,</v>

1011
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:33.160
<v Speaker 1>it is adaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it piggybacks on other things that</v>

1012
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:37.210
<v Speaker 1>have evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a third way to study religion</v>

1013
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:41.220
<v Speaker 1>is to just do a content analysis of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1014
00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.050
<v Speaker 1>the narratives within religions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a great study done by a</v>

1015
00:48:44.051 --> 00:48:49.051
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian historian where she looked at</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the old testament how many women are</v>

1016
00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:54.781
<v Speaker 1>ascribed to a different male in the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>testament as a function of a status.</v>

1017
00:48:55.750 --> 00:49:00.430
<v Speaker 1>So the higher the status of the male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more sexual partners you had,</v>

1018
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.940
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you would predict</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an evolutionary perspective.</v>

1019
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:08.080
<v Speaker 1>High status to men confers reproductive</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

1020
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 1>So there are different ways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution is.</v>

1021
00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:15.070
<v Speaker 1>And there are several other ways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can study religion from an evolutionary</v>

1022
00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:15.904
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

1023
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:17.990
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1024
00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I also think that we've always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as cultures have sort of tried to stay</v>

1025
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:28.531
<v Speaker 1>alive and have tried to maintain order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've always tried to establish sets of</v>

1026
00:49:29.951 --> 00:49:34.570
<v Speaker 1>rules and boundaries and things and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>only makes sense that you would say,</v>

1027
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:35.501
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1028
00:49:35.501 --> 00:49:38.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a real reason why you can't kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1029
00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's not because it makes everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>

1030
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.070
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're gonna go to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1031
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 1>So listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to go to hell.</v>

1032
00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:46.810
<v Speaker 1>So don't kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these,</v>

1033
00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.750
<v Speaker 1>all these things that people have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout history.</v>

1034
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at religion on a global</v>

1035
00:49:53.291 --> 00:49:56.740
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some key components to almost</v>

1036
00:49:56.741 --> 00:50:01.741
<v Speaker 1>all religions and those seem to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to benefit order.</v>

1037
00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:06.670
<v Speaker 1>They seem to benefit culture and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were saying that the idea of people</v>

1038
00:50:06.671 --> 00:50:09.010
<v Speaker 1>living longer and being more successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a.</v>

1039
00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.240
<v Speaker 1>As a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1040
00:50:10.241 --> 00:50:12.790
<v Speaker 1>we'll senses of community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a sense of community,</v>

1041
00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:14.430
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you established community and</v>

1042
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:19.450
<v Speaker 1>establish a bond between people and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher good or a higher reason to exist.</v>

1043
00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you another example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A kosher laws actually have discussed</v>

1044
00:50:23.471 --> 00:50:24.700
<v Speaker 1>this in this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1045
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 1>So I try to offer a biological</v>

1046
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:33.070
<v Speaker 3>explanation that is not rooted in</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious narratives for why kosher laws</v>

1047
00:50:33.411 --> 00:50:34.400
<v Speaker 3>would have evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1048
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.530
<v Speaker 3>So think about the kosher edict that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't eat shellfish.</v>

1049
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I did a lot of research when I was</v>

1050
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.700
<v Speaker 3>writing the book on this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turns out that when you have</v>

1051
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:49.760
<v Speaker 3>shellfish that is infected with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular pathogen,</v>

1052
00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:50.960
<v Speaker 3>red tie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

1053
00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:51.860
<v Speaker 3>That could kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1054
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one that is infected versus the one</v>

1055
00:50:55.401 --> 00:50:57.920
<v Speaker 3>that is uninformed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not infected.</v>

1056
00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.760
<v Speaker 3>You can't really tell the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>either through smell,</v>

1057
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.010
<v Speaker 3>either through site,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so number one,</v>

1058
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 3>number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not as though the one that's coming</v>

1059
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:08.690
<v Speaker 3>from an infected lives in mercury or</v>
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

1060
00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.320
<v Speaker 3>so there was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is nothing that you could use in</v>

1061
00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:17.060
<v Speaker 3>terms of observational learning that can</v>
<v Speaker 3>offer you some statistical regularity of</v>

1062
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:20.060
<v Speaker 3>if I do a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>b will happen once in a while.</v>

1063
00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Somebody eats a shellfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they dropped that.</v>

1064
00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking as a Bronze Age guy running</v>

1065
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:31.370
<v Speaker 3>around the Middle East to ever learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>from this mal addiction.</v>

1066
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Therefore the only thing that I can do</v>
<v Speaker 3>is then say it is a edict from God.</v>

1067
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>

1068
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.140
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they are very,</v>

1069
00:51:39.141 --> 00:51:43.190
<v Speaker 3>very easy earthly biological reasons to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take food,</v>

1070
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:45.740
<v Speaker 3>taboos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious taboos and demonstrate that</v>

1071
00:51:45.741 --> 00:51:48.110
<v Speaker 3>they have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course when I say this in a</v>

1072
00:51:48.111 --> 00:51:51.050
<v Speaker 3>classroom where there are people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>might otherwise be religious,</v>

1073
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:54.350
<v Speaker 3>they see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet they can't completely follow you</v>

1074
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.213
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1075
00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:55.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1076
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.420
<v Speaker 3>because they have this doctrine in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind that is just the word of God will</v>

1077
00:51:59.421 --> 00:52:01.250
<v Speaker 3>also pigs eating pig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1078
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all know that pigs contained trick of</v>

1079
00:52:03.561 --> 00:52:05.870
<v Speaker 3>gnosis and exactly bears as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1080
00:52:05.871 --> 00:52:08.510
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to eat bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of reasons why kosher</v>

1081
00:52:08.511 --> 00:52:09.890
<v Speaker 3>living in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1082
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.320
<v Speaker 3>a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>5,000 years ago or whatever was really</v>

1083
00:52:12.321 --> 00:52:13.670
<v Speaker 3>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smart way to go.</v>

1084
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever read.</v>

1085
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving him here a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1086
00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.711
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1087
00:52:17.711 --> 00:52:19.880
<v Speaker 3>a thumbs up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it'll help his book.</v>

1088
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:23.350
<v Speaker 3>The Paleo manifesto by John Durant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1089
00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:25.970
<v Speaker 3>no I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but John and I have been talking back</v>

1090
00:52:25.971 --> 00:52:28.310
<v Speaker 3>and forth on twitter and where he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving here.</v>

1091
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.800
<v Speaker 3>So when he moves here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's dead to me.</v>

1092
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:33.380
<v Speaker 3>You just said he's moving here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be in southern California.</v>

1093
00:52:33.381 --> 00:52:38.381
<v Speaker 3>Is that I now see my hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were here for like three months,</v>

1094
00:52:38.841 --> 00:52:40.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weren't you here for a bunch of money</v>

1095
00:52:40.401 --> 00:52:42.890
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you move here because I need a</v>

1096
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:46.810
<v Speaker 3>professorship job here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a smart guy selling books.</v>

1097
00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.340
<v Speaker 3>You're doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

1098
00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:52.760
<v Speaker 3>and I think in his book he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the exact number,</v>

1099
00:52:52.761 --> 00:52:57.761
<v Speaker 3>but he looked at the 613 commandments in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish law and some outlandish number,</v>

1100
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:04.490
<v Speaker 3>say something like 20 percent of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with purity rituals.</v>

1101
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:10.270
<v Speaker 3>And those purity rituals are ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 3>means very earthly means to try to</v>

1102
00:53:10.701 --> 00:53:14.690
<v Speaker 3>remove the possibility that you've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>exposed to dangerous pathogens.</v>

1103
00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:15.861
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

1104
00:53:15.861 --> 00:53:20.450
<v Speaker 3>you see how something that is cloaked</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the in the robe of religion is</v>

1105
00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:23.810
<v Speaker 3>ultimately solving a very basic earthly</v>
<v Speaker 3>biological problem.</v>

1106
00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Well also if you talk about</v>

1107
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.220
<v Speaker 2>sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>promiscuity,</v>

1108
00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:32.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Controlling that controls sexually</v>

1109
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:36.150
<v Speaker 2>transmitted diseases which like syphilis</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of the really terminal ones</v>

1110
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.160
<v Speaker 2>before they had medication for those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1111
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:42.120
<v Speaker 2>they killed a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people died from having sex,</v>

1112
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:46.500
<v Speaker 2>which is just a ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cruel thank and you got to assume that</v>

1113
00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:49.650
<v Speaker 2>that's probably nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to strike some sort of a balance,</v>

1114
00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to think about it that</v>

1115
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:55.500
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's exists all throughout nature.</v>

1116
00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:59.250
<v Speaker 2>When animals become overpopulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden they start developing</v>

1117
00:53:59.251 --> 00:54:02.520
<v Speaker 2>diseases and they fall off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the rabbit cycle,</v>

1118
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:07.380
<v Speaker 2>if you're not aware of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't aware of rabbits go in a seven</v>

1119
00:54:07.381 --> 00:54:11.670
<v Speaker 2>year cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're around and you see a lot of</v>

1120
00:54:11.671 --> 00:54:16.470
<v Speaker 2>rabbits see rabbits all over the place</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then like three years later there's</v>

1121
00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:19.980
<v Speaker 2>no rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens is rabbits get to a high</v>

1122
00:54:19.981 --> 00:54:24.900
<v Speaker 2>population level and then they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop a disease and they die off and</v>

1123
00:54:24.901 --> 00:54:28.810
<v Speaker 2>then there's only a few rabbits and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes seven years until they reach</v>

1124
00:54:28.811 --> 00:54:32.230
<v Speaker 2>this peak and then they die off again in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a natural setting,</v>

1125
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:37.320
<v Speaker 2>natural constant seven year cycle to</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulate the population of rabbits</v>

1126
00:54:37.321 --> 00:54:40.890
<v Speaker 2>because we all know that rabbits fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>like rabbits and they,</v>

1127
00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:43.980
<v Speaker 2>they make a lot of babies and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that.</v>

1128
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately with pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs are so hardy and so ruthless that</v>

1129
00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:51.600
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will have litters three,</v>

1130
00:54:51.601 --> 00:54:55.230
<v Speaker 2>four times a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a female pig can have a litter</v>

1131
00:54:55.231 --> 00:54:57.330
<v Speaker 2>as soon as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look this up,</v>

1132
00:54:57.331 --> 00:54:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to say it's like within six</v>

1133
00:54:59.341 --> 00:55:02.370
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within six months of being born she can</v>

1134
00:55:02.371 --> 00:55:04.410
<v Speaker 2>give birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy,</v>

1135
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:09.690
<v Speaker 2>and they can just have piglets three</v>
<v Speaker 2>times a year and each time they do it</v>

1136
00:55:09.691 --> 00:55:12.930
<v Speaker 2>they'll have a bunch of them and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>just overtake places.</v>

1137
00:55:12.931 --> 00:55:15.840
<v Speaker 2>They got a problem in San Jose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a news story on the other day</v>

1138
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:20.550
<v Speaker 2>where these people were in their house</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the pigs were knocking over the</v>

1139
00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:25.140
<v Speaker 2>garbage can and eating up their lawn in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a normal residential neighborhood.</v>

1140
00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean a pretty crowded</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>

1141
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:30.210
<v Speaker 2>And these wild pigs are just roaming</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the streets now.</v>

1142
00:55:30.211 --> 00:55:31.620
<v Speaker 2>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you.</v>

1143
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard the term our case</v>
<v Speaker 2>selected?</v>

1144
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Does that ring a bell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1145
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.760
<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically it's the idea that some</v>

1146
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:43.761
<v Speaker 2>species produce many offspring with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hope that very few will survive until</v>

1147
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.910
<v Speaker 2>sexual maturity alligator frog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1148
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Many fish pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1149
00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Versus a little on that scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would be less so versus a elephant.</v>

1150
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Humans where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1151
00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:00.240
<v Speaker 2>the gestational period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1152
00:56:00.241 --> 00:56:02.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the length of parental investment that</v>

1153
00:56:02.071 --> 00:56:04.770
<v Speaker 2>is required before you reach sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>maturity as much.</v>

1154
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:09.480
<v Speaker 2>So it's either a lot of quantity hoping</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you survive or much less</v>

1155
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:12.410
<v Speaker 2>quantitative but heavily parental</v>
<v Speaker 2>investment and,</v>

1156
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.300
<v Speaker 2>and just that right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you are a species that is our</v>

1157
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.180
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1158
00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.380
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason for the arcade room doesn't</v>

1159
00:56:19.381 --> 00:56:20.400
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1160
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 2>has a profound effect on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary trajectory</v>

1161
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.480
<v Speaker 1>of that species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1162
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:30.160
<v Speaker 1>So thanks for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a humans are a bike rental species,</v>

1163
00:56:30.161 --> 00:56:33.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though you males invest</v>

1164
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:35.860
<v Speaker 1>parentally less than females in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human context,</v>

1165
00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.170
<v Speaker 1>we are really championed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the,</v>

1166
00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:39.610
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the greater context of,</v>

1167
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:43.120
<v Speaker 1>of mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human dads are just outlandish,</v>

1168
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:45.970
<v Speaker 1>but there's no one like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing like us except for example,</v>

1169
00:56:45.971 --> 00:56:48.040
<v Speaker 1>penguins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's of course you're not mammals.</v>

1170
00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:51.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the human context then because we</v>

1171
00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:54.520
<v Speaker 1>are by parental species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would expect the evolution of a few</v>

1172
00:56:54.521 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of which,</v>

1173
00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:59.110
<v Speaker 1>and I actually recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I discussed this in one of my lectures</v>

1174
00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:00.880
<v Speaker 1>because somebody asked that exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1175
00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:06.180
<v Speaker 1>So the evolution of romantic love is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like a solution to this very</v>

1176
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:09.220
<v Speaker 1>important problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you and I,</v>

1177
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.400
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female have to pair bond for a certain</v>

1178
00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:15.310
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to be able to stand one another</v>

1179
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:19.860
<v Speaker 1>for a sufficiently large enough period</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time to get our child to sexual</v>

1180
00:57:19.861 --> 00:57:24.861
<v Speaker 1>maturity and hence they are selection</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressures for us to evolve the aspect of</v>

1181
00:57:25.611 --> 00:57:27.580
<v Speaker 1>system that we call romantic love.</v>

1182
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1183
00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:34.040
<v Speaker 1>so this shows you how the pending on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular history of the species.</v>

1184
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:37.570
<v Speaker 1>You get completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting trajectories,</v>

1185
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Dennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

1186
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 1>And it completely makes sense if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

1187
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:45.160
<v Speaker 1>And there are certain animals like rats</v>
<v Speaker 1>or mice,</v>

1188
00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:48.790
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly being preyed upon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to develop large litters.</v>

1189
00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another one here at coping with</v>

1190
00:57:51.011 --> 00:57:52.030
<v Speaker 1>feral hogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1191
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five and six pigs per litter sounds of</v>

1192
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:56.920
<v Speaker 1>approximately one point five liters per</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

1193
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:57.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when,</v>

1194
00:57:57.521 --> 00:57:59.890
<v Speaker 1>when can they get pregnant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get to the first litter when</v>

1195
00:57:59.891 --> 00:58:03.940
<v Speaker 1>they're 13 months of age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be sexually mature at six months.</v>

1196
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.760
<v Speaker 1>What's their life expectancy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

1197
00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd say 48 years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's if they don't get killed by a</v>

1198
00:58:12.371 --> 00:58:13.540
<v Speaker 1>cougar series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one.</v>

1199
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:16.840
<v Speaker 1>You Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

1200
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.600
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't know what sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimorphism is.</v>

1201
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right,</v>

1202
00:58:20.531 --> 00:58:23.470
<v Speaker 1>so humans are sexually dimorphic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But take for example,</v>

1203
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:24.790
<v Speaker 1>why don't you explain it to people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

1204
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1205
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:28.540
<v Speaker 1>So where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there is an innate sex difference.</v>

1206
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Typically we talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1207
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.860
<v Speaker 1>you're a sexist sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized,</v>

1208
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:34.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual dimorphism is just a cultural,</v>

1209
00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:38.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a cultural construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>

1210
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.290
<v Speaker 1>And I like how you say it with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>affectations person.</v>

1211
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I watch a woman in a video explained</v>
<v Speaker 1>that women are not inherently weaker</v>

1212
00:58:46.211 --> 00:58:49.190
<v Speaker 1>than men and just engage in less</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength based activities.</v>

1213
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:51.130
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

1214
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Well actually at [inaudible] even been</v>
<v Speaker 1>linked to the fact that little boys are</v>

1215
00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:03.810
<v Speaker 1>encouraged to play rough and tumble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas little girls are dissuaded from</v>

1216
00:59:04.211 --> 00:59:06.910
<v Speaker 1>doing so and that's what sets them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their trajectory.</v>

1217
00:59:06.911 --> 00:59:10.880
<v Speaker 1>So that Baba who plays center for</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Nebraska can bench press</v>

1218
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.390
<v Speaker 1>500 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely social construction has</v>

1219
00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:15.520
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with muscle mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to do with testosterone,</v>

1220
00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:18.850
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so going back to differences across</v>

1221
00:59:18.851 --> 00:59:21.770
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sexual dimorphism species are very</v>

1222
00:59:21.771 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 1>sexually</v>

1223
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.650
<v Speaker 3>dimorphic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See Elephant seals.</v>

1224
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:29.390
<v Speaker 3>You have a male who's massive 44 times</v>
<v Speaker 3>the size of a female or a mountain</v>

1225
00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 3>gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1226
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:35.450
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at the extent to which</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is or isn't sexual dimorphism with</v>

1227
00:59:35.451 --> 00:59:40.070
<v Speaker 3>the species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that itself perfectly predicts the</v>

1228
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:45.071
<v Speaker 3>mating system within that species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning if there is a huge sexual</v>

1229
00:59:45.111 --> 00:59:47.840
<v Speaker 3>dimorphism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>typically the males are bigger than the</v>

1230
00:59:47.841 --> 00:59:50.270
<v Speaker 3>females,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes you have sex reversal</v>

1231
00:59:50.271 --> 00:59:53.060
<v Speaker 3>species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have privilege in this meeting,</v>

1232
00:59:53.061 --> 00:59:58.061
<v Speaker 3>meaning what one male monopolizes sexual</v>
<v Speaker 3>access to many females,</v>

1233
00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:02.210
<v Speaker 3>and the reason why they develop that</v>
<v Speaker 3>size is because that's the combat that</v>

1234
01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:05.450
<v Speaker 3>they engage in where the winner then</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets the genetic lottery,</v>

1235
01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:06.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

1236
01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:10.760
<v Speaker 3>when you have species where the two</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexes are equal sized,</v>

1237
01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:13.490
<v Speaker 3>then you have typically monogamous</v>
<v Speaker 3>mating,</v>

1238
01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:16.610
<v Speaker 3>like in the case of some bird species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even there,</v>

1239
01:00:16.611 --> 01:00:17.840
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though they're supposed to be</v>

1240
01:00:17.841 --> 01:00:19.190
<v Speaker 3>monogamous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once in a while,</v>

1241
01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:21.440
<v Speaker 3>they go behind the bush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Genetic tests have shown,</v>

1242
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.960
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>birds are really only male.</v>

1243
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:24.830
<v Speaker 3>Penguins are a big one that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring.</v>

1244
01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Throwing monogamous for a year,</v>

1245
01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even even within what you consider</v>

1246
01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:33.380
<v Speaker 3>to be a monogamist window,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some tests that show that once</v>

1247
01:00:33.381 --> 01:00:36.110
<v Speaker 3>in a while we do go behind the bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's behind.</v>

1248
01:00:36.111 --> 01:00:38.120
<v Speaker 3>That Bush did not win the game.</v>

1249
01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once in a while,</v>

1250
01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:45.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use my evolutionary stuff on my wife to</v>

1251
01:00:45.381 --> 01:00:48.890
<v Speaker 3>explain why it might be okay to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She hasn't really bought into the whole</v>

1252
01:00:48.891 --> 01:00:49.724
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Read more,</v>

1253
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.200
<v Speaker 3>get her head out of the bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly sand wherever.</v>

1254
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:55.820
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incidentally,</v>

1255
01:00:56.250 --> 01:01:00.770
<v Speaker 3>this whole idea of taking an</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary explanation and then people</v>

1256
01:01:00.771 --> 01:01:05.240
<v Speaker 3>thinking that that then justifies or</v>
<v Speaker 3>condones the behavior as a classic</v>

1257
01:01:05.241 --> 01:01:07.010
<v Speaker 3>reason why people hate evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology,</v>

1258
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you explain,</v>

1259
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:09.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a,</v>

1260
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:12.080
<v Speaker 3>here's an evolutionary explanation for</v>
<v Speaker 3>rape,</v>

1261
01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.200
<v Speaker 3>here's an evolution explanation for wild</v>
<v Speaker 3>child abuse happens.</v>

1262
01:01:15.201 --> 01:01:19.850
<v Speaker 3>If there's a step parent in the family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's why people might have difficulty</v>

1263
01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:24.440
<v Speaker 3>staying true to their monogamous unions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then people will get very upset at you</v>

1264
01:01:24.441 --> 01:01:28.850
<v Speaker 3>because they somehow conflate the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are explaining the phenomenon</v>

1265
01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:33.290
<v Speaker 3>using science as meaning that you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying it clears your moral judgment and</v>

1266
01:01:33.291 --> 01:01:35.600
<v Speaker 3>of course it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's one of the places where</v>

1267
01:01:35.601 --> 01:01:39.020
<v Speaker 3>people get really upset at you and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>send you hate mail in that moral</v>

1268
01:01:39.021 --> 01:01:42.020
<v Speaker 3>judgment is also cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which gets really strange when you look</v>

1269
01:01:42.021 --> 01:01:44.330
<v Speaker 3>at certain religions like the Mormons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1270
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:49.950
<v Speaker 3>The whole reason why the Mormons a setup</v>
<v Speaker 3>this compound in Mexico while they moved</v>

1271
01:01:51.861 --> 01:01:55.280
<v Speaker 3>to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is when polygamy was made illegal in the</v>

1272
01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.040
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will we're just going to go to Mexico.</v>

1273
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.980
<v Speaker 3>And that's where Mitt Romney's family</v>
<v Speaker 3>came around.</v>

1274
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Which is really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it amazing how whenever there are</v>

1275
01:02:04.071 --> 01:02:04.904
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1276
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:08.900
<v Speaker 3>polygynous rulings from God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always that.</v>

1277
01:02:08.901 --> 01:02:12.380
<v Speaker 3>It's one man with multiple women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never been a polyandrous thing.</v>

1278
01:02:12.381 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 3>It's never been the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't want to get a gang bang.</v>

1279
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:16.700
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want a bunch of dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1280
01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:20.940
<v Speaker 3>there is one place in the world where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is polyandry.</v>

1281
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Do you know where it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere?</v>

1282
01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 3>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called Tibetan.</v>

1283
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:29.870
<v Speaker 3>Polyandry told you it's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fraternal to Beth and polyandry.</v>

1284
01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1285
01:02:31.231 --> 01:02:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Which means b means brothers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sisters.</v>

1286
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:38.580
<v Speaker 3>No meaning at a frat together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that the woman who is being</v>

1287
01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:43.581
<v Speaker 3>shared across many men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those men are brothers.</v>

1288
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:46.620
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the evolutionary explanation,</v>

1289
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:48.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine where you have a system for</v>

1290
01:02:48.421 --> 01:02:50.990
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not every man could be mated.</v>

1291
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:54.300
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good thing because you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of men who are going to be</v>

1292
01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:55.400
<v Speaker 3>sexually frustrated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1293
01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:56.670
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1294
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1295
01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:01.970
<v Speaker 3>so therefore by creating a system where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1296
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:06.060
<v Speaker 3>not everybody could be guaranteed that</v>
<v Speaker 3>their reproductive fitness is going to</v>

1297
01:03:06.061 --> 01:03:09.270
<v Speaker 3>be assured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least they're kin selection will</v>

1298
01:03:09.271 --> 01:03:10.180
<v Speaker 3>be assured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meaning what?</v>

1299
01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:13.620
<v Speaker 3>I share half of my genes on average from</v>
<v Speaker 3>my brother.</v>

1300
01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:17.130
<v Speaker 3>So either I will impregnate the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which case great.</v>

1301
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 3>Or my brother will impregnate her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which case I'm still indirectly not</v>

1302
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:25.110
<v Speaker 3>through direct reproductive fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but through kin selection,</v>

1303
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:29.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm still extending my jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even in cases where men share a</v>

1304
01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:32.910
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be in the context of all in</v>

1305
01:03:32.911 --> 01:03:33.744
<v Speaker 3>the family.</v>

1306
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:36.480
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm blowing your mind.</v>

1307
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:38.490
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an intense thing and that's.</v>

1308
01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.330
<v Speaker 3>That must be just a reaction to the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is much more men than there</v>

1309
01:03:42.331 --> 01:03:44.610
<v Speaker 3>are women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why would that be?</v>

1310
01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Why are there more men than there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes it could be.</v>

1311
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.150
<v Speaker 3>That's called by the way and operational</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex ratio.</v>

1312
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:56.280
<v Speaker 3>If there are imbalances between males</v>
<v Speaker 3>and females within a particular niche,</v>

1313
01:03:56.970 --> 01:04:01.970
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it could be because of certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>inheritance structures where it's only</v>

1314
01:04:02.581 --> 01:04:07.200
<v Speaker 3>the eldest who can have enough money</v>
<v Speaker 3>through inheritance so the other guys</v>

1315
01:04:07.201 --> 01:04:11.040
<v Speaker 3>can't really afford a what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are all sorts of institutional</v>

1316
01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:16.041
<v Speaker 3>reasons beyond sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racial reasons where some men may</v>

1317
01:04:16.411 --> 01:04:20.970
<v Speaker 3>otherwise be out of the mating market</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we know that societies were.</v>

1318
01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:25.050
<v Speaker 3>A lot of men are sitting around sexually</v>
<v Speaker 3>frustrated is not going to be societies</v>

1319
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.530
<v Speaker 3>that are conducive to quiet and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore.</v>

1320
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.990
<v Speaker 3>So therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in the context where you have</v>

1321
01:04:30.991 --> 01:04:33.210
<v Speaker 3>something like polyandry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is something that typically</v>

1322
01:04:33.211 --> 01:04:34.770
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't expect.</v>

1323
01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:39.360
<v Speaker 3>When it arises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it arises as a response to a real</v>

1324
01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:40.920
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1325
01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:43.440
<v Speaker 3>so every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean most things that you could think</v>

1326
01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:47.220
<v Speaker 3>of ultimately have some evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 3>expansion to them and that's why I fell</v>

1327
01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:51.570
<v Speaker 3>in love with evolution because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>explanatory power that is afforded once</v>

1328
01:04:51.571 --> 01:04:56.571
<v Speaker 3>you have that key to understand things</v>
<v Speaker 3>via evolutionary thinking,</v>

1329
01:04:57.450 --> 01:05:02.450
<v Speaker 3>it becomes incredibly powerful and once</v>
<v Speaker 3>the parameters and the variables change,</v>

1330
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:05.910
<v Speaker 3>the behavior changes to adapt to those</v>
<v Speaker 3>parameters.</v>

1331
01:05:05.911 --> 01:05:07.380
<v Speaker 3>Variables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>

1332
01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:09.870
<v Speaker 3>A perfect example that is fighter</v>
<v Speaker 3>pilots,</v>

1333
01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:12.930
<v Speaker 3>fighter pilots are classically wife</v>
<v Speaker 3>swappers.</v>

1334
01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1335
01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of that goes on in those</v>
<v Speaker 3>communities because these people</v>

1336
01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>are swingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean?</v>

1337
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well sort of.</v>

1338
01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's.</v>

1339
01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:23.380
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that they're probably going to</v>

1340
01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>die and if they love their wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want someone else to love their</v>

1341
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>wife as much as they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that if they all just</v>

1342
01:05:30.521 --> 01:05:32.830
<v Speaker 1>shit like life is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

1343
01:05:32.831 --> 01:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>It's much more fleeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more fragile than it is in the</v>

1344
01:05:37.211 --> 01:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>world of the Accountant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1345
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:45.150
<v Speaker 1>So I think it makes sense that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very prevalent in those communities.</v>

1346
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:46.173
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1347
01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:46.781
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

1348
01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>the sexual risk taking is a form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance policy.</v>

1349
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Say it like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1350
01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were married and Jamie was married</v>

1351
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:58.060
<v Speaker 1>and you were both fighter pilots and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you both would do missions together,</v>

1352
01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.720
<v Speaker 1>like an intense bond between you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1353
01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.940
<v Speaker 1>you would just swap wives who would just</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1354
01:06:03.941 --> 01:06:04.660
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1355
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.870
<v Speaker 1>the idea is like if you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get shot down and you die,</v>

1356
01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want your wife to be taken care of</v>

1357
01:06:09.911 --> 01:06:10.840
<v Speaker 1>by someone who loves her.</v>

1358
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as they had a smaller penis in</v>

1359
01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:15.830
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's got a hog tell you it's got a</v>

1360
01:06:15.831 --> 01:06:19.030
<v Speaker 1>hard on the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by going,</v>

1361
01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.130
<v Speaker 1>going good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going back to,</v>

1362
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:25.900
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll send you the link to the global,</v>

1363
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:30.960
<v Speaker 1>a penis sizes around the world and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>just point you to where Lebanon scores</v>

1364
01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:33.520
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas how's it go?</v>

1365
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Top is it,</v>

1366
01:06:35.411 --> 01:06:37.920
<v Speaker 1>is it like where people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1367
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 1>there's more danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dicks or bigger?</v>

1368
01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that this is the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1369
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:45.610
<v Speaker 1>well isn't been like so danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most dangerous places,</v>

1370
01:06:45.611 --> 01:06:49.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They danger and in terms of violence and</v>

1371
01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:50.680
<v Speaker 1>crime and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1372
01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:54.360
<v Speaker 1>if you classically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's all,</v>

1373
01:06:54.361 --> 01:06:57.850
<v Speaker 1>let's put away all pretenses of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1374
01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black guys supposedly have the biggest</v>

1375
01:06:59.801 --> 01:07:00.581
<v Speaker 1>dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1376
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have um,</v>

1377
01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:05.050
<v Speaker 1>more athleticism too.</v>

1378
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of things that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect to it.</v>

1379
01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:11.410
<v Speaker 1>So drone system scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has that been absolutely proven?</v>

1380
01:07:11.411 --> 01:07:14.140
<v Speaker 1>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I let it go.</v>

1381
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I know that anecdotally we hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1382
01:07:16.301 --> 01:07:16.481
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1383
01:07:16.481 --> 01:07:20.140
<v Speaker 1>no Lebanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just check it's a Lebanese people</v>

1384
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:23.110
<v Speaker 1>know mean it's always know it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotype,</v>

1385
01:07:23.111 --> 01:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>but I truly don't know whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>

1386
01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's certain stereotypes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just,</v>

1387
01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:33.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason there and that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one that is acceptable when you</v>

1388
01:07:33.551 --> 01:07:34.660
<v Speaker 1>talk about black people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1389
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Because it's got the venture that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>complementary.</v>

1390
01:07:36.471 --> 01:07:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1391
01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a great story about racial</v>

1392
01:07:39.431 --> 01:07:42.340
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in 1995,</v>

1393
01:07:42.341 --> 01:07:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 96.</v>

1394
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving a talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is shortly after my phd,</v>

1395
01:07:46.331 --> 01:07:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I just started as a young assistant</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor.</v>

1396
01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving a talk at this big</v>
<v Speaker 1>international psychology conference and</v>

1397
01:07:52.691 --> 01:07:56.290
<v Speaker 1>is maybe a thousand 500 people in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>room and that that's quite a big size</v>

1398
01:07:56.291 --> 01:08:00.490
<v Speaker 1>for academic conference and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real buzz in the room as if there's</v>

1399
01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:02.560
<v Speaker 1>tension and I'm not exactly sure why.</v>

1400
01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.350
<v Speaker 1>They're certainly not 10 set me at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1401
01:08:05.351 --> 01:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I was just a young guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew who the hell I was</v>

1402
01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:12.250
<v Speaker 1>immediately before I get up to present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the guy who was immediately before me</v>

1403
01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.380
<v Speaker 1>is a gentleman by the name of Phillip</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rushton.</v>

1404
01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know him?</v>

1405
01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Phil oppression is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1406
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 1>was he recently passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a Canadian based psychologist who</v>

1407
01:08:21.921 --> 01:08:26.921
<v Speaker 1>is probably the preeminent psychologist</v>
<v Speaker 1>who studied racial differences and</v>

1408
01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:31.940
<v Speaker 1>offered evolutionary explanations for</v>
<v Speaker 1>why these racial differences might</v>

1409
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:36.150
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most notably he had looked at a</v>

1410
01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.850
<v Speaker 1>suppose that racial differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial differences in intelligence using</v>

1411
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:44.090
<v Speaker 1>a postmortem cranial size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1412
01:08:44.091 --> 01:08:49.091
<v Speaker 1>So the fact is that if the carrying</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity cavities bigger or smaller than</v>

1413
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:52.730
<v Speaker 1>you assume that that means the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>from this race is more intelligent than</v>

1414
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:54.650
<v Speaker 1>that race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this controversial research.</v>

1415
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very spicy research.</v>

1416
01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:59.990
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this guy gets up to present his stuff</v>

1417
01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:02.780
<v Speaker 1>and he starts putting up slides of black</v>
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>

1418
01:09:02.781 --> 01:09:04.100
<v Speaker 1>black female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white male,</v>

1419
01:09:04.101 --> 01:09:05.680
<v Speaker 1>white female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see the,</v>

1420
01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean the crowd is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1421
01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:12.340
<v Speaker 1>sharpening their knives to lynch the sky</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have to get up and present right</v>

1422
01:09:13.071 --> 01:09:16.280
<v Speaker 1>after him and I'm thinking that just by</v>
<v Speaker 1>proxy,</v>

1423
01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:18.620
<v Speaker 1>just by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by being close to him,</v>

1424
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get killed.</v>

1425
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Now the good news is that immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>after he finished his presentation,</v>

1426
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.310
<v Speaker 1>out of the 1,500 people who were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 1000,</v>

1427
01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:32.320
<v Speaker 1>425 left the room to find him really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1428
01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.870
<v Speaker 1>So there was nearly no one left to</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to my talk.</v>

1429
01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:40.670
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of the few times where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually very pleased to have very</v>

1430
01:09:40.671 --> 01:09:43.220
<v Speaker 1>few people listening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they left the room.</v>

1431
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.800
<v Speaker 1>And what do they do that I think they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to sort of,</v>

1432
01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:47.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1433
01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:49.160
<v Speaker 1>challenge him and confront him and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1434
01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Does when a guy does a speech like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he allow a question?</v>

1435
01:09:52.341 --> 01:09:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Answer period is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good question.</v>

1436
01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:57.020
<v Speaker 1>So usually you would leave depending on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of the.</v>

1437
01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean let's say you have 25 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might do 20 minutes leaving five</v>

1438
01:10:00.921 --> 01:10:05.240
<v Speaker 1>minutes for q and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to the last second so that there</v>

1439
01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:09.830
<v Speaker 1>was no opportunity for questions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he sort of was whisked out.</v>

1440
01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I was really,</v>

1441
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:15.350
<v Speaker 1>really pleased that almost nobody stayed</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my talk.</v>

1442
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:20.930
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about that is there a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain truths that you're not allowed</v>

1443
01:10:20.931 --> 01:10:25.931
<v Speaker 1>to explore and you're not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explore the possibility that some human</v>

1444
01:10:26.151 --> 01:10:31.151
<v Speaker 1>beings may be not as intelligent as</v>
<v Speaker 1>other human beings on an individual</v>

1445
01:10:32.331 --> 01:10:34.160
<v Speaker 1>level or as a group level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I was going to.</v>

1446
01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1447
01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:37.280
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As on an individual level,</v>

1448
01:10:37.281 --> 01:10:40.430
<v Speaker 1>we accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on a group level we're not willing</v>

1449
01:10:40.431 --> 01:10:43.640
<v Speaker 1>to on an individual level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the individual level,</v>

1450
01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:44.820
<v Speaker 1>even while they're retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1451
01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:47.980
<v Speaker 1>well that's why it's proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1452
01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:52.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting that like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain genetic variables that will</v>

1453
01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:57.260
<v Speaker 1>accept that are a product of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment in which these people</v>

1454
01:10:57.261 --> 01:10:58.880
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for instance,</v>

1455
01:10:58.881 --> 01:11:03.530
<v Speaker 1>inuits are much more adapted to cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their hands don't get numb.</v>

1456
01:11:03.531 --> 01:11:06.440
<v Speaker 1>They don't get frostbite nearly as easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can operate.</v>

1457
01:11:06.441 --> 01:11:09.290
<v Speaker 1>They have been much better circulation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in cold weather and their hands and</v>

1458
01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:11.630
<v Speaker 1>their feet and let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they've been living up there for</v>

1459
01:11:11.631 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 1>generation after generation there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain</v>

1460
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.510
<v Speaker 3>things that we don't accept though and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the big ones is intelligence.</v>

1461
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.230
<v Speaker 3>We don't accept that some people could</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in a soft world where things are</v>

1462
01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:25.650
<v Speaker 3>easy and they develop like a slow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lazy mind.</v>

1463
01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Whereas some people develop in a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>tricky world with this constant</v>

1464
01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:31.500
<v Speaker 3>innovation going on and they develop a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharper mind.</v>

1465
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.471
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1466
01:11:32.471 --> 01:11:34.590
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we resist that because we don't want</v>

1467
01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:36.480
<v Speaker 3>anyone thinking that they're dumber than</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

1468
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1469
01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:38.391
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1470
01:11:38.391 --> 01:11:40.170
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point though is that I'm not sure</v>

1471
01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:45.171
<v Speaker 3>that anybody has offered compelling</v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation for why they would be</v>

1472
01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:49.370
<v Speaker 3>selection pressures in environment a</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus environment,</v>

1473
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:54.360
<v Speaker 3>be for there to be greater intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there is some evidence that,</v>

1474
01:11:54.361 --> 01:11:59.361
<v Speaker 3>especially European Jews who have more</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobel prize awards than anyone else.</v>

1475
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have to dis me by saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>European Jews?</v>

1476
01:12:03.091 --> 01:12:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you answer the Arab Jews?</v>

1477
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:05.363
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true though.</v>

1478
01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:08.460
<v Speaker 3>It's just because you're a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent man,</v>

1479
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.740
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm neither your,</v>

1480
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:11.920
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of European,</v>

1481
01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:13.410
<v Speaker 3>Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1482
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something fascinating about that</v>

1483
01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:18.120
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder if that's cultural.</v>

1484
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:20.040
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's educational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1485
01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:20.671
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

1486
01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:24.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can certainly definitively point to</v>

1487
01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:27.040
<v Speaker 3>the cultural elements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the genetic element is,</v>

1488
01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:28.280
<v Speaker 3>is debatable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1489
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's neither,</v>

1490
01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:30.810
<v Speaker 3>yes or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unclear.</v>

1491
01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:34.200
<v Speaker 3>But the cultural element that I'll share</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you a personal anecdote,</v>

1492
01:12:34.201 --> 01:12:35.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever shared it on the</v>

1493
01:12:35.621 --> 01:12:38.280
<v Speaker 3>show before or if I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still worth repeating.</v>

1494
01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after I finished my Mba.</v>

1495
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew I was going to go on and do my</v>

1496
01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:47.580
<v Speaker 3>phd and become a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at one point I had a brother who</v>

1497
01:12:47.581 --> 01:12:50.640
<v Speaker 3>lives in southern California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a very successful businessman and</v>

1498
01:12:50.641 --> 01:12:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I was coming out here to see whether I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want it to go and do my phd at Uc</v>

1499
01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Irvine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1500
01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.420
<v Speaker 3>versus other schools where I had been</v>
<v Speaker 3>accepted.</v>

1501
01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.651
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1502
01:12:58.651 --> 01:13:00.630
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you put on the proverbial</v>

1503
01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:05.100
<v Speaker 3>sooth and maybe work with me for a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>years before you go on to get your phd.</v>

1504
01:13:05.101 --> 01:13:08.130
<v Speaker 3>It might be a nice thing for you to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>some work experience outside of</v>

1505
01:13:08.131 --> 01:13:11.340
<v Speaker 3>academia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't really entertaining it.</v>

1506
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.940
<v Speaker 3>Buy My mother a herd of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>

1507
01:13:14.941 --> 01:13:16.530
<v Speaker 3>And so when I went back to Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1508
01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.470
<v Speaker 3>she took me aside to one of the rooms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and very,</v>

1509
01:13:19.471 --> 01:13:20.700
<v Speaker 3>very concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said to me,</v>

1510
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:24.870
<v Speaker 3>remember if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't go on to get your phd,</v>

1511
01:13:24.871 --> 01:13:26.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want people to remember you as</v>

1512
01:13:26.311 --> 01:13:30.150
<v Speaker 3>somebody who's dropped out of school?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from her perspective,</v>

1513
01:13:30.151 --> 01:13:34.100
<v Speaker 3>from the standards that we're expected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who had,</v>

1514
01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got an Undergrad in mathematics and</v>

1515
01:13:37.171 --> 01:13:39.800
<v Speaker 3>computer science and I've gotten an MBA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1516
01:13:39.801 --> 01:13:42.720
<v Speaker 3>if I stopped at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will drop out.</v>

1517
01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:47.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dropout from school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an MBA from a top school right</v>

1518
01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.890
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course I didn't do a phd from my</v>

1519
01:13:49.891 --> 01:13:53.280
<v Speaker 3>parents' approval,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just gives you the sense of the</v>

1520
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.690
<v Speaker 3>type of expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the,</v>

1521
01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:56.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1522
01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:00.390
<v Speaker 3>the imparting of love for learning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for knowledge,</v>

1523
01:14:00.391 --> 01:14:05.190
<v Speaker 3>for wisdom and achievement and</v>
<v Speaker 3>achievement that is inbred in you from</v>

1524
01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:08.400
<v Speaker 3>the minute you come out of the womb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whether there is a genetic component</v>

1525
01:14:08.401 --> 01:14:09.240
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1526
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:13.060
<v Speaker 3>but I can certainly say that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>component is very alluring</v>

1527
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:16.330
<v Speaker 2>cultural components.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It exists very strongly in the Korean</v>

1528
01:14:16.331 --> 01:14:19.180
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good buddy of mine when I was a</v>

1529
01:14:19.181 --> 01:14:22.480
<v Speaker 2>kid who's Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was on the US national taekwondo</v>

1530
01:14:22.481 --> 01:14:25.720
<v Speaker 2>team while he was in his residency as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>

1531
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a fucking animal.</v>

1532
01:14:28.571 --> 01:14:30.220
<v Speaker 2>This kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1533
01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never met anybody who worked</v>

1534
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:34.090
<v Speaker 2>harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He slept like three or four hours a</v>

1535
01:14:34.091 --> 01:14:35.350
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always exhausted.</v>

1536
01:14:35.351 --> 01:14:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Every time you look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a giant bags under his eyes and he</v>

1537
01:14:38.111 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>couldn't possibly have physically worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>harder than he did.</v>

1538
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:40.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1539
01:14:40.991 --> 01:14:45.180
<v Speaker 2>He did everything he possibly could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One the US national title went on to</v>

1540
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:49.300
<v Speaker 2>compete in international competitions</v>
<v Speaker 2>all while he was going to medical school</v>

1541
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 2>instead of a madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way he described it to me,</v>

1542
01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:54.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1543
01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:57.460
<v Speaker 2>it was more of a prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way he described it,</v>

1544
01:14:57.461 --> 01:15:01.050
<v Speaker 2>he was just burdened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always tired and he,</v>

1545
01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.670
<v Speaker 2>it was just expected of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was really upset by it.</v>

1546
01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not quite as.</v>

1547
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.940
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the right term is.</v>

1548
01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Autocratic or dictatorial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more a,</v>

1549
01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:14.530
<v Speaker 3>the Baiting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1550
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:15.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about,</v>

1551
01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:17.050
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Talmudic tradition,</v>

1552
01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.750
<v Speaker 3>when you sit down and you debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you discuss you the bay.</v>

1553
01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:24.910
<v Speaker 3>So there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this endless inculcation of the</v>

1554
01:15:24.911 --> 01:15:29.911
<v Speaker 3>pursuit of knowledge just for the sake</v>
<v Speaker 3>of knowledge that is endemic to all</v>

1555
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Jewish homes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1556
01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.380
<v Speaker 3>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the extent that some of my family</v>

1557
01:15:35.381 --> 01:15:38.740
<v Speaker 3>members did not have that particular</v>
<v Speaker 3>orientation,</v>

1558
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 3>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get along with them as well</v>

1559
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.310
<v Speaker 3>because I have some family members who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are quite mercantile in their approach.</v>

1560
01:15:45.311 --> 01:15:49.150
<v Speaker 3>They just care about money and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>always maybe to a fault,</v>

1561
01:15:49.151 --> 01:15:52.150
<v Speaker 3>somebody who cared more about ideas than</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did about money.</v>

1562
01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:54.750
<v Speaker 3>What could be a fault?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could there be a fault there and,</v>

1563
01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:55.330
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1564
01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:57.110
<v Speaker 3>and not pursuing it.</v>

1565
01:15:57.210 --> 01:15:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Well in the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1566
01:15:58.061 --> 01:16:01.210
<v Speaker 3>that I'm not a careerist in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do things out of purity.</v>

1567
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't strategize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1568
01:16:03.281 --> 01:16:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like an awesome dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1569
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:05.800
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1570
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:08.630
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you an example.</v>

1571
01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:10.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a very concrete example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1572
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:12.630
<v Speaker 3>You were asking earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1573
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.840
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you get a job here?</v>

1574
01:16:13.841 --> 01:16:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1575
01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.490
<v Speaker 3>by me taking very open positions on</v>
<v Speaker 3>topics that are quote politically</v>

1576
01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:21.700
<v Speaker 3>incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not being a careerist.</v>

1577
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:23.530
<v Speaker 3>If I would shut my mouth about all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1578
01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:26.500
<v Speaker 3>these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe some university that might</v>

1579
01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:29.860
<v Speaker 3>otherwise be very impressed with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific dossier might say,</v>

1580
01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:30.430
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1581
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:32.320
<v Speaker 3>this guy's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if he's a shitster,</v>

1582
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:35.890
<v Speaker 3>if he appears on Joe Rogan and makes fun</v>
<v Speaker 3>of trigger warnings and talks about</v>

1583
01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well he's a bit of a loose cannon.</v>

1584
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:43.950
<v Speaker 2>This is why I disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The amount of input that you can have on</v>

1585
01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:48.820
<v Speaker 2>a culture based out of teaching a</v>
<v Speaker 2>classroom of 100 people or more whatever</v>

1586
01:16:48.821 --> 01:16:52.480
<v Speaker 2>it is in comparison to what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>already on your youtube videos.</v>

1587
01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1588
01:16:53.670 --> 01:16:56.830
<v Speaker 2>It's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reach that you have right now.</v>

1589
01:16:56.831 --> 01:16:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to send this to some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities that are supposed to hire</v>

1590
01:16:59.801 --> 01:17:00.320
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1591
01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.320
<v Speaker 2>they don't look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all in the past.</v>

1592
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:04.930
<v Speaker 2>These people did understand what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on right now.</v>

1593
01:17:04.931 --> 01:17:06.530
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

1594
01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 2>There's a podcast that you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now</v>

1595
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.330
<v Speaker 1>that will be heard and watched by more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a million people for sure.</v>

1596
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

1597
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:21.110
<v Speaker 1>it'll exist in perpetuity as long as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have digital content,</v>

1598
01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:23.900
<v Speaker 1>it'll exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's people listening to this</v>

1599
01:17:23.901 --> 01:17:25.610
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years from now,</v>

1600
01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:27.770
<v Speaker 1>100 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're still alive,</v>

1601
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:31.920
<v Speaker 1>if there's still a world to live in 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>years now people are going to be living</v>

1602
01:17:31.921 --> 01:17:34.760
<v Speaker 1>in listening to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are literally,</v>

1603
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music to my ears what you're saying</v>

1604
01:17:37.101 --> 01:17:41.090
<v Speaker 1>because I just had this conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently where I was talking to a</v>

1605
01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:44.440
<v Speaker 1>university about the importance actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1606
01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:49.280
<v Speaker 1>to a dean when I was talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of how do we judge academics.</v>

1607
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean academics are meme creators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1608
01:17:51.711 --> 01:17:56.000
<v Speaker 1>We create memes through our science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're also a meme propagators now.</v>

1609
01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:58.520
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the highlights of coming to</v>

1610
01:17:58.521 --> 01:18:00.080
<v Speaker 1>southern California and that's saying a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>

1611
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:01.460
<v Speaker 1>given how much I love southern</v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

1612
01:18:01.461 --> 01:18:06.290
<v Speaker 1>is to appear on your show because I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the platform that you have,</v>

1613
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:11.470
<v Speaker 1>it'll take me 16,000 years to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>even come close to achieving that type</v>

1614
01:18:12.261 --> 01:18:12.410
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

1615
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's not because of a narcissist</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1616
01:18:13.971 --> 01:18:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I want to be famous because ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about spreading ideas and that's</v>

1617
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.400
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a million people are going to</v>

1618
01:18:19.401 --> 01:18:22.340
<v Speaker 1>listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if I can get one percent of that</v>

1619
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:25.670
<v Speaker 1>million to be interested in evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory after what we've discussed,</v>

1620
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:29.300
<v Speaker 1>how does that compare to having 25</v>
<v Speaker 1>students in my classroom,</v>

1621
01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.800
<v Speaker 1>but most universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're exactly right.</v>

1622
01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Haven't caught up with the times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one has the university itself.</v>

1623
01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not the only way you can learn</v>

1624
01:18:37.821 --> 01:18:42.170
<v Speaker 1>these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only way to get an education is</v>

1625
01:18:42.171 --> 01:18:45.050
<v Speaker 1>to get a degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To go to sit in class,</v>

1626
01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.860
<v Speaker 1>to do all the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The teacher prescribes all this stuff</v>

1627
01:18:48.861 --> 01:18:52.100
<v Speaker 1>that you have to turn in and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>papers that you have to do.</v>

1628
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.230
<v Speaker 1>That's not the only way to get an</v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

1629
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.810
<v Speaker 1>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a human construct and we're</v>

1630
01:18:56.811 --> 01:18:59.210
<v Speaker 1>living in a world where that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>make much sense anymore.</v>

1631
01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:04.280
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a primary education is going to be</v>

1632
01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:06.170
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's without a doubt.</v>

1633
01:19:06.171 --> 01:19:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Why travel somewhere white go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you dealing with all</v>

1634
01:19:09.621 --> 01:19:13.280
<v Speaker 1>these fucking assholes in these campuses</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are instituting all these</v>

1635
01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:17.840
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous rules of social behavior and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these social misfits that want to</v>

1636
01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:21.200
<v Speaker 1>level the playing field and all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense that's going on.</v>

1637
01:19:21.201 --> 01:19:25.460
<v Speaker 1>That's really it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stifles a lot of open discussion.</v>

1638
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:29.930
<v Speaker 1>It stifles a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of exchanges of information because of</v>

1639
01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:32.300
<v Speaker 1>these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people have that these are these</v>

1640
01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:37.301
<v Speaker 1>rigid ideas that cannot be breached.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're living in a world now</v>

1641
01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:42.371
<v Speaker 1>where you have instant access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>information to go to a physical place to</v>

1642
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:45.920
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems to me to be kind of archaic.</v>

1643
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:48.950
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of retro isn't ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just recently asked.</v>

1644
01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I shouldn't be commenting</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly,</v>

1645
01:19:51.081 --> 01:19:52.580
<v Speaker 1>but I go ahead and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1646
01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:55.370
<v Speaker 1>there's a company called great courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of it?</v>

1647
01:19:55.371 --> 01:19:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were a sponsor of the podcast in</v>

1648
01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:57.880
<v Speaker 1>the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

1649
01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1650
01:19:58.401 --> 01:20:00.200
<v Speaker 1>I have one of them at home on</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

1651
01:20:00.210 --> 01:20:04.400
<v Speaker 1>so I was honored to be asked to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't yet.</v>

1652
01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.380
<v Speaker 1>We haven't signed a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still looking into it,</v>

1653
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>but the mere fact that they</v>

1654
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.120
<v Speaker 3>contacted me as one of the perspective</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to put together a course for</v>

1655
01:20:12.121 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great courses course on evolutionary</v>

1656
01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:16.670
<v Speaker 3>psychology and so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1657
01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:17.400
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1658
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:22.230
<v Speaker 3>imagine the number of people that I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially reach by putting together</v>

1659
01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:23.400
<v Speaker 3>that course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1660
01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:25.290
<v Speaker 3>there's this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should check him out.</v>

1661
01:20:25.291 --> 01:20:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Robert Sapolsky or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very well known.</v>

1662
01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Stanford.</v>

1663
01:20:29.461 --> 01:20:31.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm not loving you more and more by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>second.</v>

1664
01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:35.130
<v Speaker 3>I work on toxoplasmosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been studying him for years.</v>

1665
01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Look at this stuff on baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it mind going,</v>

1666
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:42.270
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I need to spend like months every</v>

1667
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:44.450
<v Speaker 3>year in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Youtube clips.</v>

1668
01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of that.</v>

1669
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:47.250
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I wrote to him,</v>

1670
01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:49.350
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I shouldn't be advertising a</v>

1671
01:20:49.351 --> 01:20:50.850
<v Speaker 3>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's okay.</v>

1672
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:56.180
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote to him because I really</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted him on my show and he was very</v>

1673
01:20:56.611 --> 01:20:57.030
<v Speaker 3>gracious.</v>

1674
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.960
<v Speaker 3>He responded right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1675
01:20:57.961 --> 01:20:58.794
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to.</v>

1676
01:20:58.930 --> 01:21:00.090
<v Speaker 3>So on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

1677
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on two books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm shutting down everything.</v>

1678
01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:06.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying no to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some point in the future,</v>

1679
01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:09.270
<v Speaker 3>which of course I completely understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1680
01:21:09.271 --> 01:21:11.550
<v Speaker 3>look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you go to his youtube,</v>

1681
01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:14.490
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>900,000 views,</v>

1682
01:21:14.491 --> 01:21:17.190
<v Speaker 3>one point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1 million of a lecture that typically</v>

1683
01:21:17.191 --> 01:21:19.530
<v Speaker 3>would have been viewed by 80 people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1684
01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I Bet I sent a couple of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand people to those things.</v>

1685
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Just no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Fan of that guy been sending people</v>

1686
01:21:25.471 --> 01:21:28.380
<v Speaker 3>to is his videos and his lectures for</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1687
01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.260
<v Speaker 3>So let's talk about what are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>findings from his drone to do that.</v>

1688
01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.870
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's got research,</v>

1689
01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:36.870
<v Speaker 3>because you mentioned baboons showing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in a,</v>

1690
01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:39.990
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a sort of a hierarchical society of</v>

1691
01:21:39.991 --> 01:21:44.400
<v Speaker 3>baboons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lower ranked baboons will have</v>

1692
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:48.960
<v Speaker 3>higher cortisol levels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will have more stress hormones.</v>

1693
01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:51.570
<v Speaker 3>While you intuitively you might think</v>
<v Speaker 3>the opposite.</v>

1694
01:21:51.571 --> 01:21:54.380
<v Speaker 3>You might think that the higher the rank</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the baboon,</v>

1695
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.230
<v Speaker 3>the more stressed he is because he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He asked to defend against all the other</v>

1696
01:21:58.231 --> 01:22:00.540
<v Speaker 3>dangers and maintain his position and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1697
01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:06.140
<v Speaker 3>So people took this exact study and</v>
<v Speaker 3>applied it in an organizational context</v>

1698
01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:12.050
<v Speaker 3>where they looked at an organizational</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy and took cortisol levels of</v>

1699
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.140
<v Speaker 3>people in a big organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a the public health</v>

1700
01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:20.250
<v Speaker 3>system in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the higher the rank of the employee,</v>

1701
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:24.930
<v Speaker 3>the lower his or her cortisol level and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the argument.</v>

1702
01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:25.801
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1703
01:22:25.801 --> 01:22:28.200
<v Speaker 3>why would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't the person who is higher rank</v>

1704
01:22:28.201 --> 01:22:31.380
<v Speaker 3>be more stressed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a CEO has to have more stress</v>

1705
01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:32.603
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1706
01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:36.210
<v Speaker 3>the janitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the arguments at least that</v>

1707
01:22:36.211 --> 01:22:41.211
<v Speaker 3>they proposed was the idea of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy who was at the lowest rung of</v>

1708
01:22:41.221 --> 01:22:46.110
<v Speaker 3>the hierarchy has to be told when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>could go and relieve himself with his</v>

1709
01:22:46.111 --> 01:22:47.100
<v Speaker 3>bodily functions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1710
01:22:47.101 --> 01:22:47.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1711
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:52.320
<v Speaker 3>the amount of free destiny that he has</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his daily life is very limited.</v>

1712
01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Whereas at least the CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though he's working very hard,</v>

1713
01:22:56.370 --> 01:22:59.050
<v Speaker 3>he's more master of his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1714
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.360
<v Speaker 3>of his daily life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1715
01:23:00.361 --> 01:23:02.040
<v Speaker 3>I work all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can work 10,</v>

1716
01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:02.731
<v Speaker 3>12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

1717
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:04.500
<v Speaker 3>18 hour days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet I still am.</v>

1718
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm always free because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's</v>

1719
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:09.880
<v Speaker 1>nobody who's telling me what to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>when at any time and apparently just</v>

1720
01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:13.930
<v Speaker 1>that has a profound effect on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortisol levels and the origins of that</v>

1721
01:23:13.931 --> 01:23:17.830
<v Speaker 1>whole study were originally due to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polsky's work with baboons.</v>

1722
01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:19.120
<v Speaker 1>If I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm correct,</v>

1723
01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:24.180
<v Speaker 1>well you know that the finding is</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirrored in a special ops guys versus</v>

1724
01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>versus enlisted men versus your average</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier.</v>

1725
01:23:29.201 --> 01:23:34.201
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the big issues that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have today is ptsd and one of the</v>

1726
01:23:34.961 --> 01:23:39.961
<v Speaker 1>factors in ptsd is people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for things to happen versus</v>

1727
01:23:40.061 --> 01:23:43.150
<v Speaker 1>people who are making things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas seals,</v>

1728
01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:46.270
<v Speaker 1>rangers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that they send in to go and kick</v>

1729
01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:49.930
<v Speaker 1>ass and take names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys have way less stress,</v>

1730
01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:55.540
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way less incidences of PTSD and you</v>

1731
01:23:55.541 --> 01:23:58.900
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously still tremendously stressful</v>

1732
01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:01.870
<v Speaker 1>and still a lot of instances of ptsd but</v>
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>

1733
01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.680
<v Speaker 1>And the more guys that I talked to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have served will tell you that the</v>

1734
01:24:05.681 --> 01:24:08.290
<v Speaker 1>reason is that they're active and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>

1735
01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:10.540
<v Speaker 1>They're proactive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones who are moving in and</v>

1736
01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:14.260
<v Speaker 1>doing these things and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>after these bad guys and hunting them</v>

1737
01:24:14.261 --> 01:24:17.260
<v Speaker 1>down essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the other people are sitting</v>

1738
01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:20.490
<v Speaker 1>around the base worrying they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get attacked or you know,</v>

1739
01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:24.370
<v Speaker 1>saying on their post or driving a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying they're going to hit an IED.</v>

1740
01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

1741
01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:28.750
<v Speaker 1>let's propose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another hypothesis was maybe</v>

1742
01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:33.780
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's a graduate student might</v>
<v Speaker 1>test a coaches versus players.</v>

1743
01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:37.930
<v Speaker 1>So based on your logic of the findings</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you just said,</v>

1744
01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:43.260
<v Speaker 1>the coach should probably have much</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher cortisol levels because he writes</v>

1745
01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.030
<v Speaker 1>out of his control and that's why you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see them on the sidelines going freaking</v>

1746
01:24:49.031 --> 01:24:50.500
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going crazy because you really can't</v>

1747
01:24:50.501 --> 01:24:52.480
<v Speaker 1>affect much influence on the game.</v>

1748
01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can add the margins that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the strategies and so on.</v>

1749
01:24:56.650 --> 01:24:58.810
<v Speaker 1>But the guys that are in the battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1750
01:24:58.811 --> 01:24:59.181
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1751
01:24:59.181 --> 01:25:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I was a competitive soccer player and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course you are not the few minutes</v>

1752
01:25:02.621 --> 01:25:05.170
<v Speaker 1>before you've got butterflies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're in the thick of things,</v>

1753
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.330
<v Speaker 1>you're not stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're focused.</v>

1754
01:25:07.331 --> 01:25:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the flow,</v>

1755
01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:10.750
<v Speaker 1>but the coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones who are about to have a</v>

1756
01:25:10.751 --> 01:25:11.840
<v Speaker 1>heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I thank you.</v>

1757
01:25:11.850 --> 01:25:15.130
<v Speaker 1>The intestine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is probably also a big factor why</v>

1758
01:25:15.131 --> 01:25:20.131
<v Speaker 1>it's so difficult to beat a champion in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in combat sports because the champion is</v>

1759
01:25:20.291 --> 01:25:23.170
<v Speaker 1>the one who's in control and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>champion is one has been dominating.</v>

1760
01:25:23.171 --> 01:25:26.560
<v Speaker 1>He has fear and intimidation on his side</v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore he has less stress.</v>

1761
01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been,</v>

1762
01:25:27.730 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have stress no matter what</v>

1763
01:25:29.411 --> 01:25:32.710
<v Speaker 1>if you're entering into a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the person who's trying to overcome</v>

1764
01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:35.890
<v Speaker 1>the psychological barrier that is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>champion in front of them,</v>

1765
01:25:35.891 --> 01:25:36.820
<v Speaker 1>like this is big.</v>

1766
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a persona that's attached to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a good example is like Mike Tyson,</v>

1767
01:25:42.911 --> 01:25:45.640
<v Speaker 1>when he was in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wanted to believe that he can be</v>

1768
01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:49.060
<v Speaker 1>beaten and men would lose before they</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever got into the ring that he.</v>

1769
01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Buster Douglas case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1770
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.730
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1771
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:55.720
<v Speaker 1>So have you ever seen the study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if we've mentioned it</v>

1772
01:25:55.721 --> 01:25:57.100
<v Speaker 1>here before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1773
01:25:57.350 --> 01:26:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it was published in the journal</v>
<v Speaker 1>called a motion where they looked at,</v>

1774
01:26:00.281 --> 01:26:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it was mma fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they smiled or not before the</v>

1775
01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:05.750
<v Speaker 1>contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this before?</v>

1776
01:26:05.751 --> 01:26:06.740
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1777
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>You just send me a private message and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll look for it.</v>

1778
01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the exact details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was some nonverbal cues that</v>

1779
01:26:14.331 --> 01:26:17.470
<v Speaker 1>were studied prior to a fight that if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1780
01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:21.890
<v Speaker 1>if I remember the study correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were highly predictive of the eventual</v>

1781
01:26:21.891 --> 01:26:22.910
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1782
01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:23.470
<v Speaker 1>That's fast.</v>

1783
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:24.500
<v Speaker 1>And is that cool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1784
01:26:24.501 --> 01:26:27.590
<v Speaker 1>I bet they're highly predictive of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of focus at the fighters entering</v>

1785
01:26:27.591 --> 01:26:30.740
<v Speaker 1>to the octagon with here he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smiles are for losers.</v>

1786
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I love how you come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Studies show that MMA fighters who smile</v>

1787
01:26:35.721 --> 01:26:37.170
<v Speaker 1>before fights don't do well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1788
01:26:37.171 --> 01:26:40.950
<v Speaker 1>this is at a way in which I doubt you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could really tell and that was published</v>

1789
01:26:40.951 --> 01:26:42.980
<v Speaker 1>that what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pre-fight stare down.</v>

1790
01:26:42.981 --> 01:26:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the preflight steered on that.</v>

1791
01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense because if you're</v>

1792
01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:47.230
<v Speaker 1>smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1793
01:26:47.230 --> 01:26:50.900
<v Speaker 1>it most likely means that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>really in the game.</v>

1794
01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As expected,</v>

1795
01:26:52.491 --> 01:26:56.180
<v Speaker 1>smile intensity predicted both the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcomes of fights as well as the more</v>

1796
01:26:56.181 --> 01:26:59.600
<v Speaker 1>detailed measures of inflight hostility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

1797
01:26:59.601 --> 01:27:04.280
<v Speaker 1>the smiles predicted both reduced</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostility from the smiler as well as</v>

1798
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:07.640
<v Speaker 1>increased hostility from his opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1799
01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:10.520
<v Speaker 1>it seemed that both fighters were</v>
<v Speaker 1>attuned to the information being</v>

1800
01:27:10.521 --> 01:27:12.710
<v Speaker 1>communicated in the preflight smile.</v>

1801
01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:17.900
<v Speaker 1>These results held even when controlling</v>
<v Speaker 1>for existing differences in skill.</v>

1802
01:27:17.901 --> 01:27:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I e the betting odds of the fight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

1803
01:27:20.511 --> 01:27:25.010
<v Speaker 1>height and weight though don't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go drastically altering your</v>

1804
01:27:25.011 --> 01:27:28.040
<v Speaker 1>gambling strategy just yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The betting lines still did a better job</v>

1805
01:27:28.041 --> 01:27:30.560
<v Speaker 1>overall in predicting fights compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just smile intensity.</v>

1806
01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:31.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

1807
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have we talked here about a ratio?</v>

1808
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:36.681
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1809
01:27:36.681 --> 01:27:37.490
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1810
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like the size of fingers at one</v>

1811
01:27:40.661 --> 01:27:41.090
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1812
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:44.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the length of a digital always.</v>

1813
01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I've actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've thought about at some point</v>

1814
01:27:47.031 --> 01:27:52.031
<v Speaker 1>either asking you or my nephew to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to mma fighters to take some</v>

1815
01:27:53.931 --> 01:27:58.070
<v Speaker 1>measures that capture how androgen highs</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

1816
01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:02.090
<v Speaker 1>how much exposure to testosterone at</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be,</v>

1817
01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:05.390
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through certain facial features or</v>

1818
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:06.740
<v Speaker 1>through A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1819
01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.030
<v Speaker 1>they're two d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four d ratio,</v>

1820
01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:12.750
<v Speaker 1>which is a measure of how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone you've been exposed to in</v>

1821
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:15.470
<v Speaker 1>utero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I actually have a study right now</v>

1822
01:28:15.471 --> 01:28:18.000
<v Speaker 1>with one of my graduate students without</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Rumiyah,</v>

1823
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:19.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're looking at the links between</v>

1824
01:28:19.881 --> 01:28:23.270
<v Speaker 1>testosterone and extreme sports using</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact same idea.</v>

1825
01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:24.380
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1826
01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:29.380
<v Speaker 1>of course an obvious hypothesis might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>that on average and then they fighters</v>

1827
01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.930
<v Speaker 1>compared to a control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal population,</v>

1828
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.900
<v Speaker 1>non non fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1829
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:37.580
<v Speaker 1>will be more androgens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think that that has to be</v>

1830
01:28:37.581 --> 01:28:38.414
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1831
01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1832
01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Because I would wonder what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say maybe probably successful</v>

1833
01:28:45.981 --> 01:28:49.720
<v Speaker 1>ones I see we've moderated by whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

1834
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.560
<v Speaker 1>what their trajectory in their career</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1835
01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:56.180
<v Speaker 1>I think there are a lot of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>enter into mixed martial arts or martial</v>

1836
01:28:56.181 --> 01:29:01.181
<v Speaker 1>arts in general because they recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of benefit in trying</v>

1837
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:06.060
<v Speaker 2>to overcome extreme challenges and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're attracted to these things</v>

1838
01:29:06.061 --> 01:29:09.900
<v Speaker 2>because they get addicted to the rush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adrenaline rush of a challenge and</v>

1839
01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 2>it's very few challenges that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>intense as one on one competition with</v>

1840
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:15.870
<v Speaker 2>another person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1841
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:18.600
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's a lot of people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>gravitate towards those,</v>

1842
01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:21.840
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems counterintuitive,</v>

1843
01:29:21.841 --> 01:29:25.740
<v Speaker 2>but you would think that they would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most violent people or the most</v>

1844
01:29:25.770 --> 01:29:29.160
<v Speaker 2>angry people and they're doing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they want to dominate.</v>

1845
01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts is different in a lot</v>

1846
01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:32.670
<v Speaker 2>of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1847
01:29:32.671 --> 01:29:36.570
<v Speaker 2>because in boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you're seeing people that</v>

1848
01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:40.410
<v Speaker 2>are searching for a way out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>searching for a way out of poverty.</v>

1849
01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:44.490
<v Speaker 2>They're searching for a way out of bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods and crime and they do so</v>

1850
01:29:44.491 --> 01:29:45.780
<v Speaker 2>through fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a classic,</v>

1851
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a classic trope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's something going on</v>

1852
01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.390
<v Speaker 2>with MMA fighters.</v>

1853
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:56.390
<v Speaker 2>It's very different in that martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to be something that costs money</v>

1854
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:01.740
<v Speaker 2>and so to join these classes and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>proficient,</v>

1855
01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:06.770
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to afford them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're getting people that enter</v>

1856
01:30:06.781 --> 01:30:09.060
<v Speaker 2>into martial arts from two different</v>
<v Speaker 2>venues,</v>

1857
01:30:09.061 --> 01:30:13.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get wrestlers who classically get it</v>

1858
01:30:13.021 --> 01:30:14.930
<v Speaker 2>from school that you get it from high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

1859
01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:16.050
<v Speaker 2>Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman wrestlers,</v>

1860
01:30:16.051 --> 01:30:18.460
<v Speaker 2>you mean freestyle or Greco Roman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1861
01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:20.040
<v Speaker 2>depending on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

1862
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:22.440
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's successful examples of both.</v>

1863
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.250
<v Speaker 2>And wrestling is probably one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most important skills to have,</v>

1864
01:30:26.251 --> 01:30:29.460
<v Speaker 2>if not the most important in mma because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fighter can dictate where the fight</v>

1865
01:30:29.461 --> 01:30:31.650
<v Speaker 2>takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a really strong wrestler takes you</v>

1866
01:30:31.651 --> 01:30:34.620
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can control you were as if you're a</v>

1867
01:30:34.621 --> 01:30:36.930
<v Speaker 2>really good kick boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your kickboxing can't really be</v>

1868
01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:38.490
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone can take you down at will.</v>

1869
01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.920
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>

1870
01:30:41.010 --> 01:30:44.500
<v Speaker 2>there's the wrestling which they get in</v>
<v Speaker 2>college and they get in high school in</v>

1871
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:45.343
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1872
01:30:45.710 --> 01:30:49.110
<v Speaker 2>at least fairly free college if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a scholarship and get it for free.</v>

1873
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but martial arts,</v>

1874
01:30:51.301 --> 01:30:54.600
<v Speaker 2>like Jujitsu and kickboxing and things</v>
<v Speaker 2>along those lines,</v>

1875
01:30:54.601 --> 01:30:56.070
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>karate,</v>

1876
01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.320
<v Speaker 2>traditional martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it costs money to take those things.</v>

1877
01:30:58.321 --> 01:31:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're seeing a lot of very educated</v>

1878
01:31:00.361 --> 01:31:03.660
<v Speaker 2>people that are getting into mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of MMA fighters that are</v>

1879
01:31:03.661 --> 01:31:06.090
<v Speaker 2>extremely articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't there a guy who was a biology</v>

1880
01:31:06.091 --> 01:31:08.070
<v Speaker 2>teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>math teacher,</v>

1881
01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:11.010
<v Speaker 2>rich Franklin math teacher who was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>former champion.</v>

1882
01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was UFC champion,</v>

1883
01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.370
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy.</v>

1884
01:31:14.371 --> 01:31:17.820
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of other very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very intelligent guys speak multiple</v>

1885
01:31:17.821 --> 01:31:18.870
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1886
01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:21.170
<v Speaker 2>really brilliant people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1887
01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:26.570
<v Speaker 2>so you get a different style of fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1888
01:31:27.121 --> 01:31:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I think there's people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are fighting because they were abused as</v>

1889
01:31:30.631 --> 01:31:33.180
<v Speaker 2>a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were bullied and then they have</v>

1890
01:31:33.181 --> 01:31:35.100
<v Speaker 2>this anger inside of them and they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to express it.</v>

1891
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:38.250
<v Speaker 2>So you get a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also get people that just,</v>

1892
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:40.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just tough.</v>

1893
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:43.310
<v Speaker 2>It's just tough and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome challenges and they,</v>

1894
01:31:43.630 --> 01:31:48.030
<v Speaker 2>they get some sort of benefit out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these extreme challenges.</v>

1895
01:31:48.630 --> 01:31:50.490
<v Speaker 2>So I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would wonder,</v>

1896
01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I would wonder what the results of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

1897
01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:53.570
<v Speaker 2>What about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1898
01:31:53.670 --> 01:31:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I think this is probably an obvious</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis,</v>

1899
01:31:55.651 --> 01:31:59.860
<v Speaker 2>but do you think that if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if one were to a</v>

1900
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.250
<v Speaker 3>salivary assays to measure testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels,</v>

1901
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:08.650
<v Speaker 3>pre-fight post fight and post fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at the winner and the</v>

1902
01:32:08.651 --> 01:32:12.640
<v Speaker 3>loser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly the testosterone scores would</v>

1903
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:17.290
<v Speaker 3>assort along whether I won or lost exam</v>
<v Speaker 3>will also dependent upon how much brain</v>

1904
01:32:17.291 --> 01:32:22.240
<v Speaker 3>damage they acquire during the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That has a pretty significant effect on</v>

1905
01:32:22.241 --> 01:32:25.390
<v Speaker 3>your pituitary gland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Primarily I had,</v>

1906
01:32:25.391 --> 01:32:26.224
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1907
01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.720
<v Speaker 3>since you're a standup professional</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up comedian,</v>

1908
01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:32.590
<v Speaker 3>one of my former students of postdoc who</v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

1909
01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:33.640
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to mention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1910
01:32:33.650 --> 01:32:36.280
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he studied the evolutionary roots of</v>

1911
01:32:36.281 --> 01:32:38.320
<v Speaker 3>humor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that we wanted</v>

1912
01:32:38.321 --> 01:32:39.970
<v Speaker 3>to study when he was doing his post doc</v>
<v Speaker 3>with me,</v>

1913
01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:43.480
<v Speaker 3>but then he ended up leaving after a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year to take a position anyways,</v>

1914
01:32:43.710 --> 01:32:47.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was to use the Montreal just for laughs</v>

1915
01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:52.210
<v Speaker 3>festivals to study that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Stasi responses of Comedians,</v>

1916
01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:53.523
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1917
01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:58.030
<v Speaker 3>prior to getting on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after finishing and to see</v>

1918
01:32:58.031 --> 01:33:03.031
<v Speaker 3>whether their testosterone response</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be moderated by whether</v>

1919
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:06.790
<v Speaker 3>objectively speaking it was a successful</v>
<v Speaker 3>set or not.</v>

1920
01:33:06.791 --> 01:33:08.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes you get up and you just</v>

1921
01:33:08.321 --> 01:33:10.560
<v Speaker 3>killed the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other Times it's.</v>

1922
01:33:10.570 --> 01:33:14.620
<v Speaker 3>It's dead silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So will my endocrinological system</v>

1923
01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:19.870
<v Speaker 3>response track that reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's something that I still</v>

1924
01:33:20.170 --> 01:33:22.330
<v Speaker 3>hopefully we'll test with some future</v>
<v Speaker 3>students.</v>

1925
01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:23.730
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that's a viable?</v>

1926
01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with bombing especially,</v>

1927
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:29.490
<v Speaker 2>it comes down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1928
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:32.030
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a horrible feeling.</v>

1929
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine there would be any</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit to bombing.</v>

1930
01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than maybe your testosterone would</v>

1931
01:33:38.601 --> 01:33:40.790
<v Speaker 2>spike because you need the energy to run</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from them.</v>

1932
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say when you,</v>

1933
01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:49.040
<v Speaker 3>when you're like you are doing a show</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you feel as though it's not going</v>

1934
01:33:49.041 --> 01:33:53.180
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you ever able to redirect the ship</v>

1935
01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:56.600
<v Speaker 3>or do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is there a point where there's no</v>

1936
01:33:56.601 --> 01:33:58.850
<v Speaker 3>return?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to suck today.</v>

1937
01:33:58.851 --> 01:34:00.500
<v Speaker 3>It's just not working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not connecting.</v>

1938
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:01.940
<v Speaker 2>There's both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1939
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:04.510
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely times where you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not getting out of the hole.</v>

1940
01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:06.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can dig yourself into a hole that</v>

1941
01:34:06.281 --> 01:34:07.990
<v Speaker 2>you can't get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What determines that?</v>

1942
01:34:07.991 --> 01:34:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Is it that your delivery that day is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>working or is it there's something</v>

1943
01:34:11.861 --> 01:34:14.200
<v Speaker 2>endemic to the crowd that for whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

1944
01:34:14.201 --> 01:34:18.370
<v Speaker 2>they're just not digging your style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all the above.</v>

1945
01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:20.710
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be your delivery,</v>

1946
01:34:20.711 --> 01:34:23.020
<v Speaker 2>it could be your subject matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be an event,</v>

1947
01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:24.850
<v Speaker 2>something that went on with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

1948
01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:30.400
<v Speaker 2>It could be the way you are reacting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them that you chose a path that was</v>

1949
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:34.030
<v Speaker 2>ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be making fun of them,</v>

1950
01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:37.180
<v Speaker 2>but that got them to get more on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could certainly be that.</v>

1951
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:41.380
<v Speaker 2>It could cause a lot of variables</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in whether or not you go down</v>

1952
01:34:41.381 --> 01:34:44.290
<v Speaker 2>with the ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also it could be that you didn't</v>

1953
01:34:44.291 --> 01:34:45.124
<v Speaker 2>address it.</v>

1954
01:34:45.370 --> 01:34:47.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes things are going bad and a guy</v>

1955
01:34:47.471 --> 01:34:49.380
<v Speaker 2>will address that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going bad and they pulled</v>

1956
01:34:49.381 --> 01:34:51.460
<v Speaker 2>themselves out of it and then it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 2>great again.</v>

1957
01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.290
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done that.</v>

1958
01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:57.160
<v Speaker 2>I've had like bad moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We address that bad moment and things</v>

1959
01:34:57.161 --> 01:34:59.930
<v Speaker 2>snap back or you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1960
01:34:59.931 --> 01:35:03.110
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you reassess your approach.</v>

1961
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:06.110
<v Speaker 2>It does a lot of variables involved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup comedy,</v>

1962
01:35:06.111 --> 01:35:10.250
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to explain this and I've gone</v>

1963
01:35:10.251 --> 01:35:12.620
<v Speaker 2>over this with many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many comedian friends of mine and we all</v>

1964
01:35:12.621 --> 01:35:15.350
<v Speaker 2>seem to agree on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a moment when things are</v>

1965
01:35:15.351 --> 01:35:18.470
<v Speaker 2>going really well with the audience is</v>
<v Speaker 2>laughing and you're in the zone and</v>

1966
01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:21.230
<v Speaker 2>you're delivering your jokes that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared for a long time.</v>

1967
01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Everything's done right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a lot of great timing and</v>

1968
01:35:23.661 --> 01:35:24.660
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1969
01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a mass hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when I watch a really funny</v>

1970
01:35:28.311 --> 01:35:33.311
<v Speaker 2>comedian firewatch a bill burr for say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1971
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.810
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's on stage and he's killing and</v>

1972
01:35:35.811 --> 01:35:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching and I'm laughing my ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

1973
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:40.310
<v Speaker 2>what I am doing is allowing him to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

1974
01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm allowing him to,</v>

1975
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:45.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's talking about having a female</v>

1976
01:35:45.561 --> 01:35:48.860
<v Speaker 2>president or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going through his thought process</v>

1977
01:35:48.861 --> 01:35:50.730
<v Speaker 2>of what it would be like Bubba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bubba,</v>

1978
01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Bubba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as he's going through it,</v>

1979
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:55.460
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really doing any calculations,</v>

1980
01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm allowing him to do all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>calculations.</v>

1981
01:35:57.830 --> 01:36:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm allowing him to take up all of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought process with his sentences and</v>

1982
01:36:02.681 --> 01:36:03.200
<v Speaker 2>the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1983
01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.430
<v Speaker 2>the images that he's depicting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes it really funny and</v>

1984
01:36:07.431 --> 01:36:09.320
<v Speaker 2>the whole audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all in it together,</v>

1985
01:36:09.321 --> 01:36:12.470
<v Speaker 2>so there's this community effect of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>group hypnosis,</v>

1986
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:17.000
<v Speaker 2>so we're all laughing because we're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the same page and we're all like</v>

1987
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:20.690
<v Speaker 2>these thoughts that he's saying are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny and we're all going along with it,</v>

1988
01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:24.650
<v Speaker 2>but when someone's bad or when the joke</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work,</v>

1989
01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.550
<v Speaker 2>then everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1990
01:36:25.551 --> 01:36:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1991
01:36:27.171 --> 01:36:28.040
<v Speaker 2>this isn't working.</v>

1992
01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll look around and see everybody</v>

1993
01:36:29.901 --> 01:36:32.870
<v Speaker 2>else's uncomfortable and then you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's uncomfortable and I'm like,</v>

1994
01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:33.900
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1995
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:35.210
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's bombing right now.</v>

1996
01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:39.110
<v Speaker 2>And when someone's bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're forced to completely out of</v>

1997
01:36:39.111 --> 01:36:41.540
<v Speaker 2>the spell and now you have to do all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these calculations.</v>

1998
01:36:41.690 --> 01:36:43.210
<v Speaker 2>You have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do all this,</v>

1999
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:45.890
<v Speaker 2>all this consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>considerations going on.</v>

2000
01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.850
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot happening that wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening if a guy was just killing,</v>

2001
01:36:50.110 --> 01:36:52.160
<v Speaker 2>but someone's killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's effortless to watch.</v>

2002
01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Just laughing it off and then you leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel great.</v>

2003
01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:59.120
<v Speaker 2>So it's when it goes bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uncomfortable for everybody.</v>

2004
01:36:59.390 --> 01:37:02.720
<v Speaker 2>It's uncomfortable for the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's uncomfortable for the comedian.</v>

2005
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:07.750
<v Speaker 2>It's just because you're forced to</v>
<v Speaker 2>consider his process,</v>

2006
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:13.280
<v Speaker 2>his failures or her failures and her bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes or all those things.</v>

2007
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there are certain elements</v>
<v Speaker 2>of humor?</v>

2008
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:21.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean clearly they are culture specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestations of you are maybe physical</v>

2009
01:37:21.891 --> 01:37:24.140
<v Speaker 2>comedy is more appreciated and culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asian culture be,</v>

2010
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:29.470
<v Speaker 2>but are there specific umer mechanisms</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are not mechanism but you know,</v>

2011
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:34.940
<v Speaker 2>whatever bueller content that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>universally successful?</v>

2012
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:35.900
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2013
01:37:35.901 --> 01:37:38.030
<v Speaker 2>so you think it's always culture</v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent,</v>

2014
01:37:38.210 --> 01:37:41.930
<v Speaker 2>culture dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture dependent,</v>

2015
01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:44.720
<v Speaker 2>taste dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain styles of humor that</v>

2016
01:37:44.721 --> 01:37:47.420
<v Speaker 2>some people really enjoy and other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people hate.</v>

2017
01:37:47.890 --> 01:37:50.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people like all tumor,</v>

2018
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:54.390
<v Speaker 2>which is like keep the mic in the stand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't move dead.</v>

2019
01:37:54.391 --> 01:37:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Pan Delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put very little effort forth.</v>

2020
01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Some people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they prefer.</v>

2021
01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:04.710
<v Speaker 2>The balding guy with the curly hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>balding guy with the curly found like 20</v>

2022

2023
01:38:06.601 --> 01:38:07.434
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2024
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Well he's an absurdist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that all absurd?</v>

2025
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like a used to work at a fire</v>

2026
01:38:13.261 --> 01:38:18.150
<v Speaker 2>hydrant factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't park anywhere near the place.</v>

2027
01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.073
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2028
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:20.510
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing,</v>

2029
01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:20.980
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2030
01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:22.320
<v Speaker 2>is that kind of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2031
01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:25.770
<v Speaker 2>it's all like really bizarre and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>observed one liners.</v>

2032
01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's not all that's just really</v>

2033
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:33.900
<v Speaker 2>funny and original and all it is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of times really bad,</v>

2034
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

2035
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.500
<v Speaker 2>And it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super supportive crowds that gather</v>

2036
01:38:38.501 --> 01:38:41.520
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they got kicked out of</v>

2037
01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:46.020
<v Speaker 2>the cool playground so they made their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own playground and there's a comedy</v>

2038
01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.650
<v Speaker 2>festival that's going on right now are</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be going on some somewhere</v>

2039
01:38:49.651 --> 01:38:52.910
<v Speaker 2>in New York where somebody sent me this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and I looked at it for a couple of</v>

2040
01:38:52.911 --> 01:38:54.060
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have throw it away.</v>

2041
01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.680
<v Speaker 2>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

2042
01:38:55.740 --> 01:39:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I can't even get into this where they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>charging different amounts for different</v>

2043
01:39:01.681 --> 01:39:05.470
<v Speaker 2>access to people who are white males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2044
01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.570
<v Speaker 2>they want to have as few white males as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>

2045
01:39:09.571 --> 01:39:11.580
<v Speaker 2>so they want to make it as diverse as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

2046
01:39:11.581 --> 01:39:14.490
<v Speaker 2>So they're opening it up to people of</v>
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>

2047
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Lbgtq x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y,</v>

2048
01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:19.470

<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2049
01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.980
<v Speaker 2>and this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is their solution.</v>

2050
01:39:23.010 --> 01:39:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Their solution is to not just have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>funniest people that they think are</v>

2051
01:39:26.851 --> 01:39:28.770
<v Speaker 2>there regardless of race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>

2052
01:39:28.771 --> 01:39:29.670
<v Speaker 2>creed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity.</v>

2053
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

2054
01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Exclude the white man and token white</v>
<v Speaker 2>bearded men is one of the things that</v>

2055
01:39:35.161 --> 01:39:36.540
<v Speaker 2>they discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

2056
01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:38.010
<v Speaker 2>the people that run the group were all</v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

2057
01:39:38.210 --> 01:39:39.690
<v Speaker 2>So hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2058
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:42.960
<v Speaker 2>if you want to run a festival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to do whatever the</v>

2059
01:39:42.961 --> 01:39:46.530
<v Speaker 2>fuck you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that you want to run an art</v>

2060
01:39:46.531 --> 01:39:49.620
<v Speaker 2>festival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want to exclude certain people</v>

2061
01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:53.130
<v Speaker 2>like pick the best ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about pick the best ones,</v>

2062
01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:55.440
<v Speaker 2>the best ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn out to be white men with beards.</v>

2063
01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Go with that information and try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out why that's the case.</v>

2064
01:39:58.771 --> 01:40:02.040
<v Speaker 2>So from that perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we to assume that I now know what</v>

2065
01:40:02.041 --> 01:40:04.650
<v Speaker 2>your position is on affirmative action?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2066
01:40:04.710 --> 01:40:07.650
<v Speaker 2>my position on affirmative action is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2067
01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:12.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it has good intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea is to try to stop</v>

2068
01:40:12.421 --> 01:40:13.200
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

2069
01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.960
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're getting someone in there,</v>

2070
01:40:15.961 --> 01:40:19.110
<v Speaker 2>they become a firefighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're less physically fit and less</v>

2071
01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.720
<v Speaker 2>intelligent than someone who could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten the job,</v>

2072
01:40:21.721 --> 01:40:24.870
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other guy was from Croatian descent,</v>

2073
01:40:25.330 --> 01:40:26.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2074
01:40:26.581 --> 01:40:29.250
<v Speaker 2>he looks like a white man who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>privileged,</v>

2075
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:31.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile this guy came from a</v>

2076
01:40:31.411 --> 01:40:36.240
<v Speaker 2>family of very poor immigrants who</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggled and scratched and scraped and,</v>

2077
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:37.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people could look at him as the</v>

2078
01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:39.610
<v Speaker 2>oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking preposterous.</v>

2079
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:41.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of that going on.</v>

2080
01:40:41.491 --> 01:40:42.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2081
01:40:42.241 --> 01:40:43.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's ridiculous.</v>

2082
01:40:43.621 --> 01:40:44.880
<v Speaker 2>So I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

2083
01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this idea of people who are all</v>

2084
01:40:49.261 --> 01:40:52.800
<v Speaker 2>have a certain amount of melanin in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their skin that they should get a job</v>

2085
01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.970
<v Speaker 2>versus people who don't have melanin in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their skin.</v>

2086
01:40:55.150 --> 01:40:56.330
<v Speaker 2>That's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2087
01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I think we should address the core</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

2088
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:04.360
<v Speaker 2>which is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it harder for people who grow up</v>

2089
01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:08.230
<v Speaker 2>in African American communities or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexican American communities?</v>

2090
01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Why is it harder for them to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better education?</v>

2091
01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Why is it harder for them to succeed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it hard for them to resist crime?</v>

2092
01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Why are they in involved in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>impoverished areas?</v>

2093
01:41:18.551 --> 01:41:19.930
<v Speaker 2>And how do we fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2094
01:41:19.931 --> 01:41:21.310
<v Speaker 2>you know what Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we bounced that,</v>

2095
01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:25.230
<v Speaker 2>you know who larry elder's to sage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever had them on the show?</v>

2096
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.060
<v Speaker 2>But I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2097
01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:27.760
<v Speaker 2>he and I had been going back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>through twitter.</v>

2098
01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

2099
01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:31.750
<v Speaker 2>you know what his answer would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's an African American.</v>

2100
01:41:31.751 --> 01:41:33.040
<v Speaker 2>He's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

2101
01:41:33.041 --> 01:41:34.900
<v Speaker 2>what is the reason for all of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you said,</v>

2102
01:41:34.901 --> 01:41:39.270
<v Speaker 2>why this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why that father absence he at now,</v>

2103
01:41:39.271 --> 01:41:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether he is a overusing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2104
01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:45.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that causal factor,</v>

2105
01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:50.350
<v Speaker 2>but he certainly seems to be quoting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of data that suggests that many of</v>

2106
01:41:50.351 --> 01:41:55.351
<v Speaker 2>these sort of delirious downstream</v>
<v Speaker 2>effects are due to nothing more than</v>

2107
01:41:55.451 --> 01:41:56.290
<v Speaker 2>father absence.</v>

2108
01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Solve that problem and many of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues would go away.</v>

2109
01:41:59.410 --> 01:42:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a little simplistic</v>

2110
01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:04.180
<v Speaker 2>because your dad's a fucking piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and lives in your house,</v>

2111
01:42:04.210 --> 01:42:05.430
<v Speaker 2>you've got a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2112
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:07.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's necessarily the</v>

2113
01:42:07.061 --> 01:42:08.420
<v Speaker 2>only way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2114
01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:12.640
<v Speaker 2>and I think you can't just blame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that we were</v>

2115
01:42:12.641 --> 01:42:16.420
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really important is that cultures become</v>

2116
01:42:16.421 --> 01:42:21.421
<v Speaker 2>patterns and patterns repeat and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns that these people are born</v>

2117
01:42:22.121 --> 01:42:23.530
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not their choice.</v>

2118
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:27.640
<v Speaker 2>And we recognize it as someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't born in that pattern.</v>

2119
01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.190
<v Speaker 2>You look at a bad pattern of someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>being born say,</v>

2120
01:42:30.191 --> 01:42:33.520
<v Speaker 2>like in Baltimore and extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>impoverished community is filled with</v>

2121
01:42:33.521 --> 01:42:36.370
<v Speaker 2>crime and gang violence and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2122
01:42:36.371 --> 01:42:38.830
<v Speaker 2>how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does this get corrected?</v>

2123
01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:40.980
<v Speaker 2>How do we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Michael Wood on who's an</v>

2124
01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:44.800
<v Speaker 2>interesting guy who was a former cop in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore and really,</v>

2125
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:48.790
<v Speaker 2>really interesting dude and I think he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to run for like he's trying to be</v>

2126
01:42:48.791 --> 01:42:49.670
<v Speaker 2>a police commissioner.</v>

2127
01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:50.520
<v Speaker 2>CHICAGO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2128
01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I applied for it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he would be a great person for</v>

2129
01:42:54.521 --> 01:42:56.230
<v Speaker 2>that job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2130
01:42:56.410 --> 01:43:00.400
<v Speaker 2>he's got a lot of information and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of really,</v>

2131
01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:01.550
<v Speaker 2>he's very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2132
01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Law Common Sense when it comes to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that Michael Wood</v>

2133
01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:09.010
<v Speaker 2>was talking about when he was on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast was that they had found a,</v>

2134
01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I guess a directive from the 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies when they were going through</v>

2135
01:43:12.551 --> 01:43:14.980
<v Speaker 2>the archives and all the shit that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have in Baltimore.</v>

2136
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:20.790
<v Speaker 2>The police director from the 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies was exactly the same as what</v>

2137
01:43:21.551 --> 01:43:24.970
<v Speaker 2>he was dealing with in the two thousands</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as the neighborhoods that had</v>

2138
01:43:24.971 --> 01:43:27.220
<v Speaker 2>drugs and neighborhoods where crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2139
01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:30.490
<v Speaker 2>it's the same pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>repeating the same patterns over and</v>

2140
01:43:30.491 --> 01:43:33.730
<v Speaker 2>over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one has done anything to try to</v>

2141
01:43:33.731 --> 01:43:38.170
<v Speaker 2>socially engineer some beneficial change</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these communities.</v>

2142
01:43:38.171 --> 01:43:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Instead they just continue to lock up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same people.</v>

2143
01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:44.590
<v Speaker 2>And I agree with him that that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially at that point it becomes</v>

2144
01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:46.360
<v Speaker 2>institutionalized racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2145
01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:49.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's the issue that</v>

2146
01:43:49.931 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>needs to be addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think</v>

2147
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:57.020
<v Speaker 3>that affirmative action is the best way</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it because I think that also it,</v>

2148
01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:02.380
<v Speaker 3>it starts to produce this feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 3>resentment from people that are more</v>

2149
01:44:03.591 --> 01:44:06.020
<v Speaker 3>qualified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't get the jobs well.</v>

2150
01:44:06.021 --> 01:44:08.210
<v Speaker 3>And I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say for the,</v>

2151
01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:13.190
<v Speaker 3>for the black applicant who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say goes to law school,</v>

2152
01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2153
01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:20.380
<v Speaker 3>they will never know whether they went</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the whole process simply on</v>

2154
01:44:20.481 --> 01:44:23.420
<v Speaker 3>their merit or whether they were helped</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some way.</v>

2155
01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:27.290
<v Speaker 3>And I think that itself won't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll be if they graduate.</v>

2156
01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:27.610
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2157
01:44:27.610 --> 01:44:27.771
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2158
01:44:27.771 --> 01:44:30.290
<v Speaker 3>What I mean is when you got it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you,</v>

2159
01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.830
<v Speaker 3>did you get in strictly on the merits of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your Dosha?</v>

2160
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.710
<v Speaker 3>Let's suppose I actually don't want a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

2161
01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm a person of color and I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything to be effecting the decision</v>

2162
01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:45.470
<v Speaker 3>other than purely the merits of my dose</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2163
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:49.040
<v Speaker 3>So now I go through the process at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>end of that process,</v>

2164
01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.840
<v Speaker 3>I won't absolutely know for sure whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was strictly based on what I wanted,</v>

2165
01:44:53.841 --> 01:44:55.010
<v Speaker 3>which is the murder of my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those here,</v>

2166
01:44:55.011 --> 01:44:56.490
<v Speaker 3>whether there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2167
01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:59.840
<v Speaker 3>something that helped me along the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of this institutionalized</v>

2168
01:44:59.841 --> 01:45:02.930
<v Speaker 3>affirmative action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's not a bit problematic.</v>

2169
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:05.480
<v Speaker 3>I guess it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would assume that by the time</v>

2170
01:45:05.481 --> 01:45:07.520
<v Speaker 3>you've gone through university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2171
01:45:07.521 --> 01:45:09.470
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're now you're talking about a much</v>

2172
01:45:09.471 --> 01:45:13.100
<v Speaker 3>higher level of education and it should</v>
<v Speaker 3>be pretty.</v>

2173
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I hate to use the term black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it should be right there.</v>

2174
01:45:16.431 --> 01:45:18.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should see their grades and you see,</v>

2175
01:45:18.970 --> 01:45:23.570
<v Speaker 3>so are our professors are hired as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>function of these things.</v>

2176
01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:27.320
<v Speaker 3>What I once applied for real say this</v>
<v Speaker 3>here publicly,</v>

2177
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 3>I once applied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is,</v>

2178
01:45:29.571 --> 01:45:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I was coming out on the market finishing</v>
<v Speaker 3>my phd,</v>

2179
01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the market like a cow or since the</v>

2180
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:37.183
<v Speaker 3>academic market.</v>

2181
01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.550
<v Speaker 3>And the academic market works is you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2182
01:45:40.570 --> 01:45:43.730
<v Speaker 3>you interview round one and then route</v>
<v Speaker 3>in one place.</v>

2183
01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:46.760
<v Speaker 3>All the schools come there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in round two they invite you</v>

2184
01:45:46.761 --> 01:45:48.800
<v Speaker 3>for a campus visit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I had been,</v>

2185
01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:52.460
<v Speaker 3>I was interviewing at one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>prestigious places that you could ever</v>

2186
01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:55.430
<v Speaker 3>hope to imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually from your neck of the</v>

2187
01:45:55.431 --> 01:45:58.040
<v Speaker 3>woods in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard,</v>

2188
01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2189
01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:02.300
<v Speaker 3>maybe I shouldn't have said that and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think you said that.</v>

2190
01:46:02.301 --> 01:46:04.550
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have right salt kittings I'm not</v>

2191
01:46:04.551 --> 01:46:08.000
<v Speaker 3>admitting whether that's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently I was one of the</v>

2192
01:46:08.001 --> 01:46:13.001
<v Speaker 3>finalists and at least I had heard from</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people who are maybe on the inside,</v>

2193
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:16.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were really looking for a</v>

2194
01:46:16.101 --> 01:46:20.660
<v Speaker 3>woman and that to the extent that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>might not be able to articulate a might</v>

2195
01:46:20.661 --> 01:46:23.000
<v Speaker 3>be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if that ended up being</v>

2196
01:46:23.001 --> 01:46:24.320
<v Speaker 3>the main reason why I think that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>job,</v>

2197
01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.570
<v Speaker 3>but I've often heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2198
01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:28.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are not have the right race.</v>

2199
01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:31.670
<v Speaker 3>We need more diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need more gender diversity,</v>

2200
01:46:31.671 --> 01:46:35.180
<v Speaker 3>we need more racial diversity and make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it fair.</v>

2201
01:46:35.181 --> 01:46:36.350
<v Speaker 3>And even though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2202
01:46:36.351 --> 01:46:37.610
<v Speaker 3>how has that ever achieved?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2203
01:46:37.611 --> 01:46:38.300
<v Speaker 3>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>

2204
01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:40.040
<v Speaker 3>I think it's grotesque.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2205
01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.690
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you saw,</v>

2206
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:46.430
<v Speaker 3>I had a sad truth clip where I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I titled it the All Time Greatest social</v>

2207
01:46:46.431 --> 01:46:49.830
<v Speaker 3>justice warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was based on a group of Dartmouth</v>

2208
01:46:49.831 --> 01:46:53.790
<v Speaker 3>students that had occupied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the president's office with a</v>

2209
01:46:53.791 --> 01:46:54.890
<v Speaker 3>set of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen,</v>

2210
01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:56.670
<v Speaker 3>have you seen this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the freedom project.</v>

2211
01:46:56.671 --> 01:47:00.270
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you can put it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Dartmouth freedom project where</v>

2212
01:47:00.271 --> 01:47:02.460
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had sort of like a manifesto,</v>

2213
01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:07.760
<v Speaker 3>here are the things that we absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>expect dartmouth to implement.</v>

2214
01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:12.840
<v Speaker 3>If you saw that list and I go through</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of that on my youtube channel,</v>

2215
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:15.480
<v Speaker 3>it's simply baffling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2216
01:47:15.481 --> 01:47:20.130
<v Speaker 3>we have to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a professor of Color Speaker series.</v>

2217
01:47:20.490 --> 01:47:21.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2218
01:47:21.391 --> 01:47:22.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if,</v>

2219
01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:22.920
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm,</v>

2220
01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.020
<v Speaker 3>if I'm a number theorist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a mathematician,</v>

2221
01:47:25.410 --> 01:47:30.410
<v Speaker 3>does the amount of melanin that I have</v>
<v Speaker 3>determined how I study the distribution</v>

2222
01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:34.440
<v Speaker 3>of prime numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you would have students</v>

2223
01:47:34.441 --> 01:47:39.240
<v Speaker 3>demanding that there be a person of</v>
<v Speaker 3>color speaker series.</v>

2224
01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:41.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's grotesque,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2225
01:47:41.581 --> 01:47:43.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's denying the fact that racism</v>

2226
01:47:43.770 --> 01:47:46.680
<v Speaker 3>has existed and to some extent continues</v>
<v Speaker 3>to exist,</v>

2227
01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:51.870
<v Speaker 3>but to have these types of demands to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems problematic.</v>

2228
01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2229
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.710
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't think it's the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual approach to the issue at</v>

2230
01:47:57.711 --> 01:47:59.840
<v Speaker 2>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is combating racism,</v>

2231
01:47:59.841 --> 01:48:01.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's making.</v>

2232
01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Instead of having an even playing field</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all and considering all with equal</v>

2233
01:48:05.781 --> 01:48:10.130
<v Speaker 2>merit to change the level of the playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>field and boost people up that aren't</v>

2234
01:48:10.131 --> 01:48:11.080
<v Speaker 2>qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2235
01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where you're talking also</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the end result.</v>

2236
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:16.970
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the finished</v>
<v Speaker 2>product of an education,</v>

2237
01:48:17.130 --> 01:48:19.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally at the highest level of</v>

2238
01:48:19.341 --> 01:48:22.250
<v Speaker 2>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think that if you're looking at</v>

2239
01:48:22.251 --> 01:48:24.350
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really,</v>

2240
01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:29.410
<v Speaker 2>it all comes down to what is it that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>making certain people have less</v>

2241
01:48:30.771 --> 01:48:35.771
<v Speaker 2>opportunity and that needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineered from a societal level and</v>

2242
01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:38.370
<v Speaker 2>from a cultural level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

2243
01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I've said this many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times at the,</v>

2244
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:44.750
<v Speaker 2>the biggest issue with any culture is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weakest link,</v>

2245
01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:45.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2246
01:48:45.370 --> 01:48:48.140
<v Speaker 2>But what's the best way to have a more</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful country?</v>

2247
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:51.410
<v Speaker 2>What's the best way to have a more</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful union will less losers?</v>

2248
01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you have less losers here?</v>

2249
01:48:53.370 --> 01:48:56.450
<v Speaker 2>We give more people education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people chances,</v>

2250
01:48:56.451 --> 01:49:01.310
<v Speaker 2>and more people who are disenfranchised</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're stuck in these bad situations.</v>

2251
01:49:01.670 --> 01:49:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Give them an opportunity to get out some</v>
<v Speaker 2>way or another.</v>

2252
01:49:04.941 --> 01:49:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's through continued</v>
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

2253
01:49:07.401 --> 01:49:10.460
<v Speaker 2>whether it's through community centers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's through combat,</v>

2254
01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:13.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean what will Larry elders talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about better not having fathers?</v>

2255
01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we can't just say fuck them,</v>

2256
01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:17.440
<v Speaker 2>they should have a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Dad should get involved that,</v>

2257
01:49:17.441 --> 01:49:19.370
<v Speaker 2>that you're not going to fix people like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2258
01:49:19.590 --> 01:49:23.480
<v Speaker 2>The children are the ones that there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>still malleable and still have</v>

2259
01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:26.060
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to figure out a way to</v>

2260
01:49:26.061 --> 01:49:28.590
<v Speaker 2>provide them with some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

2261
01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of mentorship,</v>

2262
01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:34.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

2263
01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.920
<v Speaker 2>some hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2264
01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just read through this carefully</v>

2265
01:49:38.771 --> 01:49:43.060
<v Speaker 3>because it's a thorny topic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Earlier we spoke about the,</v>

2266
01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 3>the culture of achievement that</v>

2267
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:51.310
<v Speaker 2>we find that is that make within Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 2>homes.</v>

2268
01:49:51.330 --> 01:49:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the same token,</v>

2269
01:49:53.381 --> 01:49:57.730
<v Speaker 2>do you think that other cultures might</v>
<v Speaker 2>be creating environments that are</v>

2270
01:49:57.850 --> 01:50:00.310
<v Speaker 2>exactly the opposite of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

2271
01:50:00.730 --> 01:50:02.400
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be some endemic</v>

2272
01:50:02.410 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 2>institutional reasons why people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>succeed,</v>

2273
01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:09.220
<v Speaker 2>but there are also individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility or collective</v>

2274
01:50:09.221 --> 01:50:11.200
<v Speaker 2>responsibility within the family or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

2275
01:50:11.590 --> 01:50:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I think just eluding to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll let.</v>

2276
01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:20.200
<v Speaker 2>We'll will cause people to level an</v>
<v Speaker 2>accusation of racism against you,</v>

2277
01:50:20.201 --> 01:50:20.501
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2278
01:50:20.501 --> 01:50:22.570
<v Speaker 2>think about Bill Cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Cosby,</v>

2279
01:50:22.571 --> 01:50:25.450
<v Speaker 2>I know he's not popular now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at one point he was walking around</v>

2280
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:27.410
<v Speaker 2>and saying exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2281
01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:27.930
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2282
01:50:27.930 --> 01:50:32.930
<v Speaker 2>that blacks have to take responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some of their failures and he was</v>

2283
01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.950
<v Speaker 2>that that message was not very well</v>
<v Speaker 2>received.</v>

2284
01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:36.451
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2285
01:50:36.451 --> 01:50:39.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying it from an easy place saying</v>

2286
01:50:39.090 --> 01:50:41.180
<v Speaker 2>it from someone who's very successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2287
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:44.530
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people imitate their atmosphere.</v>

2288
01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I think culture's exists because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to pattern yourself around what's</v>

2289
01:50:49.421 --> 01:50:54.020
<v Speaker 2>around you and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That exists in a religious sense and it</v>

2290
01:50:54.021 --> 01:50:56.200
<v Speaker 2>exists in a behavioral sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2291
01:50:56.201 --> 01:50:59.440
<v Speaker 2>you become a lot like the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you surround yourself with.</v>

2292
01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.140
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so important to surround</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself with positive people.</v>

2293
01:51:02.141 --> 01:51:04.780
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most important lessons</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could ever learn as a human being.</v>

2294
01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:07.420
<v Speaker 2>The more positive people you surround</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself with,</v>

2295
01:51:07.421 --> 01:51:12.421
<v Speaker 2>the more you'll aspire to be like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more you you have a high standard</v>

2296
01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:16.330
<v Speaker 2>that exists all around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2297
01:51:16.331 --> 01:51:19.320
<v Speaker 2>if you're fucked and you grow up in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place without,</v>

2298
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:22.210
<v Speaker 2>with no hope and a lot of despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2299
01:51:22.211 --> 01:51:27.211
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I first moved to New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York when I was in my early twenties and</v>

2300
01:51:27.371 --> 01:51:29.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really have that many friends</v>

2301
01:51:29.441 --> 01:51:32.270
<v Speaker 2>at first and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had a few friends that I just,</v>

2302
01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I was really disappointed with them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them because he just would say so</v>

2303
01:51:36.821 --> 01:51:40.840
<v Speaker 2>much racist shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would drive me crazy and I just,</v>

2304
01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:43.770
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was almost like God damn it.</v>

2305
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't find friends like I had in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston,</v>

2306
01:51:46.710 --> 01:51:47.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2307
01:51:47.231 --> 01:51:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch of knuckleheads that I</v>

2308
01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:51.820
<v Speaker 2>wish that I knew and I needed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>establish,</v>

2309
01:51:51.821 --> 01:51:53.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a while when,</v>

2310
01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:54.550
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're young and by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2311
01:51:54.551 --> 01:51:59.551
<v Speaker 2>no Internet back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're trying to find good friends</v>

2312
01:52:00.190 --> 01:52:03.820
<v Speaker 2>and friends that were like in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>profession as standup comics.</v>

2313
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.620
<v Speaker 2>So I had to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2314
01:52:05.621 --> 01:52:08.470
<v Speaker 2>get closer to a few people that are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these communities.</v>

2315
01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:11.140
<v Speaker 2>And it took a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I remember feeling really depressed</v>

2316
01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:16.240
<v Speaker 2>when I first moved there and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a cause for me to reconsider</v>

2317
01:52:16.241 --> 01:52:18.280
<v Speaker 2>moving back to Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one point in time,</v>

2318
01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:23.440
<v Speaker 2>even though I had just signed with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>new manager that's still my manager to</v>

2319
01:52:23.441 --> 01:52:26.230
<v Speaker 2>this day and there's all this hope and</v>
<v Speaker 2>promise that like,</v>

2320
01:52:26.410 --> 01:52:28.120
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually going to have a career now.</v>

2321
01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I was so bummed out by the people that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was around with that I would go back to</v>

2322
01:52:31.871 --> 01:52:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Boston and do gigs and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

2323
01:52:33.731 --> 01:52:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I want to move back here man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I was like Boston for all of its</v>

2324
01:52:38.561 --> 01:52:42.190
<v Speaker 2>faults and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very smart place.</v>

2325
01:52:42.370 --> 01:52:43.450
<v Speaker 2>And as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as New York.</v>

2326
01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:47.210
<v Speaker 2>But I had just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had infiltrated into a really great</v>

2327
01:52:47.211 --> 01:52:50.030
<v Speaker 2>community in Boston and I hadn't done</v>
<v Speaker 2>that yet in New York.</v>

2328
01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:52.530
<v Speaker 2>So there's a very small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2329
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:54.410
<v Speaker 2>obviously a couple of years later I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

2330
01:52:54.411 --> 01:52:58.400
<v Speaker 2>But it was when you're not around</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive people,</v>

2331
01:52:58.401 --> 01:53:00.890
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in North New Jersey when I</v>

2332
01:53:00.891 --> 01:53:04.730
<v Speaker 2>first moved there because that's where</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandfather lived and I didn't have</v>

2333
01:53:04.731 --> 01:53:06.830
<v Speaker 2>any money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I stayed with him for awhile and he</v>

2334
01:53:06.831 --> 01:53:10.940
<v Speaker 2>was in a terrible neighborhood and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had bought a house there a long time ago</v>

2335
01:53:10.941 --> 01:53:14.360
<v Speaker 2>and the community had changed several</v>
<v Speaker 2>times and gotten worse and worse and the</v>

2336
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:18.290
<v Speaker 2>kid next door before I had moved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think somewhere around the time that I</v>

2337
01:53:18.291 --> 01:53:21.130
<v Speaker 2>was living there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his door got broken down by the cops and</v>

2338
01:53:21.131 --> 01:53:23.570
<v Speaker 2>they was selling crack and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2339
01:53:23.710 --> 01:53:24.543
<v Speaker 2>it was real bad.</v>

2340
01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2341
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:30.010
<v Speaker 2>so I've felt depressed living there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment that I've found myself</v>

2342
01:53:30.201 --> 01:53:32.870
<v Speaker 2>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandmother had had a stroke so she</v>

2343
01:53:32.871 --> 01:53:36.030
<v Speaker 2>would moan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the grandmother who's a Mafia.</v>

2344
01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.110
<v Speaker 2>I runner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2345
01:53:37.850 --> 01:53:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was earlier in her life when she</v>

2346
01:53:39.951 --> 01:53:41.610
<v Speaker 2>was mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she had a,</v>

2347
01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:44.690
<v Speaker 2>she had a stroke and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she gave her 70,</v>

2348
01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:49.790
<v Speaker 2>like 72 hours to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lived for 12 years and they were</v>

2349
01:53:49.791 --> 01:53:51.140
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's probably going to die.</v>

2350
01:53:51.190 --> 01:53:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Like she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a really bad stroke,</v>

2351
01:53:52.731 --> 01:53:56.600
<v Speaker 2>but somehow she hung on by a thread for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time and you know,</v>

2352
01:53:56.601 --> 01:54:00.260
<v Speaker 2>my grandfather used to have to change</v>
<v Speaker 2>your sheets and she had bed sores</v>

2353
01:54:00.261 --> 01:54:02.780
<v Speaker 2>because she would just lay in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't really move.</v>

2354
01:54:02.781 --> 01:54:04.130
<v Speaker 2>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was awful.</v>

2355
01:54:04.131 --> 01:54:07.610
<v Speaker 2>So that environment of being in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>really poor neighborhood,</v>

2356
01:54:07.611 --> 01:54:10.760
<v Speaker 2>being poor myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no fucking money being around bad,</v>

2357
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:12.500
<v Speaker 2>like didn't have good friends.</v>

2358
01:54:12.530 --> 01:54:14.690
<v Speaker 2>It's depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's depressing now.</v>

2359
01:54:14.691 --> 01:54:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I had opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a career.</v>

2360
01:54:17.770 --> 01:54:20.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a way to get out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got a taste.</v>

2361
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:22.430
<v Speaker 2>I think even though the tiniest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiniest,</v>

2362
01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:26.990
<v Speaker 2>tiniest taste of despair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to be stuck in a shit</v>

2363
01:54:26.991 --> 01:54:30.500
<v Speaker 2>situation now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine being born in that situation</v>

2364
01:54:30.501 --> 01:54:31.161
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2365
01:54:31.161 --> 01:54:33.980
<v Speaker 2>I moved there when I was in my twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like 23 or something like that.</v>

2366
01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if I was there my whole life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just been around fucked up.</v>

2367
01:54:38.181 --> 01:54:41.990
<v Speaker 2>People had been sexually abused or</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically abused or you know,</v>

2368
01:54:41.991 --> 01:54:45.920
<v Speaker 2>my mother was selling crack or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother was in jail or who knows,</v>

2369
01:54:45.921 --> 01:54:47.930
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of variables that can lead</v>

2370
01:54:47.931 --> 01:54:52.931
<v Speaker 2>to a terrible state of mind and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>insanely hard to overcome the patterns</v>

2371
01:54:53.571 --> 01:54:58.160
<v Speaker 2>of the past and the patterns of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and until we address that,</v>

2372
01:54:58.250 --> 01:55:00.560
<v Speaker 2>this idea of pulling yourself up by your</v>
<v Speaker 2>bootstraps,</v>

2373
01:55:00.561 --> 01:55:01.910
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking ridiculous.</v>

2374
01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:03.140
<v Speaker 2>The idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2375
01:55:03.141 --> 01:55:05.570
<v Speaker 2>the cops wouldn't be shooting these</v>
<v Speaker 2>young black kids if they just didn't</v>

2376
01:55:05.571 --> 01:55:07.340
<v Speaker 2>commit crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2377
01:55:07.341 --> 01:55:10.940
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy because it's not even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an even playing field.</v>

2378
01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:15.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not even for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comparing myself of 23 to myself,</v>

2379
01:55:15.361 --> 01:55:17.540
<v Speaker 2>a 48,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I have way more</v>

2380
01:55:17.541 --> 01:55:19.280
<v Speaker 2>opportunity now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way easier.</v>

2381
01:55:19.281 --> 01:55:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way easier and way,</v>

2382
01:55:20.631 --> 01:55:22.230
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way better friends way.</v>

2383
01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I've established a nice community with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends.</v>

2384
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Do you still a form of a lot of new</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendships or do you have.</v>

2385
01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm honored to be amongst that group</v>

2389
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:39.380
<v Speaker 2>because of doing this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's allowed me to communicate with some</v>

2390
01:55:39.381 --> 01:55:42.350
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating people and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely allowed me to</v>

2391
01:55:42.351 --> 01:55:47.351
<v Speaker 2>formulate some new and it's allowed me</v>
<v Speaker 2>to evolve my perspective to examine my</v>

2392
01:55:48.151 --> 01:55:50.220
<v Speaker 2>own ideas and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2393
01:55:50.230 --> 01:55:53.370
<v Speaker 2>I think all of us that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm friends with,</v>

2394
01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:57.870
<v Speaker 2>we've all experienced that sort of same</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar growth pattern because,</v>

2395
01:55:57.871 --> 01:55:59.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you take in more information,</v>

2396
01:55:59.761 --> 01:56:01.470
<v Speaker 2>you communicate with each other about</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2397
01:56:01.471 --> 01:56:03.000
<v Speaker 2>you kind of evolve ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2398
01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:07.670
<v Speaker 3>so there was a study done I think a</v>
<v Speaker 3>longitudinal study and I believe I</v>

2399
01:56:07.671 --> 01:56:09.600
<v Speaker 3>mentioned it in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2400
01:56:09.650 --> 01:56:11.860
<v Speaker 3>at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

2401
01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:13.490
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lead investigator,</v>

2402
01:56:13.491 --> 01:56:17.360
<v Speaker 3>I think his name is George French would</v>
<v Speaker 3>say I guess viola or Vegan,</v>

2403
01:56:17.690 --> 01:56:21.770
<v Speaker 3>I think that's his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And out of 75 years of research in terms</v>

2404
01:56:21.771 --> 01:56:25.070
<v Speaker 3>of what is sort of the number one</v>
<v Speaker 3>predictor that makes people happy or</v>

2405
01:56:25.071 --> 01:56:26.630
<v Speaker 3>content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the exact dependent</v>

2406
01:56:26.631 --> 01:56:30.230
<v Speaker 3>measure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The number one thing was establishing</v>

2407
01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:35.500
<v Speaker 3>meaningful connections with others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean 75 years of research out of a</v>

2408
01:56:36.591 --> 01:56:40.040
<v Speaker 3>million possible causal factors were</v>
<v Speaker 3>distilled to that.</v>

2409
01:56:40.041 --> 01:56:40.874
<v Speaker 3>One fact.</v>

2410
01:56:40.990 --> 01:56:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2411
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I would agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mother's status.</v>

2412
01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:45.190
<v Speaker 2>People I know are lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2413
01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Your saddest people I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2414
01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:47.600
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2415
01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:51.610
<v Speaker 2>I know a few comedians don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian friends too,</v>

2416
01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.860
<v Speaker 2>which is really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sort of ostracized by the</v>

2417
01:56:53.861 --> 01:56:57.940
<v Speaker 2>community in some weird way and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are really sad,</v>

2418
01:56:58.390 --> 01:57:00.130
<v Speaker 2>really sad or really lonely and really</v>

2419
01:57:00.230 --> 01:57:00.921
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2420
01:57:00.921 --> 01:57:02.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if we've ever mentioned</v>

2421
01:57:02.661 --> 01:57:05.170
<v Speaker 3>this and this on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2422
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:09.980
<v Speaker 3>if you take prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of them will prefer to be in</v>

2423
01:57:09.981 --> 01:57:14.240
<v Speaker 3>general population where they might be</v>
<v Speaker 3>jumped and stabbed then raped than to be</v>

2424
01:57:14.241 --> 01:57:17.420
<v Speaker 3>put in solitary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Precisely because solitary confinement</v>

2425
01:57:17.421 --> 01:57:20.870
<v Speaker 3>is the ultimate of punishments to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>social species,</v>

2426
01:57:20.871 --> 01:57:21.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2427
01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need each other and these,</v>

2428
01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:28.770
<v Speaker 2>these biological requirements that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't consider because we meet them on a</v>

2429
01:57:28.991 --> 01:57:30.610
<v Speaker 2>daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2430
01:57:30.611 --> 01:57:33.190
<v Speaker 2>that's one of them is getting outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2431
01:57:33.191 --> 01:57:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2432
01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I feel it</v>

2433
01:57:34.450 --> 01:57:38.590
<v Speaker 3>often because of course in my career</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are two parts of me,</v>

2434
01:57:38.591 --> 01:57:43.591
<v Speaker 3>there is the cocoon and my study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on a book and for the next</v>

2435
01:57:44.710 --> 01:57:49.540
<v Speaker 3>16 months I'm pretty much focused on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and I become sort of a cave dweller</v>

2436
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:53.500
<v Speaker 3>and of course there's the public side of</v>
<v Speaker 3>me which is very extroverted and social</v>

2437
01:57:53.501 --> 01:57:56.770
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once in a while when I've spent several</v>

2438
01:57:56.770 --> 01:58:01.060
<v Speaker 3>days very much cocooned and then I go</v>
<v Speaker 3>out even to me to graduate students to</v>

2439
01:58:01.061 --> 01:58:04.810
<v Speaker 3>discuss ideas or a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally come back</v>

2440
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:10.030
<v Speaker 2>refreshed in a way that is akin to</v>
<v Speaker 2>satiating a thirst or hunger or sexual</v>

2441
01:58:12.321 --> 01:58:12.741
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2442
01:58:12.741 --> 01:58:15.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you genuinely feel that I went out with</v>

2443
01:58:15.501 --> 01:58:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Joe and we had coffee and I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed that.</v>

2444
01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exactly that.</v>

2445
01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:21.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2446
01:58:21.831 --> 01:58:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I think I feel like that all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see my friends,</v>

2447
01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:26.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work with um,</v>

2448
01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:31.300
<v Speaker 2>my good friend Joey Diaz last night at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store and when I saw him,</v>

2449
01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't seen him a couple of days or</v>

2450
01:58:34.221 --> 01:58:35.210
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may see them all the time,</v>

2451
01:58:35.211 --> 01:58:38.410
<v Speaker 2>but I hadn't seen him and he gave me a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big hug and I'm hugging them.</v>

2452
01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:39.171
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2453
01:58:39.171 --> 01:58:40.520
<v Speaker 2>so good to see this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2454
01:58:40.521 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is hormonal marker</v>

2455
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:44.170
<v Speaker 3>of hugging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lux release of oxytocin.</v>

2456
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

2457
01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend that I genuinely love and he</v>

2458
01:58:50.031 --> 01:58:52.520
<v Speaker 2>genuinely loves me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see each other big smiles,</v>

2459
01:58:52.521 --> 01:58:54.890
<v Speaker 2>big hug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's warm and it's awesome,</v>

2460
01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:56.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you don't have that in life,</v>

2461
01:58:56.810 --> 01:59:01.070
<v Speaker 2>you suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first moved to La I had gone here</v>

2462
01:59:01.071 --> 01:59:05.540
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do some acting and I was here for a</v>

2463
01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:07.070
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks and I didn't have any</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends again,</v>

2464
01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:10.930
<v Speaker 2>same sort of situation and I had gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2465
01:59:10.931 --> 01:59:14.420
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like two weeks being here and</v>

2466
01:59:14.421 --> 01:59:19.130
<v Speaker 2>really not really knowing anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this girl that I was working with on</v>

2467
01:59:19.131 --> 01:59:24.131
<v Speaker 2>the set gave me a hug and I remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hug felt so good and it didn't feel</v>

2468
01:59:24.921 --> 01:59:26.150
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wanted to fuck her.</v>

2469
01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt good,</v>

2470
01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:29.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like warm,</v>

2471
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:32.450
<v Speaker 2>like love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an actual person being kind to me,</v>

2472
01:59:32.630 --> 01:59:35.360
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or else like I was so weirded out by</v>

2473
01:59:35.361 --> 01:59:40.361
<v Speaker 2>being in this strange place and living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in La and like I'd just gotten</v>

2474
01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:43.550
<v Speaker 2>accustomed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just established like a community in</v>

2475
01:59:43.551 --> 01:59:44.230
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2476
01:59:44.230 --> 01:59:47.480
<v Speaker 2>established some friends and I was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to be happy in New York and all</v>

2477
01:59:47.481 --> 01:59:48.350
<v Speaker 2>something out in La.</v>

2478
01:59:48.810 --> 01:59:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in Darwinian Psychiatry,</v>

2479
01:59:51.501 --> 01:59:54.800
<v Speaker 3>which is a field of psychiatry that</v>
<v Speaker 3>applies evolutionary principles,</v>

2480
01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:57.440
<v Speaker 3>there's this idea of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

2481
01:59:57.441 --> 02:00:01.460
<v Speaker 3>we've evolved in bands of about up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>150 people,</v>

2482
02:00:01.461 --> 02:00:03.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you might've heard of raw robin</v>

2483
02:00:03.411 --> 02:00:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Dunbar's number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2484
02:00:04.731 --> 02:00:07.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is a hundred and 50 people</v>

2485
02:00:07.221 --> 02:00:09.830
<v Speaker 3>you can keep in your social memory</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly right,</v>

2486
02:00:09.831 --> 02:00:14.831
<v Speaker 3>because computationally you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to mark who's trustworthy,</v>

2487
02:00:14.871 --> 02:00:16.640
<v Speaker 3>who's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy reciprocated.</v>

2488
02:00:16.641 --> 02:00:19.910
<v Speaker 3>This guy doesn't once you get past one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's very difficult to maintain</v>

2489
02:00:19.911 --> 02:00:21.590
<v Speaker 3>all these in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2490
02:00:22.190 --> 02:00:25.310
<v Speaker 3>so in the context of the environments in</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we've evolved,</v>

2491
02:00:25.490 --> 02:00:28.490
<v Speaker 3>small groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>repeat interactions,</v>

2492
02:00:28.850 --> 02:00:31.880
<v Speaker 3>our need for social interaction is</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly met.</v>

2493
02:00:31.970 --> 02:00:33.620
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could live in New York,</v>

2494
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:37.040
<v Speaker 3>you're surrounded by 8 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

2495
02:00:37.041 --> 02:00:42.041
<v Speaker 3>how could somebody be lonely when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>step outside and you bump into 17,000</v>

2496
02:00:42.081 --> 02:00:46.700
<v Speaker 3>people yet the rates of depression in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this very lonely place,</v>

2497
02:00:46.701 --> 02:00:49.180
<v Speaker 3>but yet very filled place as much</v>
<v Speaker 3>greater than 150.</v>

2498
02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Precisely because there is a mismatch</v>
<v Speaker 3>between the environment in which we've</v>

2499
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.570
<v Speaker 3>evolved and the contemporary environment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's in the field of</v>

2500
02:00:56.571 --> 02:00:59.480
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You study these types of things.</v>

2501
02:00:59.690 --> 02:01:02.300
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mismatch is true and also there's an</v>

2502
02:01:02.301 --> 02:01:05.780
<v Speaker 2>intimacy wall that people put up because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too many folks,</v>

2503
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:07.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many people and when there's</v>

2504
02:01:07.761 --> 02:01:10.100
<v Speaker 2>too many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't make friends with everybody.</v>

2505
02:01:10.290 --> 02:01:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're in a small town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wave to people as you're driving by,</v>

2506
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:15.710
<v Speaker 2>you don't wave to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In New York you'd be.</v>

2507
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:18.950
<v Speaker 2>You'd go fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you had to wave to every cab</v>

2508
02:01:18.951 --> 02:01:19.880
<v Speaker 2>that passed you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In New York,</v>

2509
02:01:19.881 --> 02:01:20.870
<v Speaker 2>if you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>

2510
02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:23.750
<v Speaker 3>It's not possible so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in your case,</v>

2511
02:01:23.751 --> 02:01:26.150
<v Speaker 3>as somebody who obviously is as well</v>
<v Speaker 3>known and so on,</v>

2512
02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:28.810
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people are trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

2513
02:01:28.811 --> 02:01:33.811
<v Speaker 3>You does that result in you having a bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of a precautionary approach with</v>

2514
02:01:35.241 --> 02:01:37.910
<v Speaker 3>people because you always think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there might be some.</v>

2515
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't have to be angle Aj,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want</v>

2516
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:41.160
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2517
02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:45.110
<v Speaker 2>friends with this famous person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that ever come into play in your</v>

2518
02:01:45.111 --> 02:01:46.310
<v Speaker 2>interactions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2519
02:01:46.311 --> 02:01:48.560
<v Speaker 2>you definitely going to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2520
02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:53.470
<v Speaker 2>you just find other likeminded people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just find people that are like you or</v>

2521
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:54.520
<v Speaker 2>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Similar.</v>

2522
02:01:54.890 --> 02:01:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to be picky,</v>

2523
02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:57.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also there's,</v>

2524
02:01:57.390 --> 02:01:59.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of weight to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2525
02:01:59.390 --> 02:02:02.240
<v Speaker 2>if you like for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2526
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:05.300
<v Speaker 2>perfect example like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start doing this podcast,</v>

2527
02:02:05.301 --> 02:02:08.150
<v Speaker 2>your podcast has taken off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your youtube series is taken off and</v>

2528
02:02:08.151 --> 02:02:11.840
<v Speaker 2>then people want to become friends with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you because they think that they can get</v>

2529
02:02:11.841 --> 02:02:14.810
<v Speaker 2>on your show or piggy back on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>success and they,</v>

2530
02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:17.090
<v Speaker 2>they calculate and they look at you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>

2531
02:02:17.091 --> 02:02:18.740
<v Speaker 2>if I could just get in with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Godfather,</v>

2532
02:02:18.741 --> 02:02:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be in and then I'll,</v>

2533
02:02:21.231 --> 02:02:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I'll get a youtube following.</v>

2534
02:02:22.670 --> 02:02:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll get a little twitter following</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can get a career.</v>

2535
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Like there's people that do calculate</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that and I've met people</v>

2536
02:02:27.921 --> 02:02:30.440
<v Speaker 2>like that in the world of standup where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have said,</v>

2537
02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:31.281
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2538
02:02:31.281 --> 02:02:32.210
<v Speaker 2>take me under your wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2539
02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:34.430
<v Speaker 2>what are you fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no wing.</v>

2540
02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go get your own way.</v>

2541
02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have time.</v>

2542
02:02:37.970 --> 02:02:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I barely have time to do what I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now and continue my own stuff like</v>

2543
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:45.080
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see funny like,</v>

2544
02:02:45.190 --> 02:02:48.770
<v Speaker 2>but there's certain comics will see them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know they're really good and</v>

2545
02:02:48.771 --> 02:02:51.620
<v Speaker 2>they're working really hard and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take them on the road with me.</v>

2546
02:02:51.621 --> 02:02:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Like Tony Hinchcliffe is a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

2547
02:02:53.901 --> 02:02:57.050
<v Speaker 2>I think he was opening for you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Montreal when you</v>

2548
02:02:59.230 --> 02:03:02.180
<v Speaker 2>take them with me everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's other ones like that</v>

2549
02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:06.010
<v Speaker 2>where I meet them and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're working hard and they're,</v>

2550
02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:08.060
<v Speaker 2>they're hustling and then I can help</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2551
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.960
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2552
02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:11.420
<v Speaker 2>But some people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to work hard.</v>

2553
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:16.490
<v Speaker 2>They just want to sort of cling on to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like a lamprey and then they think</v>

2554
02:03:16.491 --> 02:03:19.460
<v Speaker 2>somehow know that'll take them to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you got to know who those people are</v>

2555
02:03:19.461 --> 02:03:22.010
<v Speaker 2>and some people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have friends that don't,</v>

2556
02:03:22.370 --> 02:03:24.560
<v Speaker 2>they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll be hanging around with them</v>

2557
02:03:24.561 --> 02:03:25.730
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is this guy?</v>

2558
02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:26.691
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2559
02:03:26.691 --> 02:03:27.650
<v Speaker 2>he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good guy.</v>

2560
02:03:27.651 --> 02:03:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2561
02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:30.540
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

2562
02:03:30.570 --> 02:03:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll bring these guys on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>road with them and they're.</v>

2563
02:03:32.511 --> 02:03:35.090
<v Speaker 2>They're terrible comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they do is they know how to</v>

2564
02:03:35.091 --> 02:03:40.070
<v Speaker 2>stroke their ego and kiss their ass and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've become a part of their system.</v>

2565
02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:43.190
<v Speaker 2>And the they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of my friends who have had this,</v>

2566
02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:47.480
<v Speaker 2>they had real problems with these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's a deep resentment that</v>

2567
02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:50.690
<v Speaker 2>gets established when the person's</v>
<v Speaker 2>career doesn't take off.</v>

2568
02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2569
02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:53.720
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't happen because they really</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have that much talent.</v>

2570
02:03:53.721 --> 02:03:56.030
<v Speaker 2>They're just really good at kissing ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they get upset.</v>

2571
02:03:56.031 --> 02:03:57.320
<v Speaker 2>This person's not helping them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2572
02:03:57.321 --> 02:04:00.650
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've let this knuckle head into your</v>

2573
02:04:00.651 --> 02:04:04.010
<v Speaker 2>life because they figured out a way how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to woo you and beginning.</v>

2574
02:04:04.190 --> 02:04:07.190
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be careful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also have to be careful with</v>

2575
02:04:07.191 --> 02:04:09.080
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be careful with your own</v>

2576
02:04:09.081 --> 02:04:10.130
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

2577
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:15.230
<v Speaker 2>you have to objectively monitor your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and you have to spend time</v>

2578
02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:20.420
<v Speaker 2>alone just thinking and that's something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people don't like to do.</v>

2579
02:04:20.710 --> 02:04:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's something I think is</v>

2580
02:04:23.810 --> 02:04:27.680
<v Speaker 2>absolutely critical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most critical things for</v>

2581
02:04:27.710 --> 02:04:32.710
<v Speaker 2>a grown person to do is to spend some</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and just think alone,</v>

2582
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:38.400
<v Speaker 2>just thinking and monitor your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monitor your life,</v>

2583
02:04:38.401 --> 02:04:41.610
<v Speaker 2>and then go forth from that with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>directives,</v>

2584
02:04:41.611 --> 02:04:44.030
<v Speaker 2>with some ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some guidelines of what you want to</v>

2585
02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:45.210
<v Speaker 2>do and what you want to accomplish.</v>

2586
02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sort of live life,</v>

2587
02:04:47.401 --> 02:04:51.030
<v Speaker 2>untethered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>untethered to your dreams or your ideas</v>

2588
02:04:51.031 --> 02:04:54.450
<v Speaker 2>or mean even dreams as far as like</v>
<v Speaker 2>community and family.</v>

2589
02:04:54.451 --> 02:04:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Like those aren't like lofty aspirations</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sent in the sense of like</v>

2590
02:04:58.770 --> 02:05:01.560
<v Speaker 2>unachievable things like climbing</v>
<v Speaker 2>everest in your underwear.</v>

2591
02:05:01.590 --> 02:05:05.880
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about things that can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>done but oftentimes aren't because you</v>

2592
02:05:05.881 --> 02:05:08.790
<v Speaker 2>don't pursue them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With that director of like my directive</v>

2593
02:05:08.791 --> 02:05:12.630
<v Speaker 2>to establish a happy family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a good friend,</v>

2594
02:05:12.631 --> 02:05:14.820
<v Speaker 2>to be a good neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to all these things,</v>

2595
02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:18.690
<v Speaker 2>people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You oftentimes don't consider how much</v>

2596
02:05:18.691 --> 02:05:22.620
<v Speaker 2>of a factor those things play in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>overall happiness and the happiness of</v>

2597
02:05:22.621 --> 02:05:24.240
<v Speaker 2>the people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2598
02:05:24.241 --> 02:05:26.910
<v Speaker 2>and you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you always have to think about it</v>

2599
02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:29.580
<v Speaker 3>earlier for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course your viewers don't know.</v>

2600
02:05:29.581 --> 02:05:32.310
<v Speaker 3>We I introduced you to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my friends was an FBI special</v>

2601
02:05:32.311 --> 02:05:35.520
<v Speaker 3>agent and we were chatting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been here for a few days,</v>

2602
02:05:35.521 --> 02:05:40.350
<v Speaker 3>so we had gone out together and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling him that oftentimes I get an</v>

2603
02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:44.790
<v Speaker 3>itch for like a man's man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>companionship.</v>

2604
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:45.860
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2605
02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Because I mean not not to stereotype,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes the intellectual types</v>

2606
02:05:51.150 --> 02:05:53.610
<v Speaker 3>with whom I can go out who are part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my world,</v>

2607
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:58.140
<v Speaker 3>who are my colleagues will will satisfy</v>
<v Speaker 3>a particular itch,</v>

2608
02:05:58.620 --> 02:06:00.920
<v Speaker 3>but of course I used to be a soccer</v>
<v Speaker 3>player and I'm,</v>

2609
02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:03.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm a guy's guy and I eat right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2610
02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:06.990
<v Speaker 3>we need to be able to talk about certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are not necessarily within</v>

2611
02:06:06.991 --> 02:06:11.580
<v Speaker 3>the confines need fellow sexist say it</v>
<v Speaker 3>fellow sexist,</v>

2612
02:06:11.581 --> 02:06:12.414
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2613
02:06:12.510 --> 02:06:16.040
<v Speaker 3>but fellow guys who can sort of let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let let the hair down.</v>

2614
02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're allowed to be yourself and,</v>

2615
02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:20.910
<v Speaker 3>and I mean not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that I'm not myself and the other</v>

2616
02:06:20.911 --> 02:06:23.340
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are different sort of rules of</v>

2617
02:06:23.341 --> 02:06:24.750
<v Speaker 3>conduct and different settings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2618
02:06:24.751 --> 02:06:27.300
<v Speaker 3>The way you act in way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2619
02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:32.220
<v Speaker 3>and I find that recently maybe because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course I think we both have young</v>

2620
02:06:32.221 --> 02:06:35.160
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you somewhat cocoon?</v>

2621
02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:40.880
<v Speaker 3>I've lost a bit of the male bonding and</v>
<v Speaker 3>comradery that comes with playing in a</v>

2622
02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:45.960
<v Speaker 3>soccer team or under many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many professional athletes as you know,</v>

2623
02:06:45.961 --> 02:06:49.380
<v Speaker 3>when they retire they will always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2624
02:06:49.381 --> 02:06:52.440
<v Speaker 3>they don't miss playing in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>100,000 people or the adulation,</v>

2625
02:06:52.441 --> 02:06:57.441
<v Speaker 3>but they miss the Camaraderie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Brotherhood would there and that,</v>

2626
02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:02.760
<v Speaker 3>that element of male male bonding is</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that sometimes I Miss Because</v>

2627
02:07:02.791 --> 02:07:04.530
<v Speaker 3>of how busy my life is.</v>

2628
02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree.</v>

2629
02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:11.060
<v Speaker 2>And I've found that the most potent form</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that is hunting camps.</v>

2630
02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hunting camps,</v>

2631
02:07:12.681 --> 02:07:15.520
<v Speaker 2>when you go hunting and camping out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a.</v>

2632
02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:18.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're focused on one thing and all</v>

2633
02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:22.760
<v Speaker 2>you're surrounded by these men and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is allowed to be themselves and</v>

2634
02:07:22.761 --> 02:07:23.720
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were also,</v>

2635
02:07:23.721 --> 02:07:28.010
<v Speaker 2>you were in engaging in this intensely</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote manly activity,</v>

2636
02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:30.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is almost the polar opposite of</v>

2637
02:07:30.711 --> 02:07:32.950
<v Speaker 2>raising children and coddling little</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls.</v>

2638
02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:37.060
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes this manly pursuit and it's</v>

2639
02:07:37.061 --> 02:07:38.530
<v Speaker 2>very satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2640
02:07:38.590 --> 02:07:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Deep genetic level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2641
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Because I think there's these reward</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems that are established thousands</v>

2642
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:46.350
<v Speaker 2>of years ago in our DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2643
02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:48.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like why you like being around a</v>
<v Speaker 2>campfire,</v>

2644
02:07:48.611 --> 02:07:50.950
<v Speaker 2>like why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's super beneficial to have a</v>

2645
02:07:50.951 --> 02:07:55.270
<v Speaker 2>fire wards off predators keeps you warm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it cooks you off the mosquitoes,</v>

2646
02:07:55.610 --> 02:07:58.090
<v Speaker 2>the mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many benefits to having this fire</v>

2647
02:07:58.330 --> 02:08:01.730
<v Speaker 2>that when you have one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like naturally satisfying.</v>

2648
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2649
02:08:02.290 --> 02:08:04.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all huddled around it and you know,</v>

2650
02:08:04.661 --> 02:08:06.310
<v Speaker 2>it's odd to leave it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2651
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:10.960
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that being around other men is</v>

2652
02:08:10.961 --> 02:08:13.570
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's oftentimes thought that these men</v>

2653
02:08:13.571 --> 02:08:17.230
<v Speaker 2>are going to get together and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>men things come back and be sexist,</v>

2654
02:08:17.290 --> 02:08:19.990
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gonna come back and ruin all this</v>

2655
02:08:19.991 --> 02:08:23.710
<v Speaker 2>progress that we've had and there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea that somehow or another that</v>

2656
02:08:23.711 --> 02:08:28.711
<v Speaker 2>manly is anti progressive and anti anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>equal anti equal rights and equal</v>

2657
02:08:31.331 --> 02:08:32.164
<v Speaker 2>values.</v>

2658
02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:36.750
<v Speaker 3>It's funny by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you ask a lot of women what</v>

2659
02:08:36.751 --> 02:08:41.751
<v Speaker 3>types of Ben they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will typically point to the male</v>

2660
02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:47.030
<v Speaker 3>archetype that is most viewed with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stain by the current wave of third wave</v>

2661
02:08:49.111 --> 02:08:49.944
<v Speaker 3>feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2662
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Talk to those women when they're being</v>
<v Speaker 3>honest and alone.</v>

2663
02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they got called out by.</v>

2664
02:08:56.020 --> 02:08:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2665
02:08:56.610 --> 02:08:58.530
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was wanting to communicating with the.</v>

2666
02:08:58.830 --> 02:09:01.200
<v Speaker 3>I think she was either Swedish or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Danish,</v>

2667
02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:04.860
<v Speaker 3>what she was saying that especially I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think she was Swedish where in Sweden</v>

2668
02:09:04.861 --> 02:09:09.300
<v Speaker 3>they had this sort of longstanding</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment where they try to remove</v>

2669
02:09:09.301 --> 02:09:10.670
<v Speaker 3>gender pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2670
02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's very bizarre people.</v>

2671
02:09:14.610 --> 02:09:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea is that they're trying to,</v>

2672
02:09:16.951 --> 02:09:21.951
<v Speaker 3>as much as they can remove any gender</v>
<v Speaker 3>markers in any setting.</v>

2673
02:09:24.090 --> 02:09:27.930
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is that we should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender neutral in every possible way.</v>

2674
02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a study on toy preferences</v>

2675
02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:31.740
<v Speaker 3>done in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2676
02:09:31.741 --> 02:09:32.150
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2677
02:09:32.150 --> 02:09:35.190
<v Speaker 3>the Mecca of gender neutrality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And guess what?</v>

2678
02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:40.130
<v Speaker 3>Little Boys and little girls gravitate</v>
<v Speaker 3>to exactly the same sex specific voices</v>

2679
02:09:40.140 --> 02:09:43.650
<v Speaker 3>everywhere else on earth core,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite 40 years of a social</v>

2680
02:09:43.651 --> 02:09:45.240
<v Speaker 3>engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't done anything,</v>

2681
02:09:45.630 --> 02:09:46.770
<v Speaker 3>but anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2682
02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:51.980
<v Speaker 3>so the men there have been so ravaged by</v>
<v Speaker 3>third wave feminism that,</v>

2683
02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:55.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there,</v>

2684
02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:57.900
<v Speaker 3>they have no testicles a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphorically,</v>

2685
02:09:57.901 --> 02:09:59.130
<v Speaker 3>not literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2686
02:09:59.310 --> 02:10:01.370
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we were chatting on it,</v>

2687
02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:01.921
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she,</v>

2688
02:10:01.921 --> 02:10:06.630
<v Speaker 3>and she was saying that she misses the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pursuit.</v>

2689
02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:09.540
<v Speaker 3>I eman courting her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2690
02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:13.820
<v Speaker 3>not sexually harassing her but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is a sense that happens.</v>

2691
02:10:13.890 --> 02:10:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually harassing</v>

2692
02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.450
<v Speaker 2>when you're not attracted to that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2693
02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:19.280
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2694
02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:21.290
<v Speaker 2>Because it's the right man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2695
02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Depp or something is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pursuing you.</v>

2696
02:10:24.890 --> 02:10:25.820
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hot.</v>

2697
02:10:26.210 --> 02:10:29.930
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if some fat slob with dirty breath is</v>

2698
02:10:29.931 --> 02:10:32.150
<v Speaker 2>pursuing you harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2699
02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's</v>

2700
02:10:34.650 --> 02:10:37.050
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes and so men have become so</v>
<v Speaker 3>tentative,</v>

2701
02:10:37.051 --> 02:10:40.280
<v Speaker 3>it apparently and sweetness that</v>
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes these women,</v>

2702
02:10:40.281 --> 02:10:41.770
<v Speaker 3>the reason why they like guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2703
02:10:41.810 --> 02:10:44.210
<v Speaker 3>sort of the stereotypical Italian guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they go,</v>

2704
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:46.900
<v Speaker 3>it's not only of course Italian guys on</v>
<v Speaker 3>average American,</v>

2705
02:10:46.910 --> 02:10:49.100
<v Speaker 3>very stylish and good looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's because the,</v>

2706
02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:54.290
<v Speaker 3>that political correctness that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>stifled natural dynamics between men and</v>

2707
02:10:54.291 --> 02:10:58.820
<v Speaker 3>women hasn't fully</v>
<v Speaker 3>permeated,</v>

2708
02:10:59.090 --> 02:11:01.640
<v Speaker 3>say Italian culture so that when women</v>
<v Speaker 3>pass by,</v>

2709
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:03.560
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want them to be cat calling</v>

2710
02:11:03.561 --> 02:11:05.000
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but guys will approach.</v>

2711
02:11:05.001 --> 02:11:08.180
<v Speaker 3>You guys will hit on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys will tell you you're beautiful.</v>

2712
02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:12.320
<v Speaker 3>And in the deep recesses of even the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most ardent feminist,</v>

2713
02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.160
<v Speaker 3>you like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2714
02:11:14.161 --> 02:11:16.460
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the natural dynamics of</v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women.</v>

2715
02:11:16.461 --> 02:11:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's so confusing now for anyone</v>

2716
02:11:19.311 --> 02:11:20.440
<v Speaker 3>because you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2717
02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:22.850
<v Speaker 3>if I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look good today at work,</v>

2718
02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:26.600
<v Speaker 3>is that sexual harassment or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should I only tell my male colleague</v>

2719
02:11:26.601 --> 02:11:28.870
<v Speaker 3>that he really looks good in this time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I shouldn't.</v>

2720
02:11:28.930 --> 02:11:29.421
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2721
02:11:29.421 --> 02:11:33.530
<v Speaker 3>the problem is if you are attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this man and he tells you you look good</v>

2722
02:11:33.531 --> 02:11:35.090
<v Speaker 3>and you say why thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

2723
02:11:35.091 --> 02:11:36.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to stick my dick in your mouth.</v>

2724
02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:37.393
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2725
02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:39.950
<v Speaker 3>you fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2726
02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:40.790
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

2727
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:44.930
<v Speaker 2>how far do people take it if it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender or a sexual neutral thing,</v>

2728
02:11:45.170 --> 02:11:46.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2729
02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:47.110
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2730
02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:48.830
<v Speaker 2>debra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look wonderful today.</v>

2731
02:11:48.831 --> 02:11:50.420
<v Speaker 2>I love your dress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look fantastic.</v>

2732
02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Well thank you Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

2733
02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:55.610
<v Speaker 2>he goes to work and you go to work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's happy and you are friends.</v>

2734
02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:58.550
<v Speaker 2>There's a neutrality of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>neutrality there,</v>

2735
02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:03.200
<v Speaker 2>but that's the platonic values that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would like to see in the</v>

2736
02:12:03.201 --> 02:12:04.760
<v Speaker 2>workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rarely exist.</v>

2737
02:12:04.761 --> 02:12:08.210
<v Speaker 2>There's always coveted sexual desires</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people,</v>

2738
02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:11.930
<v Speaker 2>their unrequited love and the affairs</v>
<v Speaker 2>that take place because people were</v>

2739
02:12:11.931 --> 02:12:14.960
<v Speaker 2>working together in these environments</v>
<v Speaker 2>for eight hours a day staring at each</v>

2740
02:12:14.961 --> 02:12:17.240
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's normal thoughts and ideas.</v>

2741
02:12:17.241 --> 02:12:18.630
<v Speaker 2>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an in.</v>

2742
02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:23.150
<v Speaker 2>It's an abnormal environment for men and</v>
<v Speaker 2>women to be in these,</v>

2743
02:12:23.151 --> 02:12:26.120
<v Speaker 2>in these workplaces and not have those</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>

2744
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:28.340
<v Speaker 2>That's abnormal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thoughts,</v>

2745
02:12:28.341 --> 02:12:31.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean Matt and managing those thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes incredibly tricky,</v>

2746
02:12:31.191 --> 02:12:36.191
<v Speaker 2>which is why you need to establish very</v>
<v Speaker 2>strict behavior and know laws and rules</v>

2747
02:12:37.341 --> 02:12:40.040
<v Speaker 2>and regulations in the workforce because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want women to have to deal</v>

2748
02:12:40.041 --> 02:12:41.720
<v Speaker 2>with bullshit or men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2749
02:12:41.721 --> 02:12:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I've had men that were in here.</v>

2750
02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I had a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amazing atheist was talking about</v>

2751
02:12:45.771 --> 02:12:50.480
<v Speaker 2>this woman that he had that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was his boss and he was getting</v>

2752
02:12:50.481 --> 02:12:52.970
<v Speaker 2>sexually harassed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on a daily basis and it was</v>

2753
02:12:52.971 --> 02:12:54.140
<v Speaker 2>torturous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was brutal.</v>

2754
02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:57.600
<v Speaker 2>She would grab his ass who tried to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>him to fuck her and he didn't want to.</v>

2755
02:12:57.601 --> 02:13:00.230
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't attracted to her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was an atheist.</v>

2756
02:13:00.231 --> 02:13:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Was the recipient of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2757
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:05.330
<v Speaker 2>He's a youtube guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to show the drunken</v>

2758
02:13:05.331 --> 02:13:06.164
<v Speaker 2>peasants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2759
02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:07.393
<v Speaker 2>Good Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2760
02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

2761
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:10.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about it from his</v>

2762
02:13:10.341 --> 02:13:15.020
<v Speaker 2>perspective where people don't look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it like that he was in any sort of a bad</v>

2763
02:13:15.021 --> 02:13:17.890
<v Speaker 2>situation at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They laugh it off because he's mad.</v>

2764
02:13:18.570 --> 02:13:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Know was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2765
02:13:19.941 --> 02:13:23.630
<v Speaker 2>So he's like psychologically devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to go to work all the time.</v>

2766
02:13:23.631 --> 02:13:25.760
<v Speaker 2>This lady's Greg grab his ass and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>gross.</v>

2767
02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:27.320
<v Speaker 2>She's above him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2768
02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:30.650
<v Speaker 2>And so he's experiencing what a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>women experienced.</v>

2769
02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Only no one</v>

2770
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.500
<v Speaker 3>cares because he's a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2771
02:13:34.530 --> 02:13:35.363
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2772
02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:38.520
<v Speaker 3>speaking of not sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but continuing on that train of thought,</v>

2773
02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:43.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a public exchange with a woman who</v>

2774
02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:47.250
<v Speaker 3>started as trying to pass a bill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in New Jersey.</v>

2775
02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe in New York.</v>

2776
02:13:49.021 --> 02:13:51.810
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the rape by fraud.</v>

2777
02:13:51.930 --> 02:13:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that.</v>

2778
02:13:52.801 --> 02:13:55.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen it through me or I've seen</v>

2779
02:13:55.291 --> 02:13:57.720
<v Speaker 3>that law that they're trying to pass</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole area.</v>

2780
02:13:57.721 --> 02:14:00.060
<v Speaker 3>So I explained the law because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2781
02:14:00.061 --> 02:14:02.790
<v Speaker 3>The basic idea is that she's arguing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when you,</v>

2782
02:14:02.970 --> 02:14:07.710
<v Speaker 3>in the same way that you enter a</v>
<v Speaker 3>contract with somebody and if you do so</v>

2783
02:14:07.711 --> 02:14:12.480
<v Speaker 3>under false pretense than you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>engaging in a fraudulent action.</v>

2784
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get somebody to go to bed with</v>

2785
02:14:15.631 --> 02:14:19.350
<v Speaker 3>you under false pretense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lie about your background,</v>

2786
02:14:19.351 --> 02:14:21.240
<v Speaker 3>your education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you learning about whatever,</v>

2787
02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:25.830
<v Speaker 3>and you get that person to acquiesce to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your advances.</v>

2788
02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:28.760
<v Speaker 3>And you have sex with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then that is a,</v>

2789
02:14:29.110 --> 02:14:31.680
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an instantiation of rape by fraud,</v>

2790
02:14:31.681 --> 02:14:32.181
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2791
02:14:32.181 --> 02:14:34.860
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were able to have sex with me under</v>

2792
02:14:34.861 --> 02:14:37.830
<v Speaker 3>false pretenses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I saw this thing.</v>

2793
02:14:37.831 --> 02:14:41.250
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was breathtaking how</v>
<v Speaker 3>idiotic it was.</v>

2794
02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:42.151
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2795
02:14:42.151 --> 02:14:45.030
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me put together a sad truth youtube</v>

2796
02:14:45.031 --> 02:14:47.880
<v Speaker 3>clip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the clip I didn't mention her.</v>

2797
02:14:47.881 --> 02:14:50.020
<v Speaker 3>I didn't attack the woman who's trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to move the,</v>

2798
02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:51.930
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea.</v>

2799
02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:57.300
<v Speaker 3>But of course I linked back to her site</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I want to be judicious and link</v>

2800
02:14:58.010 --> 02:14:59.970
<v Speaker 3>show that it's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real thing.</v>

2801
02:14:59.971 --> 02:15:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Show them as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

2802
02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:03.420
<v Speaker 3>as a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she,</v>

2803
02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:07.110
<v Speaker 3>she starts</v>
<v Speaker 3>hammering at me.</v>

2804
02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she puts up this website.</v>

2805
02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:13.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure she could probably find them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I shouldn't have given this</v>

2806
02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:15.410
<v Speaker 3>platform for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2807
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:18.330
<v Speaker 3>maybe you shouldn't put it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'll just get more attention.</v>

2808
02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:19.433
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

2809
02:15:19.530 --> 02:15:23.400
<v Speaker 3>she's saying that I am a rape by fraud</v>
<v Speaker 3>enabler.</v>

2810
02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:27.390
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she goes on to say that you</v>

2811
02:15:27.391 --> 02:15:32.391
<v Speaker 3>better stop critiquing my ideas because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have a lawsuit from my</v>

2812
02:15:32.671 --> 02:15:36.780
<v Speaker 3>lawyer for being live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the family story to me,</v>

2813
02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.980
<v Speaker 3>so the mindset of person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those words in roughly those words.</v>

2814
02:15:40.981 --> 02:15:42.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>critiquing,</v>

2815
02:15:43.590 --> 02:15:46.350
<v Speaker 3>so maybe I'm paraphrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mean the fact that I'm coming after</v>

2816
02:15:46.351 --> 02:15:50.430
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this woman thought that her putting</v>

2817
02:15:50.490 --> 02:15:55.490
<v Speaker 3>up an idea in the marketplace of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>and having somebody scrutinize that idea</v>

2818
02:15:57.090 --> 02:16:02.090
<v Speaker 3>and harassment is harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a form of defamation.</v>

2819
02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:06.810
<v Speaker 3>It being libelous and I thought that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>just breathtaking and I had two other</v>

2820
02:16:06.811 --> 02:16:10.950
<v Speaker 3>cases with two for both happen to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forbes journalist,</v>

2821
02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:14.910
<v Speaker 3>female journalists where we went back</v>
<v Speaker 3>and forth it very,</v>

2822
02:16:14.911 --> 02:16:17.340
<v Speaker 3>very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This integrated on on twitter.</v>

2823
02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:21.690
<v Speaker 3>They started doing this year cyber</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullying me when I had done no such</v>

2824
02:16:21.691 --> 02:16:22.321
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was very,</v>

2825
02:16:22.321 --> 02:16:25.590
<v Speaker 3>very tepid and so on and I used against</v>
<v Speaker 3>both of them.</v>

2826
02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people might have already heard</v>

2827
02:16:26.881 --> 02:16:29.170
<v Speaker 3>this story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use against both of them.</v>

2828
02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 3>The fact that I</v>

2829
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:35.070
<v Speaker 1>score higher on oppression Olympics or</v>
<v Speaker 1>victimology poker brown man from the</v>

2830
02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jus Arab,</v>

2831
02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:39.280
<v Speaker 1>overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I started moving on from</v>

2832
02:16:39.470 --> 02:16:41.490
<v Speaker 1>tell your story is a story that you told</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2833
02:16:41.491 --> 02:16:43.730
<v Speaker 1>This podcast that's about as presses</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2834
02:16:43.930 --> 02:16:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I turned it against them,</v>

2835
02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:48.220
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They disappeared.</v>

2836
02:16:48.430 --> 02:16:50.710
<v Speaker 1>So imagine how grotesque their mindset</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2837
02:16:50.711 --> 02:16:53.270
<v Speaker 1>As long as they thought they could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2838
02:16:53.290 --> 02:16:55.090
<v Speaker 1>you're a pig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're cyber bullying me.</v>

2839
02:16:55.091 --> 02:16:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they need eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2840
02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:58.880
<v Speaker 1>twitter things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2841
02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:01.300
<v Speaker 1>they felt safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second I started,</v>

2842
02:17:01.330 --> 02:17:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I actually was satirizing saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you attacking a brown man?</v>

2843
02:17:04.451 --> 02:17:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Why are you attacking me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because I'm overweight?</v>

2844
02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:11.551
<v Speaker 1>I have this beard faster than you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>say godfather because they knew that</v>

2845
02:17:13.061 --> 02:17:14.860
<v Speaker 1>they would be accused of Anti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2846
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:16.620
<v Speaker 1>you literally use those things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2847
02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:20.600
<v Speaker 1>you're an anti Semite you're in bureau</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2848
02:17:20.850 --> 02:17:21.700
<v Speaker 1>and it works.</v>

2849
02:17:21.970 --> 02:17:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It's magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so stupid.</v>

2850
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just engage me in ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>about identity politics?</v>

2851
02:17:29.530 --> 02:17:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some value in some merit</v>

2852
02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:37.840
<v Speaker 1>in the idea that you shouldn't be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lie to people and fuck them.</v>

2853
02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like if you say you're a prince</v>

2854
02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:45.130
<v Speaker 1>from another country and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take this person to your land and they</v>

2855
02:17:45.131 --> 02:17:49.000
<v Speaker 1>will live forever in a garden of Eden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this woman thinks,</v>

2856
02:17:49.001 --> 02:17:50.590
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met the perfect guy.</v>

2857
02:17:50.650 --> 02:17:52.270
<v Speaker 1>But it's not right by fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2858
02:17:52.271 --> 02:17:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

2859
02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:54.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually in my,</v>

2860
02:17:54.401 --> 02:17:57.790
<v Speaker 1>in my clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made it clear that I find that morally</v>

2861
02:17:57.791 --> 02:18:00.970
<v Speaker 1>and ethically reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that people should be</v>

2862
02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:04.780
<v Speaker 1>maximally honest in their daily affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2863
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:06.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't call it rape by fraud.</v>

2864
02:18:06.650 --> 02:18:08.410
<v Speaker 1>You're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not rape,</v>

2865
02:18:08.710 --> 02:18:10.360
<v Speaker 1>but what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duplicity.</v>

2866
02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:14.440
<v Speaker 1>It's caveat emptor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buyer beware,</v>

2867
02:18:14.530 --> 02:18:19.420
<v Speaker 1>but there's something that we value very</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely about intimacy.</v>

2868
02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who achieves intimacy through</v>

2869
02:18:22.811 --> 02:18:24.360
<v Speaker 1>false pretenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2870
02:18:24.361 --> 02:18:28.360
<v Speaker 1>it's different than someone that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2871
02:18:28.510 --> 02:18:30.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says they're going to pay for lunch.</v>

2872
02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Ninety years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to give you a million</v>

2873
02:18:33.490 --> 02:18:34.241
<v Speaker 1>dollars and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2874
02:18:34.241 --> 02:18:35.710
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2875
02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Ninety five percent of online dating</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be then rape.</v>

2876
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2877
02:18:41.711 --> 02:18:43.530
<v Speaker 1>It should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should it be all rape,</v>

2878
02:18:43.810 --> 02:18:46.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men Lie about their education,</v>

2879
02:18:46.841 --> 02:18:48.550
<v Speaker 1>about their income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their height.</v>

2880
02:18:48.551 --> 02:18:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Women lie about their age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about their weight.</v>

2881
02:18:51.130 --> 02:18:54.910
<v Speaker 1>They wear pushup bras at part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mating ritual as,</v>

2882
02:18:54.911 --> 02:18:58.300
<v Speaker 1>as the testable as it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people engage in deceptive</v>

2883
02:18:58.301 --> 02:19:01.620
<v Speaker 1>signaling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals evolve deceptive signals.</v>

2884
02:19:01.650 --> 02:19:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2885
02:19:02.470 --> 02:19:05.560
<v Speaker 1>so that's called everybody a rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody is a rapist.</v>

2886
02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under that you're getting real extreme</v>

2887
02:19:08.910 --> 02:19:11.830
<v Speaker 1>because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about like what kind of</v>

2888
02:19:11.831 --> 02:19:15.100
<v Speaker 1>lies are we talking about where it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be raped by fraud?</v>

2889
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Like is it established?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have certain parameters that</v>

2890
02:19:18.371 --> 02:19:20.200
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know that achieved that.</v>

2891
02:19:20.210 --> 02:19:21.370
<v Speaker 1>This terminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boundaries.</v>

2892
02:19:21.460 --> 02:19:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I think in her case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that she has experienced</v>

2893
02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:30.300
<v Speaker 1>a very bad deception where the guy whom</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

2894
02:19:30.301 --> 02:19:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she married him or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2895
02:19:32.121 --> 02:19:35.210
<v Speaker 1>had said that he was ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turned out to not be true.</v>

2896
02:19:35.211 --> 02:19:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And he had maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2897
02:19:37.071 --> 02:19:39.050
<v Speaker 1>it's dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>

2898
02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:41.240
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called life.</v>

2899
02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn from that.</v>

2900
02:19:43.311 --> 02:19:44.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean that happened to Cindy</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

2901
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Cindy Crawford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christie Brinkley,</v>

2902
02:19:47.210 --> 02:19:49.880
<v Speaker 1>she married some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was in a helicopter crash with,</v>

2903
02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:54.380
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be kind of a con man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as time went on she realized it and</v>

2904
02:19:54.381 --> 02:19:55.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across to a lot of money.</v>

2905
02:19:55.580 --> 02:19:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A woman who fakes an orgasm with you is</v>

2906
02:19:59.301 --> 02:20:04.100
<v Speaker 1>raping you because the next time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next time that you have sex with her</v>

2907
02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:07.940
<v Speaker 1>under the false pretense that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>received positive feedback that you're a</v>

2908
02:20:07.941 --> 02:20:10.640
<v Speaker 1>great lover because you gave her an</v>
<v Speaker 1>orgasm,</v>

2909
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:12.320
<v Speaker 1>but she was faking her orgasm.</v>

2910
02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:15.830
<v Speaker 1>She's raping me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's ridiculous.</v>

2911
02:20:17.390 --> 02:20:21.860
<v Speaker 1>So far off the beaten path because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman is saying like,</v>

2912
02:20:21.861 --> 02:20:23.470
<v Speaker 1>you gave her pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's.</v>

2913
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:27.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no loss to you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hurt you in any way.</v>

2914
02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Like if that woman said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made me come so because he made me</v>

2915
02:20:31.131 --> 02:20:32.900
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you a million dollars</v>

2916
02:20:33.050 --> 02:20:34.940
<v Speaker 1>and then you can quit your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you quit your job.</v>

2917
02:20:34.941 --> 02:20:36.560
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the best pussy eater ever.</v>

2918
02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:39.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get paid for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you quit your job because of that,</v>

2919
02:20:39.201 --> 02:20:41.430
<v Speaker 1>and then it turns out that she doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have a million dollars and you'd</v>

2920
02:20:41.450 --> 02:20:45.260
<v Speaker 1>even make her have an orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you fucked up.</v>

2921
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:47.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason I wanted to have sex</v>

2922
02:20:47.001 --> 02:20:52.001
<v Speaker 1>with her again is because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback I received for the great love</v>

2923
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:57.080
<v Speaker 1>of your own pleasures of secondary</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature come out on the secondary.</v>

2924
02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very giving guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely all justice.</v>

2925
02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Such as stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should abandon it immediately is a</v>

2926
02:21:02.331 --> 02:21:04.640
<v Speaker 1>terrible argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think there is,</v>

2927
02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:08.510
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of validity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what this woman saying like as far as</v>

2928
02:21:08.511 --> 02:21:11.810
<v Speaker 1>like someone who was like very</v>
<v Speaker 1>deceptive,</v>

2929
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:15.260
<v Speaker 1>who uses that deception to have sex with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you find out they're a liar.</v>

2930
02:21:15.380 --> 02:21:16.850
<v Speaker 1>That feels terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2931
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:19.730
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what should it be like,</v>

2932
02:21:19.731 --> 02:21:21.900
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2933
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:22.510
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2934
02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:25.220
<v Speaker 1>what would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could it be mean if a guy says he's</v>

2935
02:21:25.221 --> 02:21:27.450
<v Speaker 1>a one eighth Indian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2936
02:21:27.470 --> 02:21:27.840
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2937
02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:30.170
<v Speaker 1>my mom's a patchy on my grandfather's</v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

2938
02:21:30.171 --> 02:21:31.810
<v Speaker 1>no end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all bullshit when you're</v>

2939
02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:34.650
<v Speaker 1>attracted to that and some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange way because you really like a</v>

2940
02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:36.260
<v Speaker 1>dream catchers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2941
02:21:36.261 --> 02:21:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to be with a native</v>
<v Speaker 1>American and then you find out the guys</v>

2942
02:21:39.021 --> 02:21:41.300
<v Speaker 1>really like German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish and you know,</v>

2943
02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:42.140
<v Speaker 1>he's a liar.</v>

2944
02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Like is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

2945
02:21:44.390 --> 02:21:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Of course not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2946
02:21:46.011 --> 02:21:47.660
<v Speaker 1>So what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a liar.</v>

2947
02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:49.880
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when life,</v>

2948
02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:51.400
<v Speaker 1>when is it a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2949
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:54.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone does it in somehow or</v>

2950
02:21:54.591 --> 02:21:58.000
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it harms the person who's been deceived.</v>

2951
02:21:58.001 --> 02:21:59.450
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2952
02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:01.610
<v Speaker 1>I think if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know,</v>

2953
02:22:01.611 --> 02:22:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to think about what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parameters are,</v>

2954
02:22:03.141 --> 02:22:04.670
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2955
02:22:04.730 --> 02:22:08.480
<v Speaker 1>if you were engaging in a repeat</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction where you defrauded the</v>

2956
02:22:08.481 --> 02:22:13.481
<v Speaker 1>person through a misrepresentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the idea that to get somebody</v>

2957
02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:19.300
<v Speaker 1>to date you or have sex with you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the pursuit of that objective,</v>

2958
02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:21.950
<v Speaker 1>July as reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be clear.</v>

2959
02:22:21.951 --> 02:22:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reprehensible and I certainly don't</v>

2960
02:22:24.201 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 1>live my life that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm married</v>

2961
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:28.170
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never have lived my life that way.</v>

2962
02:22:28.410 --> 02:22:33.410
<v Speaker 2>You can't criminalize a central feature</v>
<v Speaker 2>of human nature.</v>

2963
02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:37.530
<v Speaker 2>It is incumbent of on each individual to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do their homework.</v>

2964
02:22:37.531 --> 02:22:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean you do your due diligence and</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out if the guy that you're speaking</v>

2965
02:22:41.101 --> 02:22:42.510
<v Speaker 2>to is a Nigerian prince.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2966
02:22:42.511 --> 02:22:47.511
<v Speaker 2>but doesn't this woman have a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly fairly cut and dry parameters</v>

2967
02:22:47.851 --> 02:22:49.290
<v Speaker 2>that she's establishing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2968
02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know why.</v>

2969
02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she did,</v>

2970
02:22:52.201 --> 02:22:54.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe that would give it more validity</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something that she's been thinking</v>

2971
02:22:54.661 --> 02:22:57.780
<v Speaker 2>about for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can never imagine that it would</v>

2972
02:22:57.781 --> 02:23:01.890
<v Speaker 2>ever be able to meet the standards of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>being called rape.</v>

2973
02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:03.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting about this</v>

2974
02:23:03.121 --> 02:23:07.320
<v Speaker 2>conversation is that what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about as a person who's been fucked over</v>

2975
02:23:07.380 --> 02:23:10.890
<v Speaker 2>and that person has gone out of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to make sure this never happens</v>

2976
02:23:10.891 --> 02:23:13.160
<v Speaker 2>again because they've been hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been tortured.</v>

2977
02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I think you see a lot of that with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>really radical feminism in general.</v>

2978
02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:23.670
<v Speaker 2>What you see is a lot of women who their</v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions with men have not been</v>

2979
02:23:23.671 --> 02:23:28.671
<v Speaker 2>positive and unfortunately the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotype is that these are very</v>

2980
02:23:28.831 --> 02:23:30.450
<v Speaker 2>unattractive women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2981
02:23:30.451 --> 02:23:34.770
<v Speaker 2>if you're a very unattractive woman and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go through life just being rejected</v>

2982
02:23:34.771 --> 02:23:37.440
<v Speaker 2>by man or being treated like shit by</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

2983
02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:42.070
<v Speaker 2>there's like a natural tendency to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that men are terrible because they've</v>

2984
02:23:42.071 --> 02:23:44.100
<v Speaker 2>rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe you're attracted to a man and</v>

2985
02:23:44.101 --> 02:23:46.380
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He laughed at you and mocks you.</v>

2986
02:23:46.940 --> 02:23:49.390
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that on the male side too,</v>

2987
02:23:49.770 --> 02:23:54.060
<v Speaker 2>and with a close friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend that I watched him evolve</v>

2988
02:23:54.061 --> 02:23:57.660
<v Speaker 2>into a woman hater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had aspirations and hopes,</v>

2989
02:23:57.661 --> 02:24:00.840
<v Speaker 2>find a good girl and he had this one</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl he was dating and she fucked him</v>

2990
02:24:00.841 --> 02:24:04.330
<v Speaker 2>over and then another girl fucked them</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and just women I'm working at</v>

2991
02:24:04.331 --> 02:24:08.850
<v Speaker 2>attracted to him and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just got darker and darker as he got</v>

2992
02:24:08.851 --> 02:24:13.260
<v Speaker 2>older and older to the point where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely would say like,</v>

2993
02:24:13.650 --> 02:24:16.770
<v Speaker 2>just generalized terrible things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>women like women.</v>

2994
02:24:16.770 --> 02:24:18.570
<v Speaker 2>They're all fucking Horace Mann.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all just want your money.</v>

2995
02:24:18.571 --> 02:24:19.950
<v Speaker 2>They're all fucking pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck them.</v>

2996
02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Who gives a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope they get raped.</v>

2997
02:24:21.630 --> 02:24:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Like you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy shit like that.</v>

2998
02:24:23.101 --> 02:24:24.510
<v Speaker 2>And you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2999
02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Like where did this come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3000
02:24:26.131 --> 02:24:30.270
<v Speaker 2>it came from a lifetime of rejection and</v>
<v Speaker 2>associating women with a negative</v>

3001
02:24:30.271 --> 02:24:31.020
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3002
02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:32.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm attracted to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come up to them,</v>

3003
02:24:32.731 --> 02:24:34.530
<v Speaker 2>they shit on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm attracted to them.</v>

3004
02:24:34.531 --> 02:24:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I come up to them to shit on me over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again to the point where</v>

3005
02:24:36.961 --> 02:24:38.090
<v Speaker 2>he broke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3006
02:24:38.130 --> 02:24:40.620
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was easier for him to form these</v>

3007
02:24:40.621 --> 02:24:45.600
<v Speaker 2>generalizations and the act on these or</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have these in his mindset and I think</v>

3008
02:24:45.601 --> 02:24:50.450
<v Speaker 2>that this is the unfortunate reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>about sexual attraction in,</v>

3009
02:24:50.490 --> 02:24:54.630
<v Speaker 2>as it pertains to the dynamics of men</v>
<v Speaker 2>and women interacting with each other.</v>

3010
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:59.470
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot going on there when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at unattractive of feminist versus</v>

3011
02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:00.810
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again,</v>

3012
02:25:00.811 --> 02:25:02.490
<v Speaker 2>you see one after the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the other.</v>

3013
02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:03.870
<v Speaker 2>How do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a study that was done,</v>

3014
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:06.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think published in frontiers in human</v>

3015
02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:12.140
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience where they measured that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ratio and administered a scale of</v>

3016
02:25:13.430 --> 02:25:14.520
<v Speaker 2>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3017
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:16.320
<v Speaker 2>how much you score and masculinity</v>
<v Speaker 2>femininity,</v>

3018
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:19.590
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or dominance or something at a feminist</v>

3019
02:25:19.591 --> 02:25:24.310
<v Speaker 2>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the women were more masculinized at</v>

3020
02:25:24.311 --> 02:25:27.940
<v Speaker 2>that conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is empirical evidence for sort</v>

3021
02:25:27.941 --> 02:25:31.720
<v Speaker 2>of your anecdotal intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

3022
02:25:31.721 --> 02:25:34.210
<v Speaker 2>And also women that are forced to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3023
02:25:34.211 --> 02:25:35.320
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've found that women in the</v>

3024
02:25:35.321 --> 02:25:37.720
<v Speaker 2>workplace generally develop more</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone,</v>

3025
02:25:38.050 --> 02:25:38.831
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3026
02:25:38.831 --> 02:25:40.480
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women that are forced to fend for</v>

3027
02:25:40.481 --> 02:25:42.790
<v Speaker 2>themselves generally develop more</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>

3028
02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:46.410
<v Speaker 2>It it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it literally alters the way their</v>

3029
02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:49.750
<v Speaker 2>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not that depending on the fields</v>

3030
02:25:49.751 --> 02:25:52.590
<v Speaker 2>that they go into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start off with more or less to</v>

3031
02:25:52.591 --> 02:25:53.424
<v Speaker 2>start strong.</v>

3032
02:25:53.470 --> 02:25:55.330
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying that it's their</v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

3033
02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:59.440
<v Speaker 2>They're saying that they believe it is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>response to women being independent and</v>

3034
02:25:59.441 --> 02:26:02.830
<v Speaker 2>being forced to provide for themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they develop more testosterone.</v>

3035
02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:04.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck they prove</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3036
02:26:04.421 --> 02:26:07.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how he likes to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is you would have to have</v>

3037
02:26:07.031 --> 02:26:10.300
<v Speaker 2>the exact same person with the exact</v>
<v Speaker 2>same genetics take two completely</v>

3038
02:26:10.301 --> 02:26:12.910
<v Speaker 2>different paths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'd have to do with identical twins</v>

3039
02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:15.910
<v Speaker 2>with very similar input,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3040
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Because like your jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what's going on,</v>

3041
02:26:18.791 --> 02:26:21.310
<v Speaker 2>the way they express themselves is</v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent upon your environment,</v>

3042
02:26:21.311 --> 02:26:24.870
<v Speaker 2>your experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot going on that simple.</v>

3043
02:26:25.530 --> 02:26:26.363
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3044
02:26:26.420 --> 02:26:30.520
<v Speaker 2>I think my last set truth clip was on</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly that where I was arguing that</v>

3045
02:26:30.521 --> 02:26:34.300
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea of biological determinism</v>
<v Speaker 2>as applied to evolutionary psychology is</v>

3046
02:26:34.301 --> 02:26:37.120
<v Speaker 2>complete nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the examples that I give is</v>

3047
02:26:37.121 --> 02:26:41.920
<v Speaker 2>exactly the words that you use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that genes are turned on or off</v>

3048
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:44.440
<v Speaker 2>as a function of environmental inputs.</v>

3049
02:26:44.570 --> 02:26:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3050
02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:47.540
<v Speaker 2>so the idea when people levy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

3051
02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an evolutionary psychologist.</v>

3052
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe everything is biologically</v>

3053
02:26:50.711 --> 02:26:53.350
<v Speaker 2>determined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody who says that is effectively</v>

3054
02:26:53.351 --> 02:26:56.080
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand nothing about biology,</v>

3055
02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:57.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3056
02:26:57.850 --> 02:27:01.480
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very complex and only being</v>

3057
02:27:01.481 --> 02:27:04.540
<v Speaker 2>recently understood within the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of decades.</v>

3058
02:27:04.810 --> 02:27:08.950
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about a fairly new</v>
<v Speaker 2>science that is,</v>

3059
02:27:08.951 --> 02:27:12.820
<v Speaker 2>or a fairly new data I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people just haven't</v>

3060
02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:16.360
<v Speaker 2>accepted yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very convenient to generalize</v>

3061
02:27:16.361 --> 02:27:21.361
<v Speaker 2>instead to not taking into account all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these incredibly complex variables that</v>

3062
02:27:22.451 --> 02:27:26.110
<v Speaker 2>determine whether a human being is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>way or that way,</v>

3063
02:27:26.111 --> 02:27:28.720
<v Speaker 2>whether they're more masculine and more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3064
02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:30.140
<v Speaker 2>what have you had to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3065
02:27:30.170 --> 02:27:34.780
<v Speaker 2>How have you had to fend for yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you had to get through life?</v>

3066
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.620
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3067
02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:37.270
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what have you had to do as far as like</v>

3068
02:27:37.271 --> 02:27:38.860
<v Speaker 2>who have you had to nurture and take</v>
<v Speaker 2>care of?</v>

3069
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:42.160
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of variables that lead to</v>

3070
02:27:42.161 --> 02:27:46.180
<v Speaker 2>a person being a person and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of different styles of people and</v>

3071
02:27:46.181 --> 02:27:50.500
<v Speaker 2>some men like really strong dominant</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother figure wives.</v>

3072
02:27:50.530 --> 02:27:52.090
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they want.</v>

3073
02:27:52.091 --> 02:27:54.580
<v Speaker 2>They want some woman to take care of</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and tell them what to do.</v>

3074
02:27:54.850 --> 02:27:57.580
<v Speaker 2>I have friends like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want that woman to yell at them and</v>

3075
02:27:57.581 --> 02:28:01.300
<v Speaker 2>tell them what to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It alleviates a lot of questions and</v>

3076
02:28:01.301 --> 02:28:04.780
<v Speaker 2>choices and that's what they look</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward to and then I have other friends</v>

3077
02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:08.450
<v Speaker 2>that want the wife to be like some 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties housewife from a,</v>

3078
02:28:08.530 --> 02:28:11.260
<v Speaker 2>from a movie where she was just leave it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to beaver.</v>

3079
02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:13.240
<v Speaker 2>You come home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner's on the table,</v>

3080
02:28:13.241 --> 02:28:17.830
<v Speaker 2>she gives you a kiss and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like real traditional values,</v>

3081
02:28:18.010 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 2>but there's feminists that we'll look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that woman and she's an enemy</v>

3082
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:23.570
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her life,</v>

3083
02:28:23.630 --> 02:28:25.850
<v Speaker 1>although it makes her happy to exist in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way,</v>

3084
02:28:25.851 --> 02:28:30.030
<v Speaker 1>they have a really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cooperative relationship,</v>

3085
02:28:30.090 --> 02:28:33.350
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have the right to that choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Amanda's never have the right to be</v>

3086
02:28:33.351 --> 02:28:35.570
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men Don't have a right to go on these</v>

3087
02:28:35.571 --> 02:28:36.530
<v Speaker 1>hunting camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3088
02:28:36.531 --> 02:28:38.930
<v Speaker 1>you should only eat vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be a Vegan,</v>

3089
02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in doing so you definitely</v>

3090
02:28:41.151 --> 02:28:43.610
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be a hunter and you definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be involved in masculine</v>

3091
02:28:43.611 --> 02:28:46.100
<v Speaker 1>sports or activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely shouldn't enjoy</v>

3092
02:28:46.130 --> 02:28:49.820
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting or anything that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make you more men because it'll make</v>

3093
02:28:49.821 --> 02:28:52.550
<v Speaker 1>you toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a toxic masculinity.</v>

3094
02:28:52.551 --> 02:28:55.440
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we want to talk about quickly or.</v>

3095
02:28:56.010 --> 02:29:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that familiar with her other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I've seen a couple of her videos</v>

3096
02:29:00.921 --> 02:29:04.820
<v Speaker 1>about video games and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've also seen thunder foot stuff</v>

3097
02:29:04.821 --> 02:29:06.230
<v Speaker 1>on her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting.</v>

3098
02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Which explains that she had this</v>
<v Speaker 1>background in marketing and mass</v>

3099
02:29:09.651 --> 02:29:13.370
<v Speaker 1>marketing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is obviously whether or not she's</v>

3100
02:29:13.430 --> 02:29:17.810
<v Speaker 1>entirely invested in these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's obviously aware that she's</v>

3101
02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:23.030
<v Speaker 1>marketing her ideas towards a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific group and she's got these Beta</v>

3102
02:29:23.031 --> 02:29:27.800
<v Speaker 1>males that cling to her and are attached</v>
<v Speaker 1>to which are hilarious human beings.</v>

3103
02:29:27.801 --> 02:29:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard my theory about the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a real top secret fucker</v>

3104
02:29:31.550 --> 02:29:32.660
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

3105
02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Sneaker fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sneaker fuckers.</v>

3106
02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:37.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait.</v>

3107
02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:39.230
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3108
02:29:39.231 --> 02:29:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if it was a term that was</v>

3109
02:29:41.421 --> 02:29:43.760
<v Speaker 1>introduced by Richard Dawkins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember who it was,</v>

3110
02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:47.730
<v Speaker 1>but he called it speak if Dawkins called</v>
<v Speaker 1>misspeaking.</v>

3111
02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Jamie can pull it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

3112
02:29:50.330 --> 02:29:55.330
<v Speaker 1>it basically refers to some species</v>
<v Speaker 1>where males come in different</v>

3113
02:29:56.361 --> 02:29:57.500
<v Speaker 1>phenotypes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

3114
02:29:57.560 --> 02:29:59.960
<v Speaker 1>different physical manifestations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there might be,</v>

3115
02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.500
<v Speaker 1>say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that type of fish species where the</v>

3116
02:30:03.501 --> 02:30:06.200
<v Speaker 1>typical male is a whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big big phenotype,</v>

3117
02:30:06.201 --> 02:30:07.034
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>

3118
02:30:07.100 --> 02:30:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Then there are other males that mimic</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenotype of females,</v>

3119
02:30:12.470 --> 02:30:17.470
<v Speaker 1>so when the male standing around looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect his area that that male who</v>

3120
02:30:18.531 --> 02:30:23.531
<v Speaker 1>looks like a female will sneak in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then get some quick calculations with</v>

3121
02:30:23.991 --> 02:30:27.130
<v Speaker 1>some of the females that otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be inaccessible to him and that</v>

3122
02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:32.190
<v Speaker 1>became known as a sneaker fuckers</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy in zoology and I argue I</v>

3123
02:30:33.441 --> 02:30:35.230
<v Speaker 1>haven't tested it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it it,</v>

3124
02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:36.020
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

3125
02:30:36.020 --> 02:30:39.410
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be interesting to do so that</v>

3126
02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:42.230
<v Speaker 1>some of these sort of social justice</v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior,</v>

3127
02:30:42.231 --> 02:30:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Beta males are engaging in a form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sneaker fuckers strategies.</v>

3128
02:30:45.980 --> 02:30:47.390
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent,</v>

3129
02:30:48.200 --> 02:30:49.580
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt.</v>

3130
02:30:49.610 --> 02:30:51.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do what you gotta do it.</v>

3131
02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:54.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a desperation involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you can't be,</v>

3132
02:30:55.010 --> 02:30:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful Stud Mail that all these</v>

3133
02:30:58.161 --> 02:31:02.720
<v Speaker 1>women falling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too short and too short.</v>

3134
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not existent and give me a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3135
02:31:05.091 --> 02:31:05.930
<v Speaker 1>you're shorter than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

3136
02:31:05.931 --> 02:31:07.610
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking know I'm finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

3137
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:11.120
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is research that shows this study.</v>

3138
02:31:11.690 --> 02:31:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Get ready defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3139
02:31:13.330 --> 02:31:14.480
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're ready.</v>

3140
02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:15.980
<v Speaker 1>You're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3141
02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:20.820
<v Speaker 1>So you bring in a guy to a room and only</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you manipulate is the</v>

3142
02:31:20.821 --> 02:31:23.310
<v Speaker 1>ascribed status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>academic status that you give to a guy.</v>

3143
02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:26.220
<v Speaker 1>He comes into a room and in one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one version of the experiment,</v>

3144
02:31:26.221 --> 02:31:28.800
<v Speaker 1>he's a assistant professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the second version,</v>

3145
02:31:28.801 --> 02:31:30.690
<v Speaker 1>he's an associate professor of the third</v>
<v Speaker 1>version.</v>

3146
02:31:30.691 --> 02:31:35.220
<v Speaker 1>He's a famous world famous professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when he steps out,</v>

3147
02:31:35.550 --> 02:31:40.470
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that you test is people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of his height.</v>

3148
02:31:41.070 --> 02:31:46.070
<v Speaker 1>His height magically becomes taller as</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ascribed academic status goes up.</v>

3149
02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:51.070
<v Speaker 1>And so I always joke that I may be only</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my phone,</v>

3150
02:31:51.620 --> 02:31:54.540
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you I'm seven foot four</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

3151
02:31:55.410 --> 02:31:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hurtful.</v>

3152
02:31:58.740 --> 02:31:59.371
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

3153
02:31:59.371 --> 02:32:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I feel safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel very uncomfortable.</v>

3154
02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a really good day where the Harris</v>

3155
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Spike five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>600 actually.</v>

3156
02:32:10.130 --> 02:32:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Somebody really good data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a photo.</v>

3157
02:32:12.931 --> 02:32:15.660
<v Speaker 1>You'd measure that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a photo yesterday with Dave</v>

3158
02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Rubin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did his show and so on.</v>

3159
02:32:17.280 --> 02:32:18.360
<v Speaker 1>And somebody wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3160
02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:21.030
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned something new.</v>

3161
02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I thought the Godfather was much taller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gotta wear stilts.</v>

3162
02:32:24.970 --> 02:32:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I got to wear stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to wear the Rubio heels.</v>

3163
02:32:27.091 --> 02:32:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a Rubio Hill?</v>

3164
02:32:29.090 --> 02:32:29.923
<v Speaker 1>Rubio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3165
02:32:29.950 --> 02:32:32.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presidential candidate has wasn't</v>

3166
02:32:32.481 --> 02:32:34.980
<v Speaker 1>he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't there a rumor that he was patting</v>

3167
02:32:34.981 --> 02:32:37.270
<v Speaker 1>his heels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make himself real?</v>

3168
02:32:37.350 --> 02:32:38.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'd heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3169
02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about political circles</v>

3170
02:32:42.270 --> 02:32:44.910
<v Speaker 1>and what kind of manipulation matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3171
02:32:44.911 --> 02:32:48.990
<v Speaker 1>There's so much manipulation going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>there with image and even so many</v>

3172
02:32:48.991 --> 02:32:50.160
<v Speaker 1>different consultants.</v>

3173
02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have that on television</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

3174
02:32:51.841 --> 02:32:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine what it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

3175
02:32:53.250 --> 02:32:53.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

3176
02:32:53.731 --> 02:32:56.850
<v Speaker 1>when George Bush was debating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was carrie,</v>

3177
02:32:56.851 --> 02:32:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember which one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3178
02:32:58.610 --> 02:33:01.170
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his camp had to come up with all sorts</v>

3179
02:33:01.171 --> 02:33:04.110
<v Speaker 1>of rules of what kind of camera shots</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do and so on,</v>

3180
02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:09.320
<v Speaker 1>so that he doesn't look at his heels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it beautiful how everything I say</v>

3181
02:33:10.201 --> 02:33:13.650
<v Speaker 1>is validated by Jamie Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's believable.</v>

3182
02:33:13.950 --> 02:33:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Fucking four inch heels on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Jamie.</v>

3183
02:33:16.261 --> 02:33:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I should have him around everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I'm in class I say something</v>

3184
02:33:19.561 --> 02:33:21.450
<v Speaker 1>and he just pops this stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:41.290
<v Speaker 2>incredible athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know what his name was.</v>

3223
02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you should.</v>

3226
02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:48.940
<v Speaker 2>You should show his wife at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure she's not as fuck.</v>

3227
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.990
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't show it.</v>

3228
02:34:50.410 --> 02:34:52.440
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>

3229
02:34:52.810 --> 02:34:54.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this guy running for president as</v>

3230
02:34:54.521 --> 02:34:57.700
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she's as Christ the guy's boring.</v>

3231
02:34:57.880 --> 02:34:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a leader.</v>

3232
02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:00.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jeb Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeb Bush,</v>

3233
02:35:00.761 --> 02:35:03.130
<v Speaker 2>not a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you had to back out of it.</v>

3234
02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:05.680
<v Speaker 2>You know Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a leader.</v>

3235
02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:06.151
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3236
02:35:06.151 --> 02:35:09.070
<v Speaker 2>they're hanging their hat on this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that most people see right through</v>

3237
02:35:09.071 --> 02:35:11.110
<v Speaker 2>because there's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

3238
02:35:11.111 --> 02:35:13.750
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing that happens when you</v>

3239
02:35:13.751 --> 02:35:17.260
<v Speaker 2>talk to that guy where his intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Ted Cruz,</v>

3240
02:35:17.550 --> 02:35:20.130
<v Speaker 2>like maybe he's intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybes I don't,</v>

3241
02:35:20.131 --> 02:35:23.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly went to Harvard supposedly is</v>

3242
02:35:23.201 --> 02:35:25.450
<v Speaker 2>very wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way he talks,</v>

3243
02:35:25.451 --> 02:35:29.740
<v Speaker 2>the way he establishes himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he communicates is not enough.</v>

3244
02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:32.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not enough to run the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all recognize it.</v>

3245
02:35:33.260 --> 02:35:34.250
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>

3246
02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:39.070
<v Speaker 2>He's not powerful enough in his ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie sanders might be a crazy old</v>

3247
02:35:39.071 --> 02:35:40.360
<v Speaker 2>socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be,</v>

3248
02:35:40.510 --> 02:35:44.980
<v Speaker 2>but when that guy speaks with passion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I buy it,</v>

3249
02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:47.650
<v Speaker 2>you buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exude a wind penis.</v>

3250
02:35:47.710 --> 02:35:48.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't exude a wimp.</v>

3251
02:35:48.881 --> 02:35:51.610
<v Speaker 2>He's got terrible posture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got terrible posture,</v>

3252
02:35:52.260 --> 02:35:56.230
<v Speaker 2>he looks very unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's willing to stand up for his</v>

3253
02:35:56.231 --> 02:36:00.250
<v Speaker 2>beliefs and he speaks with clarity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he speaks with a certain amount of</v>

3254
02:36:00.251 --> 02:36:01.084
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

3255
02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:03.100
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

3256
02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's the king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3257
02:36:05.171 --> 02:36:07.960
<v Speaker 2>but I think we live in a time where only</v>
<v Speaker 2>assholes want to be president.</v>

3258
02:36:08.370 --> 02:36:09.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look this,</v>

3259
02:36:09.731 --> 02:36:12.010
<v Speaker 2>this president thing is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>last.</v>

3260
02:36:12.370 --> 02:36:13.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to last.</v>

3261
02:36:13.870 --> 02:36:15.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like fucking,</v>

3262
02:36:15.341 --> 02:36:18.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like a Morse code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we need something better.</v>

3263
02:36:18.390 --> 02:36:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Like this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we have Morse code and we also</v>

3264
02:36:21.761 --> 02:36:22.571
<v Speaker 2>have cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3265
02:36:22.571 --> 02:36:24.490
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna use fucking Morse code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's goofy.</v>

3266
02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:28.720
<v Speaker 2>And this Internet thing that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>created this way of establishing</v>

3267
02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:33.430
<v Speaker 2>information or expressing information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is so far superior to anything that</v>

3268
02:36:33.431 --> 02:36:36.790
<v Speaker 2>existed back when they invented the</v>
<v Speaker 2>electoral college or representative</v>

3269
02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:39.590
<v Speaker 2>government that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that voting and,</v>

3270
02:36:39.610 --> 02:36:42.070
<v Speaker 2>and having a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one single hire,</v>

3271
02:36:42.071 --> 02:36:44.080
<v Speaker 2>primate leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one singer,</v>

3272
02:36:44.140 --> 02:36:46.720
<v Speaker 2>single top eight that runs all the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>apes.</v>

3273
02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:47.793
<v Speaker 2>It's dumb.</v>

3274
02:36:48.250 --> 02:36:50.560
<v Speaker 2>It's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't one person being president.</v>

3275
02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:54.160
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking really stupid idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't make any sense,</v>

3276
02:36:54.161 --> 02:36:56.890
<v Speaker 2>but who makes the decisions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be a lot of people should be</v>

3277
02:36:56.891 --> 02:36:59.890
<v Speaker 2>a gigantic council of really intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 2>governance.</v>

3278
02:36:59.950 --> 02:37:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

3279
02:37:01.211 --> 02:37:02.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it is already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is already.</v>

3280
02:37:02.981 --> 02:37:04.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a figurehead more than it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

3281
02:37:04.810 --> 02:37:09.310
<v Speaker 2>If that doesn't explain why Obama</v>
<v Speaker 2>shifted almost all of his policies that</v>

3282
02:37:09.311 --> 02:37:11.110
<v Speaker 2>he said that he was going to do once he</v>
<v Speaker 2>got into office,</v>

3283
02:37:11.260 --> 02:37:13.330
<v Speaker 2>once he actually got into office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

3284
02:37:13.390 --> 02:37:17.960
<v Speaker 2>So many of the things he including his</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea and stance on whistleblowers.</v>

3285
02:37:18.050 --> 02:37:21.050
<v Speaker 2>There was a big part of his hope and</v>
<v Speaker 2>change website that they had to redact.</v>

3286
02:37:21.650 --> 02:37:25.730
<v Speaker 2>So who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who believes that the president really</v>

3287
02:37:25.731 --> 02:37:29.270
<v Speaker 2>is responsible for the entire country</v>
<v Speaker 2>really is the one guy that runs the</v>

3288
02:37:29.271 --> 02:37:31.400
<v Speaker 2>entire show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think almost no one now.</v>

3289
02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Almost no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a ridiculous figurehead position</v>

3290
02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:38.090
<v Speaker 2>that I think we need to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to stop pretending that we have</v>

3291
02:37:38.091 --> 02:37:39.860
<v Speaker 2>a king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to stop.</v>

3292
02:37:40.010 --> 02:37:43.370
<v Speaker 2>We need to figure out a way to have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective form of government with a</v>

3293
02:37:43.371 --> 02:37:46.370
<v Speaker 2>giant group of really intelligent people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that vote on it.</v>

3294
02:37:46.371 --> 02:37:50.090
<v Speaker 2>People that have proven to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent and objective and well</v>

3295
02:37:50.091 --> 02:37:55.091
<v Speaker 2>educated and have a reasonable reason to</v>
<v Speaker 2>response to all these different various</v>

3296
02:37:55.520 --> 02:38:00.520
<v Speaker 2>the parliamentary system of the US,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada or Britain would probably be more</v>

3297
02:38:01.731 --> 02:38:04.640
<v Speaker 2>akin to what you're talking about maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still have trudeau.</v>

3298
02:38:04.641 --> 02:38:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean you still have a figurehead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have a one.</v>

3299
02:38:07.660 --> 02:38:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Figurehead is a bad idea and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bad idea because I think that</v>

3300
02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:15.380
<v Speaker 2>this hope and this idea that we need a</v>
<v Speaker 2>king,</v>

3301
02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:17.810
<v Speaker 2>we need a a number one primate.</v>

3302
02:38:17.890 --> 02:38:21.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's these are like chimpanzee hierarchy</v>

3303
02:38:21.561 --> 02:38:25.460
<v Speaker 2>systems that have existed for thousands</v>
<v Speaker 2>and millions of years,</v>

3304
02:38:25.461 --> 02:38:28.910
<v Speaker 2>but you don't think that humans succumb</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the same dominance hierarchies.</v>

3305
02:38:28.970 --> 02:38:32.720
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think we need it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we're moving towards this</v>

3306
02:38:32.721 --> 02:38:36.560
<v Speaker 2>idea of a global community moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards this idea of a,</v>

3307
02:38:36.561 --> 02:38:41.561
<v Speaker 2>of a world with the boundaries that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have had in the past oftentimes have</v>

3308
02:38:43.101 --> 02:38:46.280
<v Speaker 2>been because we try to stay safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We try to establish borders.</v>

3309
02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:49.520
<v Speaker 2>We want to stay safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to keep people together and to</v>

3310
02:38:49.521 --> 02:38:51.320
<v Speaker 2>keep all the outsiders out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need a king.</v>

3311
02:38:51.790 --> 02:38:53.450
<v Speaker 2>We need a king to king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the guard.</v>

3312
02:38:53.451 --> 02:38:54.920
<v Speaker 2>The border is a king to lead us into</v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

3313
02:38:55.430 --> 02:38:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I just think that's less and less</v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant today and that it's more and</v>

3314
02:38:59.391 --> 02:39:03.710
<v Speaker 2>more relevant to have a large group of</v>
<v Speaker 2>very informed people that can help a</v>

3315
02:39:03.711 --> 02:39:06.770
<v Speaker 2>large group of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>collectively calling themselves a</v>

3316
02:39:06.771 --> 02:39:07.604
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

3317
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Plato talks about philosopher kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3318
02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:14.810
<v Speaker 2>He talks about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those who should lead should be the wise</v>

3319
02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:17.510
<v Speaker 2>philosophers and assuming you sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>amalgamation of those guys,</v>

3320
02:39:17.511 --> 02:39:19.030
<v Speaker 2>be the Godfather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they,</v>

3321
02:39:19.260 --> 02:39:20.730
<v Speaker 2>you were born in another country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting,</v>

3322
02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:22.060
<v Speaker 2>but you're changing the constitution for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

3323
02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tried for Arnold Schwarzenegger until</v>

3324
02:39:26.061 --> 02:39:27.270
<v Speaker 2>he got popped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3325
02:39:28.780 --> 02:39:32.360
<v Speaker 2>But what's the deal with him now doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>those video game commercials?</v>

3326
02:39:32.361 --> 02:39:34.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it not seem goodness,</v>

3327
02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:36.890
<v Speaker 2>scratch paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pay for that divorce.</v>

3328
02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:37.753
<v Speaker 2>A lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought it.</v>

3329
02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's doing movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a lot of different things.</v>

3330
02:39:40.011 --> 02:39:42.680
<v Speaker 2>So I probably came to him with a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal and you know,</v>

3331
02:39:42.681 --> 02:39:44.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny commercial and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking.</v>

3332
02:39:44.441 --> 02:39:46.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3333
02:39:46.570 --> 02:39:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't bother me.</v>

3334
02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:48.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a bother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3335
02:39:48.861 --> 02:39:51.020
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it seems like for former</v>
<v Speaker 2>governor.</v>

3336
02:39:51.090 --> 02:39:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it's governor anymore.</v>

3337
02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3338
02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3339
02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:57.860
<v Speaker 2>But I don't spend too much time thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

3340
02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:00.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be weird if push started doing</v>

3341
02:40:00.861 --> 02:40:03.180
<v Speaker 2>one of those Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president what it.</v>

3342
02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The current guy,</v>

3343
02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:05.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3344
02:40:05.271 --> 02:40:08.120
<v Speaker 2>the former president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>President George W started doing a</v>

3345
02:40:08.121 --> 02:40:11.180
<v Speaker 2>commercial for a video game where he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>running away from a bunch of assassins</v>

3346
02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 2>are trying to steal his phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would get really weird.</v>

3347
02:40:13.981 --> 02:40:14.814
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3348
02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:19.740
<v Speaker 2>or if Obama left office and started</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing commercials for Shit,</v>

3349
02:40:19.890 --> 02:40:22.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean is there a law against that?</v>

3350
02:40:22.770 --> 02:40:27.570
<v Speaker 2>If a black president doing commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a former president,</v>

3351
02:40:27.580 --> 02:40:29.640
<v Speaker 2>like representing Pepsi Cola or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

3352
02:40:29.641 --> 02:40:32.010
<v Speaker 2>And I suspect not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would be the law and would fall</v>

3353
02:40:32.011 --> 02:40:33.750
<v Speaker 2>under what rubric?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3354
02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:35.190
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never seen it?</v>

3355
02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:37.800
<v Speaker 2>No wonder why a violation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>

3356
02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:40.170
<v Speaker 2>in quotes of the presidential office.</v>

3357
02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:40.831
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3358
02:40:40.831 --> 02:40:45.510
<v Speaker 2>I think one thing that would hinder them</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the financial reward of being a</v>

3359
02:40:45.511 --> 02:40:48.330
<v Speaker 2>president is really about those gigantic</v>
<v Speaker 2>speeches that they give.</v>

3360
02:40:48.980 --> 02:40:50.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton.</v>

3361
02:40:50.191 --> 02:40:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a fucking a crazy one.</v>

3362
02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton have</v>
<v Speaker 2>made hundreds of millions of dollars in</v>

3363
02:41:00.391 --> 02:41:04.620
<v Speaker 2>speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave their daughter a $3,000,000</v>

3364
02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:07.880
<v Speaker 2>wedding party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$3,000,000.</v>

3365
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:10.580
<v Speaker 2>The masses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just like you and me will.</v>

3366
02:41:10.581 --> 02:41:15.570
<v Speaker 2>This just should show you how insanely</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up political system in this</v>

3367
02:41:15.571 --> 02:41:17.490
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why a president,</v>

3368
02:41:17.491 --> 02:41:22.170
<v Speaker 2>it would actually be a negative to them</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they had any mark on their record</v>

3369
02:41:22.171 --> 02:41:24.300
<v Speaker 2>like doing a pepsi commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

3370
02:41:24.490 --> 02:41:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Whatever Pepsi would pay them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be enough because like a guy</v>

3371
02:41:28.141 --> 02:41:32.010
<v Speaker 2>like Bill Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes unfucking believable amounts of</v>

3372
02:41:32.011 --> 02:41:36.090
<v Speaker 2>money and he was at least a partially</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgraced president,</v>

3373
02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:40.200
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still didn't harm his financial.</v>

3374
02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:43.470
<v Speaker 2>The financial possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it'll ever be the case</v>

3375
02:41:43.471 --> 02:41:47.280
<v Speaker 2>where a sitting US president can claim</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be an atheist?</v>

3376
02:41:49.050 --> 02:41:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I think an agnostic is more likely than</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual atheist in the atheist is</v>

3377
02:41:53.551 --> 02:41:55.410
<v Speaker 2>someone who says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in God.</v>

3378
02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:56.273
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

3379
02:41:56.450 --> 02:41:58.290
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more likely someone that could</v>

3380
02:41:58.291 --> 02:41:59.860
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about you know,</v>

3381
02:41:59.910 --> 02:42:04.910
<v Speaker 2>or someone who is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anybody that chooses to engage</v>

3382
02:42:06.511 --> 02:42:10.080
<v Speaker 2>in a bunch of different traditional</v>
<v Speaker 2>practices of worship but doesn't</v>

3383
02:42:10.081 --> 02:42:13.010
<v Speaker 2>necessarily believe in the God has as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>politician,</v>

3384
02:42:13.300 --> 02:42:17.490
<v Speaker 2>someone who tries to go into a Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 2>synagogue and then one day and then do</v>

3385
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:21.900
<v Speaker 2>all these trades when it's campaigning</v>
<v Speaker 2>season I put do they wear the garb and</v>

3386
02:42:21.901 --> 02:42:23.310
<v Speaker 2>do cert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the service,</v>

3387
02:42:23.390 --> 02:42:26.190
<v Speaker 2>so I could send you a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ether police pulled them up.</v>

3388
02:42:26.220 --> 02:42:29.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of photos of Justin</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trudeau being able to.</v>

3389
02:42:30.130 --> 02:42:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm done with that guy too to show he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in every extremist mosque in</v>

3390
02:42:35.851 --> 02:42:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prostrating himself as a,</v>

3391
02:42:39.151 --> 02:42:42.160
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a sort of a Muslim that.</v>

3392
02:42:42.170 --> 02:42:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Did he do that to get into the office a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot?</v>

3393
02:42:45.300 --> 02:42:47.700
<v Speaker 2>What else would he have done then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once he's in office,</v>

3394
02:42:47.701 --> 02:42:50.610
<v Speaker 2>then how does he behave?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

3395
02:42:50.611 --> 02:42:52.230
<v Speaker 2>It's only been 100 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll have to.</v>

3396
02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I reserved judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3397
02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that I liked that very</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

3398
02:42:55.980 --> 02:42:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3399
02:42:57.960 --> 02:43:02.960
<v Speaker 2>it's problematic when you support any</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies that really just don't make</v>

3400
02:43:03.661 --> 02:43:04.494
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3401
02:43:04.650 --> 02:43:09.150
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about like meditation</v>

3402
02:43:09.151 --> 02:43:11.920
<v Speaker 2>or anything else where you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about like really strict guidelines for</v>

3403
02:43:11.921 --> 02:43:14.200
<v Speaker 2>living and they don't make sense and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3404
02:43:14.201 --> 02:43:16.240
<v Speaker 2>they're ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3405
02:43:16.270 --> 02:43:19.960
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those places where those guidelines were</v>

3406
02:43:19.961 --> 02:43:23.200
<v Speaker 2>established.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where was the cradle of civilization</v>

3407
02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:27.880
<v Speaker 2>where civilization first emanate in</v>
<v Speaker 2>first took off and I have this sort of</v>

3408
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:29.860
<v Speaker 2>joke that I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really figured out how to do it</v>

3409
02:43:29.861 --> 02:43:32.290
<v Speaker 2>on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that essentially the Middle East is</v>

3410
02:43:32.291 --> 02:43:33.970
<v Speaker 2>like the townies of the world.</v>

3411
02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what a townie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3412
02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last time we were on,</v>

3413
02:43:36.650 --> 02:43:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that that terminal west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3414
02:43:38.231 --> 02:43:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3415
02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:42.070
<v Speaker 2>We talked about it last time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like think that patterns are</v>

3416
02:43:42.071 --> 02:43:46.030
<v Speaker 2>intensely hard to break and it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reasons why the United States is the</v>

3417
02:43:46.031 --> 02:43:51.031
<v Speaker 2>most as far as like artistically one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most diverse places in the world and</v>

3418
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:54.250
<v Speaker 2>as far as our ability to express</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in film,</v>

3419
02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:57.370
<v Speaker 2>in music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in standup comedy and things along those</v>

3420
02:43:57.371 --> 02:44:01.420
<v Speaker 2>lines and even in podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the most diverse and the most</v>

3421
02:44:01.421 --> 02:44:05.830
<v Speaker 2>potent and it's because we're the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that escaped exactly all the other</v>

3422
02:44:05.831 --> 02:44:06.730
<v Speaker 2>spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3423
02:44:06.731 --> 02:44:09.400
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandparents came from Italy and</v>

3424
02:44:09.401 --> 02:44:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Ireland and they all came over on a boat</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were young and they</v>

3425
02:44:13.391 --> 02:44:16.600
<v Speaker 2>established themselves in the east coast</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where my parents were born</v>

3426
02:44:16.601 --> 02:44:20.050
<v Speaker 2>and that's where I was born and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are just like cup second,</v>

3427
02:44:20.051 --> 02:44:23.260
<v Speaker 2>third generation immigrants that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get the fuck away from the</v>

3428
02:44:23.261 --> 02:44:27.030
<v Speaker 2>horrors of Europe and they tried to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new place with new opportunity and the</v>

3429
02:44:27.031 --> 02:44:27.580
<v Speaker 2>escape.</v>

3430
02:44:27.580 --> 02:44:30.970
<v Speaker 2>The tradition of the past and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition of this new place was</v>

3431
02:44:30.971 --> 02:44:32.170
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was different.</v>

3432
02:44:32.171 --> 02:44:34.480
<v Speaker 2>It was more open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was more more.</v>

3433
02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:36.000
<v Speaker 2>There was more hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

3434
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:37.850
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a caste system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3435
02:44:37.860 --> 02:44:40.570
<v Speaker 2>like there is an England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's like a very clear class</v>

3436
02:44:40.571 --> 02:44:43.300
<v Speaker 2>system that goes on in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries throughout the world that has</v>

3437
02:44:43.301 --> 02:44:46.570
<v Speaker 2>existed back from the days when they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>kings.</v>

3438
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:49.630
<v Speaker 2>By the way in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Canadian government,</v>

3439
02:44:49.631 --> 02:44:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember exactly when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically to avoid that caste system.</v>

3440
02:44:53.921 --> 02:44:54.461
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3441
02:44:54.461 --> 02:44:56.890
<v Speaker 2>the royal caste system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3442
02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:01.750
<v Speaker 2>made it a law that Canadians can't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>knighted because any country that's</v>

3443
02:45:01.751 --> 02:45:05.050
<v Speaker 2>under the Commonwealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're Nigerian or you're Indian,</v>

3444
02:45:05.051 --> 02:45:07.720
<v Speaker 2>you could be knighted by the queen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You become sir dame so on.</v>

3445
02:45:08.050 --> 02:45:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Canadians can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely because the argument was that</v>

3446
02:45:11.651 --> 02:45:16.480
<v Speaker 2>the Canadian ethos is contrary to having</v>
<v Speaker 2>these hierarchical,</v>

3447
02:45:16.481 --> 02:45:17.290
<v Speaker 2>royal titles.</v>

3448
02:45:17.290 --> 02:45:19.570
<v Speaker 2>So I could never be served godfather</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3449
02:45:19.660 --> 02:45:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be assertive.</v>

3450
02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:27.480
<v Speaker 2>I think there's real problems in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>established caste systems like that.</v>

3451
02:45:29.261 --> 02:45:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Real problems that are intensely hard to</v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

3452
02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:36.400
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the beauty of America</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you can come here with nothing</v>

3453
02:45:36.401 --> 02:45:40.390
<v Speaker 2>and become somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the real lesson in that is not that</v>

3454
02:45:40.391 --> 02:45:43.330
<v Speaker 2>America is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really everybody is somebody being</v>

3455
02:45:43.331 --> 02:45:46.510
<v Speaker 2>held back by tradition and you're being</v>
<v Speaker 2>held back by these,</v>

3456
02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:49.600
<v Speaker 2>these parameters and these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guidelines that are set in place</v>

3457
02:45:49.810 --> 02:45:52.330
<v Speaker 2>by people that had a very limited amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of information to work with.</v>

3458
02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:54.040
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't understand the consequences</v>

3459
02:45:54.041 --> 02:45:56.710
<v Speaker 2>of these rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't understand the consequences</v>

3460
02:45:56.711 --> 02:45:59.440
<v Speaker 2>of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these patterns of behavior that you're</v>

3461
02:45:59.441 --> 02:46:03.280
<v Speaker 2>forcing people to follow in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why America,</v>

3462
02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:06.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways represents still like</v>

3463
02:46:06.401 --> 02:46:09.860
<v Speaker 2>the beacon of freedom to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of problems with</v>

3464
02:46:09.861 --> 02:46:11.900
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge amount of problems with America,</v>

3465
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:16.490
<v Speaker 2>but that alone that it represents the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most recent of the big countries,</v>

3466
02:46:16.610 --> 02:46:20.300
<v Speaker 2>the most recent of the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if it's coincidentally</v>

3467
02:46:20.330 --> 02:46:21.730
<v Speaker 2>the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3468
02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:23.120
<v Speaker 2>The super power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3469
02:46:23.121 --> 02:46:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's a coincidence.</v>

3470
02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Earlier we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>friendships,</v>

3471
02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:29.560
<v Speaker 3>so let me link that to some of the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're talking about America.</v>

3472
02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:34.830
<v Speaker 3>So one of the arguments as to why</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans seem to form more sort of</v>

3473
02:46:36.221 --> 02:46:38.260
<v Speaker 3>Ephemera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>transient friendships,</v>

3474
02:46:38.290 --> 02:46:39.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as.</v>

3475
02:46:39.340 --> 02:46:40.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be a stereotype,</v>

3476
02:46:40.841 --> 02:46:43.060
<v Speaker 3>but I can tell you that when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>graduate student in the,</v>

3477
02:46:43.150 --> 02:46:46.960
<v Speaker 3>in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the non American students complained</v>

3478
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:49.360
<v Speaker 3>that Americans are very quick to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly with you,</v>

3479
02:46:49.630 --> 02:46:52.000
<v Speaker 3>but they don't form the same tight</v>
<v Speaker 3>bonds.</v>

3480
02:46:52.001 --> 02:46:53.380
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard that before,</v>

3481
02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:55.840
<v Speaker 3>but listen to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought about it and I thought,</v>

3482
02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:58.810
<v Speaker 3>well that can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't be inherently that Americans</v>

3483
02:46:58.811 --> 02:47:01.150
<v Speaker 3>are more shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what might be some reasons,</v>

3484
02:47:01.420 --> 02:47:03.280
<v Speaker 3>and so I actually talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in this book,</v>

3485
02:47:03.281 --> 02:47:08.281
<v Speaker 3>but in an earlier book of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2007 book that the fact that Americans</v>

3486
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:12.340
<v Speaker 3>face greater geographic mobility today.</v>

3487
02:47:12.340 --> 02:47:16.730
<v Speaker 3>I could be in Boston tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be an la and socioeconomic</v>

3488
02:47:16.750 --> 02:47:20.950
<v Speaker 3>mobility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stratum that I was born into is not</v>

3489
02:47:20.951 --> 02:47:25.240
<v Speaker 3>necessarily the one that I might die in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because of these various forms of</v>

3490
02:47:25.241 --> 02:47:29.530
<v Speaker 3>mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it creates a more transient,</v>

3491
02:47:29.770 --> 02:47:33.340
<v Speaker 3>a definition of friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that Americans can form strong</v>

3492
02:47:33.341 --> 02:47:37.120
<v Speaker 3>bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is a bit of a shallowness to</v>

3493
02:47:37.150 --> 02:47:39.730
<v Speaker 3>the original encounters because tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be somewhere else.</v>

3494
02:47:40.030 --> 02:47:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the guy who comes from Lebanon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

3495
02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:45.310
<v Speaker 3>where he's born as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he's going to die,</v>

3496
02:47:45.311 --> 02:47:49.420
<v Speaker 3>where his word is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as this contract is going to have a</v>

3497
02:47:49.421 --> 02:47:54.421
<v Speaker 3>different definition of friendship if</v>
<v Speaker 3>only because life is not as anonymous.</v>

3498
02:47:54.551 --> 02:47:57.580
<v Speaker 3>It's not as open to mobility as it would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the case in say,</v>

3499
02:47:57.620 --> 02:47:59.590
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems reasonable.</v>

3500
02:47:59.650 --> 02:48:01.270
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

3501
02:48:01.390 --> 02:48:01.841
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3502
02:48:01.841 --> 02:48:02.651
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3503
02:48:02.651 --> 02:48:04.510
<v Speaker 3>I probably saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw you.</v>

3504
02:48:04.511 --> 02:48:06.320
<v Speaker 3>I saw you trying to poke a hole into it.</v>

3505
02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

3506
02:48:08.451 --> 02:48:13.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm captive by the initial impulses of</v>

3507
02:48:14.601 --> 02:48:17.630
<v Speaker 2>the people who created us and the land</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they established,</v>

3508
02:48:17.940 --> 02:48:19.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this place was established by people</v>

3509
02:48:19.710 --> 02:48:20.390
<v Speaker 2>that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

3510
02:48:20.390 --> 02:48:21.610
<v Speaker 2>were so transient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3511
02:48:21.740 --> 02:48:25.460
<v Speaker 2>they got in a boat and they sailed away</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they had pictures.</v>

3512
02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:26.660
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3513
02:48:26.690 --> 02:48:29.960
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't even fucking pictures when</v>
<v Speaker 2>people came here in the 17 hundreds.</v>

3514
02:48:29.961 --> 02:48:31.700
<v Speaker 2>They had a draw things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3515
02:48:31.730 --> 02:48:34.610
<v Speaker 2>you should look at this drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's waiting for you on the</v>

3516
02:48:34.611 --> 02:48:36.590
<v Speaker 2>other side of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only going to take three months.</v>

3517
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Don't be a pussy and you're likely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

3518
02:48:39.530 --> 02:48:42.710
<v Speaker 2>People don't want to get on a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>plane for 10 hours and go to England.</v>

3519
02:48:42.740 --> 02:48:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too far,</v>

3520
02:48:43.870 --> 02:48:45.800
<v Speaker 2>but people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a fucking dot.</v>

3521
02:48:45.801 --> 02:48:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Even a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could wake up in,</v>

3522
02:48:48.410 --> 02:48:50.000
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Los Angeles,</v>

3523
02:48:50.001 --> 02:48:51.890
<v Speaker 2>get on a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have dinner in London.</v>

3524
02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:54.080
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

3525
02:48:54.110 --> 02:48:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Is it Louis?</v>
