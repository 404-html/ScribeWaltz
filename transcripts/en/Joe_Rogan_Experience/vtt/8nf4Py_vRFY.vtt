00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience sands process.</v>

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Awkward moment ever is when they see like in Vegas,</v>

3
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:08.310
<v Speaker 1>about five dudes hanging out together and there's no girls near him.</v>

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>And then they're getting a couple of drinks in them and they start sorta like</v>

5
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>half dance and they can't like totally commit to dancing,</v>

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>so like little go through like half the moves.</v>

8
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not really an advocate of this music.</v>

9
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make me move that much.</v>

10
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

11
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll give a little move,</v>

12
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>we'll get up a little move here and there,</v>

13
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>but they can't like dance with each other.</v>

15
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>They can only move just a minimal amount.</v>

16
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>You can't get crazy</v>

17
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>gyrating hips.</v>

18
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

19
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to do that to dude's girls can get together and dance all</v>

20
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

21
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>But with dudes you can only sort of half dance.</v>

22
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.991
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

23
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:40.191
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

24
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>just by myself.</v>

25
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.421
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

27
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you should go out by yourself to clubs.</v>

28
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 1>when I first moved to La I did,</v>

30
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>but I would go on the dance floor by myself.</v>

31
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

32
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with your brain.</v>

33
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>You need to go to a doctor</v>

34
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.163
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

35
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bad at first you didn't get to get the guys that are like,</v>

36
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

37
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>what's this guy doing?</v>

38
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.433
<v Speaker 1>You kind of do it,</v>

39
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>but then you get the girls that come over to you because they liked the guy who,</v>

40
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>who's then we've done a lot of work.</v>

41
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:05.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:06.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a little gutsy.</v>

43
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>It was a very gutsy move.</v>

44
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.791
<v Speaker 1>Got You.</v>

45
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Moved.</v>

46
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

47
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>not always worked.</v>

48
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>How many times is it failed on you?</v>

49
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

50
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:12.841
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>

51
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Probably more times than but that,</v>

52
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but it just takes that one time.</v>

53
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

54
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Just that one time.</v>

55
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Some dudes can take criticism and rejection rather.</v>

56
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Some dudes are fine with that.</v>

57
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>

58
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>

59
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>he would hit on every girl that he was an ugly guy.</v>

60
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

61
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.343
<v Speaker 1>I was fat,</v>

62
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't give a fuck.</v>

63
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>He would swing.</v>

64
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>He would swing at every pitch.</v>

65
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I know a couple of Evernote that way that I know that he's a comic.</v>

66
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give him up on the air.</v>

67
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I've owned you.</v>

68
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.491
<v Speaker 1>Do you mind?</v>

69
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:41.701
<v Speaker 1>Either,</v>

70
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:46.270
<v Speaker 1>but you can't go to bars with that guy because it's too much to my,</v>

71
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>and then those are always the guys who let people know you're a comic.</v>

72
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a whole bunch of comics that are that way.</v>

73
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 1>So they go up to the boundary like,</v>

74
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

75
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>we're the comics had to chuckle,</v>

76
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:55.231
<v Speaker 1>hut.</v>

77
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And then the bonds are usually like,</v>

78
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't care</v>

79
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>

80
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>free tickets or the want the girls to be impressed.</v>

81
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>It's bad.</v>

82
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>It's brutal when you were,</v>

83
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:04.771
<v Speaker 1>the dude will,</v>

84
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:05.221

85
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>

86
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>If you go somewhere and there's a chick that he's not going to hit on her and</v>

87
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to get annoying and it's not going to get embarrassing.</v>

88
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

89
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>those guys are brutal.</v>

90
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.371
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>

91
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:14.701

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>And then the cooler,</v>

149
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>one of the group will then kind of come over and go,</v>

150
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>you can then,</v>

151
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.570

152
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing them.</v>

153
