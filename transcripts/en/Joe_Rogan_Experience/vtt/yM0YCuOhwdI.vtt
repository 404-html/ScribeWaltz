00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.601
<v Speaker 1>Shocking.</v>

3
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>There's two shocking things that these pills have done for me is for you to</v>

4
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>remember one,</v>

5
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>remembering dreams and to being lucid in the middle of a dream.</v>

6
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I stayed in a dream.</v>

7
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I was in a dream and I stayed in the dream.</v>

8
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

9
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>oh well this is just a fucking dream.</v>

10
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.513
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

11
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even go lucid.</v>

12
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't try to control it or move around.</v>

13
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I just let the dream play out.</v>

14
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>But I realized it was a dream and I still didn't wake up.</v>

15
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

16
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a rare thing for me just for that chef dreams.</v>

17
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:29.844
<v Speaker 1>I have dreams.</v>

18
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I have been fucking crazy dreams,</v>

19
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:34.090
<v Speaker 1>but I am totally lucid inside my dreams.</v>

20
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Dreams that I'm reading something and I'll go,</v>

21
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll be,</v>

22
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.861
<v Speaker 1>I'll go,</v>

23
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:38.071
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

24
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>that's so funny that I'm reading something because nothing's there in the dream.</v>

25
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll pick this.</v>

26
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's there in my minds making up these words,</v>

27
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still reading them.</v>

28
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>That's so interesting.</v>

29
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>I had a dream one time that me and Elvis walked into his hotel room and there</v>

30
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:50.431
<v Speaker 1>were four dudes,</v>

31
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>but fucking right.</v>

32
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And I just hear me where they were.</v>

33
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>That might be one of the best sentences ever created.</v>

34
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 1>I had a dream that I was with Elvis and we walked into his dressing room.</v>

35
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>There was four dudes,</v>

36
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>but fucking dot,</v>

37
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:05.101
<v Speaker 1>dot,</v>

38
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>dot.</v>

39
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Now hear me out it weird or they're throwing up in Burger King cups should just</v>

40
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 1>fucking each other and then I,</v>

41
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.301
<v Speaker 1>where do you,</v>

42
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:15.961
<v Speaker 1>when I say this,</v>

43
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I fucking just shut the door and I looked at Elvis.</v>

44
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:18.601
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

45
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on in your room?</v>

46
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.213
<v Speaker 1>He said to me,</v>

47
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>what's your Dream Baby Shit?</v>

48
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.351
<v Speaker 1>I wake up,</v>

49
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:28.921
<v Speaker 1>I wake up.</v>

50
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

51
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.001
<v Speaker 1>wake up.</v>

52
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Check my Dick and make sure it's,</v>

53
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:31.734
<v Speaker 1>I'm bored.</v>

54
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

55
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>well you don't really flipped me out.</v>

56
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't really put me out.</v>

57
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Not that.</v>

58
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Not that the guys were both fucking right.</v>

59
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>They didn't ask.</v>

60
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

61
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>It was the product placement like what the fuck did Burger King do to get it?</v>

62
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 1>When did they figured it out and you just don't know that they are just waiting</v>

63
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Jack to advertising into your Dream Burger King in the future.</v>

64
00:01:58.531 --> 00:01:58.831
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

65
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like I got her Chrysler stream about the Elvis and the buck fucking high,</v>

66
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

67
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

68
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.971
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

69
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.181
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

70
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:03.361
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

71
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>But what is,</v>

72
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.750
<v Speaker 1>there is a possibility that someone could insert a product into a dream,</v>

73
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>They could give you a cheeseburger and in that cheeseburger with some</v>

75
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>experimental thing that would make you think about burger king in a dream and</v>

76
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>see a burger and a dream,</v>

77
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:19.051
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

78
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>

79
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I fucking girl from behind.</v>

80
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>It's going Geico and shit.</v>

81
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

82
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Work in the future.</v>

83
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't make any sense cause you have the Pronto duck noises.</v>

84
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>It's Geico to eat something,</v>

85
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>to have this happen to you.</v>

86
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>We're still,</v>

87
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.920
<v Speaker 1>we're still missing the whole point.</v>

88
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>We're stumbling on something very brilliant right now.</v>

89
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
