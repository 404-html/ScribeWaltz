<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm in traffic.</v>

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not angry like it does nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

157
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:19.124
<v Speaker 2>Because your body will burn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you're just so fucking </v>

158
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 2>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is my feeling.</v>

159
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I feel a lot of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have those feelings that you have,</v>

160
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:28.214
<v Speaker 2>whether it's anxiety or stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just extra energy that your body </v>

161
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unnecessary.</v>

162
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.093
<v Speaker 2>It's unnecessary energy and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like your body's looking for trouble </v>

163
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 2>that isn't there looking for danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't.</v>

164
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:40.334
<v Speaker 2>They're looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for something that's going to </v>

165
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 2>like steal your food or fade your </v>
<v Speaker 2>village,</v>

166
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 2>all that shit because who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill my family?</v>

167
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.973
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think your body has to have a certain </v>

168
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

169
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.553
<v Speaker 2>We're designed right for all the years </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we were running away from wild </v>

170
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 2>animals and other tribes and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

171
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.883
<v Speaker 2>I think your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body and your brain have a certain </v>

172
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 2>amount on reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always looking for some sort of danger.</v>

173
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.980
<v Speaker 2>You're a see a deer in the wild that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

174
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitchy and yeah,</v>

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.863
<v Speaker 2>they sit here and around the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>lion outline is that a mountain is a </v>

176
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 2>mountain lion in my neighborhood by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

177
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.881
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

178
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:17.714
<v Speaker 2>The neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the neighbor spotted a mountain </v>

179
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 2>lion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got your fucking good luck.</v>

180
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Shooting them out in line with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would be fun though.</v>

181
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to.</v>

182
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.530
<v Speaker 2>The odds of you shooting them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

183
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That walks by.</v>

184
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 2>That lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a cat?</v>

185
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

186
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:32.504
<v Speaker 2>that's not a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a mountain lion because of how </v>

187
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 2>it's tail popped up and it looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lion,</v>

188
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's just way too casual walking by </v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

189
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't know what it is.</v>

190
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 2>It definitely looks like cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She thought it was a dog.</v>

191
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kind of looks like a dog.</v>

192
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.600
<v Speaker 2>It's this way to calm the way it walks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buyer.</v>

193
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 2>That's not a wild cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a dog man,</v>

194
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't look like a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a mountain lion made its debut.</v>

195
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows what the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine or not.</v>

196
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 2>In wildlife experts are looking at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>video and they'll see like,</v>

197
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a wildlife expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen a lot of wildlife.</v>

198
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 2>The tail does not look right at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tail.</v>

199
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Looks like a cat does it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

200
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does see it again,</v>

201
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 2>that tail definitely say cat doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>look that good dog tail.</v>

202
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.700
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a balancing tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at what's wrong.</v>

203
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

206
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.400
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me say it again.</v>

207
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.210
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking dog though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be a dollar.</v>

208
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.780
<v Speaker 2>People trim their dog hair and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a way.</v>

209
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the tail.</v>

210
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 2>It's holding its tail in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what I'm saying?</v>

211
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:33.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

212
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.590
<v Speaker 2>We check the tracks and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely dog tracks,</v>

213
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.340
<v Speaker 2>so it's a dog to dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my dad.</v>

214
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 2>I told myself I wasn't going to say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>f word anymore than I did.</v>

215
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:48.710
<v Speaker 2>It snuck out talking about a dog and </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes its way out.</v>

216
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 2>I think this closet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dog identifies as a cat.</v>

217
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.320
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>

218
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>I heard the dog as a person.</v>

219
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Now that it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wants to be called cal Calvin.</v>

220
00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 1>That's his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:00.940
<v Speaker 1>The dog says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Calvin.</v>

222
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to respect its feelings.</v>

223
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.950
<v Speaker 1>It has every right to be whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be,</v>

224
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.140
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just assume that animals.</v>

225
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assumed it's identity.</v>

226
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>It's identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

227
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 1>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big mistake on my part.</v>

228
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:16.524
<v Speaker 1>We've got a lot of fucking nerve Joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan to have a lot of nerve that's </v>

229
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.633
<v Speaker 1>fucking deeply embarrassed by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to go to a support group for </v>

230
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 1>people who think that dogs are dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even a cat.</v>

231
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.113
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just a century and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe identifies as like a sentient </v>

232
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a being.</v>

233

<v Speaker 2>Admired is Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

352
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Go live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go large.</v>

353
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.653
<v Speaker 2>Go large on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go logical line and bring it to the </v>

354
00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:30.910
<v Speaker 2>beginning because this is quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>political.</v>

355
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Hold on to the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

356
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.143
<v Speaker 3>My name is cody or Glam room and I see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you might categorize as </v>

357
00:14:40.621 --> 00:14:43.170
<v Speaker 3>intersectional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm British or rocky,</v>

358
00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.413
<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>non binary and also identify as Muslim </v>

359
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.573
<v Speaker 3>and the glittery quantum physics has </v>
<v Speaker 3>makeup I've ever seen like any human </v>

360
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.823
<v Speaker 3>entity,</v>

361
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.280
<v Speaker 2>quantum physics has helped them </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand this queer identity.</v>

362
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now listen,</v>

363
00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.190
<v Speaker 2>she just fucking space cadet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pictures are insane.</v>

364
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.233
<v Speaker 2>The listen</v>

365
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.973
<v Speaker 4>glorious sect of physics that looks at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Subatomic particles that govern our </v>

366
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.880
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so inside the neutrons,</v>

367
00:15:09.881 --> 00:15:14.880
<v Speaker 4>electrons and the protons and looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>Decaux leptons those hakes,</v>

368
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.460
<v Speaker 4>whereas classical newtonian physics is </v>
<v Speaker 4>obsessed with the universal formula that</v>

369
00:15:21.851 --> 00:15:25.480
<v Speaker 4>governor reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so fixed on resolute answers.</v>

370
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.840
<v Speaker 4>Quantum physics reveals that there is no</v>
<v Speaker 4>fixed reality and it's full of beautiful</v>

371
00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:32.110
<v Speaker 4>contradictions.</v>

372
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's my point.</v>

373
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.180
<v Speaker 2>You can keep going on and watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a very intelligent person.</v>

374
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.540
<v Speaker 2>So why am I so dismissive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

375
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:42.643
<v Speaker 2>Why can't this person where like if a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman was beautiful and she wore like a </v>

376
00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 2>dark red lipstick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was talking brilliant science,</v>

377
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have an issue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why do I have an issue with this Glam</v>

378
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:56.430
<v Speaker 2>roof fella?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Character,</v>

379
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Glam row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fellow Glam roadshow.</v>

380
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Why do I have an issue with the bright </v>
<v Speaker 2>blue,</v>

381
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.103
<v Speaker 2>glittery lips?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Literal Rainbow colored eye shadow </v>

382
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.560
<v Speaker 2>with glitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the false</v>

383
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] nine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what the.</v>

384
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:15.420
<v Speaker 5>Is this the Kashi?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sixty nine.</v>

385
00:16:15.421 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Speaker 5>And I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's my thing with this whole thing,</v>

386
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck what you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who you identify with.</v>

387
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm for real cool with all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this is like peacocking and it's</v>

388
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.280
<v Speaker 5>at is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is formed.</v>

389
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.740
<v Speaker 5>This is calling for attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the reason that we all are like,</v>

390
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.360
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when they get mad,</v>

391
00:16:29.361 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 5>like what are you looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what someone's like,</v>

392
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 5>what are you looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You like,</v>

393
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.660
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

394
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.560
<v Speaker 5>you fucking did this show for me to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise you'd stay in private and have</v>

395
00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:38.750
<v Speaker 5>your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you want me to react.</v>

396
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:39.803
<v Speaker 2>But why do I like some of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if there's a seven year old black </v>

397
00:16:43.561 --> 00:16:46.710
<v Speaker 2>dude and he's got like a red velvet suit</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

398
00:16:46.711 --> 00:16:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Well he looks cool as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

399
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.193
<v Speaker 2>With like a slick Dora and he's walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the street with a fucking snake </v>

400
00:16:53.501 --> 00:16:55.050
<v Speaker 2>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silver Cane.</v>

401
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Hey Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

402
00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean I look at that guy or girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this cool motherfucker,</v>

403
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.500
<v Speaker 2>but he's peacocking as well.</v>

404
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:02.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's a different this.</v>

405
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.660
<v Speaker 5>But this is attention grabbing because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they want you to see,</v>

406
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.420
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people are the people who do,</v>

407
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.313
<v Speaker 5>who want to be larger than life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That do things like this to express who </v>

408
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:12.674
<v Speaker 5>they really are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they want to have a discussion </v>

409
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.820
<v Speaker 5>whether or not they want to have true </v>
<v Speaker 5>discourse.</v>

410
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.580
<v Speaker 5>They want you to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is this?</v>

411
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 5>What are you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they want that.</v>

412
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.163
<v Speaker 5>Then they also want to like quote </v>
<v Speaker 5>unquote inform you or argue with you </v>

413
00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 5>about who they are and what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Identity.</v>

414
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:28.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why?</v>

415
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.280
<v Speaker 5>That's my whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you just be.</v>

416
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.183
<v Speaker 5>Be The thing you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't need to have so many fucking </v>

417
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.460
<v Speaker 5>with that nine labels from rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gay,</v>

418
00:17:34.461 --> 00:17:35.031
<v Speaker 5>British,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Muslim.</v>

419
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:35.511
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

420
00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:38.120
<v Speaker 5>what you just your Glam Room agree with </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

421
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be Glamorous,</v>

422
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.833
<v Speaker 2>but I also myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm questioning my own judgemental </v>

423
00:17:43.591 --> 00:17:44.424
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You saying why don't prejudge because I </v>

424
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.060
<v Speaker 2>care because it's outside of the realm </v>
<v Speaker 2>of normalcy.</v>

425
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.013
<v Speaker 2>It would've.</v>

426
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.540
<v Speaker 6>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is.</v>

427
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 6>These are pretty fucking normal foods </v>
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>

428
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.953
<v Speaker 6>from jen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from normal standards of what's kind of </v>

429
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.563
<v Speaker 6>the same thing you've seen for the past.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we fit into the culture where we </v>

430
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:01.824
<v Speaker 6>don't stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we're not asking for additional </v>

431
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:04.014
<v Speaker 6>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

432
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

433
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>

434
00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Speaker 6>this is a call to attention to call to </v>
<v Speaker 6>discussion and again,</v>

435
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.603
<v Speaker 6>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't have anything against this </v>

436
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 6>fucking person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know him.</v>

437
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't give a shit about them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just know that this is clearly for you</v>

438
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:19.020
<v Speaker 6>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck?</v>

439
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 6>That's why they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why that is.</v>

440
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 6>What if I was dressed exactly like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a thick rope chain with a star on it</v>

441
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 6>that had all diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You want me to say something about it?</v>

442
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Speaker 6>That's why you wore that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

443
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.750
<v Speaker 6>You'd want me to go.</v>

444
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 6>Why the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why are you wearing that shit?</v>

445
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.343
<v Speaker 6>Why the fuck are you wearing that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in fact it would be insane if I sat </v>

446
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 6>here the whole fucking interview and </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't end.</v>

447
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:42.690
<v Speaker 6>Wasn't like it didn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is that star?</v>

448
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:43.703
<v Speaker 6>Like the size of like a Mercedes emblem </v>
<v Speaker 6>diamond and you'd be the asshole if you </v>

449
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:48.204
<v Speaker 6>go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

450
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:48.990
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

451
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.823
<v Speaker 6>what does this do I have to fucking do </v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to know my identity with my </v>

452
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.570
<v Speaker 6>part of my culture,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

453
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:55.404
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well explain it because I don't get it </v>

454
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 6>because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I'm fucking used to or okay,</v>

455
00:18:58.861 --> 00:19:01.710
<v Speaker 6>how about a white guy who dresses like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

456
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:04.440
<v Speaker 6>but he talks like he's not a white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

457
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:04.771
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

458
00:19:04.771 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Speaker 6>Like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well we'll do it.</v>

459
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:07.630
<v Speaker 6>This guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's that.</v>

460
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 6>He's a great troll.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's actually so good at it.</v>

461
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.040
<v Speaker 6>Do you think he really got pistol </v>
<v Speaker 6>whipped in Brooklyn and robbed,</v>

462
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.460
<v Speaker 6>or do you think?</v>

463
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.090
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to him.</v>

464
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.370
<v Speaker 6>So I think that was all a big fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>media push,</v>

465
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.130
<v Speaker 6>but I think he's a genius for doing it </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it got him way more attention.</v>

466
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 6>I think rob,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think this kid is,</v>

467

500
00:21:06.601 --> 00:21:07.434

<v Speaker 5>whole push about getting Kaepernick to </v>

501
00:21:10.081 --> 00:21:12.230
<v Speaker 5>have lunch with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brilliant.</v>

502
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.373
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking pr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he used the whole platform of </v>

503
00:21:14.461 --> 00:21:18.270
<v Speaker 5>snl just to get trump to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love Kanye.</v>

504
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.600
<v Speaker 5>He wants trump to be so in love with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Kanye,</v>

505
00:21:21.601 --> 00:21:22.434
<v Speaker 5>wants trump to love him so much that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's willing to actually take a meeting </v>

506
00:21:24.571 --> 00:21:27.840
<v Speaker 5>with someone he's been publicly shitting</v>
<v Speaker 5>on for for a year now.</v>

507
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.823
<v Speaker 5>All trump has been doing a sand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kaepernick is a terrible representation </v>

508
00:21:31.471 --> 00:21:32.910
<v Speaker 5>of this country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bad football player,</v>

509
00:21:32.911 --> 00:21:33.750
<v Speaker 5>a bad person.</v>

510
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.270
<v Speaker 5>He had been dumping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dumping them and and then Kanye is going</v>

511
00:21:36.271 --> 00:21:37.104
<v Speaker 5>to sucker him in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>twist his mind into thinking he should </v>

512
00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:42.360
<v Speaker 5>actually sit and have lunch with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet my life that'll happen.</v>

513
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.430
<v Speaker 5>That trump will go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

514
00:21:44.431 --> 00:21:48.150
<v Speaker 5>I'll take a meeting because I love Kanye</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's just out of respect for Kanye.</v>

515
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.260
<v Speaker 5>So he'll get up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'll get him and fucking catherine.</v>

516
00:21:51.261 --> 00:21:52.350
<v Speaker 5>Nick in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

517
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 5>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch it happen.</v>

518
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.830
<v Speaker 5>I hope he does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the thing.</v>

519
00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.693
<v Speaker 5>Donald trump is not a cop and he's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>shooting black people like the whole </v>

520
00:21:59.821 --> 00:22:02.590
<v Speaker 5>thing is bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes no sense when</v>

521
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Kaepernick is on his knees during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>national anthem.</v>

522
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.813
<v Speaker 2>That's bizarre too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people were just there for a </v>

523
00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:09.930
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a game.</v>

524
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I completely understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're disgusted by police brutality.</v>

525
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:21.330
<v Speaker 2>I think virtually everyone is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My take on it is it's first of all,</v>

526
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.140
<v Speaker 2>it's insanely difficult to be a police </v>
<v Speaker 2>officer.</v>

527
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.063
<v Speaker 2>You have a lot of people that are police</v>
<v Speaker 2>officers that have no business holding </v>

528
00:22:29.651 --> 00:22:31.750
<v Speaker 2>that job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're under extreme pressure.</v>

529
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them have ptsd and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

530
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.130
<v Speaker 2>they're bullies and they get into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>position because they want to be the guy</v>

531
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:40.810
<v Speaker 2>with the gun in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally,</v>

532
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.733
<v Speaker 2>and then they have an opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull that trigger and they do and they </v>

533
00:22:44.411 --> 00:22:45.244
<v Speaker 2>face repercussions because someone was </v>
<v Speaker 2>filming it and I think that shit has </v>

534
00:22:47.921 --> 00:22:49.720
<v Speaker 2>happened from the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

535
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:50.710
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's film.</v>

536
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 2>There's a horrible film that we played </v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

537
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.850
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I posted it on my twitter.</v>

538
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:55.684
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking horrible of a guy shooting </v>
<v Speaker 2>a white guy who's crawling for his life </v>

539
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.930
<v Speaker 2>on the voice telling the guy to crawl </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards him.</v>

540
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Let me see your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in Arizona and the guy's pants have</v>

541
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 2>fallen down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It keeps reaching back to grab his pants</v>

542
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.740
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

543
00:23:08.741 --> 00:23:09.574
<v Speaker 2>I will fucking shoot you if you grab </v>
<v Speaker 2>your pants and the guy is crawling and </v>

544
00:23:13.361 --> 00:23:14.194
<v Speaker 2>his pants are falling down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tries to grab his pants and the guy </v>

545
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.470
<v Speaker 2>liked him up in the hallway of a hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

546
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Fox just kills him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked,</v>

547
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:21.993
<v Speaker 2>murdered him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy was crying and begging for his </v>

548
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:27.460
<v Speaker 2>life and the cop was making crawl </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards him like,</v>

549
00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:30.100
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck would you ever make someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>crawl towards you?</v>

550
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:34.750
<v Speaker 2>It's insane and he's giving them all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these confusing directions while he's in</v>

551
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:36.670
<v Speaker 2>full riot gear holding a gun.</v>

552
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.713
<v Speaker 2>Apparently the guy had a fake pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a water pistol or a water gun and </v>

553
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:43.414
<v Speaker 2>was holding it out the window and </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone saw it and they said there's a </v>

554
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:47.060
<v Speaker 2>guy with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they came in,</v>

555
00:23:47.061 --> 00:23:50.600
<v Speaker 2>they're ready to shoot somebody already </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they see this guy,</v>

556
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:51.434
<v Speaker 2>but the guy was clearly not threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see this in this guy had already </v>

557
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:55.214
<v Speaker 2>been in trouble for other police </v>
<v Speaker 2>brutality and then got kicked off the </v>

558
00:23:58.641 --> 00:24:00.350
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got acquitted by the way,</v>

559
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.360
<v Speaker 2>with video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got acquitted,</v>

560
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 2>and then you've got acquitted of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>murder?</v>

561
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquitted.</v>

562
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.460
<v Speaker 2>He murdered this with the video with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>

563
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.473
<v Speaker 2>got acquitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then afterwards got kicked off the </v>

564
00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:11.930
<v Speaker 2>force for something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

565
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 2>So the guy was just an abusive guy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just going off.</v>

566
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:18.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

567
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.170
<v Speaker 2>And there's also some that are racist </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

568
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not discounting racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some that are racist too,</v>

569
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a fucking insanely </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult job.</v>

570
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.893
<v Speaker 2>But no one respects are very few people </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect and these people are in these </v>

571
00:24:32.691 --> 00:24:33.524
<v Speaker 2>situations every day where their life is</v>
<v Speaker 2>in danger and their whole brain is </v>

572
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:39.530
<v Speaker 2>frazzled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm friends with a lot of cops.</v>

573
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of cops in my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of cops from mma.</v>

574
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.053
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known a lot of cops in my whole </v>

575
00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:48.110
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my whole life growing up.</v>

576
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:50.240
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my real dad was a cop.</v>

577
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:51.163
<v Speaker 2>I grew up like knowing cops when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid and then in an all through martial </v>

578
00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:56.030
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new cops,</v>

579
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.760
<v Speaker 2>because cops are always taking martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts to learn how to defend themselves.</v>

580
00:24:58.761 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking insane job,</v>

581
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:02.444
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

582
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.840
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up and every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all day long,</v>

583
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>committing crimes.</v>

584
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>lying.</v>

585
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.790
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>lying to you.</v>

586
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.430
<v Speaker 2>You pull people over there lying either </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk or on drugs.</v>

587
00:25:14.431 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 2>They've got a body in the trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just lies.</v>

588
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.990
<v Speaker 5>Even a simple pullover is alive when it </v>
<v Speaker 5>faster.</v>

589
00:25:18.991 --> 00:25:19.780
<v Speaker 5>We're going like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

590
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.680
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Going over.</v>

591
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:23.963
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I legitimately had a broken speedometer </v>

592
00:25:25.541 --> 00:25:28.480
<v Speaker 2>once and a cop pulled me over and I go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the skin.</v>

593
00:25:28.481 --> 00:25:30.390
<v Speaker 2>It sounds so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Must be nominated.</v>

594
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

595
00:25:31.751 --> 00:25:33.340
<v Speaker 2>get that shit fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

596
00:25:33.341 --> 00:25:34.111
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should.</v>

597
00:25:34.111 --> 00:25:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I should let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why I'm white,</v>

598
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.110
<v Speaker 2>white dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white guy.</v>

599
00:25:38.111 --> 00:25:40.200
<v Speaker 2>And it was only 18 at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black Dude.</v>

600
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.123
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

601
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:45.980
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of the car again.</v>

602
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.620
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

603
00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.530
<v Speaker 2>it's not even something to joke about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sad that you just joked about it.</v>

604
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is fucked up.</v>

605
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.060
<v Speaker 5>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is fucked up,</v>

606
00:25:55.061 --> 00:25:56.260
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing,</v>

607
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.890
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Football players like capita,</v>

608
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.810
<v Speaker 5>people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they need because they want to.</v>

609
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.880
<v Speaker 5>They using their platform.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

610
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.250
<v Speaker 5>I get that to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should use your fuck.</v>

611
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.350
<v Speaker 5>Everyone should use their platform.</v>

612
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Here's my thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has that helped in any way?</v>

613
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.581
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

614
00:26:09.581 --> 00:26:11.220
<v Speaker 5>See the problem is there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no.</v>

615
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.153
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is if you said to </v>

616
00:26:12.551 --> 00:26:15.070
<v Speaker 5>Kaepernick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's your end game to say,</v>

617
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.410
<v Speaker 5>stop all police violence is such a </v>
<v Speaker 5>vague,</v>

618
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.460
<v Speaker 5>broad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does it go?</v>

619
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.211
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just stop it.</v>

620
00:26:19.211 --> 00:26:20.350
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's not that.</v>

621
00:26:20.351 --> 00:26:23.290
<v Speaker 5>This is to have a dialogue about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was what's important,</v>

622
00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 5>but the problem is they need to have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need.</v>

623
00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.753
<v Speaker 5>There needs to be a bigger goal for why </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are kneeling because the </v>

624
00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:29.734
<v Speaker 5>conversation has already been had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like we're kneeling so we can </v>

625
00:26:31.271 --> 00:26:33.260
<v Speaker 5>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we're talking about it we need to.</v>

626
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.800
<v Speaker 5>There needs to be some kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an end game.</v>

627
00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:37.290
<v Speaker 5>A goal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a point of that,</v>

628
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.650
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying it's achievable,</v>

629
00:26:38.651 --> 00:26:41.440
<v Speaker 5>it's not necessarily going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you need,</v>

630
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.060
<v Speaker 5>you need something to to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You</v>

631
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.903
<v Speaker 6>need something to get to because </v>
<v Speaker 6>otherwise this is just going to be this </v>

632
00:26:46.861 --> 00:26:51.750
<v Speaker 6>weird turmoil between ultimately racist </v>
<v Speaker 6>people because truly the people that are</v>

633
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:54.000
<v Speaker 6>yelling about it that are angry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't give a fuck the take a knee.</v>

634
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 6>Are they still gonna play football.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why do you care?</v>

635
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I like,</v>

636
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.533
<v Speaker 6>but ultimately people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you better stand up better stand up for </v>

637
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:02.120
<v Speaker 6>America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

638
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.990
<v Speaker 6>the ideas that we're all on the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>team.</v>

639
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's no one to support the team,</v>

640
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:07.900
<v Speaker 6>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why Neil dirt.</v>

641
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:08.763
<v Speaker 6>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then like because just because people </v>

642
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:12.390
<v Speaker 6>were paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's exactly right because the all the</v>

643
00:27:12.391 --> 00:27:13.224
<v Speaker 6>eyeballs are on right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the idea about a nation about </v>

644
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:17.274
<v Speaker 6>everybody being on the team together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we're supposed to support these </v>

645
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:25.230
<v Speaker 6>ideals that this song is about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I pledge of allegiance to the flag.</v>

646
00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:25.960
<v Speaker 6>All this jazz.</v>

647
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

648
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:27.864
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I find it so odd that the things </v>

649
00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:29.304
<v Speaker 6>have anything to do with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I sat it on stage one time that I was </v>

650
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:31.824
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a game that has no bearing on the </v>

651
00:27:33.841 --> 00:27:36.300
<v Speaker 6>future of the United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't do that for anything else,</v>

652
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.370
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't just.</v>

653
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 6>You don't have like a dinner party and </v>
<v Speaker 6>play monopoly and someone's like,</v>

654
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:41.440
<v Speaker 6>we should say the pledge of allegiance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Swamping.</v>

655
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.293
<v Speaker 6>The UFC stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That I really liked was saying they </v>

656
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:46.480
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't do the fucking national anthem </v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

657
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.120
<v Speaker 6>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're here for cage fights.</v>

658
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.820
<v Speaker 6>These are just two men competing in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sport,</v>

659
00:27:50.821 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 6>but it was a big thing with boxing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it still is.</v>

660
00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:53.544
<v Speaker 6>I think she's still do the national </v>
<v Speaker 6>anthem before big boxing matches and </v>

661
00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:58.800
<v Speaker 6>it's bold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's miserable.</v>

662
00:27:58.890 --> 00:27:59.723
<v Speaker 6>So you see people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's when people do that thing with </v>

663
00:28:01.801 --> 00:28:06.300
<v Speaker 6>their voice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they tried to be.</v>

664
00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.420
<v Speaker 6>They tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they tried to make it</v>

665
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.070
<v Speaker 7>shaky thing.</v>

666
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.620
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>

667
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.490
<v Speaker 6>that's the funny thing at any sporting </v>
<v Speaker 6>event in the middle of that,</v>

668
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.300
<v Speaker 6>up that last stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's always like 50,000</v>

669
00:28:29.301 --> 00:28:30.134
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

670
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.060
<v Speaker 6>I think the crossover is so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>silly.</v>

671
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.700
<v Speaker 6>We don't need to be singing about </v>
<v Speaker 6>America at sporting events.</v>

672
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.260
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have anything that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>have any.</v>

673
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:44.340
<v Speaker 6>The Olympics Olympics definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what it's fucking about.</v>

674
00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.513
<v Speaker 6>Controversy or country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But during all this shit about the </v>

675
00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:49.230
<v Speaker 6>Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>

676
00:28:49.231 --> 00:28:52.020
<v Speaker 6>but I'm just saying I get that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>national anthems at the Olympics.</v>

677
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:52.854
<v Speaker 6>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But this is just the packers versus </v>

679
00:28:57.721 --> 00:29:00.180
<v Speaker 6>nothing to do with the bearing of </v>
<v Speaker 6>American future.</v>

680
00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.860
<v Speaker 6>Will the soldiers fought for your right </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be able to put soldiers,</v>

<v Speaker 6>fucking everything can do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see fat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye,</v>

932
00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Kanye was pulpit here with Kanye with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meds,</v>

933
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:19.150
<v Speaker 1>so what happened was after he gave his </v>
<v Speaker 1>support for Donald Trump,</v>

934
00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:20.380
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't vote,</v>

935
00:40:20.381 --> 00:40:22.510
<v Speaker 1>but if I voted I would have voted on </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

936
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Like Lugoff Biggie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got they.</v>

937
00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:28.450
<v Speaker 1>They loaded him up with pills and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they loaded him up with pills,</v>

938
00:40:28.451 --> 00:40:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you vanished for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canceled his tour.</v>

939
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:36.100
<v Speaker 1>He was like having a fucking serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous breakdown and he got big fat.</v>

940
00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.480
<v Speaker 1>That's usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when he.</v>

941
00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:39.720
<v Speaker 1>That's when he was on the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

942
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Mentally fucking stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

943
00:40:41.711 --> 00:40:42.544
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather be fairly stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think because of sober </v>

944
00:40:45.071 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he just needs to work out.</v>

945
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.500
<v Speaker 1>She was just going to say I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

946
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.343
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a part of his </v>

947
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:52.870
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his lifestyle so.</v>

948
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not true because one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends was his trainer,</v>

949
00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.840
<v Speaker 1>so he does work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta train it for a walk.</v>

950
00:40:57.841 --> 00:40:58.674
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he doesn't.</v>

951
00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seems like God that just doesn't have</v>

952
00:41:00.281 --> 00:41:01.390
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

953
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.590
<v Speaker 1>He had a trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

954
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

955
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:05.103
<v Speaker 1>That's when he lost weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all this bullshit is a long time </v>

956
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:07.780
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a trainer.</v>

957
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I want to say my friend was doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless he looks really good.</v>

958
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

959
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Six or seven years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

960
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

961
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to disclose any trainer </v>
<v Speaker 1>client confidential shit,</v>

962
00:41:19.151 --> 00:41:21.670
<v Speaker 1>but working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was working out,</v>

963
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.560
<v Speaker 1>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

964
00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:26.620
<v Speaker 1>the guy's fucking obviously a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>looney,</v>

965
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but that's also why he's so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>

966
00:41:28.901 --> 00:41:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why his music so good.</v>

967
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

968
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you have to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

969
00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my best friends are out of their</v>

970
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:39.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not fucking normal.</v>

971
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not knowing I got real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

972
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:42.710
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we all do.</v>

973
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:43.573
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that's good at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also have a lot of self </v>

974
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:46.910
<v Speaker 1>examination and that's what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lacking.</v>

975
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.493
<v Speaker 1>Self awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I examined the things that I think and </v>

976
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:55.070
<v Speaker 1>say and how I interact with people and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't always get it right,</v>

977
00:41:55.071 --> 00:41:55.904
<v Speaker 1>but when I see him doing that holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>court in front of the president of the </v>

978
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:00.463
<v Speaker 1>United States with a mag maggot hat on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in front of all these fucking </v>

979
00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:03.404
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking pictures of him like this is </v>

980
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.023
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't use words like dope because I </v>

981
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 1>try to use only positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lovely.</v>

982
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Dope is positive.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It just swallow Cox.</v>

1003
00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those words that you use </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're hanging around with actors.</v>

1004
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.780
<v Speaker 1>He was wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a wonderful,</v>

1005
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.643
<v Speaker 1>wonderful performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're talking about a </v>

1006
00:42:49.641 --> 00:42:51.830
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was exquisite.</v>

1007
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her performance was so wonderful.</v>

1008
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:55.380
<v Speaker 1>You know the word that I hate.</v>

1009
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.270
<v Speaker 5>Brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>supportive woman.</v>

1010
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.113
<v Speaker 5>I hate brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the actor community people say </v>

1011
00:42:59.351 --> 00:43:01.210
<v Speaker 5>brilliant bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when they go,</v>

1012
00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:02.430
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just brilliant.</v>

1013
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.390
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless it's brilliant.</v>

1014
00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the rarity of that word should.</v>

1015
00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.700
<v Speaker 5>It should be so it would be used so </v>
<v Speaker 5>less,</v>

1016
00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.950
<v Speaker 5>but you go see Roger Waters at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hollywood bowl and like,</v>

1017
00:43:11.951 --> 00:43:13.360
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was brilliant.</v>

1018
00:43:13.361 --> 00:43:15.190
<v Speaker 5>Big Difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's of course,</v>

1019
00:43:15.191 --> 00:43:16.930
<v Speaker 5>that's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is brilliant,</v>

1020
00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:18.243
<v Speaker 5>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's decades of hard work and talent </v>

1021
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:22.060
<v Speaker 5>and so many things coming together to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make.</v>

1022
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.160
<v Speaker 5>I've watched him do the wall here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1023
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:29.190
<v Speaker 5>Three years ago at Staples Center and </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was sober rish.</v>

1024
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.800
<v Speaker 5>Let's just say that I was so British.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was microdosing and it was sobering.</v>

1025
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:34.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>but I was in a good space.</v>

1027
00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:41.170
<v Speaker 5>It was maybe one of the most incredible </v>
<v Speaker 5>visual things.</v>

1028
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.033
<v Speaker 5>Visual concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've ever seen in my fucking life to </v>

1029

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:44.943
<v Speaker 5>You ever seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They build the wall on stage as he's </v>

1031
00:43:46.721 --> 00:43:49.060
<v Speaker 5>performing and they tear it down in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of it all.</v>

1032
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:50.980
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're a part of black.</v>

1063
00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:57.594
<v Speaker 1>Twitter is the black community </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoning Kanye and there are only </v>

1064
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:02.880
<v Speaker 1>white people accepting him now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Jamie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the black.</v>

<v Speaker 1>White.</v>

1072
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 1>All white would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not all right yet.</v>

1073
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.860
<v Speaker 1>They're not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All white is all the batter's box.</v>

1074
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like on their way.</v>

1075
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.673
<v Speaker 1>The next step.</v>

1076
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.470
<v Speaker 1>What's all white?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call out?</v>

1077
00:45:33.471 --> 00:45:34.290
<v Speaker 1>White.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who like,</v>

1078
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 1>give me an example of a person who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>all white.</v>

1079
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.930
<v Speaker 1>It was whiter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one.</v>

1080
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Here's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the fucking Dilbert guy.</v>

1081
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Scott Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's all white.</v>

1082
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Who's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he's not all right,</v>

1083
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:49.890
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really brilliant guy,</v>

1084
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.520
<v Speaker 1>but he's like Sorta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh the comic seniors,</v>

1085
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1086
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.260
<v Speaker 1>seems like he had and I liked the guy a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>

1087
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:56.094
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like he had these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>about trump and now he's always just </v>

1088
00:45:59.221 --> 00:46:00.054
<v Speaker 1>trying to defend them with some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>circular logic and weird phrasing and </v>

1089
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.733
<v Speaker 1>he's a super smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he never said a single negative </v>

1090
00:46:07.051 --> 00:46:08.040
<v Speaker 1>thing about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always,</v>

1091
00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:08.874
<v Speaker 1>well it was a brilliant negotiator and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing is so strategy and he's </v>

1092
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 1>very persuasive and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1093
00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:14.483
<v Speaker 1>is he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what's going on or is he just </v>

1094
00:46:15.901 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 1>like flying by the seat of his pants </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a fucking maniac.</v>

1095
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.613
<v Speaker 1>And Are you just trying to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify all the other shit that you've </v>

1096
00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:24.840
<v Speaker 1>said about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really good.</v>

1097
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like to me.</v>

1098
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 1>People don't like Scott Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1099
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:29.530
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1100
00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think he's a very nice guy.</v>

1101
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 1>He's all white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all white.</v>

1102
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dance on this line that's like,</v>

1103
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.740
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not offensive over my house.</v>

1104
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Now they just have dinner with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's more youthful guy,</v>

1105
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.303
<v Speaker 1>he's he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's more into those positions that he </v>

1106
00:46:44.911 --> 00:46:47.860
<v Speaker 1>wants to probably admit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from a surface level he's like,</v>

1107
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:48.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1108
00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Like what positions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doggystyle style.</v>

1109
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Alt right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

1110
00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:54.240
<v Speaker 1>No mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's an ot?</v>

1111
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.083
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you think all white people fuck </v>

<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1114
00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:03.390
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do this the whole time.</v>

1115

1117
00:47:08.821 --> 00:47:11.610
<v Speaker 1>the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's all white.</v>

1148
00:48:22.031 --> 00:48:22.864
<v Speaker 6>times on a bit.</v>

1149
00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:27.080
<v Speaker 6>I can see how that didn't go over as </v>
<v Speaker 6>well though.</v>

1516
01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.950
<v Speaker 2>into the machine.</v>

1519
01:03:36.451 --> 01:03:37.284
<v Speaker 2>himself right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it says the oregon's had been </v>

1520
01:03:40.321 --> 01:03:41.154
<v Speaker 2>removed and replaced with paper scraps </v>
<v Speaker 2>printer printed with ancient chinese </v>

1521
01:03:44.941 --> 01:03:47.490
<v Speaker 2>characters.</v>

1524
01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.313
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were a month at wanting to </v>

1525
01:03:55.161 --> 01:03:58.670
<v Speaker 2>achieve enlightenment and be revered as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a living buddha,</v>

1526
01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:02.780
<v Speaker 2>self mummification was your brutal </v>
<v Speaker 2>option.</v>

1527
01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.750
<v Speaker 2>How is it brutal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monks in the spiritual path would starve</v>

1528
01:04:05.751 --> 01:04:08.660
<v Speaker 2>themselves for almost a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsisting on water,</v>

1529
01:04:08.661 --> 01:04:09.494
<v Speaker 2>seeds and nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they'd be sealed inside the statue </v>

1530
01:04:14.121 --> 01:04:18.320
<v Speaker 2>and ingest roots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pine bark and a toxic tree,</v>

1531
01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:21.740
<v Speaker 2>sap based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>t for another 1000 days,</v>

1532
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:24.320
<v Speaker 2>eating and breathing through a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>tube.</v>

1533
01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.513
<v Speaker 2>Eventually death would come and amongst </v>
<v Speaker 2>mummified this manner were said to have </v>

1534
01:04:29.691 --> 01:04:32.240
<v Speaker 2>reached enlightenment.</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking tube.</v>

1545
01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:57.373
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be ultimate panic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They starve themselves for almost a </v>

1546
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:01.783
<v Speaker 2>decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where would they piss and shit while </v>

1547
01:05:02.271 --> 01:05:04.220
<v Speaker 2>they're in here for a thousand days of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bob?</v>

1548
01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Come on a little pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would come right out of their mouth.</v>

1549
01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:12.140
<v Speaker 2>That's what motherfuckers you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the shit.</v>

1550
01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:13.653
<v Speaker 2>That's the glue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would stay in the statue and they </v>

1551
01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 2>would fill up with shit</v>

1552
01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>and went and that's when they die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1553
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.393
<v Speaker 1>That would took a thousand days to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gargle on shit until you finally smell </v>

1554
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:26.074
<v Speaker 1>shit up to your nostrils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have shit right up to the lip of </v>

1555
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an example of self mummification</v>

1556
01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:34.183
<v Speaker 1>fact that his organs removed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced the paper suggest that may not </v>

1557
01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:36.671
<v Speaker 1>be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

1558
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>So all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1559
01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>this all this could be bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be some dude just assholes</v>

1560
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>because this is an asshole article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toxic t,</v>

1561
01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>the toxic t thing I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

1562
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>That's just another mind control way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them solely killing our people.</v>

1563
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Toxic t.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But someone must have probably done that</v>

1564
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:57.400
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do,</v>

1565
01:05:57.401 --> 01:05:59.320
<v Speaker 1>there's always someone who's willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go further,</v>

1566
01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1567
01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do those ultra marathons,</v>

1568
01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:06.610
<v Speaker 1>right where they run like 200 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to.</v>

1569
01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Cameron hanes runs $9,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million miles a day,</v>

1570
01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.680
<v Speaker 1>whereas a marathon a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a machine.</v>

1571
01:06:11.681 --> 01:06:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Crazy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1572
01:06:13.151 --> 01:06:13.984
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're,</v>

1573
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:15.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going to do while we're doing all</v>

1574
01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:16.624
<v Speaker 1>this sober october fitness challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going to try to get more fitness </v>

1575
01:06:19.091 --> 01:06:21.130
<v Speaker 1>points in all of us combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably,</v>

1576
01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.680
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not that hard to be honest.</v>

1577
01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:26.460
<v Speaker 1>He could do it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1578
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:30.100
<v Speaker 1>what they're going to do now is a 500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile race,</v>

1579
01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:33.280
<v Speaker 1>500 fucking miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 miles.</v>

1580
01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.870
<v Speaker 1>They run stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He runs fast though.</v>

1581
01:06:34.871 --> 01:06:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It's all about time though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't,</v>

1582
01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>he'd have to run for six hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to,</v>

1583
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.700
<v Speaker 1>when you sit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is running guys 24 slash seven.</v>

1584
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sang about minutes.</v>

1585
01:06:46.061 --> 01:06:46.894
<v Speaker 1>So he had to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he runs three hours a day all the </v>

1586
01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:49.930
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he's running marathons,</v>

1587
01:06:49.931 --> 01:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>he's not running more than three hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathons.</v>

1588
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want three hours a day?</v>

1589
01:06:53.411 --> 01:06:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how many miles you know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1590
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:56.200
<v Speaker 1>how fast you run?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eight or nine miles an hour.</v>

1591
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you what.</v>

1592
01:06:58.161 --> 01:07:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's eight or nine grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His first 100 or no,</v>

1593
01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.210
<v Speaker 1>when he ran his first $200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big foot.</v>

1594
01:07:04.211 --> 01:07:05.044
<v Speaker 1>200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last Couple hours he was running a </v>

1595
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:10.450
<v Speaker 1>seven minute mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

1596
01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:11.284
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know insane it is that 10 </v>

1597
01:07:12.671 --> 01:07:14.170
<v Speaker 1>minutes?</v>

1598
01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:15.913
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much nine and some change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just to just understand how insane </v>

1599
01:07:18.581 --> 01:07:22.690
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He running for two straight days,</v>

1600
01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.553
<v Speaker 1>come on to run more than a hundred and </v>
<v Speaker 1>70 miles and then the last two plus </v>

1601
01:07:30.101 --> 01:07:31.510
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe even more.</v>

1602
01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:32.211
<v Speaker 1>He probably like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1603
01:07:32.211 --> 01:07:34.630
<v Speaker 1>it was actually five hours staunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1604
01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:37.600
<v Speaker 1>He's running seven minute miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking insane.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

1607
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 1>That's lit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I run,</v>

1608
01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:41.763
<v Speaker 1>I run five miles a day and that's if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my mind are like almost eight minute </v>

1609
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:47.110
<v Speaker 1>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven minute miles,</v>

1610
01:07:47.111 --> 01:07:49.720
<v Speaker 1>it could clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good to great.</v>

1611
01:07:49.721 --> 01:07:50.554
<v Speaker 1>You kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you were anyone that </v>

1612
01:07:51.431 --> 01:07:52.264
<v Speaker 1>runs over anyone that's just a casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner that runs over two or three </v>

1613
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:55.624
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They their goal usually is a eight to </v>

1614
01:07:57.611 --> 01:07:58.444
<v Speaker 1>nine minute miles to keep good pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven minute miles after you've already </v>

1615
01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:01.534
<v Speaker 1>run hundreds of miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was the point is like there's </v>

1616
01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:06.934
<v Speaker 1>always someone who's willing to take to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another place and that's the thing with </v>

1617
01:08:10.091 --> 01:08:12.280
<v Speaker 1>these buddhist assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always wanting to push.</v>

1618
01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:13.740
<v Speaker 1>One guy's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>seeds for a decade.</v>

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.160
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is great.</v>

1735
01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.560
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a girl that I dated,</v>

1736
01:13:37.561 --> 01:13:39.150
<v Speaker 6>I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>obviously I won't mention who,</v>

1737
01:13:39.151 --> 01:13:39.984
<v Speaker 6>but years and years and years ago I </v>
<v Speaker 6>dated a girl in college and she was so </v>

1738
01:13:43.021 --> 01:13:43.854
<v Speaker 6>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when she would come it was so </v>

1739
01:13:45.901 --> 01:13:47.430
<v Speaker 6>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it was like a.</v>

1740
01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.293
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was so exaggerated that I remember </v>

1741
01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:51.384
<v Speaker 6>catching myself in the mirror one time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>giving myself this face as she was </v>

1742
01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:54.804
<v Speaker 6>yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was going.</v>

1743
01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.200
<v Speaker 6>I was rolling my eyes like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>

1744
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:05.560
<v Speaker 6>but I was also like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my dick is in fucking like,</v>

1745
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:06.750
<v Speaker 6>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's not play the game.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Don't give me this.</v>

1748
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:15.610
<v Speaker 6>Do you think she was faking it or do you</v>
<v Speaker 6>think she was hyperbolizing her orgasms?</v>

1749
01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:19.450
<v Speaker 6>I think it was doing that to please you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think she thought it was pleasing me.</v>

1750
01:14:19.451 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 6>It was doing the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was making me go,</v>

1751
01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:21.843
<v Speaker 6>oh my god,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I just start crying.</v>

1754
01:14:39.221 --> 01:14:40.210

1756
01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.810
<v Speaker 6>You just hold your is exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's what porno does.</v>

1757
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.340
<v Speaker 6>Porno tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People in porn because porn girls like.</v>

1758
01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:51.573
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1759
01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 6>that's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1760
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:54.034
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever hear porn?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then they do that and you just want </v>

1761
01:14:55.391 --> 01:14:57.640
<v Speaker 6>to shut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Turn off the volume.</v>

1762
01:14:57.730 --> 01:14:58.840
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is absurd.</v>

1763
01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.823
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then you're going to look at her </v>

1764
01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:00.551
<v Speaker 6>face and.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1765
01:15:00.551 --> 01:15:01.900
<v Speaker 6>she's making stupid noises.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1766
01:15:01.901 --> 01:15:04.630
<v Speaker 6>because it's going to be distracting to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's already in there.</v>

1767
01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:06.050
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't disassociate.</v>

1768
01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:11.080
<v Speaker 6>This always impresses me in porno is </v>
<v Speaker 6>when like a girl is taken like a fucking</v>

1769
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.940
<v Speaker 6>12 inch dick like some and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 6>being loud.</v>

1770
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.310
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this girl is a fucking thug.</v>

1771
01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:22.840
<v Speaker 6>What a soldier that she's getting fucked</v>
<v Speaker 6>and she just like,</v>

1772
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:26.130
<v Speaker 6>it's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Me.</v>

1773
01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.200
<v Speaker 6>I like just looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're like this.</v>

1774
01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.120
<v Speaker 6>There's no way that's not painful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good point about porn though,</v>

1775
01:15:31.121 --> 01:15:31.954
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like people imitate like people </v>

1776
01:15:33.611 --> 01:15:34.444
<v Speaker 6>imitate behavior and films like we were </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about all the guido's and </v>

1777
01:15:36.911 --> 01:15:40.900
<v Speaker 6>imitate god father movies and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>soprano's that they imitate it,</v>

1778
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:42.900
<v Speaker 6>they see it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they want to act like it.</v>

1779
01:15:42.901 --> 01:15:46.660
<v Speaker 6>It's exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Emulate a lifestyle tHat's the same with</v>

1780
01:15:46.661 --> 01:15:48.110
<v Speaker 6>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sex.</v>

1781
01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:48.953
<v Speaker 6>There's got to be a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>are emulating the sounds and the noises </v>

1782
01:15:52.751 --> 01:15:53.584
<v Speaker 6>in the postures and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when do you think people started </v>

1783
01:15:57.401 --> 01:16:01.750
<v Speaker 6>regular coming in people's faces.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What year?</v>

1784
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.950
<v Speaker 6>What year was the first pioneer in porno</v>
<v Speaker 6>that did like a first come shot?</v>

1785
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.823
<v Speaker 6>Like in the thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think people get it in people's </v>

1786
01:16:08.171 --> 01:16:09.004
<v Speaker 6>faces are now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't ever pulled their dick </v>

1787
01:16:10.311 --> 01:16:11.141
<v Speaker 6>south.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They didn't know.</v>

1788
01:16:11.141 --> 01:16:12.750
<v Speaker 6>They didn't know you could pull out and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the thirties,</v>

1789
01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:14.890
<v Speaker 6>that was the name inside people and just</v>
<v Speaker 6>came inside everybody.</v>

1790
01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.060
<v Speaker 6>Everybody had a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1791
01:16:16.061 --> 01:16:17.540
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean you think about a timeline wise,</v>

1792
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:19.930
<v Speaker 6>like fucking pregnancy at.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at the baby boomer generation.</v>

1793
01:16:19.931 --> 01:16:23.380
<v Speaker 6>Not one person pulled out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My mom's one of 10 kids.</v>

1794
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.513
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody born in the fifties was ever </v>

1795
01:16:27.431 --> 01:16:29.410
<v Speaker 6>pulled out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean like everyone.</v>

1796
01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:30.363
<v Speaker 6>That's just what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then disease and then we and then </v>

1797
01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:34.264
<v Speaker 6>disease in the seventies and eighties </v>
<v Speaker 6>spawned this idea of condoms and </v>

1798
01:16:37.481 --> 01:16:39.280
<v Speaker 6>protection and then people started </v>
<v Speaker 6>learning.</v>

1799
01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:41.410
<v Speaker 6>maybe we will just not come inside of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

1800
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.080
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they say that one of the biggest changes</v>

1801
01:16:44.081 --> 01:16:44.914
<v Speaker 6>in culture was female birth control </v>
<v Speaker 6>because finally women had control of </v>

1802
01:16:48.461 --> 01:16:49.850
<v Speaker 6>their own reproductive side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1803
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:55.510
<v Speaker 6>But what comes with that is that theY </v>
<v Speaker 6>have to take hormones to achieve that.</v>

1804
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:58.150
<v Speaker 6>Yet he fucking up their chemical inside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>

1805
01:16:58.151 --> 01:17:01.750
<v Speaker 6>have you ever heard like what actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>happens to women?</v>

1806
01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:04.000
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't just fuck up their chemical </v>
<v Speaker 6>insides,</v>

1807
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:06.140
<v Speaker 6>fuck up their hormonal cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1808
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.053
<v Speaker 6>But it also fucks up their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 6>discern whether someone is compatible </v>

1809
01:17:09.411 --> 01:17:10.244
<v Speaker 6>with them</v>

1810
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.980
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it fucks up the science of there.</v>

1811
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:15.410
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing that women get,</v>

1812
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.950
<v Speaker 2>like there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris ryan was explaining this to me.</v>

1813
01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:19.993
<v Speaker 2>There's an actual smell like women can </v>
<v Speaker 2>pheromonal like when they're not on </v>

1814
01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:26.534
<v Speaker 2>birth control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if they get guys clothes and like </v>

1815
01:17:28.821 --> 01:17:29.960
<v Speaker 2>through a smell guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes,</v>

1816
01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:34.370
<v Speaker 2>they can literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are attracted to certain smells and</v>

1817
01:17:34.371 --> 01:17:39.371
<v Speaker 2>the men that the smell this way would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>more genetically compatible with them.</v>

1818
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:42.650
<v Speaker 2>So the pheromones literally is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairmont.</v>

1819
01:17:42.651 --> 01:17:44.300
<v Speaker 2>There's a pheromone blocker with birth </v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

1820
01:17:44.301 --> 01:17:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Then that's kinda what it confuses their</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1821
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:47.923
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women who are on birth control are much </v>

1822
01:17:50.001 --> 01:17:50.834
<v Speaker 2>more attractive attracted apparently to </v>
<v Speaker 2>alpha male type characters and </v>

1823
01:17:55.431 --> 01:17:57.350
<v Speaker 2>aggressive men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1824
01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:00.230
<v Speaker 2>There's something about birth control </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes them.</v>

1826
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:04.790
<v Speaker 2>They're not sure why their </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractiveness towards alpha males.</v>

1827
01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more attracted to alpha males.</v>

1828
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not really a negative thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

1829
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:12.470
<v Speaker 2>but they're more attracted to certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>types of people.</v>

1830
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:13.540
<v Speaker 2>And you gotta think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1831
01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:14.403
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm not a sociologist or a </v>

1832
01:18:19.431 --> 01:18:20.264
<v Speaker 2>biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wouldn't know what the fuck </v>

1833
01:18:21.411 --> 01:18:22.244
<v Speaker 2>would be the cause of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would think that it would have </v>

1834
01:18:23.961 --> 01:18:24.794
<v Speaker 2>something to do with their body wanting </v>
<v Speaker 2>something different than the baby that </v>

1835
01:18:27.831 --> 01:18:31.160
<v Speaker 2>they think is inside them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to be pregnant.</v>

1836
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:32.203
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the whole reason why you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get pregnant when you were on </v>

1837
01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:36.250
<v Speaker 2>birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Control is to pregnant.</v>

1838
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:37.363
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're walking around constantly in </v>

1839
01:18:38.721 --> 01:18:39.554
<v Speaker 2>the state of pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like why would you be more attracted </v>

1840
01:18:43.191 --> 01:18:45.890
<v Speaker 2>to alpha males or aggressive men?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1841
01:18:45.891 --> 01:18:46.724
<v Speaker 2>look at my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like hunting for a why that would </v>

1842
01:18:47.811 --> 01:18:48.644
<v Speaker 2>even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that would make sense as </v>

1843
01:18:49.941 --> 01:18:52.850
<v Speaker 2>you want something even more aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>or dominant,</v>

1844
01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:55.010
<v Speaker 2>tory or better or pretending what you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten.</v>

1845
01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Maybe more protective.</v>

1846
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you think maybe it's it goes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just superb nature.</v>

1847
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:02.120
<v Speaker 2>All those nature characteristics of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1848
01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need ultimate protection.</v>

1849
01:19:04.461 --> 01:19:05.294
<v Speaker 2>I need ultimate aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate strength and like these are </v>

1850
01:19:08.241 --> 01:19:09.440
<v Speaker 2>just all natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1851
01:19:09.441 --> 01:19:11.810
<v Speaker 2>all the fucking equality websites is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably lighten me up for that.</v>

1852
01:19:11.811 --> 01:19:13.010
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>go crazy.</v>

1853
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:15.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading this biologists account of</v>

1854
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.753
<v Speaker 2>what's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a term called hyper gummy that </v>

1855
01:19:19.581 --> 01:19:20.414
<v Speaker 2>it's a natural state for women to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted and to seek out men with </v>

1856
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.380
<v Speaker 2>higher social status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher financial status programming.</v>

1857
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and beTter physical specimens.</v>

1858
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:33.883
<v Speaker 2>that's just natural state where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>always looking for something bigger and </v>

1859
01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:40.190
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a genetic state and it's not.</v>

1860
01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.660
<v Speaker 2>It's no one's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1861
01:19:41.661 --> 01:19:44.240
<v Speaker 2>and women obviously don't have to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this,</v>

1862
01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:46.940
<v Speaker 2>but as a natural inclination that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

1863
01:19:47.290 --> 01:19:48.710
<v Speaker 2>like if the rock is there.</v>

1864
01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's perfect example.</v>

1865
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:52.610
<v Speaker 2>He's rich and he's handsome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>

1866
01:19:52.611 --> 01:19:55.490
<v Speaker 2>friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is a giant man and he's probably got</v>

1867
01:19:55.491 --> 01:20:00.491
<v Speaker 2>a huge hog and you're a woman is </v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally attracted to go towards him.</v>

1868
01:20:00.531 --> 01:20:01.410
<v Speaker 2>So am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1869
01:20:02.650 --> 01:20:05.390
<v Speaker 2>I know you got a great bit about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>

1870
01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:08.170
<v Speaker 2>this state is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called hyperthermia.</v>

1871
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that what I was reading about was </v>

1872
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:17.061
<v Speaker 2>this woman who had this awful betrayal </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this man and she was the.</v>

1873
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:18.463
<v Speaker 2>The biologist was relating it to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of hyperglycemia if they were </v>

1874
01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:25.320
<v Speaker 2>doing it in a very scientific sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical way.</v>

1875
01:20:25.690 --> 01:20:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Instead of like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this slot,</v>

1876
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:30.360
<v Speaker 2>they were saying this is a natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

1877
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women gravitate towards certain types of</v>

1878
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:35.430
<v Speaker 2>males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1879
01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:38.370
<v Speaker 2>and that this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is not discussed very often,</v>

1880
01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:38.801
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1881
01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:39.000
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1882
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:39.833
<v Speaker 5>because.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1883
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:40.673
<v Speaker 5>eSpecially because now we're bending all</v>
<v Speaker 5>these rules and names and terms and all </v>

1884
01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 5>this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the people.</v>

1885
01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:48.390
<v Speaker 5>I think there's such an escapism from </v>
<v Speaker 5>like the true nature of,</v>

1886
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of men and women.</v>

1887
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:52.500
<v Speaker 5>People don't want to talk about anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it doesn't exist.</v>

1888
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.140
<v Speaker 5>The denial of biology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so crazy to me.</v>

1889
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:56.063
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like this whole fucking </v>

1890
01:20:56.701 --> 01:20:57.534
<v Speaker 5>cavenaugh thing and all this shit and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't want to even get into all that </v>

1891
01:20:59.161 --> 01:20:59.994
<v Speaker 5>fucking said diatribe of nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the one thing I will say that I </v>

1892
01:21:03.211 --> 01:21:04.044
<v Speaker 5>don't think anybody talks about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sexual and social psychology of men and </v>

1893
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:08.514
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to talk about when you are </v>

1894
01:21:10.231 --> 01:21:12.810
<v Speaker 5>developing as a young teen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially a boy,</v>

1895
01:21:12.811 --> 01:21:13.644
<v Speaker 5>and you're learning about sexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're confused and embarrassed and </v>

1896
01:21:15.511 --> 01:21:18.990
<v Speaker 5>scared and the way that men and women </v>
<v Speaker 5>interact in that year,</v>

1897
01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:24.390
<v Speaker 5>in those years from like 12 to 16,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's insanely unstable because women are</v>

1898
01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:29.730
<v Speaker 5>not as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not as hormonally aggressive technically</v>

1899
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:30.690
<v Speaker 5>at that time that men are.</v>

1900
01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:33.840
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>so these men are fucking hormonal freaks</v>

1901
01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.520
<v Speaker 5>and they want to do things with these </v>
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>

1902
01:21:35.521 --> 01:21:36.354
<v Speaker 5>but they're not supposed to kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's kind of okay and they don't </v>

1903
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:41.580
<v Speaker 5>know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're these weird blurred lines of</v>

1904
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.570
<v Speaker 5>women want to be accepted in cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're in their circles.</v>

1905
01:21:44.571 --> 01:21:45.391
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1906
01:21:45.391 --> 01:21:46.224
<v Speaker 5>it's like when someone hooks up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone early on when poop to people </v>

1907
01:21:49.261 --> 01:21:50.460
<v Speaker 5>hook up young and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ooh.</v>

1908
01:21:50.461 --> 01:21:53.370
<v Speaker 5>And it's sketchy and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes the girl gets labeled a slut,</v>

1909
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:55.230
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For no reason.</v>

1910
01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:55.921
<v Speaker 5>It's Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1911
01:21:55.921 --> 01:21:57.450
<v Speaker 5>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember there was a girl in my,</v>

1912
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:59.630
<v Speaker 5>when we were what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1913
01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:03.150
<v Speaker 5>juniors and she was dating a senior and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they had had sex.</v>

1914
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:04.680
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it Was like,</v>

1915
01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:06.060
<v Speaker 5>she's a slut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's not a slut,</v>

1916
01:22:06.061 --> 01:22:09.300
<v Speaker 5>everybody wants to do this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are these weird subset rules,</v>

1917
01:22:09.301 --> 01:22:12.450
<v Speaker 5>but every guy that does it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just what we want to do.</v>

1918
01:22:12.451 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 5>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we.</v>

1919
01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.313
<v Speaker 5>There's no explanation over like how we </v>
<v Speaker 5>got to the point of getting comfortable </v>

1920
01:22:17.611 --> 01:22:18.444
<v Speaker 5>there because men are just these horny </v>
<v Speaker 5>freaks that don't know what to do with </v>

1921
01:22:20.911 --> 01:22:21.744
<v Speaker 5>the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there are so many blurred lines of </v>

1922
01:22:23.791 --> 01:22:27.060
<v Speaker 5>sexuality and relationships at that age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to talk about it.</v>

1923
01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.633
<v Speaker 2>Puritan culture and religion are two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that set women up in this </v>

1924
01:22:31.701 --> 01:22:32.534
<v Speaker 2>terrible place where they give into </v>
<v Speaker 2>their hormonal oranges there somehow </v>

1925
01:22:35.931 --> 01:22:37.400
<v Speaker 2>tainted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1926
01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.593
<v Speaker 2>I was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knew this and I'm sure you </v>

1927
01:22:40.071 --> 01:22:40.904
<v Speaker 2>knew this to everybody knew catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>school girls were the biggest fucking </v>

1928
01:22:43.961 --> 01:22:44.350
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1929
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:45.183
<v Speaker 5>First time I had anal catholics will </v>
<v Speaker 5>call a first and second time because </v>

1930
01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:51.180
<v Speaker 5>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're suppressed.</v>

1931
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:53.320
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There you're making diamonds.</v>

1932
01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.233
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can take in that you're putting it </v>

1933
01:22:55.541 --> 01:22:56.374
<v Speaker 5>under a mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at a fucking diamond is going to come </v>

1934

<v Speaker 5>it's catholic school girls,</v>

1936
01:23:01.751 --> 01:23:03.160

<v Speaker 5>And it's all over tHe country.</v>

1937

<v Speaker 5>Chicago,</v>

1943
01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.610
<v Speaker 5>They weren't on their jumpers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they had shorts on.</v>

1944
01:23:18.611 --> 01:23:19.444
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there was a marked difference </v>

1945
01:23:22.991 --> 01:23:23.824
<v Speaker 5>suppression right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>between catholic school girls and </v>

1946
01:23:25.541 --> 01:23:26.580
<v Speaker 5>regular girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

1947
01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.633
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I mean the public school girls </v>

1948
01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:28.951
<v Speaker 5>around me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

1949
01:23:28.951 --> 01:23:30.140
<v Speaker 5>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A whole different thing.</v>

1950
01:23:30.141 --> 01:23:31.870
<v Speaker 5>So most of them are private school rules</v>
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>

1951
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:33.340
<v Speaker 5>I was at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the biggest freak,</v>

1952
01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:36.040
<v Speaker 5>the dated during my high school years </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a girl.</v>

1953
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:39.250
<v Speaker 5>It was a wonderful girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she went to an all girl catholic.</v>

1954
01:23:39.251 --> 01:23:41.050
<v Speaker 5>Of course she was suppressed completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

1955
01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:42.173
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you hold someone in a cage like </v>

1956
01:23:43.241 --> 01:23:44.370
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think is gonna happen?</v>

1957
01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.273
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course when they get out they get </v>

1958
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.140
<v Speaker 5>wild and go nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scrub was nuts,</v>

1959
01:23:50.141 --> 01:23:51.460
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was wild.</v>

1960
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.301
<v Speaker 5>But that's.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2034
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the last word that took a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>convincing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>forties,</v>

<v Speaker 2>2:52</v>

2039
01:26:49.521 --> 01:26:50.880
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wasn't the original 44.</v>

2040
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:55.190
<v Speaker 2>My point is this shit has been going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever and it's fucking real and nobody</v>

2041
01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.320
<v Speaker 2>wants nothing to do with the cabinet </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2042
01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.153
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's the thing about the cabinet </v>

2043
01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:00.020
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean by that?</v>

2044
01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:00.923
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know,</v>

2045
01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:01.803
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the fact that you have to be </v>

2046
01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:04.550
<v Speaker 2>defensive right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has to go.</v>

2047
01:27:04.630 --> 01:27:06.220
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying.</v>

2048
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not supporting rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

2049
01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:08.613
<v Speaker 2>Or even discussing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All people are ready to fucking hit you </v>

2050
01:27:10.911 --> 01:27:11.690
<v Speaker 2>in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2051
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:15.950
<v Speaker 2>of course there's no conversation to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a woman who had a brutal take on</v>

2052
01:27:15.951 --> 01:27:16.880
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A brutal.</v>

2053
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:18.763
<v Speaker 2>There's two ways we can look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a woman who had a really brutal </v>

2054
01:27:21.201 --> 01:27:22.280
<v Speaker 2>take on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leah,</v>

2055
01:27:22.281 --> 01:27:25.610
<v Speaker 2>that was on Jordan peterson's a twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>page.</v>

2056
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:27.770
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Jordan peterson's twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>page,</v>

2057
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:32.630
<v Speaker 2>there's a woman who is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what she does,</v>

2058
01:27:32.631 --> 01:27:33.464
<v Speaker 2>but she talks about how this woman who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was aCcusing brett kavanaugh goes to </v>

2059
01:27:38.631 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 2>this predominantly.</v>

2060
01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.250
<v Speaker 2>She teaches at this predominantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>women's college,</v>

2061
01:27:43.251 --> 01:27:45.320
<v Speaker 2>were 79 percent of the students are </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

2062
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.573
<v Speaker 2>The majority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of the professors are </v>

2063
01:27:48.351 --> 01:27:49.184
<v Speaker 2>women and social justice is the number </v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that they promoted the school </v>

2064
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:55.363
<v Speaker 2>ahead of education of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the schools like list </v>

2065
01:27:58.221 --> 01:27:59.054
<v Speaker 2>of like what it aims to accomplish and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to educate the students like </v>

2066
01:28:02.630 --> 01:28:05.930
<v Speaker 2>promoting social justice is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary things.</v>

2067
01:28:05.931 --> 01:28:06.764
<v Speaker 2>IT's the first one above everything else</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea is that why would this </v>

2068
01:28:11.631 --> 01:28:12.464
<v Speaker 2>woman risk everything and with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman's take is who's criticizing this </v>

2069
01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:19.850
<v Speaker 2>is that she's not risking anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's rewarded from this.</v>

2070
01:28:20.130 --> 01:28:20.963
<v Speaker 2>Her culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a big deal and she's very </v>

2071
01:28:23.271 --> 01:28:24.470
<v Speaker 2>cynical about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

2072
01:28:24.471 --> 01:28:27.770
<v Speaker 2>this woman has no recollection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't remember how she got home,</v>

2073
01:28:27.771 --> 01:28:28.604
<v Speaker 2>doesn't remember where the party was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does remember that someone may have </v>

2074
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.490
<v Speaker 2>tried to do something to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2075
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:36.703
<v Speaker 2>I'm noT a big fan of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of criticizing people who come out and </v>

2076
01:28:39.531 --> 01:28:43.310
<v Speaker 2>say someone did something to them or try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do something because you don't know.</v>

2077
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:45.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't know you're on the outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking in and you're,</v>

2078
01:28:45.751 --> 01:28:46.584
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to pick holes in their </v>

2079
01:28:47.271 --> 01:28:49.880
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if they know because I</v>

2080
01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:50.714
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2081
01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.770
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2082
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:54.283
<v Speaker 2>If you click on the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hear some of what this woman </v>

2083
01:28:57.471 --> 01:29:01.590
<v Speaker 2>says like click on it and play some with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one says we don't have to,</v>

2084
01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:03.093
<v Speaker 10>notably by the lifelong friend who </v>
<v Speaker 10>supposedly accompanied blazzy forward </v>

2085
01:29:06.911 --> 01:29:09.130
<v Speaker 10>and presumably might have noticed.</v>

2086
01:29:09.930 --> 01:29:11.780
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Celtic.</v>

2087
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I can play that actually probably get </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked off.</v>

2088
01:29:14.890 --> 01:29:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

2089
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:16.520
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2090
01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.353
<v Speaker 2>the point is that like there's only two </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that know what really happened </v>

2091
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.820
<v Speaker 2>and they don't even know what really </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2092
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:21.743
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about something that </v>

2093
01:29:22.921 --> 01:29:26.250
<v Speaker 2>happened 35 fucking years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if he,</v>

2094
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:29.670
<v Speaker 2>if she said thirtY five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy raped me.</v>

2095
01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different story.</v>

2096
01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2097
01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2098
01:29:32.690 --> 01:29:34.410
<v Speaker 2>but this is not what she's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2099
01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:36.000
<v Speaker 2>What iS she saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My.</v>

2100
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:37.920
<v Speaker 2>From what I understood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

2101
01:29:37.921 --> 01:29:39.920
<v Speaker 2>this is something I distanced myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>from because I was just.</v>

2102
01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It was so overwhelming that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh god,</v>

2103
01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:42.653
<v Speaker 2>that he held her down while the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude was in the room and he kind of </v>

2104
01:29:45.451 --> 01:29:50.451
<v Speaker 2>helped him held to older down and he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>his penis on her or did he.</v>

2105
01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he's saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's find this because people got super</v>

2106
01:29:54.601 --> 01:29:55.950
<v Speaker 2>mad and we talKed about this the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

2107
01:29:55.951 --> 01:29:58.380
<v Speaker 2>like you should have done research for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You discussed a predator.</v>

2108
01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Might as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2109
01:30:00.230 --> 01:30:02.340
<v Speaker 2>that's what's impOrtant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2110
01:30:02.341 --> 01:30:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not supporting him anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not standing there.</v>

2111
01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:05.993
<v Speaker 2>None of the either none of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the thing is like when you </v>

2112
01:30:07.891 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 2>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone goes,</v>

2113
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:11.100
<v Speaker 2>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you In favor of him?</v>

2114
01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:12.053
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The you have to have a conversation </v>

2115
01:30:14.191 --> 01:30:15.680
<v Speaker 2>about what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I'm just,</v>

2116
01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:16.543
<v Speaker 2>I'm just numb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a giant platform and then if </v>

2117
01:30:18.901 --> 01:30:21.180
<v Speaker 2>we're discussing in this giant platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be informed.</v>

2118
01:30:21.181 --> 01:30:22.014
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with that because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're just having a conversation </v>

2119
01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:25.463
<v Speaker 2>about something you just happen to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>privy to this conversation because I'm </v>

2120
01:30:28.171 --> 01:30:29.004
<v Speaker 2>not pretending I'm some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>export or that I have some sort of </v>

2121
01:30:31.351 --> 01:30:34.650
<v Speaker 2>information that you don't know that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have those misconceptions,</v>

2122
01:30:34.651 --> 01:30:35.730
<v Speaker 2>let me clear those up right now.</v>

2196
01:33:49.911 --> 01:33:54.020
<v Speaker 2>it is to be a girl and when you're not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>

<v Speaker 2>all these guys</v>

2198
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 5>truth.</v>

2199
01:33:59.141 --> 01:33:59.974
<v Speaker 5>I can't live on the first floor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't just leave my window open at </v>

2200
01:34:01.871 --> 01:34:03.670
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like all these things are fucking very,</v>

2201
01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:04.440
<v Speaker 5>very true.</v>

2202
01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a good song and she's got a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>

2203
01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:08.950
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the.</v>

2204
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:10.260
<v Speaker 5>This is the whole thing that I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're.</v>

2205
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:11.143
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're allowed to see to see truth on </v>

2206
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:15.643
<v Speaker 5>all sides of all of these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you ever have to be so </v>

2207
01:34:17.931 --> 01:34:18.764
<v Speaker 5>staunch about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I disagree with people that are so </v>

2208
01:34:20.481 --> 01:34:23.240
<v Speaker 5>staunch about just being like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the end of the discussion.</v>

2209
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:24.650
<v Speaker 5>You're only this way or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2210
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:26.930
<v Speaker 5>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know all the stories.</v>

2211
01:34:26.931 --> 01:34:29.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't know all the truths of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the cabin.</v>

2212
01:34:29.051 --> 01:34:29.884
<v Speaker 5>All bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know all the truths of anything </v>

2213
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:32.143
<v Speaker 5>that woman coming forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tend to believe a woman that's gonna </v>

2214
01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.890
<v Speaker 5>go out of her way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think she's looking for fame.</v>

2215
01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't think any of the girls that came</v>
<v Speaker 5>out from louis,</v>

2216
01:34:38.571 --> 01:34:39.404
<v Speaker 5>we're looking for fame and attention to </v>
<v Speaker 5>one wants attention to have their name </v>

2217
01:34:41.871 --> 01:34:44.150
<v Speaker 5>googled and come up with this for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rest of their life.</v>

2218
01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.430
<v Speaker 5>So I wouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

2219
01:34:46.431 --> 01:34:47.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say no one.</v>

2220
01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:51.830
<v Speaker 5>I think most people don't want that kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>

2221
01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:52.990
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what,</v>

2222
01:34:53.010 --> 01:34:53.880
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2223
01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:55.280
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who doesn't want that kind of attention?</v>

2224
01:34:56.150 --> 01:34:57.920
<v Speaker 5>The psychopaths.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2228
01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:02.630

<v Speaker 6>attention.</v>

2229

<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry.</v>

2231
01:35:05.601 --> 01:35:08.240
<v Speaker 6>she did was make fun of his penis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like she wants money.</v>

2234
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:13.880

<v Speaker 6>It's fucking sad.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Ford and these other women,</v>

2236
01:35:17.450 --> 01:35:18.980

<v Speaker 6>the future.</v>

2314
01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.233

<v Speaker 6>That is the most potent.</v>

<v Speaker 6>school.</v>

2335
01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:30.120
<v Speaker 6>Maybe just like student teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't get shit.</v>

2336

2338
01:39:35.221 --> 01:39:36.054
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the most embarrassing thing my </v>

2339
01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:37.643
<v Speaker 6>father did to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were eating dinner when I first </v>

2340
01:39:38.581 --> 01:39:40.710
<v Speaker 6>started jerking off and figuring it out </v>
<v Speaker 6>and shit.</v>

2341
01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:44.220
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my dad at dinner in front of my whole,</v>

2342
01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:45.960
<v Speaker 6>my family,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my dad was like,</v>

2343
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.240
<v Speaker 6>you've been spending a lot of time in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the bathroom,</v>

2344
01:39:48.450 --> 01:39:49.740
<v Speaker 6>and my mom was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2345
01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:51.293
<v Speaker 6>stop it.</v>

2346
01:39:53.730 --> 01:39:54.563
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these motherfuckers had been talking </v>

2347
01:39:56.851 --> 01:39:57.684
<v Speaker 6>about me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They know I'm jerking off and they've </v>

2348
01:39:58.711 --> 01:40:02.160
<v Speaker 6>had multiple conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know it must be whacking off again,</v>

2349
01:40:02.161 --> 01:40:03.820
<v Speaker 6>that little fucking horn ball because I </v>
<v Speaker 6>would,</v>

2350
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:05.650
<v Speaker 6>I would lock the door and go in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>bathroom.</v>

2351
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:08.250
<v Speaker 6>I got a stomach ache if my mother ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>said to embarrass you,</v>

2352
01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:09.240
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my god.</v>

2353
01:40:09.241 --> 01:40:11.670
<v Speaker 6>In front of my fucking inside my sisters</v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

2354
01:40:11.671 --> 01:40:12.680
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my god.</v>

2355
01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:13.860
<v Speaker 6>And my mom was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2356
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:15.330
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And my dad was like,</v>

2357
01:40:15.331 --> 01:40:16.260
<v Speaker 6>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing,</v>

2358
01:40:16.261 --> 01:40:18.260
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I just knew it was him taking that.</v>

2359
01:40:18.450 --> 01:40:23.010
<v Speaker 6>You know what it was now as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I know that to my son.</v>

2360
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.230
<v Speaker 6>I'll take a shot like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was just a guy shooting.</v>

2361
01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:27.390
<v Speaker 6>But you would tell your son.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>

2362
01:40:27.391 --> 01:40:29.310
<v Speaker 6>but I would shit on them a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 6>too because that was funny.</v>

2363
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:30.930
<v Speaker 6>It was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was very funny.</v>

2364
01:40:30.931 --> 01:40:31.764
<v Speaker 6>In retrospect it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he bought me a kathy Ireland </v>

2365
01:40:33.271 --> 01:40:34.740
<v Speaker 6>poster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember kathy Ireland?</v>

2366
01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:36.900
<v Speaker 6>He bought me a kathy Ireland poster and </v>
<v Speaker 6>he was like,</v>

2367
01:40:36.901 --> 01:40:38.760
<v Speaker 6>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he said something along the lines of</v>

2368
01:40:38.761 --> 01:40:41.790
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a don't let this get stuck together.</v>

2369
01:40:41.791 --> 01:40:42.790
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ooh,</v>

2370
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:44.183
<v Speaker 6>but I know he's just a fucking jerk off </v>

<v Speaker 1>Joe really recently talking and I was </v>

2558
01:48:06.061 --> 01:48:06.894
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

2560
01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:10.133
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking great bubble of having </v>

2561
01:48:13.410 --> 01:48:15.070
<v Speaker 1>normal talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2562
01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:15.973
<v Speaker 1>it's all like theatrical and animated </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think years of I think years </v>

2563
01:48:19.531 --> 01:48:23.370
<v Speaker 1>of of acting and stuff late in his brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now that he's kinda like,</v>

2564
01:48:23.371 --> 01:48:24.204
<v Speaker 1>he's off the edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he feels like he has to be a </v>

2565
01:48:26.341 --> 01:48:28.170
<v Speaker 1>caricature to like feel normal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2567
01:48:29.341 --> 01:48:30.174

<v Speaker 1>thAt's the way he masks the serious </v>

2568
01:48:33.361 --> 01:48:36.450
<v Speaker 1>brain trauma and pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever pain is really going on.</v>

2569

<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's fine.</v>

2570
01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:39.140

<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>

2649
01:51:42.171 --> 01:51:43.004
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the motorcycle operator passengers </v>

2650
01:51:44.561 --> 01:51:46.690
<v Speaker 1>are under 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must wear a helmet.</v>

2651
01:51:46.730 --> 01:51:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Passengers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>passenger law,</v>

2652
01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:53.600
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the under 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2653
01:51:53.770 --> 01:51:56.080
<v Speaker 1>if they're over 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can Do whatever the fuck they want.</v>

2654
01:51:56.230 --> 01:51:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it says?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

2655
01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:00.400
<v Speaker 1>so there isn't a helmet law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

2656
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:02.610
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're 18 or if you're 60 minutes,</v>

2657
01:52:03.070 --> 01:52:03.903
<v Speaker 1>they have helmet laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying is three states </v>

2658
01:52:05.801 --> 01:52:09.000
<v Speaker 1>have no helmet laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means under 18,</v>

2659
01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:10.820
<v Speaker 1>over eight doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2660
01:52:10.821 --> 01:52:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some states have laws,</v>

2661
01:52:12.641 --> 01:52:15.700
<v Speaker 1>but grown ass adults can decide to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

2662
01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:18.280
<v Speaker 1>They won't style and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

2663
01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:19.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy weird that people </v>

2664
01:52:20.861 --> 01:52:24.370
<v Speaker 1>would fight for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like saying no seatbelt law.</v>

2665
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:25.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you don't.</v>

2666
01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to wear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>

2667

<v Speaker 1>like how is it okay to ride a </v>

<v Speaker 2>don't know what it's good for.</v>

2762
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:24.570
<v Speaker 2>People that have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is stands for.</v>

2765
01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:31.073
<v Speaker 2>He had obviously he was drinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly and he was traveling </v>

2766
01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:36.713
<v Speaker 2>constantly and he wasn't exercising </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol and he had had some health </v>

2767
01:56:41.671 --> 01:56:42.504
<v Speaker 2>issues and so they put them on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>statens and he started doing brazilian </v>

2768
01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.010

<v Speaker 2>changed his diet,</v>

<v Speaker 2>off the statens.</v>

2771
01:56:56.420 --> 01:57:00.330
<v Speaker 2>But statens have siGnificant health </v>
<v Speaker 2>risks attached to them.</v>

2772
01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:03.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not as simple as they just lower </v>

<v Speaker 2>but you mentioned something that now </v>
<v Speaker 2>clicked into my head with the mediator </v>

2781
01:57:21.991 --> 01:57:24.150
<v Speaker 2>show that your friend does steve when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

2782
01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:25.043
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a clip I just saw </v>

2783
01:57:26.111 --> 01:57:29.520
<v Speaker 2>online of him using rendering bear fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>to cook bear.</v>

2784
01:57:29.850 --> 01:57:30.683
<v Speaker 2>I just had watched that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was fucking amazing </v>

2785
01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:34.140
<v Speaker 2>because he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2786
01:57:34.141 --> 01:57:35.580
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard of that before.</v>

2787
01:57:35.581 --> 01:57:39.600
<v Speaker 2>That you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can boil down the bear fat to use as</v>

2788
01:57:39.630 --> 01:57:40.463
<v Speaker 2>oil to cook the rest of the meat because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying it was so rich that it was </v>

2789
01:57:44.551 --> 01:57:49.290
<v Speaker 2>almost like you could fry neat in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did fry me to fucking blind people.</v>

2790
01:57:49.291 --> 01:57:54.291
<v Speaker 2>Have you been using bear fat for ages?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For lard to cook pies?</v>

2791
01:57:54.781 --> 01:57:55.614
<v Speaker 2>And he was actually talking about on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast recently that he has a great </v>

2792
01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:00.570
<v Speaker 2>podcast as well called mediator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same name.</v>

2793
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:01.703
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the podcast they were discussing how </v>

2794
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:04.703
<v Speaker 2>a fat was used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's him there at the rendering this </v>

2795
01:58:09.391 --> 01:58:10.224
<v Speaker 2>bear fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a particularly interesting </v>

2796
01:58:11.251 --> 01:58:14.880
<v Speaker 2>episode because this was all about bears</v>
<v Speaker 2>who eat blueberries.</v>

2797
01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:19.940
<v Speaker 2>So all that fat had a purple tone to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a purple hue to it because the bears had</v>

2798
01:58:20.671 --> 01:58:24.060
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had been subsisting on blueberries.</v>

2799
01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:29.420
<v Speaker 2>So they tasted like blueberries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blueberry fat was supposed to be fucking</v>

2800
01:58:30.601 --> 01:58:33.480
<v Speaker 2>incredible and you render it down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make lard out of it.</v>

2801
01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:37.500
<v Speaker 2>And that lord is good literally for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and use it for cooking and for all</v>

2802
01:58:37.501 --> 01:58:39.890
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But bear lard,</v>

2803
01:58:39.891 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 2>like I have my good friends,</v>

<v Speaker 1>hunting operation up there and they bear</v>

2806
01:58:49.871 --> 01:58:54.871
<v Speaker 1>all the time and they render bear fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>into these jars of bear lard.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

3219
02:15:18.330 --> 02:15:19.890
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get edited out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>context for sure.</v>

3220
02:15:20.250 --> 02:15:21.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>

3221
02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:26.700
<v Speaker 2>I liked this woman expressing herself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>an artistic way that represents the real</v>

3222
02:15:26.881 --> 02:15:29.340
<v Speaker 2>threat that women face and it's also a </v>
<v Speaker 2>catchy song.</v>

3223
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:31.140
<v Speaker 2>She's got a beautiful voice and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>still a man.</v>

3224
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still.</v>

3225
02:15:31.771 --> 02:15:34.140
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things are allowed to coexist.</v>

3226
02:15:34.141 --> 02:15:36.120
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't somehow or another become some</v>

3227
02:15:36.121 --> 02:15:39.290
<v Speaker 2>sort of a cook or a pussy or it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean that you're,</v>

3228
02:15:39.770 --> 02:15:40.603
<v Speaker 2>you're a loser or that your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know when someone's faking </v>

3229
02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:45.713
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're giving in totally pressure </v>

3230
02:15:47.670 --> 02:15:51.000
<v Speaker 2>and pretending like actress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use the word wonderful.</v>

3231
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Describe a woman's performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we were talking about.</v>

3232
02:15:53.950 --> 02:15:56.800
<v Speaker 2>We no fake shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We no fake shit and it was very good.</v>

3233
02:15:56.850 --> 02:15:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Too much goddamn fake shit in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3234
02:15:58.830 --> 02:15:59.663
<v Speaker 2>So one of the more interesting things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's come out of this podcast is </v>

3235
02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:07.280
<v Speaker 2>because I don't have a person telling me</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do and I can just be myself.</v>

3236
02:16:08.490 --> 02:16:10.380
<v Speaker 2>People like guys go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3237
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:14.390
<v Speaker 2>this is like hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what it would be if we were just</v>

3238
02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:16.650
<v Speaker 2>hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people are listening,</v>

3239
02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:19.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But normal things.</v>

3240
02:16:19.410 --> 02:16:22.420
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to just hang out because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when people are listening,</v>

3241
02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:26.040
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to tone the language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>she say she can't say things.</v>

3242
02:16:26.190 --> 02:16:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Don't say careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't say it to say that word.</v>

3243
02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:31.353
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's so much misconstrued </v>

3244
02:16:32.291 --> 02:16:33.124
<v Speaker 2>nonsense people because people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to take any opinion that you </v>

3245
02:16:35.861 --> 02:16:37.600
<v Speaker 2>have because they don't know your full </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>

3246
02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:38.433
<v Speaker 2>They knew a piece of what you think here</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just ripped that out and throw </v>

3247
02:16:40.661 --> 02:16:43.840
<v Speaker 2>that into fucking space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's recreAtional outrage.</v>

3248
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.823
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're finding a nice little juicy </v>

3249
02:16:46.331 --> 02:16:47.260
<v Speaker 2>target like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3250
02:16:47.261 --> 02:16:51.340
<v Speaker 2>let's go after it and it'll be whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck it is when whoever's next,</v>

<v Speaker 2>whoever gets called out for something </v>

3252
02:16:54.941 --> 02:16:56.740
<v Speaker 2>and someone whether they're guilty or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3253
02:16:56.741 --> 02:16:59.700
<v Speaker 2>who gives a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's pile on to that motherfucker right</v>

3254
02:16:59.950 --> 02:17:00.783
<v Speaker 2>and ruin their life for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks and this is what's going on in </v>

3255
02:17:02.981 --> 02:17:05.500
<v Speaker 2>this world and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for anybody.</v>

3256
02:17:05.510 --> 02:17:07.030
<v Speaker 2>It's for men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for women.</v>

3257
02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:09.160
<v Speaker 2>There's only one good piece of it at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

3258
02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:11.920

<v Speaker 2>This is a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a girl who gave harvey weinstein</v>

3282
02:18:19.421 --> 02:18:20.950
<v Speaker 2>a blow job.</v>

<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to send you the actual thing </v>

<v Speaker 2>that I got here.</v>

3285
02:18:24.310 --> 02:18:24.530
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

3286
02:18:24.530 --> 02:18:25.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me one second.</v>

3287
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:30.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and her former employee was like,</v>

3288
02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:36.610
<v Speaker 2>this is not what she said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not what she said to me.</v>

3289
02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:38.013
<v Speaker 2>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were saying that it was in danger </v>

3290
02:18:40.001 --> 02:18:42.070
<v Speaker 2>of being thrown out and now it is thrown</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

3291
02:18:42.990 --> 02:18:47.740
<v Speaker 2>So she lied about what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the judge was like,</v>

3292
02:18:47.741 --> 02:18:49.600
<v Speaker 2>fuck this shit yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well don,</v>

3293
02:18:49.630 --> 02:18:53.980
<v Speaker 2>they essentially said that this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she look,</v>

3294
02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:58.990
<v Speaker 2>there are actual sexual assault victims </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there are people,</v>

3295
02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:02.830
<v Speaker 2>there's also people I think that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

3296
02:19:03.130 --> 02:19:03.963
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have a real accurate </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory of things that have happened and </v>

3297
02:19:09.731 --> 02:19:10.564
<v Speaker 2>so they can paint themselves as a victim</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be deceptive about it in </v>

3298
02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:16.780
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's entirely possible.</v>

3299
02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:17.633
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a certain amount of </v>

3300
02:19:18.071 --> 02:19:21.160
<v Speaker 2>people that are just delusional and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just don't see things accurately.</v>

3301
02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Did you get the texts that I sent you?</v>

3302
02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:24.473
<v Speaker 2>But I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you all.</v>

3303
02:19:24.490 --> 02:19:26.970
<v Speaker 2>But I also still know that harvey </v>
<v Speaker 2>weinstein is,</v>

3304
02:19:27.290 --> 02:19:28.123
<v Speaker 2>is a fucking a sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just too many women that are </v>

3305
02:19:30.411 --> 02:19:34.940
<v Speaker 2>saying that he forced himself on them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he did an audio of him without girl.</v>

3306
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.830
<v Speaker 2>You heard that audio?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard of it.</v>

3307
02:19:36.831 --> 02:19:39.200
<v Speaker 2>I didn't listen to some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcripts,</v>

3308
02:19:39.350 --> 02:19:42.140
<v Speaker 2>but there was also that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll make this bigger.</v>

3309
02:19:42.141 --> 02:19:45.260
<v Speaker 2>So my stupid old eyes can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say old eyes,</v>

3310
02:19:45.261 --> 02:19:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I can get bigger too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3311
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.660
<v Speaker 2>she accused weinstein of forcing her to </v>
<v Speaker 2>perform oral sex,</v>

3312
02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:54.530
<v Speaker 2>but a prior employee of evan's turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>over personal writing.</v>

3313
02:19:54.531 --> 02:19:55.364
<v Speaker 2>She'd left in the company's computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which appeared to contradict the grand </v>

3314
02:19:57.291 --> 02:19:58.124
<v Speaker 2>jury testimony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The writings indicated was consensual </v>

3315
02:20:00.621 --> 02:20:03.470
<v Speaker 2>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A source told the post that has caused a</v>

3316
02:20:03.471 --> 02:20:06.050
<v Speaker 2>split in the manhattan manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 2>district attorney's office.</v>

3317
02:20:06.051 --> 02:20:06.884
<v Speaker 2>Some believe the charges should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped if there's a problem with this </v>

3318
02:20:08.751 --> 02:20:09.290
<v Speaker 2>complaint.</v>

3319
02:20:09.290 --> 02:20:11.000
<v Speaker 2>And then it was just so it was dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3320
02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:12.110
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

3321
02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:14.840
<v Speaker 2>it's the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

3322
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:16.710
<v Speaker 2>It's hard man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like you,</v>

3323
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:18.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3324
02:20:18.861 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 2>these girls were all lying because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not of course.</v>

3325
02:20:21.921 --> 02:20:24.260
<v Speaker 2>But one of them could be lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3326
02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when one of them's lying,</v>

3327
02:20:26.390 --> 02:20:29.090
<v Speaker 2>they've got to do what they did and </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw that case out.</v>

3328
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:31.030
<v Speaker 2>But then he's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3329
02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:33.740
<v Speaker 2>it's all fabricated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3330
02:20:34.610 --> 02:20:38.390
<v Speaker 2>there's people that will be opportunists</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face of a scandal.</v>

3331
02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:39.373
<v Speaker 2>So There's a scandal where someone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually legitimately done awful things </v>

3332
02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:42.913
<v Speaker 2>and someone is going to stand up and say</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did awful things to me when really </v>

3333
02:20:45.471 --> 02:20:47.840
<v Speaker 2>they just fuck the guy because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to advance their career.</v>

3334
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:48.770
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

3335
02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:49.713
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would always argue the majority of </v>

3336
02:20:51.621 --> 02:20:56.300
<v Speaker 2>people that get involved in this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably aren't full of shit.</v>

3337
02:20:56.630 --> 02:21:00.950
<v Speaker 2>There is always is always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that want to capitalize.</v>

3338
02:21:00.980 --> 02:21:02.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real problem.</v>

3339
02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:03.733
<v Speaker 2>Human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do that all the time in every </v>

3340
02:21:04.791 --> 02:21:05.624
<v Speaker 2>facet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that people that lied about </v>

3341
02:21:07.250 --> 02:21:08.083
<v Speaker 2>September 11th where they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people environmentally lie about </v>

3342
02:21:10.551 --> 02:21:13.180
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's power.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

3355
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:28.850
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have anywhere near political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that wasn't that.</v>

3356
02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:29.713
<v Speaker 2>There's something about hillary clinton </v>
<v Speaker 2>lied about being in the middle of a </v>

3357
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:35.360
<v Speaker 2>gunfire situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looking people,</v>

3358
02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:37.310
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they exaggerate.</v>

3359
02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:38.233
<v Speaker 2>They make things up and some people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just full of shit and then there's </v>

3360
02:21:40.671 --> 02:21:41.504
<v Speaker 2>people that are delusional and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a problem with reality and they might </v>

3361
02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:47.750
<v Speaker 2>legitimately believe it's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>awful happened to them.</v>

3362
02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:48.753
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people that do things like </v>

3363
02:21:49.611 --> 02:21:52.430
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's not all deceptive.</v>

3364
02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:53.353
<v Speaker 2>There's people that have legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental issues and they have a paranoid </v>

3365
02:21:57.561 --> 02:21:59.780
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia to whatever extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3366
02:21:59.781 --> 02:22:04.781
<v Speaker 2>whether it's mild or horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have a delusional perception of</v>

3367
02:22:05.931 --> 02:22:06.764
<v Speaker 2>the world around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think people are out to get them </v>

3368
02:22:07.970 --> 02:22:08.803
<v Speaker 2>totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then those people get caught up in </v>

3369
02:22:10.181 --> 02:22:11.210
<v Speaker 2>the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also,</v>

3370
02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:12.830
<v Speaker 2>there's also selective memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3371
02:22:12.831 --> 02:22:14.840
<v Speaker 2>There's also manipulation of selective </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>

3372
02:22:14.841 --> 02:22:15.500
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3373
02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:18.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of study about people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have convinced themselves that something</v>

3374
02:22:18.441 --> 02:22:19.274
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but It really didn't happen that that's </v>

3375
02:22:20.151 --> 02:22:20.984
<v Speaker 2>a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really believe and they're not </v>

3376
02:22:22.821 --> 02:22:26.340
<v Speaker 2>lying because in their brain that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally with their brain has</v>

3377
02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:30.390
<v Speaker 5>kind of categorize and formulated was </v>
<v Speaker 5>that thing did happen.</v>

3378
02:22:30.391 --> 02:22:31.224
<v Speaker 5>They've told themselves that enough </v>
<v Speaker 5>where it's been convinced in their own </v>

3379
02:22:32.761 --> 02:22:34.440
<v Speaker 5>mind that it did happen</v>

3380
02:22:35.310 --> 02:22:36.143
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's trying to explain that about </v>

3381
02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:38.333
<v Speaker 2>oj.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were saying that oj has lied so </v>

3382
02:22:39.811 --> 02:22:43.770
<v Speaker 2>many times about what happened that </v>
<v Speaker 2>night that he might in his own mind,</v>

3383
02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:45.390
<v Speaker 2>he didn't actually believe he didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3384
02:22:45.420 --> 02:22:47.970
<v Speaker 2>That's wild as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the human memory,</v>

3385
02:22:47.971 --> 02:22:51.430
<v Speaker 2>like neil degrasse tyson was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain this to me that when you,</v>

3386
02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:53.790
<v Speaker 2>when you were taught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about memory,</v>

3387
02:22:53.900 --> 02:22:58.580
<v Speaker 2>you are literally talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst form of evidence that we know of.</v>

3388
02:22:59.890 --> 02:23:02.460
<v Speaker 2>The memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your memory is.</v>

3389
02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:03.593
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your memory really is your memory of </v>

3390
02:23:06.211 --> 02:23:08.430
<v Speaker 2>your memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even your memory.</v>

3391
02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:09.293
<v Speaker 2>It's a memory of you recounting what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to remember and then sort of </v>

3392
02:23:12.901 --> 02:23:15.720
<v Speaker 2>reestablishing it in your narrative of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the past.</v>

3393
02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:16.260
<v Speaker 5>RighT.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3394
02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:20.060
<v Speaker 5>it's a recounting of a thing you tried </v>
<v Speaker 5>to recount.</v>

3395
02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm pretty sure when that girl blew</v>

3396
02:23:21.961 --> 02:23:22.830
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 16,</v>

3397
02:23:22.831 --> 02:23:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I did have my ears ringing because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember like,</v>

3398
02:23:26.370 --> 02:23:27.990
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy,</v>

3399
02:23:27.991 --> 02:23:30.120
<v Speaker 2>and it's never happened since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe not now.</v>

3400
02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:31.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3401
02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:33.960
<v Speaker 2>it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I know.</v>

3402
02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:35.063
<v Speaker 2>She did rape me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't punch me in the face and hit </v>

3403
02:23:37.021 --> 02:23:39.840
<v Speaker 2>me over the head with a frying pan to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>ears rang.</v>

3404
02:23:40.350 --> 02:23:42.280
<v Speaker 2>She didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be funny.</v>

3405
02:23:42.330 --> 02:23:43.163
<v Speaker 2>Zero hit you over the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be funny if my head went to the </v>

3406
02:23:46.111 --> 02:23:46.944
<v Speaker 2>shape of a frying pan like those </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoons and then I had to go because </v>

3407
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:53.940
<v Speaker 2>you can see it's back to normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard.</v>

3408
02:23:53.941 --> 02:23:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My head was in a fried.</v>

3409
02:23:59.940 --> 02:24:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

3410
02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm optimistic.</v>

3411
02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:07.580
<v Speaker 2>This is what I think about when when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people talk about the,</v>

3412
02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:08.533
<v Speaker 2>the the divide between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see it that much in real life </v>

3413
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:15.310
<v Speaker 2>and they'll see it in my actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions on the internet.</v>

3414
02:24:15.311 --> 02:24:16.144
<v Speaker 2>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3415
02:24:16.270 --> 02:24:17.103
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The internet is just writing things and </v>

3416
02:24:19.351 --> 02:24:20.184
<v Speaker 2>you're not being there with the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talking to the person so you don't </v>

3417
02:24:22.891 --> 02:24:24.780
<v Speaker 2>know if the people are writing things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are reasonable.</v>

3418
02:24:24.781 --> 02:24:27.270
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if the people were angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3419
02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:27.830
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

3420
02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:28.663
<v Speaker 5>There's no legitimacy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no legitimization to the </v>

3421
02:24:30.141 --> 02:24:34.220
<v Speaker 5>internet anymore because it can come </v>
<v Speaker 5>from memory one anywhere at any time and</v>

3422
02:24:34.221 --> 02:24:35.380
<v Speaker 5>the problem I have with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

3423
02:24:35.430 --> 02:24:36.263
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with these growth movements that get </v>

3424
02:24:39.321 --> 02:24:42.350
<v Speaker 5>like crazy is you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are they talking to anybody else besides</v>

3425
02:24:42.351 --> 02:24:43.184
<v Speaker 5>their little internal group?</v>
<v Speaker 5>like are you talking to anybody other </v>

3426
02:24:45.501 --> 02:24:47.690
<v Speaker 5>than the people that you know because if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not,</v>

3427
02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:49.780
<v Speaker 5>you're not getting any sort of outside </v>
<v Speaker 5>opinion or sources.</v>

3428
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:52.310
<v Speaker 5>You're just listening to people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>agree with you already.</v>

3429
02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:54.020
<v Speaker 5>That the echo chamber thing is so </v>
<v Speaker 5>annoying.</v>

3430
02:24:54.021 --> 02:24:56.030
<v Speaker 5>To me it's like as annoying on the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>page.</v>

3431
02:24:56.031 --> 02:24:56.670
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3432
02:24:56.670 --> 02:24:58.010
<v Speaker 5>stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't.</v>

3433
02:24:58.011 --> 02:25:00.170
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't help any case at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you?</v>

3434
02:25:00.410 --> 02:25:03.470
<v Speaker 5>Are you actually trying to see what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other side is saying?</v>

3435
02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:06.740
<v Speaker 5>I think there are some people that do a </v>
<v Speaker 5>good job.</v>

3436
02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:08.193
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to mention names of life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are some people that I follow </v>

3437
02:25:09.771 --> 02:25:10.604
<v Speaker 5>online that do a great job of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to have good discourse of right </v>

<v Speaker 1>you and then they get mad at category.</v>

<v Speaker 1>iraqi gay nonbinary and also identifies </v>

3513
02:28:40.101 --> 02:28:43.850
<v Speaker 6>them because you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when someone says stephen hawkings,</v>

02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:47.960
<v Speaker 6>identifying as a british identified as a</v>

<v Speaker 6>of cheating and found a way to cheat on </v>

<v Speaker 6>his could feel things.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That was his side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The scientist,</v>

<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

3531
02:29:21.621 --> 02:29:22.454
<v Speaker 6>He used to go to strip clubs and there's</v>
<v Speaker 6>like videos of him like rolling into a </v>

3532
02:29:25.071 --> 02:29:27.620
<v Speaker 6>strip club in the wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he would go.</v>

3538
02:29:39.021 --> 02:29:40.670
<v Speaker 6>wife was because he fell in love with </v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody else,</v>

02:29:40.671 --> 02:29:42.590
<v Speaker 6>but wasn't it like a nurse?</v>

<v Speaker 1>came up with the strip club?</v>

3678
02:36:11.841 --> 02:36:12.674
<v Speaker 1>dj voice?</v>

3679
02:36:12.780 --> 02:36:13.613
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that motherfucker has permeated the </v>

3680
02:36:14.461 --> 02:36:16.590
<v Speaker 5>entire culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't hear that,</v>

3681
02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:21.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the main come to the main stage.</v>

3682
02:36:21.930 --> 02:36:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Rain ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's river.</v>

3683
02:36:24.390 --> 02:36:25.223
<v Speaker 1>a nice round of applause for lexus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about a nice round of applause for </v>

3684
02:36:29.430 --> 02:36:30.263
<v Speaker 1>kia sorento.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how things like that </v>

3685
02:36:35.761 --> 02:36:38.130
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like top 40 dj voiCe.</v>

3686
02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a similar voice but that.</v>

3687
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:42.930
<v Speaker 1>But that's a weird thing.</v>

3688
02:36:43.830 --> 02:36:47.550
<v Speaker 5>How did broadcast journalism broadcast </v>
<v Speaker 5>journalism in college and they teach you</v>

3689
02:36:47.551 --> 02:36:49.470
<v Speaker 5>that they teach you broadcast voice </v>
<v Speaker 5>while.</v>

3690
02:36:49.471 --> 02:36:51.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean they kind of teach you about </v>
<v Speaker 5>intonation,</v>

3691
02:36:51.540 --> 02:36:55.380
<v Speaker 5>so I think people get so stuck in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they learn it and it like this,</v>

3692
02:36:55.381 --> 02:37:00.381
<v Speaker 5>like like web kit wbbm wk qx 95 nine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the moose on the radio this morning</v>

3693
02:37:01.131 --> 02:37:05.080
<v Speaker 5>with joe rogan traffic at nine from lisa</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys today and it's,</v>

3694
02:37:05.370 --> 02:37:06.203
<v Speaker 5>it's the same rhythm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all have the exact same rhythm and </v>

3695
02:37:08.941 --> 02:37:09.774
<v Speaker 5>I think it's just because it was learned</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they hear other people do it </v>

3696
02:37:12.510 --> 02:37:14.820
<v Speaker 5>and it's just such a monkey hear monkey </v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

3697
02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:17.720
<v Speaker 5>but there's a comfort level in imitating</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3698
02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:19.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's rhythmic.</v>

3699
02:37:19.041 --> 02:37:20.750
<v Speaker 5>It's really isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean truly.</v>

3700
02:37:20.751 --> 02:37:21.584
<v Speaker 5>When they teach you in school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they teach you about the rhythm of the </v>

3701
02:37:22.551 --> 02:37:24.080
<v Speaker 5>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did they teach you?</v>

3702
02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:25.160
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they teach you that there's.</v>

3703
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:26.023
<v Speaker 5>There's rhythmic waves too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the exact same thing that happened </v>

3704
02:37:28.621 --> 02:37:30.320
<v Speaker 5>to on air journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like local news.</v>

3705
02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:33.770
<v Speaker 5>It's the same way when someone goes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>on 95th street,</v>

3706
02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:34.813
<v Speaker 5>that's where it all went down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They teach you about rhythmic ways to </v>

3707
02:37:37.281 --> 02:37:40.360
<v Speaker 5>lead into the next piece.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say it's be.</v>

3708
02:37:40.470 --> 02:37:41.303
<v Speaker 5>It teaches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It teaches the listener or the watcher </v>

3709
02:37:43.850 --> 02:37:46.400
<v Speaker 5>to get to be prepared for the next </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

3710
02:37:46.401 --> 02:37:47.300
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like a.</v>

3711
02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:50.680
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear on god,</v>

3730
02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:31.350
<v Speaker 1>getting some tech information from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lady sounds right.</v>

3731
02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Put her on speaker phone while he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>typing and she had the most annoyed,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it becomes an accent.</v>

3739
02:38:58.711 --> 02:38:59.544
<v Speaker 1>Like if it was from Georgia or something</v>

<v Speaker 12>The popular term for it is talking to </v>

3770
02:40:08.581 --> 02:40:10.870
<v Speaker 12>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but you don't have to be a fashion model</v>

3771
02:40:10.871 --> 02:40:15.600
<v Speaker 12>or a teenager to uptalk came ikea </v>
<v Speaker 12>because you can hear it on commercials.</v>

3772
02:40:15.601 --> 02:40:16.434

3773
02:40:18.091 --> 02:40:18.924
<v Speaker 12>out of the mouth of a doctor on the </v>
<v Speaker 12>president's healthcare task force </v>

3774
02:40:21.860 --> 02:40:23.820
<v Speaker 12>because I see the problem from a </v>
<v Speaker 12>different point of view.</v>

3775
02:40:24.270 --> 02:40:27.120
<v Speaker 12>She came to the table and said,</v>

02:40:27.570 --> 02:40:31.660
<v Speaker 12>Dr cynthia macklemore is a linguist in </v>
<v Speaker 12>philadelphia who's work takes 10</v>

3777
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:34.560
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how fucking old this is.</v>

3778
02:40:34.561 --> 02:40:39.110
<v Speaker 1>This huge thing for her doctorate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intonation was way more exaggerated.</v>

3779
02:40:39.111 --> 02:40:39.944
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting what they were talking </v>

3780
02:40:41.331 --> 02:40:42.530
<v Speaker 1>about in [inaudible] 94.</v>

3781
02:40:42.670 --> 02:40:45.820
<v Speaker 12>Some of the artists would make </v>
<v Speaker 12>announcements and take pledges.</v>

3782
02:40:46.390 --> 02:40:49.630
<v Speaker 12>I need your form.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's not a request for direct response,</v>

3783
02:40:49.631 --> 02:40:52.600
<v Speaker 12>but for attention,</v>
<v Speaker 12>which is the kind of response people may</v>

3784
02:40:52.601 --> 02:40:54.880
<v Speaker 12>think that uptalk conveys the </v>
<v Speaker 12>uncertainty,</v>

3785
02:40:55.060 --> 02:40:59.360
<v Speaker 12>but dr mcnamara says it can be used in a</v>
<v Speaker 12>number of specific way or do you can.</v>

3786
02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:01.030
<v Speaker 12>You can use the rise to convey </v>
<v Speaker 12>uncertainty.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the apple music service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loyalty for flawless spotify.</v>

3820
02:42:28.470 --> 02:42:30.750
<v Speaker 1>but when you try to get the shit right </v>

<v Speaker 1>subscription service.</v>

3824
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3829
02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Did they make it work better with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>home pod speaker?</v>

3830
02:42:51.930 --> 02:42:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

3832
02:42:54.690 --> 02:42:55.523
<v Speaker 1>It's a much better alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we suggest switch over to home pod </v>

3833
02:43:00.390 --> 02:43:04.440
<v Speaker 1>and that way we can listen to everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say all the time.</v>

3834
02:43:04.470 --> 02:43:06.340
<v Speaker 1>We're listening in.</v>

3837

<v Speaker 1>So you could so you can like ask for a </v>

3838
02:43:20.621 --> 02:43:25.621
<v Speaker 1>song to be played because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably built into apiary or thing.</v>
