<v Speaker 1>bodies in general,</v>

<v Speaker 1>When you find out when you watch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit dude,</v>

8
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.640
<v Speaker 1>it is crazy that you like you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and it sounds like like they can</v>

9
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>never be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like it never,</v>

10
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>it could be possible that some giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>television star that worked with</v>

11
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>children and it was always helping out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children could have actually been</v>

12
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>fucking them the whole time and a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>

13
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:53.361
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of raping them and then people</v>
<v Speaker 1>must have known there's no way he was</v>

14
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>killing them too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was killing him.</v>

15
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>He was killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>They got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found all these bodies.</v>

17
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big scandal in the UK.</v>

18
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Hold up right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

19
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an island called Jersey island</v>

20
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>that's owned by the Queen and look into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to get that deep into</v>

22
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>it because that I don't have a rape</v>
<v Speaker 1>children as young as nine while working</v>

23
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>at BBC leaked report on veils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is in the independent.</v>

24
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come,</v>

25
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>how come there's not the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort for this kind of stuff like there</v>

26
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>is with the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>the gun shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Florida school shooting.</v>

28
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't there that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's not a big event where it's</v>

29
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>one thing we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the deaths happen in one deaths or</v>

30
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

31
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

32
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>But I mean this is also why people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>freak out about 500,000 people dying</v>

33
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>every year because of obesity.</v>

34
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Like what would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's worse?</v>

35
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>What's worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having your kid get shot at a school</v>

36
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:53.601
<v Speaker 1>shooting or having that motherfucker</v>
<v Speaker 1>rape your daughter and multiple times</v>

37
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and then kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think what's worse,</v>

38
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>they're both hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

39
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>

40
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just what's scary is that that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>being protected.</v>

41
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's someone that either knew about</v>

42
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Speaker 1>it and now it's trying to cover their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass because they knew about it.</v>

43
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing about Sandusky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y'All saying Guskey did the same thing.</v>

44
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.800
<v Speaker 1>He was raping all these kids and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time he was running these programs</v>

45
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>for underprivileged children and helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these orphaned kids,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

47
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.230

<v Speaker 1>with abusing 500 children and sex with</v>

48
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>dead bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

49
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what a death ride is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death ride,</v>

50
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>death ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

51
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy savile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

52
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supply 10,</v>

53
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>15 boys to a certain politician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>he'd have a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd take him out on the boat.</v>

55
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>He could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't afford to have any</v>

56
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>witnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those were always the last rides.</v>

57
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Those kids would take their called death</v>
<v Speaker 1>rides,</v>

58
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.890
<v Speaker 1>cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't have.</v>

59
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>This is from that same documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninth Circle C but how do they know that</v>

60
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>for a fact?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just got to watch it and,</v>

61
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make the,</v>

62
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's magnified when you have children</v>

65
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:07.730
<v Speaker 2>because they have no say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the other buildings.</v>

66
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 2>They put their kids out there and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

67
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.134
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

68
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's the worst thing to</v>

69
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the child's choice.</v>

70
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.370
<v Speaker 2>And they're very young and you're making</v>
<v Speaker 2>your look like whoever did what they did</v>

71
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 2>to Michael Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

72
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that they did is they</v>

73
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 2>made him famous way before he had any</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea what the fuck that meant.</v>

74
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 2>And they profited off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.510
<v Speaker 2>They kind of pimped them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

76
00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of what's happening and</v>

77
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.930
<v Speaker 2>the story to them.</v>

78
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately the whole thing destroyed</v>

79
00:03:34.821 --> 00:03:35.420
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

80
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.970
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

81
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be a part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

82
00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:42.830
<v Speaker 1>there's no think that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's intelligent.</v>

83
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.700
<v Speaker 1>And I also don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my real honest feelings.</v>

84
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I do not think that fame is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that people should aspire</v>

85
00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:54.200
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be something that</v>

86
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:57.470
<v Speaker 1>happens if people like your work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's cool,</v>

87
00:03:57.471 --> 00:04:01.190
<v Speaker 1>it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's way too much</v>

88
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>emphasis put on just trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and it's being rewarded and</v>

89
00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:11.180
<v Speaker 1>supported in this weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with getting</v>

90
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:14.030
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it should make sense.</v>

91
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.820
<v Speaker 1>It should make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There should be some reason and if it's</v>

92
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 1>out of balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

93
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.830
<v Speaker 1>You know you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should probably look at like why,</v>

94
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.270
<v Speaker 1>why is it that</v>

95
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.060
<v Speaker 2>balance like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah and lots of things that attract</v>

96
00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:31.061
<v Speaker 2>attention or not things that we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why we want more of,</v>

97
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like conflict.</v>

98
00:04:32.901 --> 00:04:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

99
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

100
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 1>But it's also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like just fame itself.</v>

101
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.730
<v Speaker 1>One of the weirdest parts about it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to constantly be checking</v>

102
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all these people are nice to you.</v>

103
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>All these people are saying nice things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you or being mean to you.</v>

104
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:52.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

105
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>like they've all people that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even know,</v>

106
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>so you can't rely on them for your self</v>
<v Speaker 1>esteem and you certainly can't rely on</v>

107
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>them for criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't rely on them and people you</v>

108
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 1>don't even know that don't care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

109
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

110
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in this weird position.</v>

111
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>You have to be very careful with who you</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with because one of the</v>

112
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 1>weirdest things you'll see from famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>people is all the sudden they get this</v>

113
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>very strange thing where they feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were supposed to do things for</v>

114
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

115
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>they're not supposed to pay for things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything's supposed to be easy and</v>

116
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

117
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

118
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>they don't respond to criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

119
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand that there's still</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human being in the middle of growth.</v>

120
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There a fucking star.</v>

121
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking star and I want this and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want it now.</v>

122
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just like,</v>

123
00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:41.130
<v Speaker 2>what kind of fucking bullshit is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know who I am?</v>

124
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

125
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:44.700
<v Speaker 2>What we've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all seen like a version of that.</v>

126
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Rob about it.</v>

127
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.780
<v Speaker 2>The problem though is that</v>

128
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.413
<v Speaker 1>they</v>

129
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that their shit stinks.</v>

130
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know that they're human.</v>

131
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 2>They know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're so then they develop this</v>

132
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:57.124
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

133
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>fraud,</v>

134
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>a phobia that people are going to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what they really are.</v>

135
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

136
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>It hurts us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also weird,</v>

137
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>like the UFC could just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they just decide who's fighting?</v>

138
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The business is so interesting because</v>

139
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like they decide who's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decide who's champion.</v>

140
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 1>They decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

141
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 1>you're not champion anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to strip yet.</v>

142
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like put it all fell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

143
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's up at Fox studios.</v>

144
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I twist my knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was working for the UFC when he</v>

145
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>fell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's doing his,</v>

146
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:34.180
<v Speaker 1>his obligations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his press obligation.</v>

147
00:06:34.181 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange to strip him of a belt</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he never lost it.</v>

148
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>And here's the longest winning streak</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then and mean,</v>

149
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.900
<v Speaker 1>but also happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No belt,</v>

150
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.420
<v Speaker 1>no belt can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was going to take the belt.</v>

151
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>They going to make up a bell.</v>

152
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 1>And then connor has the belt at 55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do with that belt?</v>

153
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Well what they're planning on doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

154
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 1>and now they've kind of let the cat out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bag because he said it's going to</v>

155
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>be for the world lightweight title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were going to strip connor the</v>

156
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>moment something happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the moment the fight started.</v>

157
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 1>That's when they were going to strip</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor.</v>

158
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they'd stripped him</v>

159
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 1>beforehand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what happens if Tony doesn't make</v>

160
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>weight or something totally makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] doesn't make weight.</v>

161
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Then what the fuck do you check?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concern,</v>

162
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>then you have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already stripped him.</v>

163
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.690
<v Speaker 1>We're going to give it back to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give it back to them.</v>

164
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he wants to fight again now,</v>

165
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>he's not the champion anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck kind of Shit is strange.</v>

166
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>So they waited and the idea was to wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they're going to desperado</v>

167
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:27.164
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

168
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Desperado so belt on the line had</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking April fool's.</v>

169

<v Speaker 1>You can't honey dick.</v>

180
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 1>The fans are like psych.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's back on,</v>

181
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.000

<v Speaker 1>People are going to be pissed and the</v>

182
00:07:58.001 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 1>bust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

183
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we know enough</v>

184
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.880
<v Speaker 3>future science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

185
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.430
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm way in the future science.</v>

186
00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:09.430
<v Speaker 3>I wish we lived in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's where ghost fit in.</v>

187
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.320
<v Speaker 3>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean future science.</v>

188
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think time.</v>

189
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I think time is an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that I'm more,</v>

190
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.230
<v Speaker 3>do you ever see interstellar?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

191
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm more in that zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that smacked of good science to</v>

192
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:27.490
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

193
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.623
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

194
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.370
<v Speaker 1>So when you say time's an illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean like the watch is real?</v>

195
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Like if it says four 30 that's when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie starts,</v>

196
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all real.</v>

197
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just coordination.</v>

198
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 3>That's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's within our species.</v>

199
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:45.230
<v Speaker 3>We're coordinating together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're working as an ant colony.</v>

200
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 3>We're sending signals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which happened to be time signals were</v>

201
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.240
<v Speaker 3>using math to coordinate.</v>

202
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.920
<v Speaker 1>But if you go underwater and hold your</v>
<v Speaker 1>breath for five minutes,</v>

203
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.120
<v Speaker 1>that's real five minutes.</v>

204
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just when you run out of oxygen.</v>

205
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 2>So that five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the counting of that time</v>

206
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean anything.</v>

207
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean anything.</v>

208
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 2>But if someone's five minutes late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

209
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:07.404
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fine.</v>

210
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean anything.</v>

211
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never mad about that because I'm</v>

212
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:12.564
<v Speaker 3>always late.</v>

213
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.873
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

214
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

215
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the only time supposedly is now and</v>

216
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 2>everything else is just are pathetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempts at measuring it and trying to,</v>

217
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 3>that's just coordination on like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

218
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's all we're doing.</v>

219
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Like how old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

220
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that just means how crispy you</v>

221
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 3>are from going around the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not like really anything.</v>

222
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

223
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

224
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.840
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

225
00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cracklin you know,</v>

226
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just kind of that and to me like</v>

227
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 3>time is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just space.</v>

228
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like how far are you away from this</v>
<v Speaker 3>gravitational pull?</v>

229
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:53.700
<v Speaker 3>I think gravity is way more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think time is just us coordinating</v>

230
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.630
<v Speaker 2>with math while we definitely are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like when the sun's coming</v>

231
00:09:58.631 --> 00:09:59.980
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like check your watch,</v>

232
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.650
<v Speaker 2>six 15 sun's coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real thing.</v>

233
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 3>We're just clocking a spin of an earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

234
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with the lungs under</v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

235
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Speaker 3>The earth spins.</v>

236
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you and disagree with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>

237
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

238
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also think the fucking movie</v>

239
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:16.300
<v Speaker 2>starts at four 30.</v>

240
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.840
<v Speaker 3>That's another human putting on a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

241
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.100
<v Speaker 3>You're just coordinating with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me an example of time that is a</v>

242
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:28.030
<v Speaker 3>manifest thing outside of human</v>
<v Speaker 3>coordination.</v>

243
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you could,</v>

244
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.380
<v Speaker 2>the oldest don't mean like</v>

245
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.410
<v Speaker 3>things happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

246
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just time itself.</v>

247
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Like is that helpful in any way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other than for us?</v>

248
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it exists in the universe</v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

249
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:51.740
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
