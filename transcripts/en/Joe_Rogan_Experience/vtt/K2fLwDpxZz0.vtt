13
00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 2>the podcast and a,</v>

14
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.340
<v Speaker 2>as it's gotten here,</v>

15
00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I just got a a an email while I'm on.</v>

16
00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Victor contains a email list and you know,</v>

17
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:31.301
<v Speaker 2>Victor Conte,</v>

18
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Depaul Co guy,</v>

19
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was suspended for getting all those guys on some undetectable</v>

20
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:42.130
<v Speaker 2>steroids and now he's some sort of a crusader against a performance enhancing</v>

21
00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:42.551
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

22
00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:44.080
<v Speaker 2>And he just sent me this thing.</v>

23
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.161
<v Speaker 2>John Jones,</v>

24
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 2>testosterone levels are suspect and it's saying that he's probably,</v>

25
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:51.730
<v Speaker 2>he was probably on steroids coming off.</v>

26
00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 2>The biggest winner was UFC career.</v>

27
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:56.080
<v Speaker 2>A few would have expected Jon Jones to have the worst week of his life.</v>

28
00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:56.291
<v Speaker 2>Blah,</v>

29
00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:56.861
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

30
00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:00.700
<v Speaker 2>And drug test cocaine is the big one that everybody's been talking about.</v>

31
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.613
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 2>but the thing about the epic testosterone levels,</v>

33
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.110
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're saying.</v>

34
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 2>The mean it.</v>

35
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Conte has a,</v>

36
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of numbers and ratios and what's normal and what's not normal.</v>

38
00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:15.670
<v Speaker 2>But apparently this is a,</v>

39
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.190
<v Speaker 2>this is an issue now to the people are talking about.</v>

40
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:19.640
<v Speaker 3>You know it's interesting Kevin,</v>

42
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 3>I oli was tweeting some stuff about that yesterday and you know when you take a</v>

43
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:25.051
<v Speaker 3>look at,</v>

44
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 3>at some of the things that are taking place as well is there are some major</v>

45
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 3>flaws in the collection.</v>

46
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:34.130
<v Speaker 3>Whoever was the sample collector and I don't think the commission just wants to</v>

47
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 3>out them whoever did that because the first test was supposed to be for</v>

48
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 3>performance enhancements and then it was actually recreational.</v>

49
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 3>It was never supposed to happen like that.</v>

50
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 3>So then when they tested him two weeks later after failing a recreational,</v>

51
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 3>then they test them for performance enhancing.</v>

52
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.880
<v Speaker 3>And I guess that's probably where they got his testosterone ratio.</v>

53
00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 3>So you know when,</v>

54
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Speaker 3>when they get back his post fight drug test that,</v>

55
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.831
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>

56
00:01:57.831 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 3>this will be real interesting,</v>

57
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 3>but when I talked to friends of mine that I had at Usada,</v>

58
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:04.760
<v Speaker 3>I texted with them today and,</v>

59
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.100
<v Speaker 3>and you saw a is as good as it gets.</v>

60
00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean these guys don't miss that stands for the U S Anti Doping Agency.</v>

61
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:11.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:11.751
<v Speaker 3>The federally,</v>

63
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 3>the Federal Government backed organization that does the Olympics and,</v>

64
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.430
<v Speaker 3>and they told me strip,</v>

65
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.731
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

66
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:17.001
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

67
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:17.391
<v Speaker 3>yeah there's,</v>

68
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely some indicators there,</v>

69
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.091
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>

70
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:20.351
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

71
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 3>they believe at right now it looks like there's some flaws in the collection.</v>

72
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:27.520
<v Speaker 3>So who knows how this thing could possibly hold up an arbitration and if,</v>

73
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 3>if that collection process had anything to do with the flood levels,</v>

74
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of details yet to be uncovered.</v>

75
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 2>So when the collection levels what it's supposed to be supposed to be,</v>

76
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.201
<v Speaker 2>one guy,</v>

77
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:39.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a chain of custody,</v>

78
00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 2>he administered the test,</v>

79
00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:45.400
<v Speaker 2>takes the blood and like handcuffs it to his fucking cha wrist,</v>

80
00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:45.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

81
00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:45.901
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

82
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 2>like one of those nuclear bombs and like the,</v>

83
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:49.780
<v Speaker 2>the nuclear football thing.</v>

84
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 2>And they take it and it's supposed to be like,</v>

85
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 2>this guy has it.</v>

86
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.030
<v Speaker 2>He signs off on and he sleeps with it.</v>

87
00:02:55.031 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't go anywhere with it until it gets to that lab and then from there</v>

88
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>it's they have a direct chain of custody.</v>

89
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>

90
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.080
<v Speaker 3>And the big key there,</v>

91
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.320
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

92
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a few areas where it can be flawed.</v>

93
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:06.251
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

94
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 3>the collector,</v>

95
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 3>if the collectors not fully trained in,</v>

96
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:09.431
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

97
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

98
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.893
<v Speaker 3>you know where,</v>

99
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 3>then the second part is what lab do they send it to?</v>

100
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:13.601
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

101
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 3>I did confirm today Nevada had that urine sample sent to the wattle laboratory</v>

102
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 3>in Salt Lake City,</v>

103
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>

104
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.890
<v Speaker 3>is is one of the best and one of the two best in the country.</v>

105
00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:23.001
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

106
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 3>you get salt lake and then you have UCLA.</v>

107
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Those are the labs that can detect all the high level stuff.</v>

108
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.631
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

109
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 3>it was still a urine sample and urine is a lot less accurate than a blood test.</v>

110
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:33.350
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

111
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking about looking at testosterone levels,</v>

112
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:36.800
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

113
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

114
00:03:37.011 --> 00:03:39.560
<v Speaker 2>And water is the world anti-doping agent.</v>

115
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Exactly like that.</v>

116
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones who make the regulations at the Nevada state athletic</v>

117
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 3>commission and everybody else follows when they say,</v>

118
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

119
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 3>what's your protocol?</v>

120
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Or what standards do you follow for performance testing drugs or are banned</v>

121
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:50.734
<v Speaker 3>substances?</v>

122
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.921
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

123
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 3>we followed the Wada Code and so you saw it a uses that same laboratory as well.</v>

124
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.003
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

125
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

126
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:57.721
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

127
00:03:57.721 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 3>but the difference there is the collectors,</v>

128
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:00.530
<v Speaker 3>the organization and,</v>

129
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:00.691
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

130
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:01.524
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>

131
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

132
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

133
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 3>they're the premier organization in the world,</v>

134
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 3>probably a,</v>

135
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 3>and they do it worldwide.</v>

136
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 2>For folks who don't know what we're talking about,</v>

137
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.281
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones,</v>

138
00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:13.020
<v Speaker 2>who's The UFC light heavyweight champion,</v>

139
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.730
<v Speaker 2>number one pound for pound fighter,</v>

140
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 2>pretty much consensus in the world.</v>

141
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.040
<v Speaker 2>One is biggest fight of his career against Daniel Cormier,</v>

142
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:22.890
<v Speaker 2>but then tested positive for cocaine metabolites,</v>

143
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.480
<v Speaker 2>which means that,</v>

144
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

145
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.960
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

146
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.090
<v Speaker 2>the test is administered on December 4th,</v>

147
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.300
<v Speaker 2>which means some tea sometime between two and four days before that he had done</v>

148
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:34.014
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>

149
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

150
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.300
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

151
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.750
<v Speaker 2>do you hear that Wine Jamie?</v>

152
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.110
<v Speaker 2>It's the fan as it come through the microphone.</v>

153
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell.</v>

154
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

155
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.011
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

156
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:42.844
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>

157
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 2>The fan for that.</v>

158
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

159
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Is it coming through your microphone then?</v>

160
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Shut your microphone off.</v>

161
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

162
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

163
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

164
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to turn your microphone on and off.</v>

165
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:55.931
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

166
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to put that thing somewhere.</v>

167
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

168
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

169
00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Well either way.</v>

170
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.393
<v Speaker 2>We're cool.</v>

171
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

172
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 2>so for folks that don't follow the UFC,</v>

173
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>this was a huge fight.</v>

174
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Probably one of the biggest fights ever as far as skill level.</v>

175
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 2>I think probably one of the biggest fights ever.</v>

176
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Cause you got the number one pound for pound fighter in the world and a guy who</v>

177
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>many people thought could beat him.</v>

178
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

179
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.941
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

180
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

181
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 2>John Wound up winning the fight and winning,</v>

182
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

183
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 2>in pretty impressive fashion because he beat him wrestling.</v>

184
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.900
<v Speaker 2>He took Daniel down first time ever in Daniel Daniel Cormier,</v>

185
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 2>he was an Olympic wrestler,</v>

186
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 2>undefeated as a heavyweight.</v>

187
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Anissa light heavyweight was a real threat and John beat them.</v>

188
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 2>So now that the cocaine was one thing,</v>

189
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>but then this,</v>

190
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 2>the testosterone to Epictetus testosterone ratio,</v>

191
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 2>which seems to indicate that something else going on,</v>

192
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 2>that's a way bigger deal.</v>

193
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.141
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

194
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:47.471
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

195
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:47.591
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

196
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:48.011
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

197
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 3>right now there's a ton of speculation.</v>

198
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

199
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.281
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

200
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:51.731
<v Speaker 3>if the,</v>

201
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 3>if the ratios were were bigger,</v>

202
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 3>I think we'd hear a lot more talk about it right now.</v>

203
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.231
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

204
00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 3>right now people say,</v>

205
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:58.401
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

206
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 3>these could be indicators to something masking steroids and,</v>

207
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

208
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 3>this all just developed.</v>

209
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 3>So I certainly don't think either one of us had had a whole lot of time to dive</v>

210
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 3>into the details.</v>

211
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.380
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

212
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

213
00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:08.790
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

214
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 3>you got to hope that this scenario doesn't get any worse at this point.</v>

215
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.711
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

216
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 3>you really don't.</v>

217
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

218
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

219
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 3>personally having trained at that gym for a number of years now,</v>

220
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been down there in years since even before I retired.</v>

221
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

222
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 3>but there were never any rumors about John doing stuff like that.</v>

223
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

224
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 3>from day one when he came into the gym,</v>

225
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 3>he knew nothing and he still kicked everybody's ass bad to the point where</v>

226
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 3>people were just jealous,</v>

227
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

228
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 3>to the point where people thought,</v>

229
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:36.081
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

230
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

231
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.260
<v Speaker 3>there's no way he wins this fight.</v>

232
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 3>Now they finally match Migas Guy who's going to beat him.</v>

233
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 3>Then you watch him fight and he just smokes guy mean we wondered how he was</v>

234
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 3>going to do against Brandon Vera.</v>

235
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.093
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that fight?</v>

236
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean he made it look like a joke and he did it to everybody.</v>

237
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean all the way through,</v>

238
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

239
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 3>on other than the Gustafson fight and then obviously,</v>

240
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:54.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

241
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 3>or even the Rashad Evans fight,</v>

242
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

243
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 3>the Rashad Evans fight,</v>

244
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:57.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

245
00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:57.921
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

246
00:06:57.921 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 3>it was a dominant victory,</v>

247
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't something where he just,</v>

248
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.371
<v Speaker 3>he ran through it.</v>

249
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 3>So I personally never heard any rumors in any inside the fight circle.</v>

250
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 3>You generally hear a lot,</v>

251
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

252
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys do a lot of talk and when it comes to that stuff,</v>

253
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

254
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 3>you just never know,</v>

255
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

256
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Well that was one of the reasons why you retired,</v>

257
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:16.551
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

258
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:16.761
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

259
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 2>you were having a real issue with the,</v>

260
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 2>the level of performance enhancing drugs.</v>

261
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Like the permeation of it.</v>

262
00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

263
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.081
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

264
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:23.650
<v Speaker 3>In the sport.</v>

265
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.281
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

266
00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:24.461
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

267
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:26.350
<v Speaker 3>you see it when you train in these gyms and,</v>

268
00:07:26.351 --> 00:07:29.650
<v Speaker 3>and so you'll see guys that you come in and all of a sudden their physique looks</v>

269
00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:32.320
<v Speaker 3>totally different and you can feel the difference.</v>

270
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.440
<v Speaker 3>And so it's interesting because when you mentioned that a bunch of people throw</v>

271
00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:37.151
<v Speaker 3>out excuses,</v>

272
00:07:37.151 --> 00:07:37.511
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

273
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:37.751
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

274
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:37.871
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

275
00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I need to mention this until six months after I retired and I was in a position</v>

276
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:41.471
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

277
00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:41.651
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

278
00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:41.891
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

279
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:44.800
<v Speaker 3>maybe I can influence the sport a little bit here and try and steer in the right</v>

280
00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:45.191
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

281
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:46.810
<v Speaker 3>But it's a major,</v>

282
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.780
<v Speaker 3>major advantage when someone goes on that type of stuff.</v>

283
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.190
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

284
00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:51.611
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

285
00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I had to fight at a different weight class that I already thought was fishy</v>

286
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:55.720
<v Speaker 3>about that as well.</v>

287
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:55.901
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

288
00:07:55.901 --> 00:07:56.711
<v Speaker 3>Vince Vandelay Silva,</v>

289
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:56.831
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

290
00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 3>you're going to fight it light heavy instead a middleweight in the middle</v>

291
00:07:58.731 --> 00:07:59.440
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

292
00:07:59.440 --> 00:07:59.651
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

293
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:00.730
<v Speaker 3>those things happen.</v>

294
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.700
<v Speaker 3>And I still signed to do the fight even with my suspicions.</v>

295
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.990
<v Speaker 3>But if you're going to go at it clean and,</v>

296
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:09.130
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to lose the guys that maybe you suspect we're doing something,</v>

297
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

298
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.490
<v Speaker 3>for me it came down to decision 0.1.</v>

299
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Am I willing to go back to a major camp and train and leave my family behind for</v>

300
00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:17.224
<v Speaker 3>weeks at a time?</v>

301
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.183
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

302
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Am I willing to level the playing field and take something like that,</v>

303
00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:22.810
<v Speaker 3>compromise my integrity.</v>

304
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

305
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

306
00:08:24.161 --> 00:08:24.271
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

307
00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 3>to be better and get back on an ascending climb my,</v>

308
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.190
<v Speaker 3>my career.</v>

309
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:27.550
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

310
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Well then I'm out.</v>

311
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:28.691
<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>

312
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:30.220
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't worth the head trauma at that point.</v>

313
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.610
<v Speaker 2>So the Vandelay Silva fight,</v>

314
00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:35.210
<v Speaker 2>why was it light heavy weight as he went on to find it?</v>

315
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.213
<v Speaker 2>He wanted it.</v>

316
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:37.830
<v Speaker 2>Well he's,</v>

317
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:38.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

318
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.050
<v Speaker 2>he's got issues of his own,</v>

319
00:08:40.051 --> 00:08:40.830
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

320
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay Silva who was an all time great.</v>

321
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean an absolute pride,</v>

322
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.770
<v Speaker 2>a long time pride,</v>

323
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 2>what they call a middleweight champion,</v>

324
00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:50.880
<v Speaker 2>which was 203 pounds and pride,</v>

325
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:54.960
<v Speaker 2>which is light heavyweight in the UFC and most likely juice to the,</v>

326
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

327
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 2>let's be,</v>

328
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest about it.</v>

329
00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:58.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

330
00:08:58.021 --> 00:08:59.780
<v Speaker 2>everybody in pride was there.</v>

331
00:08:59.781 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of people in pride doing a lot of crazy shit.</v>

332
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

333
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

334
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 2>you talked to ensign anyway in the ensign anyway,</v>

335
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:08.431
<v Speaker 2>said that they,</v>

336
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:13.431
<v Speaker 2>they literally had a clause in the contract in pride saying that they would not</v>

337
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 2>test you for steroids.</v>

338
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:16.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

339
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.091
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

340
00:09:17.091 --> 00:09:17.924
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

341
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

342
00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:18.651
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

343
00:09:18.651 --> 00:09:20.750
<v Speaker 3>this has been a subject that for me,</v>

344
00:09:20.751 --> 00:09:20.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

345
00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:22.760
<v Speaker 3>especially in the last year,</v>

346
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.330
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those subjects where I get emotional and then,</v>

347
00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:26.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

348
00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

349
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.770
<v Speaker 3>my initial instinct is to speak with emotion and then regret what I say</v>

350
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:32.090
<v Speaker 3>afterwards when I calmed down.</v>

351
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.500
<v Speaker 3>And so I've really,</v>

352
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.040
<v Speaker 3>it showed an ugly side of me that I'm not necessarily proud of.</v>

353
00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:40.160
<v Speaker 3>And I've sat back and looked at more perspective on the whole situation.</v>

354
00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:42.860
<v Speaker 3>And not that I still don't condemn it,</v>

355
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.290
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at a guy's career,</v>

356
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 3>I hate seeing guys like a Vandelay,</v>

357
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

358
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.670
<v Speaker 3>like a Kung Lee go out with something that happened towards the end of their</v>

359
00:09:52.671 --> 00:09:57.200
<v Speaker 3>career that caused a black eye on it and then have it ruin the entire body of</v>

360
00:09:57.201 --> 00:09:58.310
<v Speaker 3>work that they perform.</v>

361
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Because right now the environment in every professional sports pressures a lot</v>

362
00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:05.300
<v Speaker 3>of guys to go towards that avenue.</v>

363
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:05.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

364
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.880
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

365
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.390
<v Speaker 3>if we're talking about what takes place in mixed martial arts,</v>

366
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.620
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about the NFL.</v>

367
00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:11.540
<v Speaker 3>If you lifted up that rock and looked underneath it,</v>

368
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.123
<v Speaker 3>God bless you.</v>

369
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean needle you,</v>

370
00:10:14.271 --> 00:10:17.330
<v Speaker 3>you have a couple of quarterbacks and you'd have maybe a punter.</v>

371
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.860
<v Speaker 3>I even think those guys,</v>

372
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:19.311
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

373
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:20.570
<v Speaker 3>You had like a 47 year old guy,</v>

374
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:22.580
<v Speaker 3>I think kick a 53 yard or the other day.</v>

375
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:23.803
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

376
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

377
00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:24.631
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

378
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:25.191
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

379
00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:27.980
<v Speaker 3>so the environment is there and I think if,</v>

380
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:28.760
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

381
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.270
<v Speaker 3>if the sport in general goes towards a comprehensive testing policy,</v>

382
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.160
<v Speaker 3>levels of playing field for everybody,</v>

383
00:10:34.161 --> 00:10:36.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes a safer environment longterm for the fighters.</v>

384
00:10:36.981 --> 00:10:37.611
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

385
00:10:37.611 --> 00:10:38.180
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

386
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.470
<v Speaker 3>maybe we'll get there in the next couple.</v>

387
00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

388
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Well for fighters is a gigantic issue of course,</v>

389
00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:46.060
<v Speaker 2>because you're not talking about a baseball where you can hit a ball better</v>

390
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.470
<v Speaker 2>basketball or anywhere,</v>

391
00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:47.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 2>you're running faster.</v>

393
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.170
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about a guy being able to deliver more physical punishment to his</v>

394
00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:54.610
<v Speaker 2>opponent and you know,</v>

395
00:10:54.611 --> 00:10:55.780
<v Speaker 2>possibly score,</v>

396
00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:58.330
<v Speaker 2>knock out that he wouldn't have been able to score possibly lantus shot,</v>

397
00:10:58.331 --> 00:11:02.140
<v Speaker 2>that he wouldn't have been able to land had he not been essentially with</v>

398
00:11:02.141 --> 00:11:03.520
<v Speaker 2>superhuman hormone levels.</v>

399
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.630
<v Speaker 2>And it's widely understood that,</v>

400
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.640
<v Speaker 2>especially in the early days of the UFC,</v>

401
00:11:09.641 --> 00:11:11.020
<v Speaker 2>in the early days of pride,</v>

402
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.790
<v Speaker 2>there were a gigantic amount of guys who are taking performance enhancing drugs.</v>

403
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend,</v>

404
00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I will not name names.</v>

405
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

406
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.760
<v Speaker 2>he fought for a Japanese organization and they not only did they tell him to do</v>

407
00:11:24.491 --> 00:11:25.324
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>

408
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.300
<v Speaker 2>they wanted him to fight at a higher weight class.</v>

409
00:11:28.301 --> 00:11:30.460
<v Speaker 2>They were going to help him set everything up.</v>

410
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.600
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

411
00:11:31.601 --> 00:11:35.140
<v Speaker 2>they were even picking opponents for him that he can beat.</v>

412
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.121
<v Speaker 2>And they were there.</v>

413
00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:36.341
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

414
00:11:36.341 --> 00:11:37.670
<v Speaker 2>they were setting the whole thing up.</v>

415
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.390
<v Speaker 2>But how like when you know about that from the inside and you know,</v>

416
00:11:40.391 --> 00:11:43.150
<v Speaker 2>like the organization telling the guy to take steroids,</v>

417
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:44.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

418
00:11:44.111 --> 00:11:45.580
<v Speaker 2>letting them know that it's okay,</v>

419
00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:46.990
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to test you for that.</v>

420
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

421
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.380
<v Speaker 2>that it had to be a major part of,</v>

422
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.810
<v Speaker 2>of MMA in the early.</v>

423
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Now those guys that came from those days,</v>

424
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 2>now they have to adjust because like you're looking at Vito,</v>

425
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 2>like Vito who was on testosterone replacement therapy,</v>

426
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

427
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:08.161
<v Speaker 2>had those incredible victories over Luke Rockhold and Michael Bisping and you</v>

428
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:08.651
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

429
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 2>now those Dan Henderson and now those fights,</v>

430
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 2>not only they come into question like,</v>

431
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:13.421
<v Speaker 2>you've got to go,</v>

432
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

433
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 2>what does he have left?</v>

434
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Now that he's off that stuff and now he's got to fight with natural testosterone</v>

435
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 2>levels and he's going to fight Chris Weidman for the title.</v>

436
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.190
<v Speaker 2>We know we're going to find out and you're going to find out next month</v>

437
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.180
<v Speaker 3>the just passed his most recent,</v>

438
00:12:26.181 --> 00:12:26.361
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

439
00:12:26.361 --> 00:12:27.440
<v Speaker 3>they've been tested them quite often.</v>

440
00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:30.350
<v Speaker 3>The Egypt passes most recent tests and absolutely right.</v>

441
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.681
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

442
00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:31.481
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna find out and,</v>

443
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:31.911
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

444
00:12:31.911 --> 00:12:33.440
<v Speaker 3>the whole TRT ruling,</v>

445
00:12:33.441 --> 00:12:36.680
<v Speaker 3>thank God it's gone because it just clouded the issue I think.</v>

446
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

447
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.080
<v Speaker 3>and gave at times a sport,</v>

448
00:12:39.081 --> 00:12:39.851
<v Speaker 3>a black eye and,</v>

449
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:40.611
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

450
00:12:40.611 --> 00:12:41.660
<v Speaker 3>not only the sport,</v>

451
00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:43.310
<v Speaker 3>but then it kind of screwed over some fighters too.</v>

452
00:12:43.311 --> 00:12:45.470
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to allow something look than guys are going to do it,</v>

453
00:12:45.471 --> 00:12:45.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

454
00:12:45.621 --> 00:12:46.760
<v Speaker 3>they're going to find a way to do it.</v>

455
00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

456
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.581
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's,</v>

457
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:49.850
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely been,</v>

458
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:50.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

459
00:12:50.511 --> 00:12:51.530
<v Speaker 3>from what I've seen,</v>

460
00:12:51.531 --> 00:12:52.400
<v Speaker 3>talking to camps,</v>

461
00:12:52.401 --> 00:12:53.151
<v Speaker 3>talking to fires,</v>

462
00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:54.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm calling all these cards now.</v>

463
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.870
<v Speaker 3>There has definitely been a difference.</v>

464
00:12:56.871 --> 00:13:01.871
<v Speaker 3>The younger breed of fighters is very anti performance handling drug a lot,</v>

465
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.590
<v Speaker 3>especially a lot of these wrestlers,</v>

466
00:13:03.591 --> 00:13:07.640
<v Speaker 3>they're so used to being tested and this is becoming like their NFL now coming</v>

467
00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:09.410
<v Speaker 3>from amateur wrestling that,</v>

468
00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:10.460
<v Speaker 3>that they're all for it.</v>

469
00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:13.850
<v Speaker 3>And in a lot of that old breed is really starting to go away.</v>

470
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.380
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

471
00:13:15.381 --> 00:13:17.390
<v Speaker 3>guys are starting to get randomly tested out of the blue.</v>

472
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

473
00:13:19.011 --> 00:13:19.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's important.</v>

474
00:13:19.851 --> 00:13:20.900
<v Speaker 2>And randomly tested.</v>

475
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.920
<v Speaker 2>The UFC is doing these random tests where they're doing the full Olympic blood</v>

476
00:13:24.921 --> 00:13:25.341
<v Speaker 2>panel,</v>

477
00:13:25.341 --> 00:13:28.170
<v Speaker 2>which is like $40,000 a fighter and you know,</v>

478
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.780
<v Speaker 2>they can only do so many of those.</v>

479
00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:31.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that everybody knows.</v>

480
00:13:31.491 --> 00:13:32.324
<v Speaker 2>So it's a bit of,</v>

481
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

482
00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.810
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit of a game of musical chairs.</v>

483
00:13:35.811 --> 00:13:36.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

484
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:37.640
<v Speaker 2>there's only a few chairs.</v>

485
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's moving around.</v>

486
00:13:39.381 --> 00:13:42.410
<v Speaker 2>You're hoping that the music doesn't stop and you're standing up.</v>

487
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

488
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 3>And I mean you're talking about over,</v>

489
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.460
<v Speaker 3>I think it's over 550 I think it was five 85 we sit on UFC tonight,</v>

490
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.210
<v Speaker 3>fighters,</v>

491
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 3>fighters on the roster.</v>

492
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.080
<v Speaker 3>And this is across the globe.</v>

493
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:53.620
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to start doing,</v>

494
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:54.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

495
00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 3>during their training camps,</v>

496
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:58.960
<v Speaker 3>random testing throughout the year and all these different countries,</v>

497
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.430
<v Speaker 3>language barriers,</v>

498
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 3>the labs,</v>

499
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:01.581
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

500
00:14:01.581 --> 00:14:03.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is a monster.</v>

501
00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:05.710
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you from private meetings at Lorenzo Fertitta,</v>

502
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.490
<v Speaker 3>he is very determined to find a way to make it work.</v>

503
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.061
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

504
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:13.930
<v Speaker 3>we've had some meetings and I think it is in the hopper over time,</v>

505
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 3>but right now it's just,</v>

506
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.960
<v Speaker 3>it's more piece mail where they can't do it every single time here and there.</v>

507
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:20.501
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be,</v>

508
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:20.711
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

509
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:23.950
<v Speaker 3>on this card we're going to be able to do three on this cargo to do for,</v>

510
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:24.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

511
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.340
<v Speaker 3>and they're going to contract out and give the athletic commission the</v>

512
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:27.731
<v Speaker 3>Authority.</v>

513
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:28.564
<v Speaker 3>Here's the money.</v>

514
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 3>You guys go partner with the organization and take care of it.</v>

515
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.321
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

516
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 3>as Dana said this week,</v>

517
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.780
<v Speaker 3>they don't want anything to do with that.</v>

518
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 3>They've botched it in,</v>

519
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.600
<v Speaker 3>in areas already.</v>

520
00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:38.990
<v Speaker 3>So they know they don't need to do it.</v>

521
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.350
<v Speaker 3>What's the [inaudible] yes,</v>

522
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

523
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Connolly is a fighter who was a,</v>

524
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:44.374
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

525
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 2>his entire career was,</v>

526
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

527
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:51.420
<v Speaker 2>he had like some really spectacular victories over in strike force,</v>

528
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 2>so great kicker.</v>

529
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 2>And he had a real good wrestling background to set a very unusual style in that</v>

530
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 2>he threw a lot of white wild taekwondo style kicks but he was also really good</v>

531
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 2>at stuffing takedowns and could throw guys around.</v>

532
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

533
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.970
<v Speaker 2>came over to the UFC,</v>

534
00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:05.631
<v Speaker 2>had some wins,</v>

535
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 2>had some losses,</v>

536
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:07.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

537
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:07.430
<v Speaker 2>fought,</v>

538
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.300
<v Speaker 2>fought as hard out and then took his last fight against Michael Bisping and</v>

539
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 2>there was all these photographs of him just looking different than he's ever</v>

540
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:14.924
<v Speaker 2>looked before.</v>

541
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about like this radical change in his appearance.</v>

542
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:20.920
<v Speaker 2>He had this mad fucking six backwards.</v>

543
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 2>You never saw that from him before.</v>

544
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.571
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

545
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:24.111
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

546
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:24.291
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

547
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time I'm healthy in a long time.</v>

548
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a lot of strength and conditioning but it's just super odd to see</v>

549
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 2>someone in their late thirties,</v>

550
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:31.911
<v Speaker 2>forties,</v>

551
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:32.690
<v Speaker 2>40 years old,</v>

552
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:33.523
<v Speaker 2>40 years,</v>

553
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.200
<v Speaker 2>40 years old being built like that out of nowhere.</v>

554
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.981
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

555
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:37.814
<v Speaker 2>very odd.</v>

556
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:38.331
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

557
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:41.570
<v Speaker 2>unless someone goes on like a fucking vision quest for like,</v>

558
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

559
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.561
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

560
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:43.341
<v Speaker 2>nine months,</v>

561
00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:43.701
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

562
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 2>and just radical fucking strength and conditioning training,</v>

563
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 2>you don't see that much of a difference in a person's body.</v>

564
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

565
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Usually while you're working on skills and you're sparring and you,</v>

566
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:52.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:15:52.611 --> 00:15:54.950
<v Speaker 2>you're doing drills and you're doing all the shit that you need to do to win</v>

568
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:55.470
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

569
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

570
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:56.611
<v Speaker 3>When you're,</v>

571
00:15:56.611 --> 00:15:57.660
<v Speaker 3>when you're training like that,</v>

572
00:15:57.661 --> 00:16:01.920
<v Speaker 3>it is so hard to then go hit the weight room and get that kind of muscle density</v>

573
00:16:01.921 --> 00:16:03.300
<v Speaker 3>and put on that kind of mass.</v>

574
00:16:03.301 --> 00:16:05.160
<v Speaker 3>And I mean that's where it gets really difficult.</v>

575
00:16:05.161 --> 00:16:05.994
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

576
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:06.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

577
00:16:06.571 --> 00:16:08.730
<v Speaker 3>and it gets clean the story with [inaudible] whichever.</v>

578
00:16:08.731 --> 00:16:08.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

579
00:16:08.971 --> 00:16:09.451
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

580
00:16:09.451 --> 00:16:09.751
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

581
00:16:09.751 --> 00:16:13.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean he goes into fight and I remember it was a Saturday morning,</v>

582
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.460
<v Speaker 3>I was in Tulsa,</v>

583
00:16:14.461 --> 00:16:14.881
<v Speaker 3>Oklahoma.</v>

584
00:16:14.881 --> 00:16:18.060
<v Speaker 3>I was calling the fights that morning and I wake up and my body's like,</v>

585
00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:18.211
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

586
00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 3>the fight pass card is on with putting on,</v>

587
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.350
<v Speaker 3>literally just woke up cause it was in China.</v>

588
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.300
<v Speaker 3>And so fight takes place.</v>

589
00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Michael Bisbing wins.</v>

590
00:16:25.261 --> 00:16:25.861
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time,</v>

591
00:16:25.861 --> 00:16:28.680
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was reading an article where busying was talking about the picture</v>

592
00:16:28.681 --> 00:16:30.240
<v Speaker 3>Kang took and you know,</v>

593
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.550
<v Speaker 3>busy Mike has always been very vocal cities,</v>

594
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.810
<v Speaker 3>fought a bunch of TRT guys and he's had some opportunity squandered in his</v>

595
00:16:36.811 --> 00:16:37.620
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>

596
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.750
<v Speaker 3>And so then I pushed out the tweet where,</v>

597
00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:40.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

598
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.460
<v Speaker 3>it's a good start or didn't pay to cheat for one's good start to the day and you</v>

599
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:44.641
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

600
00:16:44.641 --> 00:16:44.881
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

601
00:16:44.881 --> 00:16:46.050
<v Speaker 3>it's sent off,</v>

602
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:46.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

603
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.680
<v Speaker 3>a just a wildfire,</v>

604
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.460
<v Speaker 3>which all of a sudden I realized,</v>

605
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.020
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

606
00:16:52.021 --> 00:16:56.380
<v Speaker 3>that was one of those emotional times we're having the phone in my hand was to,</v>

607
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.223
<v Speaker 3>and you know what,</v>

608
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm older and I'm wiser than that.</v>

609
00:16:59.281 --> 00:16:59.461
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

610
00:16:59.461 --> 00:16:59.821
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

611
00:16:59.821 --> 00:17:00.960
<v Speaker 3>it was one of those times and then,</v>

612
00:17:00.961 --> 00:17:01.231
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

613
00:17:01.231 --> 00:17:02.130
<v Speaker 3>it was told to me,</v>

614
00:17:02.131 --> 00:17:02.964
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

615
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.950
<v Speaker 3>it's best to keep your mouth shut right now.</v>

616
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:06.203
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

617
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:06.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

618
00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:07.531
<v Speaker 3>afterwards.</v>

619
00:17:07.531 --> 00:17:10.890
<v Speaker 3>So it was certainly not a situation that I was proud of.</v>

620
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:11.761
<v Speaker 3>Regardless,</v>

621
00:17:11.761 --> 00:17:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm always going to be for proper testing,</v>

622
00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:16.470
<v Speaker 3>clean sport,</v>

623
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.740
<v Speaker 3>etc. But it is not my job to go around making accusations or whatever,</v>

624
00:17:21.811 --> 00:17:23.310
<v Speaker 3>that there's bodies to do that.</v>

625
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.480
<v Speaker 3>But it is certainly something that that does get me emotional and it triggers a</v>

626
00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:27.961
<v Speaker 3>side of me.</v>

627
00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so proud of us aside that speaks before thinking,</v>

628
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.531
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

629
00:17:31.531 --> 00:17:34.290
<v Speaker 3>And that's been a real good lesson learned for me.</v>

630
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.801
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

631
00:17:34.801 --> 00:17:37.480
<v Speaker 3>over the course this year being a,</v>

632
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.610
<v Speaker 3>an official sports broadcast or not a fighter who does commentating on the side,</v>

633
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:42.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

634
00:17:42.421 --> 00:17:42.661
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

635
00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:46.320
<v Speaker 3>and that's something where there comes a certain amount of responsibility with</v>

636
00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:46.780
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

637
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.120
<v Speaker 2>We not broadcasting audio.</v>

638
00:17:48.121 --> 00:17:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Is that what's going on?</v>

639
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.733
<v Speaker 2>There's this</v>

640
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.351
<v Speaker 2>slight issue.</v>

641
00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:53.280
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be recording.</v>

642
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:53.581
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

643
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:54.361
<v Speaker 2>I'm recording it here.</v>

644
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:54.631
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

645
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:55.350
<v Speaker 2>What's the issue?</v>

646
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Not Hitting Ustream?</v>

647
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

648
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you reboot.</v>

649
00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.333
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

650
00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Kill your Michael.</v>

651
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

652
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

653
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.191
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

654
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:02.671
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

655
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:03.600
<v Speaker 2>that is a transition,</v>

656
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:03.811
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

657
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:04.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>

658
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 2>it's also like you're speaking from the heart,</v>

659
00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 2>but if you were in the gym,</v>

660
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.410
<v Speaker 2>if you walked in the gym and you were talking to a bunch of guys in the gym,</v>

661
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.610
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a normal conversation.</v>

662
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

663
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.450
<v Speaker 2>But you did it publicly.</v>

664
00:18:13.451 --> 00:18:14.340
<v Speaker 2>And when you do it publicly,</v>

665
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 2>you invite every fucking troll and all these certainly dorks that just sit in</v>

666
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:22.260
<v Speaker 2>front of the computer waiting for something like this to talk about.</v>

667
00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you get angry at you?</v>

668
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.190
<v Speaker 4>And I don't,</v>

669
00:18:24.191 --> 00:18:24.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

670
00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:26.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't follow my own personal,</v>

671
00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:26.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

672
00:18:26.861 --> 00:18:27.171
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

673
00:18:27.171 --> 00:18:32.020
<v Speaker 4>if that is a conversation I should have with him first before I ever go anywhere</v>

674
00:18:32.021 --> 00:18:32.351
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

675
00:18:32.351 --> 00:18:32.621
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

676
00:18:32.621 --> 00:18:34.720
<v Speaker 4>I actually tried to contact him a few days after and,</v>

677
00:18:34.721 --> 00:18:35.470
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

678
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:36.550
<v Speaker 4>he had just lost the fight.</v>

679
00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.061
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't,</v>

680
00:18:37.061 --> 00:18:38.200
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't ready to speak.</v>

681
00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:39.034
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

682
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

683
00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

684
00:18:40.151 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

685
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

686
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.011
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

687
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:43.570
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those situations where where you live and learn,</v>

688
00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

689
00:18:44.111 --> 00:18:46.240
<v Speaker 4>and you'll learn the hard way when you do something,</v>

690
00:18:46.241 --> 00:18:47.860
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time,</v>

691
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:48.993
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

692
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:50.853
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

693
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.230
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

694
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.850
<v Speaker 4>it's not one of those situations where it's going to make me back down from,</v>

695
00:18:54.851 --> 00:18:57.400
<v Speaker 4>from stating right from wrong in this sport,</v>

696
00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.260
<v Speaker 4>in standing up for what's right.</v>

697
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.420
<v Speaker 2>And you were saying that he was ready to take the nine months suspension.</v>

698
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.700
<v Speaker 2>He was ready to take the nine months suspension.</v>

699
00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Then they changed it to 12 and then they started having this a quarter.</v>

700
00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

701
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.781
<v Speaker 4>According to,</v>

702
00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:10.601
<v Speaker 4>to the UFC.</v>

703
00:19:10.601 --> 00:19:11.500
<v Speaker 4>So there was something where,</v>

704
00:19:11.501 --> 00:19:11.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

705
00:19:11.711 --> 00:19:14.170
<v Speaker 4>his camp was ready to take the nine month and then instead,</v>

706
00:19:14.171 --> 00:19:14.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

707
00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:15.250
<v Speaker 4>when it got up to 12,</v>

708
00:19:15.251 --> 00:19:18.070
<v Speaker 4>that's where they fought it and ended up beating it and then everything had to</v>

709
00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Speaker 4>be rescinded.</v>

710
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

711
00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:19.211
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

712
00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 2>they ended up beating it because the way that the tests were handled was</v>

713
00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:24.061
<v Speaker 2>incorrect.</v>

714
00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:26.760
<v Speaker 2>The way that the tests were administered was incorrect.</v>

715
00:19:26.761 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 2>It was all done by someone that the UFC had hired to do it,</v>

716
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:31.680
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't done to the protocol.</v>

717
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:31.971
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

718
00:19:31.971 --> 00:19:32.570
<v Speaker 4>The lab,</v>

719
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.460
<v Speaker 4>the lab couldn't know.</v>

720
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.010
<v Speaker 4>The lab was not capable of,</v>

721
00:19:36.011 --> 00:19:39.080
<v Speaker 4>of actually testing accurately for human growth hormone,</v>

722
00:19:39.081 --> 00:19:40.790
<v Speaker 4>which is what they said he failed for.</v>

723
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.020
<v Speaker 4>So that's kind of a disaster and it was an absolute disaster,</v>

724
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.831
<v Speaker 4>absolute disaster,</v>

725
00:19:45.831 --> 00:19:48.530
<v Speaker 4>which is really why the UFC has now abandoned,</v>

726
00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

727
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:50.400
<v Speaker 4>trying to do this and,</v>

728
00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:50.960
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

729
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.900
<v Speaker 4>they've taken a step backwards to evaluate.</v>

730
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.240
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating to me because the sport is,</v>

731
00:19:56.241 --> 00:19:57.074
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

732
00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.290
<v Speaker 2>it's the most intense and the most,</v>

733
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.550
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

734
00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:06.551
<v Speaker 2>the most dangerous sport in a sense that you have so much on the line.</v>

735
00:20:07.491 --> 00:20:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Like if you lose a,</v>

736
00:20:09.171 --> 00:20:10.040
<v Speaker 2>an auto race,</v>

737
00:20:10.041 --> 00:20:11.720
<v Speaker 2>auto races are dangerous and you could crash,</v>

738
00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:12.471
<v Speaker 2>you could die.</v>

739
00:20:12.471 --> 00:20:14.150
<v Speaker 2>And there's no doubt about that.</v>

740
00:20:14.151 --> 00:20:15.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a very dangerous game.</v>

741
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.850
<v Speaker 2>Football also very game.</v>

742
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.950
<v Speaker 2>But there's something about losing a fight that is so much more personal.</v>

743
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.780
<v Speaker 2>There's so much more on the line.</v>

744
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.450
<v Speaker 2>It's so much different than any other loss.</v>

745
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.640
<v Speaker 2>You lose a basketball game at fuck,</v>

746
00:20:28.641 --> 00:20:29.474
<v Speaker 2>we lost,</v>

747
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

748
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:30.891
<v Speaker 2>let's have a beer.</v>

749
00:20:30.891 --> 00:20:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you lose a fight,</v>

750
00:20:32.301 --> 00:20:32.660
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

751
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking life changing event.</v>

752
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.380
<v Speaker 4>Tremendous,</v>

753
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:35.951
<v Speaker 4>tremendous.</v>

754
00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:36.161
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

755
00:20:36.161 --> 00:20:36.611
<v Speaker 4>well one,</v>

756
00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:38.140
<v Speaker 4>there's no teammates to point to,</v>

757
00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:38.531
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

758
00:20:38.531 --> 00:20:40.000
<v Speaker 4>it's just you and the other guy in the ring.</v>

759
00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:42.940
<v Speaker 4>You sometimes you get guys who will use the referees and excuse that judges an</v>

760
00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:45.610
<v Speaker 4>excuse and you're on a 50% pay scale.</v>

761
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:46.841
<v Speaker 4>So when,</v>

762
00:20:46.841 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

763
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 4>when I would fight,</v>

764
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:48.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

765
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 4>I would get $40,000 to show up and fight and 40,000 more to win.</v>

766
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 4>That's a tremendous difference.</v>

767
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.250
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of months of pay in the mortgage debt.</v>

768
00:20:57.251 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

769
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

770
00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 4>a big chunk that I can then put away for the future and what I need to do as a</v>

771
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 4>fighter for when I retire.</v>

772
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.140
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of that.</v>

773
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:06.370
<v Speaker 4>So it becomes very personal.</v>

774
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 4>Not to mention you're standing your contract negotiations,</v>

775
00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:10.360
<v Speaker 4>who you fight next,</v>

776
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:11.740
<v Speaker 4>how soon you fight next.</v>

777
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.610
<v Speaker 4>All these things go into a play and depending on how you lose for fighter loses</v>

778
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.050
<v Speaker 4>by a vicious knockout,</v>

779
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.790
<v Speaker 4>how much of that just shortness his career?</v>

780
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:23.710
<v Speaker 4>So there's a lot on the line and in a big part of that is the reason why people</v>

781
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:25.000
<v Speaker 4>are so intrigued by this sport.</v>

782
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.040
<v Speaker 4>That's why they want to watch it because they know,</v>

783
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:27.341
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

784
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:28.240
<v Speaker 4>these guys,</v>

785
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.620
<v Speaker 4>they lay it on the line.</v>

786
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.310
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

787
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 4>this is different than any other sport.</v>

788
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:36.760
<v Speaker 4>Who are these people that are capable of making that walk in doing that?</v>

789
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.301
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>

790
00:21:37.301 --> 00:21:38.390
<v Speaker 4>that really I think is,</v>

791
00:21:38.391 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Speaker 4>is part of the reason why people are so,</v>

792
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:42.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

793
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:42.750
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

794
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 4>it eager to watch the sport and get so interested in so involved in it.</v>

795
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.760
<v Speaker 4>That victory incentive that doesn't exist in boxing does it?</v>

796
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.310
<v Speaker 4>You don't have,</v>

797
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.150
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a win loss thing and Boston as far as like 50 to win 50,</v>

798
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:55.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

799
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.400
<v Speaker 4>50 to show 50 to win,</v>

800
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.390
<v Speaker 4>then that's not,</v>

801
00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.660
<v Speaker 4>does that exist in boxing?</v>

802
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.371
<v Speaker 4>It May.</v>

803
00:22:00.371 --> 00:22:01.001
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen,</v>

804
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:02.350
<v Speaker 4>it's usually a contracted amount.</v>

805
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.730
<v Speaker 4>It's a contract amount.</v>

806
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.200
<v Speaker 4>That's an issue,</v>

807
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.130
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

808
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.701
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

809
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:09.660
<v Speaker 4>I think the UFC likes it because it makes people,</v>

810
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 4>it gives them an incentive to fight,</v>

811
00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:12.190
<v Speaker 4>but God damn,</v>

812
00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 4>don't they already have the incentive to fight.</v>

813
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.591
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

814
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:14.700
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

815
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.221
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

816
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things where when you talk to Joe Silva about some of those</v>

817
00:22:18.101 --> 00:22:18.431
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

818
00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:18.541
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

819
00:22:18.541 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 4>he has some,</v>

820
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 4>some very strong ideologies on it since he's been there so long,</v>

821
00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:24.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

822
00:22:24.111 --> 00:22:24.221
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

823
00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:27.310
<v Speaker 4>there's one point where they did finish bonuses for anybody who finished on the</v>

824
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

825
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 4>He said that was a complete failure.</v>

826
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:30.963
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

827
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:31.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

828
00:22:31.421 --> 00:22:32.320
<v Speaker 4>so it's interesting.</v>

829
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:33.730
<v Speaker 4>That would be a pretty cool,</v>

830
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:34.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

831
00:22:34.181 --> 00:22:35.380
<v Speaker 4>to pull all the data,</v>

832
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.330
<v Speaker 4>put it into some kind of model and see,</v>

833
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.081
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

834
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:39.130
<v Speaker 4>But in my opinion,</v>

835
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 4>it seems like to me it's,</v>

836
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:45.540
<v Speaker 4>it's financially more beneficial to win long term than it is to take a whole lot</v>

837
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:46.654
<v Speaker 4>of risks.</v>

838
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.201
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

839
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:47.441
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

840
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:48.274
<v Speaker 4>Without a doubt.</v>

841
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 4>And it's also,</v>

842
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:54.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean you only have so many fights in your career and if you're extending your</v>

843
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.780
<v Speaker 4>yourself and you're,</v>

844
00:22:57.781 --> 00:23:02.781
<v Speaker 4>you're putting yourself in danger to try to eek out a win and fighting in maybe</v>

845
00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:03.930
<v Speaker 4>what you would call it,</v>

846
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 4>a non technical way or fighting in a reckless way,</v>

847
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:08.470
<v Speaker 4>you'll longtime,</v>

848
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.580
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna cost yourself money.</v>

849
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.270
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

850
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:10.651
<v Speaker 4>Because you're,</v>

851
00:23:10.651 --> 00:23:13.990
<v Speaker 4>you're going to take shots he wouldn't take and you're going to put yourself</v>

852
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.420
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

853
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.880
<v Speaker 4>It's a short term gamble that really is only beneficial to the folks that are</v>

854
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:20.110
<v Speaker 4>watching it in the UFC.</v>

855
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.561
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

856
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:21.610
<v Speaker 4>And when you look at it,</v>

857
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:21.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

858
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:22.271
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

859
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:26.950
<v Speaker 4>from spending the last year calling fights and I've really gotten to know Joe</v>

860
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.980
<v Speaker 4>Silva,</v>

861
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.250
<v Speaker 4>Sean Shelby a lot better than I did when I was a fighter.</v>

862
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 4>I've seen them reward the guys,</v>

863
00:23:32.921 --> 00:23:33.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

864
00:23:33.071 --> 00:23:37.120
<v Speaker 4>there there was a missed miscommunication or I think some guys just had it</v>

865
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:37.540
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

866
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:37.721
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

867
00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:38.560
<v Speaker 4>back when I fought were,</v>

868
00:23:38.561 --> 00:23:38.681
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

869
00:23:38.681 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 4>I got to go in there and brawl.</v>

870
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.870
<v Speaker 4>I've seen them reward guys very well for going out there and fighting.</v>

871
00:23:43.871 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 4>Very similar how Frankie Edgar Foc Cub Swanson,</v>

872
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.630
<v Speaker 4>he didn't go out there and trade with them.</v>

873
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:48.231
<v Speaker 4>He went out there,</v>

874
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 4>he moved around duty to do,</v>

875
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 4>shot the take down and dominated the fight on the ground.</v>

876
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.310
<v Speaker 4>Then gets the finish the very last few seconds of the fifth round and,</v>

877
00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 4>and they absolutely love the fight like that.</v>

878
00:23:58.581 --> 00:23:59.414
<v Speaker 4>So I don't,</v>

879
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 4>I think that fighters need to realize,</v>

880
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:01.341
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

881
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:04.430
<v Speaker 4>go in there and get the fight finished as fast as you can.</v>

882
00:24:04.431 --> 00:24:05.900
<v Speaker 4>And when in most dominant fashion,</v>

883
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.810
<v Speaker 4>what I've seen where they get frustrated with his word guys,</v>

884
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 4>we'll ride certain positions out.</v>

885
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.570
<v Speaker 4>They get inside the guard,</v>

886
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:13.580
<v Speaker 4>make no attempt to pass to do more damage.</v>

887
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.840
<v Speaker 4>They get inside the clench.</v>

888
00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:17.450
<v Speaker 4>They're happy to just hold them against the cage for a while until the referee</v>

889
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:18.284
<v Speaker 4>separates them.</v>

890
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that's some of the things that get them a little frustrated when,</v>

891
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:24.260
<v Speaker 4>when guys will win fights like that,</v>

892
00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:26.310
<v Speaker 4>but then ask for major things after it's,</v>

893
00:24:26.311 --> 00:24:26.420
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

894
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 4>I want a better contract and went higher profile matchups I want to be in the</v>

895
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:29.481
<v Speaker 4>main Carter.</v>

896
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:30.314
<v Speaker 4>I want to be the main event</v>

897
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:31.740
<v Speaker 2>and for,</v>

898
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.850
<v Speaker 2>for folks that are not familiar with training camps,</v>

899
00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.300
<v Speaker 2>there's one thing that has to be taken into consideration when you watch a</v>

900
00:24:39.301 --> 00:24:39.541
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

901
00:24:39.541 --> 00:24:41.460
<v Speaker 2>When you see a guy may be stalling like that,</v>

902
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.290
<v Speaker 2>that guy might've fought injured,</v>

903
00:24:43.291 --> 00:24:44.550
<v Speaker 2>he might've fought sick,</v>

904
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.120
<v Speaker 2>he might have gotten injured during camp and not being able to train correctly,</v>

905
00:24:48.121 --> 00:24:50.430
<v Speaker 2>so he has to take advantage of what,</v>

906
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.600
<v Speaker 2>what little opportunities sometimes that he can get to take a break because he</v>

907
00:24:54.601 --> 00:24:56.430
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have the gas tank to go all out.</v>

908
00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

909
00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.230
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell by looking at a guy.</v>

910
00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:58.721
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

911
00:24:58.721 --> 00:24:59.554
<v Speaker 4>you're on the wall.</v>

912
00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.300
<v Speaker 4>When you're warmed up like that,</v>

913
00:25:01.301 --> 00:25:03.190
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be able to move through certain injuries,</v>

914
00:25:03.191 --> 00:25:06.520
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean you have as much pop on your punch or your kick with that,</v>

915
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.413
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

916
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.710
<v Speaker 4>with that portion of your body.</v>

917
00:25:08.711 --> 00:25:08.861
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

918
00:25:08.861 --> 00:25:09.760
<v Speaker 4>it was funny because,</v>

919
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:10.900
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

920
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:11.733
<v Speaker 4>I get it all the time,</v>

921
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.281
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

922
00:25:12.281 --> 00:25:14.590
<v Speaker 4>that fight with you and Vandelay Silva was awesome,</v>

923
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:15.550
<v Speaker 4>but why did you,</v>

924
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.260
<v Speaker 4>why did you fight him like that and you know,</v>

925
00:25:17.261 --> 00:25:18.094
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell him,</v>

926
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:18.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

927
00:25:18.491 --> 00:25:19.061
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>

928
00:25:19.061 --> 00:25:20.450
<v Speaker 4>I flew to Japan and,</v>

929
00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:21.131
<v Speaker 4>and I actually,</v>

930
00:25:21.131 --> 00:25:23.410
<v Speaker 4>I tore a part of my hip the second day there.</v>

931
00:25:23.411 --> 00:25:26.650
<v Speaker 4>It was real stiff from the training camp and I would overtrain bad,</v>

932
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:26.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

933
00:25:26.801 --> 00:25:27.010
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

934
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:28.300
<v Speaker 4>it was a big problem for me.</v>

935
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.710
<v Speaker 4>I always thought the more I could do,</v>

936
00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:33.520
<v Speaker 4>the better I'd be so I couldn't lift my left knee to my chest.</v>

937
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:33.691
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

938
00:25:33.691 --> 00:25:36.880
<v Speaker 4>and it's funny cause Doctor d who flies into all the events,</v>

939
00:25:36.881 --> 00:25:39.160
<v Speaker 4>he had to come right to my hotel room as soon as he got there.</v>

940
00:25:39.161 --> 00:25:39.431
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

941
00:25:39.431 --> 00:25:39.700
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

942
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.630
<v Speaker 4>just give me a light cane,</v>

943
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 4>completely allowable by the commission.</v>

944
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.091
<v Speaker 4>It's legal,</v>

945
00:25:43.091 --> 00:25:43.750
<v Speaker 4>it will numb it,</v>

946
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.583
<v Speaker 4>be good to go,</v>

947
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:45.460
<v Speaker 4>couldn't get it,</v>

948
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.930
<v Speaker 4>and Tokyo and so,</v>

949
00:25:46.931 --> 00:25:47.351
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

950
00:25:47.351 --> 00:25:49.060
<v Speaker 4>well you don't have to find a way around it.</v>

951
00:25:49.061 --> 00:25:49.571
<v Speaker 4>And this happens.</v>

952
00:25:49.571 --> 00:25:50.321
<v Speaker 4>All fighters who knows.</v>

953
00:25:50.321 --> 00:25:52.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean Vandelay could have easily showed up to that,</v>

954
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:52.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

955
00:25:52.721 --> 00:25:52.901
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

956
00:25:52.901 --> 00:25:54.550
<v Speaker 4>with something torn in his body as well.</v>

957
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:55.601
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

958
00:25:55.601 --> 00:25:55.841
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

959
00:25:55.841 --> 00:25:58.660
<v Speaker 4>you go in there round one and Iraq them if they are right and well,</v>

960
00:25:58.661 --> 00:25:59.950
<v Speaker 4>this guy's got a lot of miles on them.</v>

961
00:25:59.951 --> 00:26:02.770
<v Speaker 4>One more shot and I'll finish this thing.</v>

962
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:03.671
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

963
00:26:03.671 --> 00:26:04.510
<v Speaker 4>He just knocked me down,</v>

964
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.261
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

965
00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:05.920
<v Speaker 4>And then it just,</v>

966
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.860
<v Speaker 4>it kind of started going back and forth and uh,</v>

967
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:09.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

968
00:26:09.311 --> 00:26:10.031
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those fights,</v>

969
00:26:10.031 --> 00:26:13.180
<v Speaker 4>you almost blackout and you just get lost in the violence and,</v>

970
00:26:13.181 --> 00:26:14.920
<v Speaker 4>and knowing you're putting on a great fight.</v>

971
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.670
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

972
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.121
<v Speaker 4>that even,</v>

973
00:26:16.121 --> 00:26:16.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

974
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.850
<v Speaker 4>when I woke up and I started to realize what happened,</v>

975
00:26:18.851 --> 00:26:20.320
<v Speaker 4>which was when Jon Anik starts interviewed me,</v>

976
00:26:20.321 --> 00:26:20.561
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

977
00:26:20.561 --> 00:26:21.160
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

978
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.993
<v Speaker 4>I lost,</v>

979
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:22.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

980
00:26:22.271 --> 00:26:23.440
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those things where,</v>

981
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.390
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

982
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

983
00:26:24.581 --> 00:26:26.230
<v Speaker 4>but at least I went out on my shield.</v>

984
00:26:26.231 --> 00:26:29.380
<v Speaker 4>The fights that really haunt you are the ones where you go home and you're like,</v>

985
00:26:29.381 --> 00:26:30.100
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

986
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.240
<v Speaker 4>I could've pushed a little harder.</v>

987
00:26:31.241 --> 00:26:31.931
<v Speaker 4>I could have done this.</v>

988
00:26:31.931 --> 00:26:32.764
<v Speaker 4>I could've done that.</v>

989
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.980
<v Speaker 2>That was a wild fucking fire.</v>

990
00:26:34.981 --> 00:26:36.100
<v Speaker 2>You and Val van de la,</v>

991
00:26:36.101 --> 00:26:36.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

992
00:26:36.421 --> 00:26:37.320
<v Speaker 2>whatever you say,</v>

993
00:26:37.321 --> 00:26:39.660
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want about performance enhancing drugs.</v>

994
00:26:39.661 --> 00:26:43.470
<v Speaker 2>And he did run a Wa Vandelay suspended for life for who?</v>

995
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Don't know the</v>

996
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.903
<v Speaker 5>whole story.</v>

997
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.260
<v Speaker 5>He ran away from a random drug test.</v>

998
00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 5>They showed up at his gym and literally ran out the door.</v>

999
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.471
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

1000
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:53.560
<v Speaker 5>I got to go see it.</v>

1001
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 5>And they suspended him for life,</v>

1002
00:26:55.891 --> 00:26:57.240
<v Speaker 5>which is really unprecedented.</v>

1003
00:26:57.241 --> 00:27:01.080
<v Speaker 5>And in my opinion it's kind of fucked up because the guy is a legend.</v>

1004
00:27:01.081 --> 00:27:03.050
<v Speaker 5>And one of my all time favorite fighters,</v>

1005
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.180
<v Speaker 5>if not my all time kills me to,</v>

1006
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.180
<v Speaker 5>to see,</v>

1007
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:07.171
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1008
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:07.521
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1009
00:27:07.521 --> 00:27:08.580
<v Speaker 5>he absolutely,</v>

1010
00:27:08.581 --> 00:27:11.010
<v Speaker 5>people should be punished for what they did wrong.</v>

1011
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.900
<v Speaker 5>But let's,</v>

1012
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:14.220
<v Speaker 5>and I've actually said this in a couple of years,</v>

1013
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they ever saw,</v>

1014
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.571
<v Speaker 5>but eight let's,</v>

1015
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:18.480
<v Speaker 5>let's not completely black out the entire career.</v>

1016
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:19.000
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1017
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.280
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1018
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.250
<v Speaker 5>there are hall of fame Worthy Martial Artists who they screwed up like every</v>

1019
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 5>other human being in there.</v>

1020
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:24.541
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1021
00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:27.840
<v Speaker 5>call a spade a spade and make them stand accountable for it.</v>

1022
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 5>But at the end of the day they have an entire body of work to look upon.</v>

1023
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.060
<v Speaker 5>But isn't it true though,</v>

1024
00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:35.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean some of these guys that are hall of fame type guys,</v>

1025
00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:39.900
<v Speaker 5>Hall of fame caliber guys most likely were cheating their entire careers.</v>

1026
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:40.171
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1027
00:27:40.171 --> 00:27:40.441
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1028
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 5>there's a big percentage of guys who you could point a finger at,</v>

1029
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.080
<v Speaker 5>especially guys that are fighting in Japan.</v>

1030
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.450
<v Speaker 5>And if you talk to the guys who fought in Japan,</v>

1031
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.740
<v Speaker 5>they will tell you that,</v>

1032
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1033
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.450
<v Speaker 5>this is what was going on.</v>

1034
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.520
<v Speaker 5>Mark Coleman told me,</v>

1035
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.600
<v Speaker 5>he went backstage and he saw Vandelay oiling up his body.</v>

1036
00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.130
<v Speaker 5>He saw him oil.</v>

1037
00:27:59.131 --> 00:27:59.401
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1038
00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:00.490
<v Speaker 5>the fuck you doing man,</v>

1039
00:28:00.491 --> 00:28:01.324
<v Speaker 5>you can't do that.</v>

1040
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.240
<v Speaker 5>They were oiling up so that nobody can take it down.</v>

1041
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:05.731
<v Speaker 5>Circus.</v>

1042
00:28:05.731 --> 00:28:06.564
<v Speaker 5>Back then,</v>

1043
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.330
<v Speaker 5>that organization was an absolute circus.</v>

1044
00:28:09.331 --> 00:28:10.620
<v Speaker 5>And for people that are listening,</v>

1045
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 5>it is light years different in the UFC.</v>

1046
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:14.580
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1047
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.060
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1048
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.421
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

1049
00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:15.651
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1050
00:28:15.651 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 5>that was an absolute circus.</v>

1051
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.740
<v Speaker 5>They let fighters fight like fights.</v>

1052
00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:20.730
<v Speaker 5>It should have never taken place.</v>

1053
00:28:20.731 --> 00:28:23.700
<v Speaker 5>Like how about Bob Sapp 375 pounds.</v>

1054
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.690
<v Speaker 5>Fought to Maura interests like one 85 right.</v>

1055
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.010
<v Speaker 5>Any anything?</v>

1056
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:29.371
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1057
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:33.900
<v Speaker 5>literally if they could have put a tiger in there with a human being,</v>

1058
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.270
<v Speaker 5>they knew they would have made money off that and they wouldn't,</v>

1059
00:28:36.271 --> 00:28:37.890
<v Speaker 5>they would have absolutely done that.</v>

1060
00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:40.380
<v Speaker 5>If they could find a way to not go to jail afterwards,</v>

1061
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:41.243
<v Speaker 5>they would have done it.</v>

1062
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.790
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1063
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 5>they put together some fucking ridiculous shows.</v>

1064
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.770
<v Speaker 5>What about Hong Man Choi versus fader?</v>

1065
00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.611
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>

1066
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:48.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1067
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.550
<v Speaker 5>hung Troy was like seven feet tall.</v>

1068
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.250
<v Speaker 5>He weighed 300 who knows what the fuck pounds.</v>

1069
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.540
<v Speaker 5>He was a legitimate giant.</v>

1070
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:55.830
<v Speaker 5>He absolutely w with,</v>

1071
00:28:55.831 --> 00:28:59.160
<v Speaker 5>with less athleticism and his body than my five year old daughter.</v>

1072
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.581
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:28:59.581 --> 00:29:00.810
<v Speaker 5>Well the poor guy was like,</v>

1074
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.230
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1075
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 5>he's bones probably weighed as much as this fucking table.</v>

1076
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:04.231
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1077
00:29:04.231 --> 00:29:05.040
<v Speaker 5>he was just,</v>

1078
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:05.791
<v Speaker 5>he was a mess.</v>

1079
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:06.031
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1080
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:08.790
<v Speaker 5>physically he had fucking tumor in his pituitary gland.</v>

1081
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.291
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1082
00:29:09.291 --> 00:29:09.370
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1083
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.560
<v Speaker 5>that's why the same as big foot Silva Silva,</v>

1084
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:13.830
<v Speaker 5>who's still fights for the UFC,</v>

1085
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.880
<v Speaker 5>still an elite fighter.</v>

1086
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean that poor fucking guy.</v>

1087
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.011
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1088
00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:21.480
<v Speaker 5>he's a guy who legitimately needs testosterone replacement therapy and he can't</v>

1089
00:29:21.481 --> 00:29:22.650
<v Speaker 5>have it and he's got to have a,</v>

1090
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.820
<v Speaker 5>some operation on his head now and now he's gonna Fight Frank Mir.</v>

1091
00:29:26.821 --> 00:29:27.100
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1092
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.560
<v Speaker 5>Cause he's got Frank Mir coming up.</v>

1093
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:29.401
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

1094
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:30.090
<v Speaker 5>God bless him.</v>

1095
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:30.271
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1096
00:29:30.271 --> 00:29:31.530
<v Speaker 5>the guy's still in there throwing,</v>

1097
00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:32.281
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>

1098
00:29:32.281 --> 00:29:34.380
<v Speaker 5>he's a guy who legitimately needs it.</v>

1099
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.340
<v Speaker 5>Fucking Nogueira.</v>

1100
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:36.571
<v Speaker 5>We've,</v>

1101
00:29:36.571 --> 00:29:38.400
<v Speaker 5>we played it a couple of weeks ago.</v>

1102
00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 5>We did a fight companion and watched Nogueira versus Bob Sab own fucking</v>

1103
00:29:42.161 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 5>Nogueira got pile drive quite 375 pound.</v>

1104
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 5>Bob Sat picked him up and dropped him and Noguera's weight on Noguera's head.</v>

1105
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:54.060
<v Speaker 5>It was the fucking most horrendous thing to ever watch someone do to someone.</v>

1106
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1107
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.390
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>

1108
00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.180
<v Speaker 5>And me and mom knew Gurwin went on to win that fight,</v>

1109
00:29:58.181 --> 00:30:00.740
<v Speaker 5>which shows you how tough deck guy was back then.</v>

1110
00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:01.900
<v Speaker 5>Then that dude is,</v>

1111
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:06.580
<v Speaker 5>I saw him in Rio just a few weeks ago and it was so cool to seek his,</v>

1112
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:06.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1113
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:07.710
<v Speaker 5>everyone was just sitting at this,</v>

1114
00:30:07.711 --> 00:30:08.800
<v Speaker 5>this little bar,</v>

1115
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 5>and it was right next to the restaurant in the hotel.</v>

1116
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 5>And when he came walking downstairs is humble as can humanly be.</v>

1117
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.120
<v Speaker 5>He comes down,</v>

1118
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.350
<v Speaker 5>everybody stood up,</v>

1119
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 5>not just presents,</v>

1120
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:23.440
<v Speaker 5>but everybody associated with fighting stood up out of respect for this guy who,</v>

1121
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:23.771
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1122
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:27.460
<v Speaker 5>the day he retire should be immediately put into the UFC hall of fame.</v>

1123
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:27.731
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1124
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:28.331
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

1125
00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:28.671
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

1126
00:30:28.671 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1127
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.240
<v Speaker 5>there should be some sort of a martial arts hall of fame,</v>

1128
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:31.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1129
00:30:31.811 --> 00:30:33.010
<v Speaker 5>like not just the UFC,</v>

1130
00:30:33.011 --> 00:30:34.690
<v Speaker 5>just to all schools,</v>

1131
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.130
<v Speaker 5>all disciplines.</v>

1132
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1133
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 5>he's in there for sure.</v>

1134
00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:38.351
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1135
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:39.300
<v Speaker 5>he explained,</v>

1136
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:39.581
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1137
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:43.870
<v Speaker 5>he showed how you could win fights off your back and the heavyweight division,</v>

1138
00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:44.740
<v Speaker 5>which nobody was doing.</v>

1139
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:45.340
<v Speaker 5>Worries.</v>

1140
00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.080
<v Speaker 5>Triangling Mark Coleman,</v>

1141
00:30:47.081 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 5>who the fuck is going to try and Mark Coleman,</v>

1142
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.190
<v Speaker 5>he's going to pick it up and slam me.</v>

1143
00:30:50.191 --> 00:30:50.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1144
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.180
<v Speaker 5>and mark home and by the way,</v>

1145
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.230
<v Speaker 5>fighting in pride,</v>

1146
00:30:53.231 --> 00:30:55.420
<v Speaker 5>most likely on a variety of Mexican supplements.</v>

1147
00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:55.601
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1148
00:30:55.601 --> 00:30:56.740
<v Speaker 5>he's fucking,</v>

1149
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 5>he looks insane.</v>

1150
00:30:58.271 --> 00:30:59.081
<v Speaker 5>He was enormous.</v>

1151
00:30:59.081 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 5>He was so good back then too.</v>

1152
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.211
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1153
00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:01.901
<v Speaker 5>that was mark,</v>

1154
00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1155
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:06.490
<v Speaker 5>like during the days where he won the pride heavyweight Grand Prix leather skin,</v>

1156
00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:08.320
<v Speaker 5>fucking animal.</v>

1157
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:09.520
<v Speaker 5>Mark Coleman.</v>

1158
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.331
<v Speaker 5>I was there.</v>

1159
00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:12.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm of the first fight ever worked was UFC 12.</v>

1160
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.860
<v Speaker 5>And that was when Mark Coleman won the UFC heavyweight title beat Dan Severn.</v>

1161
00:31:16.861 --> 00:31:20.110
<v Speaker 5>He got him in a fucking judo headlock and just almost pulled his head off.</v>

1162
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.300
<v Speaker 5>It was the old school yard,</v>

1163
00:31:22.301 --> 00:31:23.250
<v Speaker 5>the school yard moving.</v>

1164
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:23.771
<v Speaker 5>Well it wasn't,</v>

1165
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:25.060
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't quite the school yard move.</v>

1166
00:31:25.061 --> 00:31:25.421
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

1167
00:31:25.421 --> 00:31:27.610
<v Speaker 5>he was kind of in like side control,</v>

1168
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:31.610
<v Speaker 5>but laying on top of them and he had his head and he was just fucking Yank.</v>

1169
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.480
<v Speaker 5>And can I forget the,</v>

1170
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:33.920

1173
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:37.150
<v Speaker 5>Dean lister in us?</v>

1174
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:37.870
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

1175
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:38.703
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1177
00:31:43.781 --> 00:31:44.291
<v Speaker 5>old in the UFC,</v>

1178
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:45.124
<v Speaker 5>he's a heavyweight.</v>

1179
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.330
<v Speaker 5>He tapped out cre tech,</v>

1180
00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 5>the three guys in a row at that technique.</v>

1181
00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:48.724
<v Speaker 5>It's brutal.</v>

1182
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.301
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1183
00:31:49.301 --> 00:31:50.560
<v Speaker 5>If a guy gets you like that,</v>

1184
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:52.030
<v Speaker 5>especially a guy like Josh Barnett,</v>

1185
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:53.710
<v Speaker 5>he's got a ridiculous grip.</v>

1186
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.210
<v Speaker 5>He gets you in that position and good night fucks.</v>

1187
00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean fucking tab dean lister who's a Abu Dhabi,</v>

1188
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:00.161
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>

1189
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:03.040
<v Speaker 5>One of the best submission wrestlers in the world means something.</v>

1190
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:03.581
<v Speaker 5>If you can't,</v>

1191
00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:06.520
<v Speaker 5>that guy a bad dude.</v>

1192
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 5>He's a bad motherfucker and he is the best representative in my opinion,</v>

1193
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:13.630
<v Speaker 5>in all of modern MMA for catch wrestling.</v>

1194
00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean he really is a student of that game.</v>

1195
00:32:15.821 --> 00:32:17.320
<v Speaker 5>He really understands that sport.</v>

1196
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 5>That was the fight when he fought Daniel Cormay.</v>

1197
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:21.670
<v Speaker 5>That was a fight that woke me up.</v>

1198
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:21.910
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1199
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:22.920
<v Speaker 5>when you see us at me mean caught me.</v>

1200
00:32:22.921 --> 00:32:23.651
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have like eight,</v>

1201
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:24.820
<v Speaker 5>nine fights at that point in time.</v>

1202
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:25.241
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>

1203
00:32:25.241 --> 00:32:25.421
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1204
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:26.350
<v Speaker 5>he had barely any,</v>

1205
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:27.730
<v Speaker 5>any experience.</v>

1206
00:32:27.731 --> 00:32:31.330
<v Speaker 5>And he goes in there and beats a guy like Josh Barnett were granted his</v>

1207
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:31.901
<v Speaker 5>wrestling game.</v>

1208
00:32:31.901 --> 00:32:33.100
<v Speaker 5>A major advantage in that.</v>

1209
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:34.390
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1210
00:32:34.391 --> 00:32:35.530
<v Speaker 5>still Barnett's,</v>

1211
00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:36.370
<v Speaker 5>a crafty guy.</v>

1212
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:37.360
<v Speaker 5>You make any mistakes in there.</v>

1213
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:38.350
<v Speaker 5>He's going to catch you.</v>

1214
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 5>Screen keeps</v>

1215
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.281
<v Speaker 4>going.</v>

1216
00:32:40.281 --> 00:32:41.114
<v Speaker 4>Black over here.</v>

1217
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:41.983

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 4>is this not real?</v>

1219
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1220
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.413
<v Speaker 4>It's still going out.</v>

1221
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:45.783
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1222
00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:46.710
<v Speaker 4>It's not on.</v>

1223
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Not on my fucking computer.</v>

1224
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:48.764

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:51.321
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

00:32:51.321 --> 00:32:51.621
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1230
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:53.810
<v Speaker 4>Josh Barnett is a very good wrestler too.</v>

1231
00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 4>So to see Daniel Cormier launch him through the air like that.</v>

1232
00:32:56.511 --> 00:32:57.950
<v Speaker 4>And the same thing he did to Dan Henderson,</v>

1233
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.000
<v Speaker 4>who fuck has ever done that.</v>

1234
00:32:59.050 --> 00:32:59.780
<v Speaker 4>Dan Henderson,</v>

1235
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.700
<v Speaker 4>I trained the first time that traded Daniel Cormier,</v>

1236
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:03.280
<v Speaker 4>we were all doing one of these shows here in,</v>

1237
00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:03.921
<v Speaker 4>in La.</v>

1238
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:04.251
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

1239
00:33:04.251 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1240
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:04.771
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1241
00:33:04.771 --> 00:33:05.900
<v Speaker 4>let's get a session in today.</v>

1242
00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:10.901
<v Speaker 4>And so we go to this tiny little gym and it's got one of those really small</v>

1243
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:12.074
<v Speaker 4>cages.</v>

1244
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1245
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:12.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1246
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:14.740
<v Speaker 4>I could lay across at night almost be,</v>

1247
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:15.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1248
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:16.170
<v Speaker 4>as long as the Cajun,</v>

1249
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm trained to a core mia and he's picking me up.</v>

1250
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:19.251
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1251
00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:21.500
<v Speaker 4>if he wanted to throw me right out of this octagon,</v>

1252
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 4>I've never had a man picked me up that easy.</v>

1253
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.160
<v Speaker 4>Once his hips pop,</v>

1254
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 4>you're in the air and it just,</v>

1255
00:33:27.201 --> 00:33:29.540
<v Speaker 4>it shows the kind of leverage and be,</v>

1256
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1257
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.650
<v Speaker 4>the length and the technique that Jon Jones has to have stopped that repeatedly</v>

1258
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:35.090
<v Speaker 4>and stifle those attempts.</v>

1259
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:35.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1260
00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.060
<v Speaker 4>When the one time that Daniel did take them down like that,</v>

1261
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.870
<v Speaker 4>it was for a second and John was back up to his feet like he was on springs</v>

1262
00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:44.810
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't even have been scored a takedown in wrestling news.</v>

1263
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1264
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean he'd belly down immediately and pop Rebecca.</v>

1265
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.153
<v Speaker 4>It was incredible.</v>

1266
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:48.441
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1267
00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:49.580
<v Speaker 4>John is a freak.</v>

1268
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:49.851
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1269
00:33:49.851 --> 00:33:51.320
<v Speaker 4>he's a real freak athlete,</v>

1270
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.011
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1271
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 4>And the crazy part is he,</v>

1272
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1273
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if John's ever been in a Jujitsu class in shrimped before.</v>

1274
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 4>Really like [inaudible] he's never lifted weights in between fights.</v>

1275
00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 4>To my knowledge.</v>

1276
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.210
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't train.</v>

1277
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:05.901
<v Speaker 4>The key comes,</v>

1278
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:08.420
<v Speaker 4>he does his seven to nine week camp.</v>

1279
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.900
<v Speaker 4>He leaves martial arts is over at the,</v>

1280
00:34:10.901 --> 00:34:12.290
<v Speaker 4>he's got a heavy bag in his basement,</v>

1281
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:14.240
<v Speaker 4>his house in New York that he'll hit her once in a while.</v>

1282
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.830
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm dead serious.</v>

1283
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.390
<v Speaker 4>And so now he's actually moving to Albuquerque and saying how I'm going to train</v>

1284
00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:20.871
<v Speaker 4>year round.</v>

1285
00:34:20.871 --> 00:34:21.704
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

1286
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1287
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:24.410
<v Speaker 4>aside from all the other things going on with him,</v>

1288
00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:24.521
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1289
00:34:24.521 --> 00:34:26.270
<v Speaker 4>he's obviously got some things to take care of,</v>

1290
00:34:26.271 --> 00:34:27.530
<v Speaker 4>but he comes out of this,</v>

1291
00:34:27.531 --> 00:34:29.360
<v Speaker 4>the other end in search training year round.</v>

1292
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.280
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

1293
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:31.941
<v Speaker 4>really scary.</v>

1294
00:34:31.941 --> 00:34:32.151
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1295
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:32.531
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>

1296
00:34:32.531 --> 00:34:34.310
<v Speaker 4>he never lifts weights in between fights.</v>

1297
00:34:34.311 --> 00:34:37.910
<v Speaker 4>He just comes in and start lifting then that's so incredible.</v>

1298
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:38.960
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>

1299
00:34:38.961 --> 00:34:40.700
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't train in between fights.</v>

1300
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.440
<v Speaker 4>So what does he do in between fights?</v>

1301
00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:43.140
<v Speaker 4>Just hangs out.</v>

1302
00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:43.973
<v Speaker 4>He's got nothing there.</v>

1303
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.930
<v Speaker 4>He lives in Ithaca,</v>

1304
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:45.711
<v Speaker 4>Ithaca,</v>

1305
00:34:45.711 --> 00:34:45.981
<v Speaker 4>New York.</v>

1306
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 4>I drove when I was supposed to,</v>

1307
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:48.800
<v Speaker 4>when I was fighting Phil Davis,</v>

1308
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.210
<v Speaker 4>they gave me that fight.</v>

1309
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.100
<v Speaker 4>It was right after I had just fought in December.</v>

1310
00:34:52.101 --> 00:34:53.330
<v Speaker 4>I had just had a baby.</v>

1311
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.201
<v Speaker 4>And so we were,</v>

1312
00:34:54.201 --> 00:34:56.340
<v Speaker 4>we already had plane tickets booked to go to Pennsylvania.</v>

1313
00:34:56.341 --> 00:34:58.070
<v Speaker 4>You see some family for Christmas where I'm from.</v>

1314
00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:58.881
<v Speaker 4>And so man,</v>

1315
00:34:58.881 --> 00:35:00.020
<v Speaker 4>I got to train with some wrestlers.</v>

1316
00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:01.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm them fighting this guy named Phil Davis,</v>

1317
00:35:01.651 --> 00:35:02.790
<v Speaker 4>who I can't find any footage on,</v>

1318
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 4>but I know he's a national champion.</v>

1319
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really a good matchup for this guy.</v>

1320
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.330
<v Speaker 4>So of course,</v>

1321
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:08.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1322
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.200
<v Speaker 4>I end up driving all the way up to upstate New York to try and train with John.</v>

1323
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:13.340
<v Speaker 4>And I'm trained in some,</v>

1324
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was like Ithaca College summat somewhere.</v>

1325
00:35:16.551 --> 00:35:20.180
<v Speaker 4>He shows up in sweat pants and tosses me all over the place.</v>

1326
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:20.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1327
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:21.590
<v Speaker 4>he didn't know anything back then.</v>

1328
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.030
<v Speaker 4>He knew a little bit of wrestling.</v>

1329
00:35:23.031 --> 00:35:24.350
<v Speaker 4>He didn't know any Jujitsu,</v>

1330
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:25.640
<v Speaker 4>he didn't know how to strike.</v>

1331
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.620
<v Speaker 4>He was watching the first day and Greg Jackson's gym,</v>

1332
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.461
<v Speaker 4>he's a call man.</v>

1333
00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:30.380
<v Speaker 4>I watched all these youtube videos and Muhammad Ali.</v>

1334
00:35:30.381 --> 00:35:33.560
<v Speaker 4>So he goes in there and he's got his hands down and he snapped and jabs playing</v>

1335
00:35:33.561 --> 00:35:33.861
<v Speaker 4>the rope,</v>

1336
00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:35.510
<v Speaker 4>a dope with Muhammad Ali and just,</v>

1337
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:35.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1338
00:35:35.801 --> 00:35:38.490
<v Speaker 4>toasting everybody what a freak.</v>

1339
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 4>Greg was running around the gym,</v>

1340
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.690
<v Speaker 4>running around the gym saying till his wife saying to me that,</v>

1341
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.730
<v Speaker 4>that's my next champion.</v>

1342
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.600
<v Speaker 4>That's my next champion.</v>

1343
00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:46.081
<v Speaker 4>At the time,</v>

1344
00:35:46.081 --> 00:35:47.190
<v Speaker 4>I was still at light heavyweight.</v>

1345
00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:48.150
<v Speaker 4>So Greg politely said,</v>

1346
00:35:48.151 --> 00:35:48.361
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1347
00:35:48.361 --> 00:35:49.230
<v Speaker 4>after you Brian,</v>

1348
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:50.011
<v Speaker 4>and I looked at him,</v>

1349
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:50.251
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1350
00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:50.401
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1351
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:50.641
<v Speaker 4>Greg,</v>

1352
00:35:50.641 --> 00:35:51.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1353
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm old enough and mature enough that that I can tell you right off the bat,</v>

1354
00:35:54.061 --> 00:35:54.431
<v Speaker 4>look you,</v>

1355
00:35:54.431 --> 00:35:55.020
<v Speaker 4>you could,</v>

1356
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.450
<v Speaker 4>you could save that shit for someone else.</v>

1357
00:35:57.451 --> 00:35:58.284
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1358
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:00.630
<v Speaker 4>well that's rare and that's one of the reasons why you've been able to</v>

1359
00:36:00.631 --> 00:36:05.550
<v Speaker 4>transition successfully into a career in broadcasting is that like you,</v>

1360
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.820
<v Speaker 4>you let it go like in a way that very few guys do.</v>

1361
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.391
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>

1362
00:36:09.391 --> 00:36:10.830
<v Speaker 4>you let it go with many,</v>

1363
00:36:10.831 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 4>many miles still left on your engine.</v>

1364
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:13.920
<v Speaker 4>You just decided,</v>

1365
00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:14.754
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

1366
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay.</v>

1367
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:16.561
<v Speaker 4>I'm good.</v>

1368
00:36:16.561 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm young,</v>

1369
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.083
<v Speaker 4>I'm healthy.</v>

1370
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.350
<v Speaker 4>I can still fight for sure.</v>

1371
00:36:19.351 --> 00:36:21.000
<v Speaker 4>You could still compete at the highest level,</v>

1372
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:22.500
<v Speaker 4>but you decided and yeah,</v>

1373
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm good.</v>

1374
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.791
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1375
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:24.990
<v Speaker 4>and there was a couple,</v>

1376
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:25.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1377
00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Speaker 4>there are a couple things to it.</v>

1378
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:27.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1379
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.633
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1380
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:29.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1381
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:29.221
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1382
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:33.120
<v Speaker 4>when I got knocked out by Vandelay I knew right then that night in my hotel room</v>

1383
00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:33.721
<v Speaker 4>that I was done.</v>

1384
00:36:33.721 --> 00:36:36.990
<v Speaker 4>If I can't beat a fighter who's an aging fighter who yes,</v>

1385
00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 4>he's one of the best of all time ds and aging fighter.</v>

1386
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:40.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm now taking a step backwards.</v>

1387
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.160
<v Speaker 4>I had to evaluate because I played football for 14 years.</v>

1388
00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1389
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.100
<v Speaker 4>got hit with a few LEDs and Iraq.</v>

1390
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a few indicators here and then,</v>

1391
00:36:48.961 --> 00:36:49.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1392
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.070
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1393
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.880
<v Speaker 4>I trained in the air and came up in MMA where it was you go to war twice a week</v>

1394
00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:54.714
<v Speaker 4>in sparring.</v>

1395
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:55.111
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1396
00:36:55.111 --> 00:36:56.040
<v Speaker 4>That was a different era.</v>

1397
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Right now they're just starting to,</v>

1398
00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.760
<v Speaker 2>you're starting to see those guys in the gym.</v>

1399
00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:02.630
<v Speaker 2>The 10 year later,</v>

1400
00:37:02.631 --> 00:37:03.950
<v Speaker 2>guys that are still,</v>

1401
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:04.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1402
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:09.380
<v Speaker 2>sort of in the sport but have diminished considerably in their faculties have</v>

1403
00:37:09.381 --> 00:37:10.370
<v Speaker 2>diminished considerably.</v>

1404
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.100
<v Speaker 2>And that's the,</v>

1405
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.980
<v Speaker 2>that's a big issue that a lot of people have is those guys that nobody talks to,</v>

1406
00:37:15.981 --> 00:37:20.180
<v Speaker 2>those guys that are still around and you get a chance to see what that style of</v>

1407
00:37:20.181 --> 00:37:21.740
<v Speaker 2>training can do to you.</v>

1408
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Now you've seen a lot of guys who were training there.</v>

1409
00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.990
<v Speaker 2>If you've kind good training partners,</v>

1410
00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.580
<v Speaker 2>you can get so much better by not hitting each other harm.</v>

1411
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:30.260
<v Speaker 2>So Lou,</v>

1412
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.420
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that people have a hard time accepting.</v>

1413
00:37:32.421 --> 00:37:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants everybody to be tough.</v>

1414
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Most fucking guys in the UFC already tough.</v>

1415
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.020
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to take punches to be tough,</v>

1416
00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:39.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1417
00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:42.100
<v Speaker 2>it's just what you need to do is work on your reflexes,</v>

1418
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 2>your timing,</v>

1419
00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:43.461
<v Speaker 2>your technique,</v>

1420
00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:46.160
<v Speaker 2>and then the skillset working on strategies,</v>

1421
00:37:46.161 --> 00:37:50.960
<v Speaker 2>working on understanding what to do in various positions were to never be what</v>

1422
00:37:50.961 --> 00:37:54.770
<v Speaker 2>to do if you find yourself in a place that instead of just winging it on</v>

1423
00:37:54.771 --> 00:37:55.251
<v Speaker 2>toughness,</v>

1424
00:37:55.251 --> 00:37:55.790
<v Speaker 2>which you'll see,</v>

1425
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:56.720
<v Speaker 2>you're still seeing,</v>

1426
00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:00.860
<v Speaker 2>you're still seeing guys fight at the highest level with their fucking Chin up</v>

1427
00:38:00.861 --> 00:38:01.281
<v Speaker 2>in the air,</v>

1428
00:38:01.281 --> 00:38:04.250
<v Speaker 2>their hands down and they're winging punches and they're going in.</v>

1429
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.821
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1430
00:38:04.821 --> 00:38:07.210
<v Speaker 2>occasionally it works and occasionally it doesn't.</v>

1431
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:07.651
<v Speaker 4>And they're,</v>

1432
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:07.910
<v Speaker 4>and they're,</v>

1433
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.510
<v Speaker 4>they're flipping coins when they do it and it's,</v>

1434
00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.773
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1435
00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:11.800
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly right.</v>

1436
00:38:11.801 --> 00:38:15.610
<v Speaker 4>And a big part of my focus when I get to visit with all these fighters,</v>

1437
00:38:15.611 --> 00:38:16.870
<v Speaker 4>before I call their fights,</v>

1438
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.310
<v Speaker 4>I'll talk to him about that.</v>

1439
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:18.581
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1440
00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:23.230
<v Speaker 4>your objective is to make the maximum amount of money for as long as you can in</v>

1441
00:38:23.231 --> 00:38:23.711
<v Speaker 4>your career.</v>

1442
00:38:23.711 --> 00:38:25.450
<v Speaker 4>Fight as many times a year as you can.</v>

1443
00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:26.860
<v Speaker 4>And I'll always ask them,</v>

1444
00:38:26.861 --> 00:38:28.120
<v Speaker 4>do you get paid in the gym?</v>

1445
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.010
<v Speaker 4>Of course they look at me like I'm stupid.</v>

1446
00:38:30.011 --> 00:38:30.221
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1447
00:38:30.221 --> 00:38:30.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1448
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:31.810
<v Speaker 4>You could pay when you fight.</v>

1449
00:38:31.811 --> 00:38:32.644
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1450
00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:33.370
<v Speaker 4>So why,</v>

1451
00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:34.510
<v Speaker 4>why are you fighting in the gym?</v>

1452
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:35.471
<v Speaker 4>You can look,</v>

1453
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm guilty</v>

1454
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.071
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1455
00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:37.150
<v Speaker 5>and I use it myself.</v>

1456
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:37.920
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1457
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.171
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1458
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:40.060
<v Speaker 5>for years never got rocked.</v>

1459
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.280
<v Speaker 5>And I spar with some really hard hitting guys.</v>

1460
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:42.461
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1461
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 5>Jardeen Rashad Evans,</v>

1462
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:44.381
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1463
00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:47.980
<v Speaker 5>some really good guys that that would get after I would never get rocked.</v>

1464
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:49.360
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden,</v>

1465
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1466
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:51.340
<v Speaker 5>towards the end of my career,</v>

1467
00:38:51.341 --> 00:38:52.570
<v Speaker 5>my last two camps,</v>

1468
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:53.291
<v Speaker 5>I started to notice,</v>

1469
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:53.880
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1470
00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm starting to get some headaches.</v>

1471
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:55.691
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1472
00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:56.524
<v Speaker 5>I started,</v>

1473
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:56.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1474
00:38:56.921 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 5>feeling the repercussions of training so hard for so many years and instead of</v>

1475
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 5>focusing on sparring partners that can mimic my opponent,</v>

1476
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm just focusing on winning in the gym against various level guys.</v>

1477
00:39:07.421 --> 00:39:08.890
<v Speaker 5>We're going to go 100% against me.</v>

1478
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:09.490
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1479
00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:11.050
<v Speaker 5>and that takes away from your career,</v>

1480
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.973
<v Speaker 5>cuts it short,</v>

1481
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.460
<v Speaker 5>and it cuts down that window to where you can make that maximum amount of money.</v>

1482
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.091
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1483
00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:16.420
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

1484
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 5>you look at these guys now that are getting smarter,</v>

1485
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:19.414
<v Speaker 5>just like you said,</v>

1486
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.490
<v Speaker 5>and they're tracking that sort of thing.</v>

1487
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:21.701
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1488
00:39:21.701 --> 00:39:25.600
<v Speaker 5>Mark Henry counts how many strikes Frankie Edgar puts out a sparring session</v>

1489
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.220
<v Speaker 5>because when they do their game plan,</v>

1490
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:28.690
<v Speaker 5>you need to fight at this pace.</v>

1491
00:39:28.691 --> 00:39:30.670
<v Speaker 5>I want this many strikes per round.</v>

1492
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:31.840
<v Speaker 5>This what you have to do to win the fight.</v>

1493
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 5>So he'll watch Frankie sparring the whole camp to make sure he's on pace to win</v>

1494
00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:38.560
<v Speaker 5>that fight for what they feel he'll need to do to win.</v>

1495
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.730
<v Speaker 5>And he's using like a clicker.</v>

1496
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.510
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1497
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:43.270
<v Speaker 5>Mark Henry's one of the most underrated trainers in the game today.</v>

1498
00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:45.730
<v Speaker 5>He's a guy who does not get enough credit and I,</v>

1499
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.870
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to shop cause Shab did some training down there with a Frankie Edgar</v>

1500
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:50.711
<v Speaker 5>and he was like,</v>

1501
00:39:50.711 --> 00:39:55.570
<v Speaker 5>this guy's got fucking notebook after notebook filled with all the different</v>

1502
00:39:55.571 --> 00:39:56.470
<v Speaker 5>strategies,</v>

1503
00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:57.131
<v Speaker 5>techniques,</v>

1504
00:39:57.131 --> 00:39:58.300
<v Speaker 5>things they're working on,</v>

1505
00:39:58.301 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 5>things to do for very fighters.</v>

1506
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:01.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean you look what he did the cub,</v>

1507
00:40:01.661 --> 00:40:03.420
<v Speaker 5>I mean cubs a fucking monster.</v>

1508
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 5>He is such a good fighter.</v>

1509
00:40:05.081 --> 00:40:09.950
<v Speaker 5>And Frankie shut him down it and cubs a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and,</v>

1510
00:40:09.951 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 5>and he got into half guard and really he knew what to do from there.</v>

1511
00:40:13.931 --> 00:40:16.000
<v Speaker 5>But because of the continuous strikes,</v>

1512
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:18.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was a pace on tiny,</v>

1513
00:40:18.111 --> 00:40:20.200
<v Speaker 5>not even just in the striking room but on top.</v>

1514
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:20.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1515
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.090
<v Speaker 5>Frankie never stopped punching,</v>

1516
00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:23.800
<v Speaker 5>which when you're punching a guy and half guard,</v>

1517
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.670
<v Speaker 5>it makes you a threat to pass them out past to full side control.</v>

1518
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 5>It made cub worry more about retaining half guard,</v>

1519
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:32.110
<v Speaker 5>maybe get back to full guard than blocking the punches,</v>

1520
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:32.944
<v Speaker 5>hitting his face.</v>

1521
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.240
<v Speaker 5>And on top of that,</v>

1522
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:35.620
<v Speaker 5>every time a guy's punching you,</v>

1523
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:36.483
<v Speaker 5>you can't breathe.</v>

1524
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:37.810
<v Speaker 5>So every time a guys punching you,</v>

1525
00:40:37.811 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 5>you're tightening up your,</v>

1526
00:40:38.981 --> 00:40:42.250
<v Speaker 5>you're constricting your body when he's punching your body and you're,</v>

1527
00:40:42.251 --> 00:40:44.890
<v Speaker 5>you're cutting in cutting back on the amount of oxygen to get.</v>

1528
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.770
<v Speaker 5>That's like one of the strategies and Nick Diaz is always used in his career.</v>

1529
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.090
<v Speaker 5>He'll hit a guy 150 times at like 50% he just gets in front of your face and</v>

1530
00:40:52.091 --> 00:40:53.290
<v Speaker 5>starts throwing punches and people are like,</v>

1531
00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:53.531
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1532
00:40:53.531 --> 00:40:54.364
<v Speaker 5>those aren't even hurt.</v>

1533
00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.241
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1534
00:40:55.241 --> 00:40:55.751
<v Speaker 5>That first of all,</v>

1535
00:40:55.751 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 5>yes they do.</v>

1536
00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Yes they do.</v>

1537
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.390
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.</v>

1538
00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:01.420
<v Speaker 5>Let Him Punch him 50% it might not knock you dead,</v>

1539
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.450
<v Speaker 5>but it fucking hurts and he hits you with four of those.</v>

1540
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.070
<v Speaker 5>It's probably almost as good as one full full blast punch is going to hit you</v>

1541
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:10.780
<v Speaker 5>with a bunch of them and you're not going to be able to breathe.</v>

1542
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:14.500
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be tightening up constantly toe a Paul Daley,</v>

1543
00:41:14.501 --> 00:41:15.970
<v Speaker 5>Robbie Lawler knocked both out.</v>

1544
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:16.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1545
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.240
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1546
00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 5>Those are just two of the examples of what he's able to do and you know,</v>

1547
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.600
<v Speaker 5>he has good accuracy mean he'll knock them out.</v>

1548
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.230
<v Speaker 5>He's pretty pinpoint when he goes and hits a guy in the chin rate when they</v>

1549
00:41:26.231 --> 00:41:27.160
<v Speaker 5>think it's not hurting,</v>

1550
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:31.300
<v Speaker 5>then he does drop them and it's a suffocating style because I feel,</v>

1551
00:41:31.301 --> 00:41:32.860
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know if there's science that backs up,</v>

1552
00:41:32.861 --> 00:41:33.694
<v Speaker 5>I haven't researched a bit.</v>

1553
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.240
<v Speaker 5>When you're exhausted,</v>

1554
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 5>you're easier to get knocked out.</v>

1555
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.480
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1556
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.790
<v Speaker 5>you can't tense up as much when you and roll with the punches as much.</v>

1557
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.460
<v Speaker 5>You end up taking it square and it rocks.</v>

1558
00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 5>The jaw crushes the nerves and in your own,</v>

1559
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:46.101
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1560
00:41:46.101 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 5>there's no doubt.</v>

1561
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.080
<v Speaker 5>And you know those fights,</v>

1562
00:41:48.081 --> 00:41:48.410
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1563
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.861
<v Speaker 5>God Damn.</v>

1564
00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:50.120
<v Speaker 5>Especially the Paul daily fight.</v>

1565
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.040
<v Speaker 5>His Chin is another thing.</v>

1566
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.281
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1567
00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:53.300
<v Speaker 5>you can't teach that.</v>

1568
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.970
<v Speaker 5>You can't teach the ability to absorb punishment that he has.</v>

1569
00:41:55.971 --> 00:41:56.241
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1570
00:41:56.241 --> 00:41:57.074
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

1571
00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 5>he's so tough and the psychology to,</v>

1572
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:00.051
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1573
00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:02.810
<v Speaker 5>to walk into an octagon for all these people,</v>

1574
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.110
<v Speaker 5>everybody you know and care about in the world is going to watch that fight and</v>

1575
00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 5>you've got to face him afterwards and,</v>

1576
00:42:08.181 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 5>and your decision,</v>

1577
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:09.381
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1578
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:12.920
<v Speaker 5>you talk about the fight or flight and they're still fighters who,</v>

1579
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.620
<v Speaker 5>even though they're professional fighters and they're there,</v>

1580
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.670
<v Speaker 5>are way tougher than your normal populace.</v>

1581
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:17.893
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1582
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.470
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1583
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:19.303
<v Speaker 5>there's level,</v>

1584
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:20.150
<v Speaker 5>many subtle levels.</v>

1585
00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:21.290
<v Speaker 5>Once you get to the highest level,</v>

1586
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:23.150
<v Speaker 5>Nick Diaz doesn't,</v>

1587
00:42:23.151 --> 00:42:23.841
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't care.</v>

1588
00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 5>He's going to go toe to toe with you.</v>

1589
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:26.180
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter who it is.</v>

1590
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:26.691
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1591
00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:27.501
<v Speaker 5>Anderson Silva,</v>

1592
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 5>he's going to go toe to toe with them and there's no issues there.</v>

1593
00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:32.610
<v Speaker 5>Even though he hasn't been in the octagon a long time.</v>

1594
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:33.381
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1595
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:35.660
<v Speaker 5>there's something psychologically in that man where,</v>

1596
00:42:35.661 --> 00:42:35.811
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1597
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:36.171
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

1598
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:39.020
<v Speaker 5>If you tell me you're going to draw a line and fight that I'm there and he'll</v>

1599
00:42:39.021 --> 00:42:40.040
<v Speaker 5>admit he didn't even like fighting.</v>

1600
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:41.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1601
00:42:41.721 --> 00:42:42.620
<v Speaker 5>Which is pretty crazy.</v>

1602
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:43.280
<v Speaker 5>It's tough.</v>

1603
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.120
<v Speaker 5>He wants that money.</v>

1604
00:42:44.121 --> 00:42:44.511
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1605
00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:47.660
<v Speaker 5>He made a lot of money in the George Saint Pierre fight and then took a long</v>

1606
00:42:47.661 --> 00:42:50.840
<v Speaker 5>time off and now he's coming back and fighting Anderson Silva on the Andersons</v>

1607
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:51.674
<v Speaker 5>comeback fight,</v>

1608
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.060
<v Speaker 5>which is man,</v>

1609
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:55.080
<v Speaker 5>what a lot of questions and that fight,</v>

1610
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.860
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1611
00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 5>That's fights all.</v>

1612
00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:57.800
<v Speaker 5>It's one big room.</v>

1613
00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.690
<v Speaker 5>That should be the poster for that fucking fight.</v>

1614
00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:00.710
<v Speaker 5>Just a question mark.</v>

1615
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.320
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck knows what's going to happen in that fight?</v>

1616
00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.720
<v Speaker 5>And most people will look at say,</v>

1617
00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:08.180
<v Speaker 5>well you know Dee has going to come out and he's going to want to box and</v>

1618
00:43:08.181 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 5>Anderson just has so many weapons on the feet.</v>

1619
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:11.810
<v Speaker 5>But how does he throw those weapons?</v>

1620
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:12.561
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1621
00:43:12.561 --> 00:43:15.630
<v Speaker 5>we haven't seen the Diaz brothers do too many leg check,</v>

1622
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.030
<v Speaker 5>checking leg kicks yet.</v>

1623
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:17.211
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1624
00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:19.340
<v Speaker 5>certainly Nate didn't do it against how Hilda Santos.</v>

1625
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 5>But if Nick Diaz or if you have Nick Diaz comes out there and he checks a few</v>

1626
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:24.890
<v Speaker 5>leg kicks for Anderson,</v>

1627
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.930
<v Speaker 5>does that slow down the attack?</v>

1628
00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:27.441
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1629
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:28.950
<v Speaker 5>does he hit the same area again?</v>

1630
00:43:28.951 --> 00:43:29.781
<v Speaker 5>Does he check that?</v>

1631
00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:30.351
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>

1632
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:30.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1633
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:31.071
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1634
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:32.240
<v Speaker 5>if I have to bet money,</v>

1635
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:32.571
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1636
00:43:32.571 --> 00:43:33.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to put it on the all time.</v>

1637
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:34.670
<v Speaker 5>Great Anderson Silva,</v>

1638
00:43:34.671 --> 00:43:38.540
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not quite ready to count out Nick Diaz out of this fight just yet.</v>

1639
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm not counting them out at all.</v>

1640
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:42.080
<v Speaker 5>And Anderson Silva for folks who don't know what we're talking about,</v>

1641
00:43:42.081 --> 00:43:43.610
<v Speaker 5>is the greatest of all time,</v>

1642
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.560
<v Speaker 5>broke his leg in his last fight through a kick,</v>

1643
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 5>Chris Weidman lift up his knee.</v>

1644
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 5>Anderson caught him in the top part of the Shin,</v>

1645
00:43:50.931 --> 00:43:53.510
<v Speaker 5>which is a brutal spot to get checked.</v>

1646
00:43:53.511 --> 00:43:55.910
<v Speaker 5>And Anderson's leg snapped like a twig.</v>

1647
00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:56.780
<v Speaker 5>It was really,</v>

1648
00:43:56.781 --> 00:44:00.020
<v Speaker 5>I've only seen it happened twice live Corey hill long time ago.</v>

1649
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.870
<v Speaker 5>Who looked like a guy who would break.</v>

1650
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:03.381
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1651
00:44:03.381 --> 00:44:05.870
<v Speaker 5>Cory was really tall for the weight class.</v>

1652
00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.950
<v Speaker 5>Was he fighting one 55 one 55 that was a disgusting cut.</v>

1653
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.281
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1654
00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:10.851
<v Speaker 5>he was really,</v>

1655
00:44:10.851 --> 00:44:11.211
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

1656
00:44:11.211 --> 00:44:11.541
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

1657
00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:12.374
<v Speaker 5>really thin.</v>

1658
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:13.310
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1659
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean probably take something out of your bones too.</v>

1660
00:44:15.501 --> 00:44:15.681
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1661
00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:17.750
<v Speaker 5>it takes something out of your organs for sure.</v>

1662
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:22.430
<v Speaker 5>Super Bad for your kidneys and these guys are dehydrating themselves like that.</v>

1663
00:44:22.431 --> 00:44:26.540
<v Speaker 5>But Corey breaking his leg was very shocking.</v>

1664
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:30.620
<v Speaker 5>But there was something about watching Anderson break his leg where you just</v>

1665
00:44:30.621 --> 00:44:32.030
<v Speaker 5>know the Anderson isn't</v>

1666
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>all time great.</v>

1667
00:44:34.141 --> 00:44:35.250
<v Speaker 2>The all time great.</v>

1668
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:35.411
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1669
00:44:35.411 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 2>the most spectacular performer we've ever seen in the UFC,</v>

1670
00:44:38.701 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 2>in his neck,</v>

1671
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.860
<v Speaker 2>his leg just snapped the,</v>

1672
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:42.880
<v Speaker 2>the best martial artists</v>

1673
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:43.980
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

1674
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.570
<v Speaker 4>in the history of martial arts.</v>

1675
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:47.010
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean when you look at like the end,</v>

1676
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:47.940
<v Speaker 4>you want to talk about,</v>

1677
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:48.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1678
00:44:48.751 --> 00:44:49.111
<v Speaker 4>Benny,</v>

1679
00:44:49.111 --> 00:44:52.490
<v Speaker 4>the jet bill superfoot Wallace and you have Bruce Lee and yet all that,</v>

1680
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:52.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1681
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:55.530
<v Speaker 4>and you can go way back in history path pavers for sure.</v>

1682
00:44:55.531 --> 00:44:56.311
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1683
00:44:56.311 --> 00:45:00.240
<v Speaker 4>You've got to then look at Anderson Silva and how he was able to bring to the</v>

1684
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:03.870
<v Speaker 4>most complete fighting style known demand.</v>

1685
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.370
<v Speaker 4>The artistry he brought to it,</v>

1686
00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:07.920
<v Speaker 4>the many different ways he want from different kicks,</v>

1687
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:08.611
<v Speaker 4>a submission to me,</v>

1688
00:45:08.611 --> 00:45:08.881
<v Speaker 4>he can,</v>

1689
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 4>he can do it all.</v>

1690
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.300
<v Speaker 4>I still think the greatest fighter to ever go in the octagon is John Jones.</v>

1691
00:45:13.301 --> 00:45:14.580
<v Speaker 4>So I don't think any,</v>

1692
00:45:14.581 --> 00:45:17.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody has ever beat that.</v>

1693
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 4>The level competition he's beaten by,</v>

1694
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:21.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1695
00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.290
<v Speaker 2>by the margins that he's done.</v>

1696
00:45:23.291 --> 00:45:23.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1697
00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1698
00:45:24.341 --> 00:45:26.770
<v Speaker 2>drops me Cheetah unconscious to the floor.</v>

1699
00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:27.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1700
00:45:27.731 --> 00:45:28.541
<v Speaker 2>the way he's done it,</v>

1701
00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:32.530
<v Speaker 2>he submitted [inaudible] after he got his arm fucked up and that arm bar and</v>

1702
00:45:32.531 --> 00:45:33.490
<v Speaker 2>refuse to tap.</v>

1703
00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1704
00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:34.841
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1705
00:45:34.841 --> 00:45:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Fought Gustafson and from all indications,</v>

1706
00:45:38.381 --> 00:45:42.190
<v Speaker 2>barely fucking trained for that fight and still gutted it out in those final</v>

1707
00:45:42.191 --> 00:45:42.641
<v Speaker 2>rounds.</v>

1708
00:45:42.641 --> 00:45:43.290
<v Speaker 2>And one,</v>

1709
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:44.121
<v Speaker 4>it's funny you bring that.</v>

1710
00:45:44.121 --> 00:45:44.461
<v Speaker 4>I mean that,</v>

1711
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:44.731
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1712
00:45:44.731 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 4>that's what I've heard as well.</v>

1713
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:46.641
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they're true,</v>

1714
00:45:46.641 --> 00:45:48.210
<v Speaker 4>but that's certainly the rumblings.</v>

1715
00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:48.421
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1716
00:45:48.421 --> 00:45:48.641
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1717
00:45:48.641 --> 00:45:49.200
<v Speaker 4>that that was,</v>

1718
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.410
<v Speaker 4>there was some stuff taken lately.</v>

1719
00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:54.350
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare when you hear those rumblings and they're not true.</v>

1720
00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:54.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1721
00:45:54.591 --> 00:45:56.660
<v Speaker 2>when was it half the time you heard of that guy barely trained.</v>

1722
00:45:56.661 --> 00:45:56.841
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1723
00:45:56.841 --> 00:45:57.710
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you talking about?</v>

1724
00:45:57.711 --> 00:45:58.730
<v Speaker 2>The guy was doing two a days.</v>

1725
00:45:58.731 --> 00:45:59.810
<v Speaker 2>He was running five miles.</v>

1726
00:45:59.811 --> 00:46:01.420
<v Speaker 2>He was eating nothing but the,</v>

1727
00:46:01.421 --> 00:46:02.990
<v Speaker 2>the most wholesome foods.</v>

1728
00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.190
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I heard.</v>

1729
00:46:04.191 --> 00:46:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I heard he was doing the exact opposite.</v>

1730
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.750
<v Speaker 2>He was eating some very unwholesome foods.</v>

1731
00:46:08.751 --> 00:46:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1732
00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:09.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1733
00:46:09.381 --> 00:46:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean when,</v>

1734
00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.640
<v Speaker 2>when he fought shogun for the title or the worst beatings I've seen inside the</v>

1735
00:46:13.641 --> 00:46:14.270
<v Speaker 2>octagon,</v>

1736
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:19.070
<v Speaker 2>he in fucking top line knee and his opening move is he's the youngest guy to</v>

1737
00:46:19.071 --> 00:46:20.420
<v Speaker 2>ever fight for the UFC title.</v>

1738
00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.171
<v Speaker 2>He throws a fuck,</v>

1739
00:46:21.171 --> 00:46:22.850
<v Speaker 2>not the youngest guy to ever fight for a title.</v>

1740
00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I believe that was John Alessio.</v>

1741
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I think John Alessia was 20 when he fought patent military way back in the day.</v>

1742
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:29.450
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1743
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:30.160
<v Speaker 2>he's got to win it.</v>

1744
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Youngest just got to win.</v>

1745
00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:34.550
<v Speaker 2>It throws a fucking flying knee on Shogun and cracks.</v>

1746
00:46:34.551 --> 00:46:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm right in the chin.</v>

1747
00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1748
00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean just ridiculous stuff that he throw me through what he try flying armbar</v>

1749
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:40.760
<v Speaker 2>and core me.</v>

1750
00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I got a theory about that shit man.</v>

1751
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:46.940
<v Speaker 2>My theory is that guys who grow up with brothers that beat the fuck out of them</v>

1752
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.070
<v Speaker 2>or just on a completely different level,</v>

1753
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.770
<v Speaker 2>cause Weidman grew up with a brother to beat the fuck out of him.</v>

1754
00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hughes and his brother beat the fuck out of each other.</v>

1755
00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.860
<v Speaker 2>John Jones had two super athlete brothers.</v>

1756
00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:03.160
<v Speaker 2>He's got two brothers that are fucking NFL studs and you know his brother Arthur</v>

1757
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:08.060
<v Speaker 2>by all all indications kicks John's ass when they work out together.</v>

1758
00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:08.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1759
00:47:08.221 --> 00:47:08.550
<v Speaker 2>And He'd,</v>

1760
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.560
<v Speaker 2>he'd kicked John's ass,</v>

1761
00:47:09.561 --> 00:47:10.394
<v Speaker 2>grown up plenty.</v>

1762
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.650
<v Speaker 2>And he was a state champion wrestler I believe yet.</v>

1763
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Huge guy too.</v>

1764
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

1765
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:15.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1766
00:47:15.171 --> 00:47:16.130
<v Speaker 2>he's 300 plus.</v>

1767
00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.800
<v Speaker 2>And when you grow up like that,</v>

1768
00:47:18.801 --> 00:47:21.320
<v Speaker 2>I think you just have a level of tea.</v>

1769
00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:23.930
<v Speaker 2>I think also your body develop stronger.</v>

1770
00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:24.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1771
00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:28.310
<v Speaker 2>Muse is something about tangling with a brother,</v>

1772
00:47:28.311 --> 00:47:29.144
<v Speaker 2>your whole,</v>

1773
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're in competition from the time you're a baby,</v>

1774
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.970
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to war.</v>

1775
00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:35.670
<v Speaker 4>And coupled with that,</v>

1776
00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:40.620
<v Speaker 4>I have not seen in a guy like John the belief,</v>

1777
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.630
<v Speaker 4>you know John Will,</v>

1778
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.533
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1779
00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.020
<v Speaker 4>he'll watch a movie about like cheat or something and I'm making this up</v>

1780
00:47:46.021 --> 00:47:48.630
<v Speaker 4>obviously and and health think it truly exists in him.</v>

1781
00:47:48.631 --> 00:47:49.080
<v Speaker 4>So he has,</v>

1782
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.990
<v Speaker 4>he meditates near a waterfall the day of his fight always.</v>

1783
00:47:51.991 --> 00:47:52.890
<v Speaker 4>They got to find water,</v>

1784
00:47:52.891 --> 00:47:54.390
<v Speaker 4>he's got to go to water and you know,</v>

1785
00:47:54.391 --> 00:47:56.260
<v Speaker 4>he sits there and he'll meditate and he focuses on,</v>

1786
00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.080
<v Speaker 4>most guys would point to that and say,</v>

1787
00:47:58.081 --> 00:48:00.150
<v Speaker 4>that is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.</v>

1788
00:48:00.151 --> 00:48:02.550
<v Speaker 4>They try and make fun of somebody for John doesn't care.</v>

1789
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:03.541
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>

1790
00:48:03.541 --> 00:48:03.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1791
00:48:03.781 --> 00:48:06.810
<v Speaker 4>being in the locker room with him for several fights from the same card.</v>

1792
00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:11.850
<v Speaker 4>He's back there as this young kid who has very few life experiences.</v>

1793
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.470
<v Speaker 4>So calm.</v>

1794
00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.470
<v Speaker 4>Never once as a thought of him losing run through his mind.</v>

1795
00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:18.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean when he went out and fought Vladimir,</v>

1796
00:48:18.541 --> 00:48:19.201
<v Speaker 4>met your Shanko.</v>

1797
00:48:19.201 --> 00:48:21.350
<v Speaker 4>I fought in that cart and,</v>

1798
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:22.830
<v Speaker 4>and John's Jujitsu.</v>

1799
00:48:22.831 --> 00:48:25.680
<v Speaker 4>I had submitted him several times in that training camp.</v>

1800
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:30.120
<v Speaker 4>He goes out there against flatty and the game plan was to strike with him cause</v>

1801
00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.140
<v Speaker 4>Laddie was such a good restaurant.</v>

1802
00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:33.030
<v Speaker 4>So get on the ground and John wasn't good on the ground.</v>

1803
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:36.540
<v Speaker 4>Immediately takes Vladimir down past his guard,</v>

1804
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.050
<v Speaker 4>elbows him into oblivion.</v>

1805
00:48:38.051 --> 00:48:38.310
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1806
00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:39.143
<v Speaker 4>the fights over.</v>

1807
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.300
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that John even knew how to pass the guard at that point.</v>

1808
00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:44.173
<v Speaker 4>I'm serious.</v>

1809
00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:44.511
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1810
00:48:44.511 --> 00:48:47.220
<v Speaker 4>you don't do beginners Jujitsu classes at Greg Jackson's gym.</v>

1811
00:48:47.221 --> 00:48:48.960
<v Speaker 4>He'll do it in like private sessions with them,</v>

1812
00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:49.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1813
00:48:49.741 --> 00:48:49.921
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1814
00:48:49.921 --> 00:48:50.491
<v Speaker 4>but John,</v>

1815
00:48:50.491 --> 00:48:51.300
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

1816
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:51.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1817
00:48:51.541 --> 00:48:53.550
<v Speaker 4>I remember submitting them several times when we can.</v>

1818
00:48:53.551 --> 00:48:54.870
<v Speaker 4>Then two weeks later we're in Denver,</v>

1819
00:48:54.871 --> 00:48:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Colorado for that camp and he catches me in,</v>

1820
00:48:57.241 --> 00:48:58.074
<v Speaker 4>in a submission.</v>

1821
00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:58.781
<v Speaker 4>I look at Greg,</v>

1822
00:48:58.781 --> 00:48:58.921
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1823
00:48:58.921 --> 00:49:00.660
<v Speaker 4>did he learn Jujitsu in two weeks?</v>

1824
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:01.471
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1825
00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:03.150
<v Speaker 4>it's just always been that way.</v>

1826
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:07.440
<v Speaker 4>The only other guy that I hear that's like that to that extreme for every move</v>

1827
00:49:07.441 --> 00:49:09.690
<v Speaker 4>they learn they could use it instantly is Weidman.</v>

1828
00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:10.600
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

1829
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.650
<v Speaker 4>When I talked to guys and I go into hens those frequently for the,</v>

1830
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.060
<v Speaker 4>the nonprofit I run,</v>

1831
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.810
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of guys up in Wall Street who have been very generous and are very</v>

1832
00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:22.770
<v Speaker 4>avid for veterans getting jobs and they'll always meet me at handles and they</v>

1833
00:49:22.771 --> 00:49:24.120
<v Speaker 4>train there and the guys there,</v>

1834
00:49:24.121 --> 00:49:25.230
<v Speaker 4>we'll talk about it like,</v>

1835
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:26.573
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1836
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:27.443
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1837
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.260
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1838
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:32.130
<v Speaker 4>he sit there in these classes and it takes me thousands of reps to get this</v>

1839
00:49:32.131 --> 00:49:33.780
<v Speaker 4>moved to work on high level competition.</v>

1840
00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.100
<v Speaker 4>Weidman learns it,</v>

1841
00:49:35.101 --> 00:49:35.970
<v Speaker 4>drills it once,</v>

1842
00:49:35.971 --> 00:49:37.920
<v Speaker 4>and then submits everybody in the class with that.</v>

1843
00:49:37.921 --> 00:49:39.710
<v Speaker 4>He's just that much of an animal and you know,</v>

1844
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:40.650
<v Speaker 4>he's a fucking,</v>

1845
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.160
<v Speaker 4>when you get a stud wrestler that picks up Jujitsu,</v>

1846
00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:47.280
<v Speaker 4>what a fucking horrific combination that is.</v>

1847
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:50.500
<v Speaker 4>Especially for guys like me and I mean it absolutely right.</v>

1848
00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:50.990
<v Speaker 4>Anybody,</v>

1849

00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:52.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1853
00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.200
<v Speaker 2>you know Eric Bradley is wrestler.</v>

1857
00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

1858
00:49:58.491 --> 00:50:00.140
<v Speaker 2>we were doing this drill where,</v>

1859
00:50:00.141 --> 00:50:01.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's not much bigger than me.</v>

1860
00:50:01.251 --> 00:50:02.570
<v Speaker 2>He'd make maybe 15 pounds,</v>

1861
00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:03.830
<v Speaker 2>but we're doing this drill.</v>

1862
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.990
<v Speaker 2>We're doing this neat Abelli belly drill and a,</v>

1863
00:50:05.991 --> 00:50:06.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1864
00:50:06.261 --> 00:50:08.660
<v Speaker 2>you started out with neon belly and see how long you can hold it.</v>

1865
00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.270
<v Speaker 2>He might as well had,</v>

1866
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:12.050
<v Speaker 2>it might have,</v>

1867
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.390
<v Speaker 2>might as well have had a building on top of me.</v>

1868
00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Might as well have had a fucking full foundation,</v>

1869
00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.130
<v Speaker 2>a few cars parked in,</v>

1870
00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:18.964
<v Speaker 2>in the building.</v>

1871
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.221
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1872
00:50:19.221 --> 00:50:20.054
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't getting up.</v>

1873
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.440
<v Speaker 2>I got on top of him,</v>

1874
00:50:21.441 --> 00:50:22.370
<v Speaker 2>he threw me off.</v>

1875
00:50:22.371 --> 00:50:23.204
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>

1876
00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:24.111
<v Speaker 2>who's getting out of bed?</v>

1877
00:50:24.111 --> 00:50:25.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's throwing off the covers.</v>

1878
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:26.210
<v Speaker 2>It was just ridiculous.</v>

1879
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 2>It's it since there's a a kid</v>

1880
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.851
<v Speaker 4>just like that.</v>

1881
00:50:28.851 --> 00:50:32.830
<v Speaker 4>His name is Raymond Jordan and he wrestled with Tyron Woodley and Ben asking</v>

1882
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.800
<v Speaker 4>verse and Missouri and he was younger than those guys and he was a two time all</v>

1883
00:50:36.801 --> 00:50:37.131
<v Speaker 4>American.</v>

1884
00:50:37.131 --> 00:50:38.630
<v Speaker 4>There never was a national champion though.</v>

1885
00:50:38.631 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 4>And Woodley will tell you is like,</v>

1886
00:50:39.741 --> 00:50:40.790
<v Speaker 4>I won't touch rain anymore,</v>

1887
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:41.743
<v Speaker 4>won't touch it.</v>

1888
00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.350
<v Speaker 4>And so he went to go be Jordan Burroughs main partner while he went and won</v>

1889
00:50:45.351 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 4>gold.</v>

1890
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:49.700
<v Speaker 4>And I actually had him come to Atlanta to help me train for four weeks before I</v>

1891
00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:50.570
<v Speaker 4>fought Michael Bisman.</v>

1892
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.490
<v Speaker 4>The first week he was there,</v>

1893
00:50:52.491 --> 00:50:53.900
<v Speaker 4>the UFC cameras were in town.</v>

1894
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:55.131
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1895
00:50:55.131 --> 00:50:56.060
<v Speaker 4>you had me,</v>

1896
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.370
<v Speaker 4>you had Tom Watson who fights in the UFC.</v>

1897
00:50:58.371 --> 00:50:59.330
<v Speaker 4>You had Douglas Lema,</v>

1898
00:50:59.331 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 4>who's the Bella tour champion was in there,</v>

1899
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:02.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1900
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:03.110
<v Speaker 4>Juan Carnero,</v>

1901
00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.300
<v Speaker 4>who's coming back to the UFC and fight Mark Munoz.</v>

1902
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:09.170
<v Speaker 4>And then here's Raymond Jordan that this kid who's never done this shit really</v>

1903
00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:10.004
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

1904
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 4>He was beating everybody so bad that the UFC camera said,</v>

1905
00:51:13.341 --> 00:51:13.761
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

1906
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:15.500
<v Speaker 4>this is some of the best footage we've ever gotten,</v>

1907
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:16.940
<v Speaker 4>but we can't use any of it.</v>

1908
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 4>Who is this kid?</v>

1909
00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.580
<v Speaker 4>And he doesn't want to fight.</v>

1910
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:20.420
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>

1911
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:25.420
<v Speaker 4>He was was the Russell amounts he mounts INTAPP's high level worldclass level</v>

1912
00:51:26.511 --> 00:51:27.780
<v Speaker 4>black belts cause he's,</v>

1913
00:51:27.781 --> 00:51:31.190
<v Speaker 4>he's got that same funky style on the mat that these,</v>

1914
00:51:31.191 --> 00:51:32.540
<v Speaker 4>these Missouri Tigers have.</v>

1915
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:34.670
<v Speaker 4>He's most natural athlete I've ever met.</v>

1916
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.740
<v Speaker 4>Everything he throws is hard by the way.</v>

1917
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:37.903
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1918
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:38.601
<v Speaker 4>just doesn't want,</v>

1919
00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:39.550
<v Speaker 4>he's just not interested in,</v>

1920
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.551
<v Speaker 4>that's so crazy.</v>

1921
00:51:40.551 --> 00:51:41.090
<v Speaker 4>So what does he do?</v>

1922
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:41.960
<v Speaker 4>Just coaches restaurant.</v>

1923
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.860
<v Speaker 4>I helped him get a job.</v>

1924
00:51:42.861 --> 00:51:45.320
<v Speaker 4>He works at a company called Med assets and it's the,</v>

1925
00:51:45.321 --> 00:51:48.320
<v Speaker 4>it's run by the gentleman who chairs the board of the company I run.</v>

1926
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.330
<v Speaker 4>And he's also brilliant by the way.</v>

1927
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:53.450
<v Speaker 4>He's an African American kid who grew up with a crack dealing uncle.</v>

1928
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:55.130
<v Speaker 4>Both his parents are dead by six.</v>

1929
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.440
<v Speaker 4>And you would think this kid graduated from Harvard.</v>

1930
00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.050
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1931
00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:00.620
<v Speaker 4>he's an anomaly and he's brilliant.</v>

1932
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:04.970
<v Speaker 4>And so he works in finance with them and does deal analysis for a fortune 500</v>

1933
00:52:04.971 --> 00:52:06.070
<v Speaker 4>company poker traded companies.</v>

1934
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:06.913
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

1935
00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:08.900
<v Speaker 4>So just doesn't have the desire to fight.</v>

1936
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:09.410
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1937
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:09.621
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1938
00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:10.830
<v Speaker 4>he looks say sa,</v>

1939
00:52:10.831 --> 00:52:11.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1940
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.300
<v Speaker 4>he's been grinding for so long with wrestling and I think it burnt them out.</v>

1941
00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:15.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1942
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.100
<v Speaker 4>a lot of those guys,</v>

1943
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.850
<v Speaker 4>it's tough.</v>

1944
00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.760
<v Speaker 4>Is there a sport where people overtrained more than in wrestling?</v>

1945
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:20.600
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1946
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean it teaches a mental toughness and that is true.</v>

1947
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:28.120
<v Speaker 4>There's no doubt about it that wrestlers can perform and come back and in and</v>

1948
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:31.460
<v Speaker 4>push in ways that a lot of guys and other sports as they did,</v>

1949
00:52:31.461 --> 00:52:33.110
<v Speaker 4>they never developed that gear,</v>

1950
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:37.460
<v Speaker 4>that sort of extra gear that you see like a guy like Johnny Hendricks have or</v>

1951
00:52:37.461 --> 00:52:39.620
<v Speaker 4>you see like some of these wrestlers have.</v>

1952
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 4>But then you get a guy like Robbie Lawler who has a fucking gear and you know,</v>

1953
00:52:43.701 --> 00:52:45.440
<v Speaker 4>he had a little bit of a wrestling background,</v>

1954
00:52:45.441 --> 00:52:50.390
<v Speaker 4>but it was never like an NCAA national champion or anything along those lines.</v>

1955
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1956
00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.810
<v Speaker 4>The odds are definitely higher coming out of that,</v>

1957
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1958
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:54.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1959
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:55.580
<v Speaker 4>that population,</v>

1960
00:52:55.581 --> 00:52:55.651
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1961
00:52:55.651 --> 00:52:55.851
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

1962
00:52:55.851 --> 00:52:56.661
<v Speaker 4>when you look at that,</v>

1963
00:52:56.661 --> 00:53:00.800
<v Speaker 4>that talent pool of amateur wrestlers in really in any country,</v>

1964
00:53:00.801 --> 00:53:00.981
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1965
00:53:00.981 --> 00:53:03.260
<v Speaker 4>look at the kids were getting in from Dagestan now.</v>

1966
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean these guys are animals and it's not just because of their combat sambo</v>

1967
00:53:07.281 --> 00:53:08.110
<v Speaker 4>and wrestling background.</v>

1968
00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:08.943
<v Speaker 4>I mean you'd go,</v>

1969
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:14.140
<v Speaker 4>I would love to go over there and see how could be Abner Maga Madoff grew up,</v>

1970
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:17.660
<v Speaker 4>the hardships saying it's just a different kind of people,</v>

1971
00:53:17.661 --> 00:53:17.841
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1972
00:53:17.841 --> 00:53:19.850
<v Speaker 4>they're not nearly as spoiled is.</v>

1973
00:53:19.851 --> 00:53:21.320
<v Speaker 4>Most of our asses are over here.</v>

1974
00:53:21.321 --> 00:53:22.154
<v Speaker 4>State side.</v>

1975
00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:22.620
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

1976
00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:24.890
<v Speaker 4>that's without a doubt a fact.</v>

1977
00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 4>How beep number good Madoff</v>

1978
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 5>is the scariest guy at one 55 next to Paris in my opinion.</v>

1979
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.750
<v Speaker 5>I can't wait for him to get healthy.</v>

1980
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:33.390
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm looking forward to those angels fighting Pedis Cause I think</v>

1981
00:53:33.391 --> 00:53:36.060
<v Speaker 5>stylistically it's a very intriguing fight.</v>

1982
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.640
<v Speaker 5>But then you watch what Norma men off did.</v>

1983
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:41.070
<v Speaker 5>A Dos Anjos he just fucking shut up.</v>

1984
00:53:41.071 --> 00:53:42.360
<v Speaker 5>I watched that fight again the other day.</v>

1985
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.620
<v Speaker 5>He just racked all of them.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you look at him,</v>

1989
00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:48.600
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't look like Tyron Woodley.</v>

1990
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:48.931
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1991
00:53:48.931 --> 00:53:50.640

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.860
<v Speaker 5>but you look at number commander,</v>

1999
00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 5>if he looks like an athlete for sure it looks like a strong guy,</v>

2000
00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:02.550
<v Speaker 5>but the way he's fucking rag doll on people is shocking the way he did it to</v>

2001
00:54:02.551 --> 00:54:03.360
<v Speaker 5>able to Hilo.</v>

2002
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean just like people shocking hables a a stud.</v>

2003
00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:07.770
<v Speaker 5>Athletes are strong as hell,</v>

2004
00:54:07.771 --> 00:54:08.071
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2005
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:08.820
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2006
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2007
00:54:09.151 --> 00:54:13.290
<v Speaker 5>near Morgan that have his kinesthetic awareness in his leverage in technique.</v>

2008
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:14.770
<v Speaker 5>And then I think they're,</v>

2009
00:54:14.771 --> 00:54:19.060
<v Speaker 5>the real key ingredient though is his will guys that have that wrestling back</v>

2010
00:54:19.061 --> 00:54:20.010
<v Speaker 5>and they have that gear.</v>

2011
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:23.340
<v Speaker 5>If you don't believe someone can stop you,</v>

2012
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:24.900
<v Speaker 5>it's so powerful.</v>

2013
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.570
<v Speaker 5>And he has that and the talent and that's really,</v>

2014
00:54:27.571 --> 00:54:28.320
<v Speaker 5>really scary.</v>

2015
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:28.471
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2016
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:29.430
<v Speaker 5>He fights like a werewolf.</v>

2017
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:31.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's something about him.</v>

2018
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 5>It's like he's like his intensity and violence is just so heightened.</v>

2019
00:54:34.891 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 5>It's like a as next level,</v>

2020
00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:38.550
<v Speaker 5>just whatever it is.</v>

2021
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:42.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean if his striking ever catches up to his grappling,</v>

2022
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:44.490
<v Speaker 5>Jesus fucking Christ man.</v>

2023
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2024
00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:46.650
<v Speaker 5>and it most likely will,</v>

2025
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:49.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean depending on what's the state of his knee,</v>

2026
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:52.530
<v Speaker 5>cause I know he hurt his knee and then the room was where he got it operated on</v>

2027
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.470
<v Speaker 5>and then heard it again like came back too quickly.</v>

2028
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:55.951
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

2029
00:54:55.951 --> 00:54:56.480
<v Speaker 5>You know I,</v>

2030
00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 5>I had seen him maybe two months ago and you know,</v>

2031
00:55:00.691 --> 00:55:02.310
<v Speaker 5>speaking to some of his management as well.</v>

2032
00:55:02.311 --> 00:55:04.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean they believe he's going to be back soon.</v>

2033
00:55:04.381 --> 00:55:05.214
<v Speaker 5>Right around,</v>

2034
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.090
<v Speaker 5>I think the time that pedis is gonna Fight dos Anjos so he'll be waiting in the</v>

2035
00:55:09.091 --> 00:55:09.780
<v Speaker 5>wings,</v>

2036
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:10.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2037
00:55:10.021 --> 00:55:10.501
<v Speaker 5>quickly he,</v>

2038
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:11.800
<v Speaker 5>I think he's even complained that to sign.</v>

2039
00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:12.660
<v Speaker 5>Just leaving it in the shot.</v>

2040
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.231
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2041
00:55:13.231 --> 00:55:14.280
<v Speaker 5>he is complaining that,</v>

2042
00:55:14.281 --> 00:55:15.180
<v Speaker 5>but he's not ready to say,</v>

2043
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean you can't train right now.</v>

2044
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:16.860
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2045
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.491
<v Speaker 5>And if he does,</v>

2046
00:55:17.491 --> 00:55:18.240
<v Speaker 5>fuck is knee,</v>

2047
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.720
<v Speaker 5>but probably just fucking duct tape it together and get back in there anyway.</v>

2048
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 5>We're saying you don't want to ruin your career to come,</v>

2049
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:24.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.531
<v Speaker 5>take your time.</v>

2051
00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:27.540
<v Speaker 5>And the one crazy thing is though,</v>

2052
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:28.201
<v Speaker 5>if if aunt,</v>

2053
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:31.490
<v Speaker 5>cause it's not a walk in the park for pedes to beat Anjos does not just as</v>

2054
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 5>dangerous and doesn't just wrestling look really good against Nate Diaz,</v>

2055
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.920
<v Speaker 5>but pennys he's a sniper.</v>

2056
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.360
<v Speaker 5>He just needs one shot.</v>

2057
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.280
<v Speaker 5>That's how scary that kid is.</v>

2058
00:55:41.281 --> 00:55:41.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean he,</v>

2059
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.061
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2060
00:55:42.061 --> 00:55:45.390
<v Speaker 5>he can go into a fight and barely messes hair and only hit you once.</v>

2061
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:50.600
<v Speaker 5>He also has a style that's based on not like there's a style of kicking and</v>

2062
00:55:51.811 --> 00:55:53.160
<v Speaker 5>punching that a lot of these guys do.</v>

2063
00:55:53.161 --> 00:55:56.910
<v Speaker 5>That's Moy Thai style where there's a step and then a kick a step and then a</v>

2064
00:55:56.911 --> 00:56:00.150
<v Speaker 5>kick and pedis has got that taekwondo thing where he's,</v>

2065
00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:02.790
<v Speaker 5>he's standing there and he just throws it Zero Telegraph,</v>

2066
00:56:02.791 --> 00:56:07.680
<v Speaker 5>Zero Telegraph with o power and it's tough to fuck with if you watch him like</v>

2067
00:56:07.681 --> 00:56:08.730
<v Speaker 5>the head kick that he landed on,</v>

2068
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:09.564
<v Speaker 5>Joe Lozan,</v>

2069
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:10.890
<v Speaker 5>here's it comes out of nowhere.</v>

2070
00:56:10.891 --> 00:56:12.240
<v Speaker 5>The one he landed on Donald's Roni,</v>

2071
00:56:12.241 --> 00:56:13.200
<v Speaker 5>it comes out of nowhere.</v>

2072
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.630
<v Speaker 5>And so Ronnie's a fucking ex all Stryker and he's in phenomenal.</v>

2073
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.950
<v Speaker 5>That kid naturally has incredible cardio.</v>

2074
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:23.280
<v Speaker 5>We would go do these sand dunes at Jackson's and add altitude.</v>

2075
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:27.840
<v Speaker 5>These things are are 60 to 70 meter high or or,</v>

2076
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:28.191
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

2077
00:56:28.191 --> 00:56:29.800
<v Speaker 5>or length sand dunes that,</v>

2078
00:56:29.801 --> 00:56:33.130
<v Speaker 5>that are a steep incline to where the sand falls and you have to crawl up with</v>

2079
00:56:33.131 --> 00:56:33.940
<v Speaker 5>all force.</v>

2080
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.290
<v Speaker 5>He glides up to this thing,</v>

2081
00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:36.101
<v Speaker 5>smokes everybody.</v>

2082
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:36.820
<v Speaker 5>Even when he's not in,</v>

2083
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.420
<v Speaker 5>in premier shape to kick him in the body and Kayo him.</v>

2084
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.901
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2085
00:56:40.901 --> 00:56:42.730
<v Speaker 5>you've got a bruise deep,</v>

2086
00:56:42.731 --> 00:56:43.031
<v Speaker 5>deep,</v>

2087
00:56:43.031 --> 00:56:43.421
<v Speaker 5>deep on the,</v>

2088
00:56:43.421 --> 00:56:44.860
<v Speaker 5>I call them soul kicks.</v>

2089
00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.420
<v Speaker 5>You kick a dude so hard,</v>

2090
00:56:46.421 --> 00:56:47.254
<v Speaker 5>you see that.</v>

2091
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 5>You see the shit face and the soul just come sneaking right out the mouth.</v>

2092
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:51.701
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2093
00:56:51.701 --> 00:56:52.451
<v Speaker 5>that's what happens.</v>

2094
00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:52.751
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing.</v>

2095
00:56:52.751 --> 00:56:54.910
<v Speaker 5>You can do those liver shots,</v>

2096
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:55.161
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2097
00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 5>Then not like anything anybody could describe unless you've been hit like that.</v>

2098
00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2099
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:03.580
<v Speaker 5>it's this weird thing where your body just stops working and it's war as sucks</v>

2100
00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:05.470
<v Speaker 5>because you're helpless and you're,</v>

2101
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:06.580
<v Speaker 5>but you're conscious,</v>

2102
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:09.970
<v Speaker 5>so you're forced to watch the dude kick your ass while you're helpless.</v>

2103
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:11.020
<v Speaker 5>You can't do anything to stop,</v>

2104
00:57:11.021 --> 00:57:12.970
<v Speaker 5>especially in MMA and boxing.</v>

2105
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:14.800
<v Speaker 5>At least you'd go down and the,</v>

2106
00:57:14.801 --> 00:57:16.000
<v Speaker 5>you know the countdowns,</v>

2107
00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 5>like Oscar de la Hoya versus Bernard Hopkins and he was the only time we've ever</v>

2108
00:57:19.721 --> 00:57:21.460
<v Speaker 5>seen del La Jolla gets stopped like that.</v>

2109
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 5>But Bernard just fucking hooked him right in that lever.</v>

2110
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:26.590
<v Speaker 5>And you see his whole body just,</v>

2111
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.160
<v Speaker 5>it's the weirdest thing man.</v>

2112
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.790
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes you could play it off,</v>

2113
00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:33.243
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2114
00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:37.930
<v Speaker 5>you get hit and you can kind of move with it and like a guy doesn't know.</v>

2115
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:42.610
<v Speaker 5>But then there's times where you get hit and like it doesn't the cro cop versus</v>

00:58:19.301 --> 00:58:21.280
<v Speaker 5>his foot is pulled back so you know,</v>

2138
00:58:21.281 --> 00:58:26.140
<v Speaker 5>it's all shin bone and you know how god Damn Hard Mirko kicks.</v>

2139
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.980
<v Speaker 5>That is the most horrific looking body shot I've ever seen.</v>

2140
00:58:29.981 --> 00:58:32.050
<v Speaker 5>Anybody take in a photograph,</v>

2141
00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:32.710
<v Speaker 5>did it?</v>

2142
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:33.431
<v Speaker 5>I mean you don't see,</v>

2143
00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:35.050
<v Speaker 5>you see that and like car wrecks.</v>

2144
00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:35.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2145
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.760
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly what it looks like.</v>

2146
00:58:36.761 --> 00:58:37.570
<v Speaker 5>It looks like you got,</v>

2147
00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 5>he looks like he was on a motorcycle and he crashed into a telephone pole that</v>

2148
00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:42.550
<v Speaker 5>was on the back of a pickup truck.</v>

2149
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:43.271
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2150
00:58:43.271 --> 00:58:44.170
<v Speaker 5>just boom.</v>

2151
00:58:44.171 --> 00:58:47.020
<v Speaker 5>His whole body is mat that puts any picture.</v>

2152
00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:50.260
<v Speaker 5>I've got a couple of pictures where I'm taking shots and that puts everything I</v>

2153
00:58:50.261 --> 00:58:50.830
<v Speaker 5>had to shame.</v>

2154
00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:51.311
<v Speaker 5>I feel,</v>

2155
00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:52.690
<v Speaker 5>I feel like a chump just looking at it.</v>

2156
00:58:52.691 --> 00:58:54.430
<v Speaker 5>And Dad is the liver kick.</v>

2157
00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:56.380
<v Speaker 5>That is the liver kick.</v>

2158
00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:56.771
<v Speaker 5>That's all.</v>

2159
00:58:56.771 --> 00:58:59.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a rough your heart and separate.</v>

2160
00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:00.610
<v Speaker 5>It's everything.</v>

2161
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:01.421
<v Speaker 5>Anything internal,</v>

2162
00:59:01.421 --> 00:59:01.940
<v Speaker 5>it's over.</v>

2163
00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:03.340
<v Speaker 5>The ribs are probably broken.</v>

2164
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.440
<v Speaker 5>Probably broke some ribs.</v>

2165
00:59:04.441 --> 00:59:05.830
<v Speaker 5>And I'd like to talk to heath about that.</v>

2166
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:06.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2167
00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.500
<v Speaker 5>Jesus fucking Christ and,</v>

2168
00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:07.901
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2169
00:59:07.901 --> 00:59:10.330
<v Speaker 5>we saw that with Maci diverse Dalloway doll.</v>

2170
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:10.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean it,</v>

2171
00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.593
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2172
00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.740
<v Speaker 5>Dalloway has done such a fantastic job of finally,</v>

2173
00:59:14.741 --> 00:59:15.041
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2174
00:59:15.041 --> 00:59:17.320
<v Speaker 5>reaching his potential and showcase her that he does.</v>

2175
00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:21.830
<v Speaker 5>And it's so hard for fighters cause you want to at least go out there and</v>

2176
00:59:21.831 --> 00:59:26.030
<v Speaker 5>showcase your skills and similar to pedes but a different style,</v>

2177
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:26.241
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2178
00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:31.241
<v Speaker 5>taekwondo and now you're looking at at karate and a guy who no telegraph sends</v>

2179
00:59:32.211 --> 00:59:33.740
<v Speaker 5>it right underneath the elbow.</v>

2180
00:59:33.741 --> 00:59:36.920
<v Speaker 5>Your garden pinpoint accuracy in the fight is over.</v>

2181
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.753
<v Speaker 5>I called that fight.</v>

2182
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:41.930
<v Speaker 5>It's sounded like someone took a two by four and just smacked it off this table</v>

2183
00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:43.280
<v Speaker 5>and it echoed throughout the stadium.</v>

2184
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:43.761
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2185
00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:47.780
<v Speaker 5>I watched that and as soon as I saw the look on his face like oh this is</v>

2186
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:48.830
<v Speaker 5>probably over done.</v>

2187
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah he's got that.</v>

2188
00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:53.300
<v Speaker 5>And he hit him with his Shin and his instep at the same time.</v>

2189
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean in step kicks,</v>

2190
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:59.570
<v Speaker 5>like a lot of people think that like the foot area is like not as effective in,</v>

2191
00:59:59.571 --> 01:00:00.560
<v Speaker 5>it's not as hard,</v>

2192
01:00:00.561 --> 01:00:02.840
<v Speaker 5>but God damn it's hard enough to knock you out.</v>

2193
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's still a God damn bone.</v>

2194
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:07.850
<v Speaker 5>You can kick some of the pretty hard this Thai,</v>

2195
01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.960
<v Speaker 5>the Thai style,</v>

2196
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:11.270
<v Speaker 5>you could deliver a bit more power,</v>

2197
01:00:11.271 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 5>but it does take a little more time to get there.</v>

2198
01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.001
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2199
01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:15.830
<v Speaker 5>some of them depending on the athlete too,</v>

2200
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:19.520
<v Speaker 5>you know where I kicked harder more from a a Thai style stance,</v>

2201
01:00:19.521 --> 01:00:23.300
<v Speaker 5>but I don't have the flexibility of a guy like an Anthony Pettis.</v>

2202
01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:23.660
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2203
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:23.891
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2204
01:00:23.891 --> 01:00:24.471
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2205
01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:24.891
<v Speaker 5>what are,</v>

2206
01:00:24.891 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 5>what are their level,</v>

2207
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 5>their muscle levers like two in their hips and what's their fast twitch muscle</v>

2208
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:29.331
<v Speaker 5>fibers.</v>

2209
01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:29.511
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2210
01:00:29.511 --> 01:00:30.344
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2211
01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.880
<v Speaker 5>you can pick different styles,</v>

2212
01:00:31.881 --> 01:00:36.530
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes you get the athletes who did train the perfect styles for their</v>

2213
01:00:36.531 --> 01:00:37.281
<v Speaker 5>body style,</v>

2214
01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:38.001
<v Speaker 5>their genetics.</v>

2215
01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:41.780
<v Speaker 5>And that's where you get the Anthony Pettis and the Leo to Machida's who,</v>

2216
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.830
<v Speaker 5>who have the,</v>

2217
01:00:42.831 --> 01:00:45.980
<v Speaker 5>the perfect genetic structure for that as well.</v>

2218
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:46.221
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2219
01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:50.960
<v Speaker 5>there's also the speed that you develop when you do it your whole life.</v>

2220
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.100
<v Speaker 5>That's almost,</v>

2221
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:57.210
<v Speaker 5>you almost can't replicate it by starting in your 20s or your thirties and you</v>

2222
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:58.550
<v Speaker 5>learning martial arts.</v>

2223
01:00:58.790 --> 01:00:59.060
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2224
01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.340
<v Speaker 5>we'd coming from a wrestling background and learning how to kick,</v>

2225
01:01:01.341 --> 01:01:04.580
<v Speaker 5>you're probably never going to be able to collect and Cheetah or luck pedis,</v>

2226
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2227
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:07.220
<v Speaker 5>they have this ridiculous speed.</v>

2228
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.911
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2229
01:01:07.911 --> 01:01:10.850
<v Speaker 5>it's this weird thing that they can do to their body because their body</v>

2230
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.800
<v Speaker 5>developed doing that.</v>

2231
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.071
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2232
01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:14.930
<v Speaker 5>they went through maturity doing that.</v>

2233
01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.220
<v Speaker 5>Their muscles literally grew onto their bones throwing kicks.</v>

2234
01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:19.671
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2235
01:01:19.671 --> 01:01:19.941
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2236
01:01:19.941 --> 01:01:21.560
<v Speaker 5>lifelong martial arts.</v>

2237
01:01:21.561 --> 01:01:21.850
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

2238
01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:24.470
<v Speaker 5>you didn't win when I was still fighting the UFC.</v>

2239
01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:27.410
<v Speaker 5>You still had a handful of guys that were like me.</v>

2240
01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:27.591
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2241
01:01:27.591 --> 01:01:29.960
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even start thinking about doing this till 26.</v>

2242
01:01:29.961 --> 01:01:33.560
<v Speaker 5>Never had a first real lesson till I was 27.</v>

2243
01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.453
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy.</v>

2244
01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.480
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

2245
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:36.590
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2246
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:36.861
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2247
01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:38.720
<v Speaker 5>now you got these guys like Rory Macdonald,</v>

2248
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.860
<v Speaker 5>they grew up doing it.</v>

2249
01:01:39.861 --> 01:01:44.090
<v Speaker 5>You're a GSP was one of the first and he was a lifelong martial artists and</v>

2250
01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:44.640
<v Speaker 5>that's where your,</v>

2251
01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:44.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2252
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.860
<v Speaker 5>Michael Bisman was a lifelong martial artist and now you're getting guys that</v>

2253
01:01:48.861 --> 01:01:50.150
<v Speaker 5>are even higher level athletes,</v>

2254
01:01:50.151 --> 01:01:51.140
<v Speaker 5>not necessarily GSP,</v>

2255
01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:54.830
<v Speaker 5>but higher level athletes that are lifelong martial artists coming into this</v>

2256
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:55.101
<v Speaker 5>sport.</v>

2257
01:01:55.101 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 5>And I consider wrestlers lifelong martial artist as well.</v>

2258
01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:58.041
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2259
01:01:58.041 --> 01:02:00.050
<v Speaker 5>when you're doing that shit since you're five years old,</v>

2260
01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.130
<v Speaker 5>you know you are,</v>

2261
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:02.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean to me wrestling's a martial arts,</v>

2262
01:02:02.871 --> 01:02:04.010
<v Speaker 5>one of the best in the war in the world.</v>

2263
01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:04.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2264
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:05.000
<v Speaker 5>One of them.</v>

2265
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.200
<v Speaker 5>I think the most important,</v>

2266
01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.490
<v Speaker 5>if you're a really good wrestle,</v>

2267
01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:08.990
<v Speaker 5>you dictate where the fight takes place.</v>

2268
01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:09.710
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2269
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:10.640
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

2270
01:02:10.641 --> 01:02:13.960
<v Speaker 5>some wrestlers never develop that strength.</v>

2271
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.960
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like their body's not designed to strike like a good example with</v>

2272
01:02:17.961 --> 01:02:19.160
<v Speaker 5>all due respect is Matt,</v>

2273
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.560
<v Speaker 5>who was one of the fucking toughest guys ever fight in MMA.</v>

2274
01:02:21.561 --> 01:02:23.040
<v Speaker 5>It was a fantastic grappler.</v>

2275
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.330
<v Speaker 5>Well I think he wants silver,</v>

2276
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:24.931
<v Speaker 5>silver,</v>

2277
01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 5>silver looks fucking great wrestler.</v>

2278
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean you got got ahold of you manhandled people,</v>

2279
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 5>but his striking was always fairly awkward on his feet.</v>

2280
01:02:35.491 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 5>Never developed,</v>

2281
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:37.420
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2282
01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:37.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2283
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:39.810
<v Speaker 5>you're never going to mistake him for Anderson Silva.</v>

2284
01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:40.380
<v Speaker 5>Never feet.</v>

2285
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.890
<v Speaker 5>And it probably never wasn't available to them.</v>

2286
01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2287
01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:48.510
<v Speaker 5>how much scar tissue they build up in their hips and their shoulders from years</v>

2288
01:02:48.511 --> 01:02:49.350
<v Speaker 5>and years of wrestling,</v>

2289
01:02:49.351 --> 01:02:52.320
<v Speaker 5>which I know for me coming from football and the Marine Corps,</v>

2290
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:52.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2291
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:53.671
<v Speaker 5>even now,</v>

2292
01:02:53.671 --> 01:02:53.881
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2293
01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:53.951
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2294
01:02:53.951 --> 01:02:56.700
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to be able to touch one hand behind your head,</v>

2295
01:02:56.701 --> 01:02:57.780
<v Speaker 5>the other hand behind your back,</v>

2296
01:02:57.781 --> 01:02:59.760
<v Speaker 5>you feel to meet your fingers in between your shoulder blades.</v>

2297
01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:00.271
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2298
01:03:00.271 --> 01:03:01.240
<v Speaker 5>I've got like 2 million.</v>

2299
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2300
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.760
<v Speaker 5>I've got like two feet.</v>

2301
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:03.481
<v Speaker 5>I'm work.</v>

2302
01:03:03.481 --> 01:03:04.081
<v Speaker 5>We give it a shot.</v>

2303
01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:04.914
<v Speaker 5>Let's see what you can do.</v>

2304
01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.190
<v Speaker 5>One Hand behind the head sore,</v>

2305
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:07.861
<v Speaker 5>right shoulder.</v>

2306
01:03:07.861 --> 01:03:08.940
<v Speaker 5>So I can't do it one way.</v>

2307
01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.880
<v Speaker 5>I can do it like this canyon.</v>

2308
01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:11.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2309
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.941
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

2310
01:03:11.941 --> 01:03:12.031
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2311
01:03:12.031 --> 01:03:12.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2312
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:13.770
<v Speaker 5>a lot of those guys probably can,</v>

2313
01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:15.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm almost embarrassed to show mine.</v>

2314
01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.331
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

2315
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:18.991
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy,</v>

2316
01:03:18.991 --> 01:03:19.410
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2317
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:20.243
<v Speaker 5>That's all I got.</v>

2318
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.790
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2319
01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:22.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2320
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:22.981
<v Speaker 5>but that's a lot of,</v>

2321
01:03:22.981 --> 01:03:24.060
<v Speaker 5>you have a lot of muscle to,</v>

2322
01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:24.440
<v Speaker 5>isn't that?</v>

2323
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.273
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2324
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.910
<v Speaker 5>I've separated both shoulders,</v>

2325
01:03:26.911 --> 01:03:28.920
<v Speaker 5>the AC joints a couple of times each.</v>

2326
01:03:28.921 --> 01:03:29.640
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2327
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.473
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2328
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:30.791
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2329
01:03:30.791 --> 01:03:31.411
<v Speaker 5>a hump in with,</v>

2330
01:03:31.411 --> 01:03:33.330
<v Speaker 5>with big packs all the time in the military,</v>

2331
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:35.100
<v Speaker 5>shit built up scar tissue all the time.</v>

2332
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:35.851
<v Speaker 5>Oh for sure.</v>

2333
01:03:35.851 --> 01:03:38.310
<v Speaker 5>And then grappling is the worst off shoulders,</v>

2334
01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.410
<v Speaker 5>knees and necks and backs.</v>

2335
01:03:40.411 --> 01:03:43.650
<v Speaker 5>And after awhile it's everybody's playing demolition derby.</v>

2336
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.640
<v Speaker 5>After awhile,</v>

2337
01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:44.881
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2338
01:03:44.881 --> 01:03:46.350
<v Speaker 5>frames get bent fucking,</v>

2339
01:03:46.351 --> 01:03:47.184
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2340
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.310
<v Speaker 5>things blow out.</v>

2341
01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:48.930
<v Speaker 5>That's it,</v>

2342
01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:49.171
<v Speaker 5>eh?</v>

2343
01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:49.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.560
<v Speaker 5>And you see that's where you got to get the crafty old veterans who come out</v>

2345
01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:55.880
<v Speaker 5>there and pull off some sick moves and have their experience to win fights and</v>

2346
01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.330
<v Speaker 5>or they ride off into the sunset.</v>

2347
01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.380
<v Speaker 5>Well again with Nogueira the word is that no care needs like an hour to get</v>

2348
01:04:01.381 --> 01:04:02.880
<v Speaker 5>ready just to train.</v>

2349
01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:08.030
<v Speaker 5>Like he has a guy who travels with him and the guy does massage and stretches</v>

2350
01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 5>him and does all this shit and like literally can't train unless he does this</v>

2351
01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.090
<v Speaker 5>hour long regimen before he gets in there.</v>

01:05:33.161 --> 01:05:34.990
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people came out and they started saying,</v>

<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2414

2419
01:05:42.761 --> 01:05:44.320
<v Speaker 4>We know our aging fighters.</v>

2421
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.720
<v Speaker 4>you could do the same thing with football.</v>

2422
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:48.720
<v Speaker 4>You could certainly do the same thing in the military where there's,</v>

2423
01:05:48.721 --> 01:05:51.430
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of traumatic brain injuries taking place in the military as well.</v>

2424
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:52.730
<v Speaker 4>One thing that,</v>

2425
01:05:52.731 --> 01:05:56.090
<v Speaker 4>that I think people forget and that I think people need to understand that it's,</v>

2426
01:05:56.091 --> 01:05:59.170
<v Speaker 4>it's not to excuse anything or take away from the conversation.</v>

2427
01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.413
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2428
01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.840
<v Speaker 4>it's a little bit of a mitigation.</v>

2429
01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:02.880
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2430
01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.590
<v Speaker 4>the men and women who do sports like this,</v>

2431
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.180
<v Speaker 4>if you take it away from them,</v>

2432
01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:09.130
<v Speaker 4>they're going to find it elsewhere.</v>

2433
01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:10.181
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

2434
01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:10.871
<v Speaker 4>it's a need.</v>

2435
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:11.021
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2436
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:14.530
<v Speaker 4>for a guy like me had I not found mixed martial arts,</v>

2437
01:06:14.531 --> 01:06:16.330
<v Speaker 4>I was going to find something.</v>

2438
01:06:16.331 --> 01:06:16.571
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2439
01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:21.130
<v Speaker 4>there's like there's drive inside us to do something extreme that makes people</v>

2440
01:06:21.131 --> 01:06:22.270
<v Speaker 4>raise their eyebrows and say,</v>

2441
01:06:22.271 --> 01:06:23.680
<v Speaker 4>are you sure you want it?</v>

2442
01:06:23.681 --> 01:06:25.120
<v Speaker 4>You really are going to do that.</v>

2443
01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.530
<v Speaker 4>They have that,</v>

2444
01:06:26.531 --> 01:06:27.680
<v Speaker 4>that desire and,</v>

2445
01:06:27.681 --> 01:06:29.300
<v Speaker 4>and it's just a personality trait.</v>

2446
01:06:29.301 --> 01:06:29.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean if,</v>

2447
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.630
<v Speaker 4>if mixed martial arts didn't exist,</v>

2448
01:06:31.631 --> 01:06:32.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean look at cowboy Cerrone,</v>

2449
01:06:32.831 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 4>the things he does to,</v>

2450
01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:38.590
<v Speaker 4>to fill that hole in his life and you're going to get a lot of guys,</v>

2451
01:06:38.591 --> 01:06:40.120
<v Speaker 4>that's why guys don't want to retire.</v>

2452
01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:41.470
<v Speaker 4>It's just part of who they are.</v>

2453
01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.090
<v Speaker 4>We all know the risks.</v>

2454
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.650
<v Speaker 4>We all know everything we're up against.</v>

2455
01:06:44.651 --> 01:06:45.880
<v Speaker 4>We still sign the contract.</v>

2456
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:50.800
<v Speaker 4>And so it's important to remind them that if you know for people that are anti</v>

2457
01:06:50.801 --> 01:06:51.820
<v Speaker 4>this and anti that,</v>

2458
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:52.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2459
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:54.520
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do something like that anyways,</v>

2460
01:06:54.521 --> 01:06:55.960
<v Speaker 4>we're going to find something else to do.</v>

2461
01:06:55.961 --> 01:06:58.000
<v Speaker 4>And at some point we've got to be accountable for her own actions.</v>

2462
01:06:58.070 --> 01:06:58.191
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2463
01:06:58.191 --> 01:07:01.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a wide variety of human beings is always going to be sedentary.</v>

2464
01:07:01.611 --> 01:07:04.820
<v Speaker 2>People that sit in their couch is going to be people who want fucking rock climb</v>

2465
01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:05.654
<v Speaker 2>with no ropes.</v>

2466
01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:08.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just like you ever see that Alex Honnold guy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he not only does he climb these insane peaks that people get scared to climb</v>

2476
01:07:24.531 --> 01:07:25.280
<v Speaker 2>with ropes.</v>

2477
01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.480
<v Speaker 2>He does it with no ropes.</v>

2478
01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:29.840
<v Speaker 2>He also takes paths that no one has ever done before.</v>

2479
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:34.990
<v Speaker 2>He takes his fucking crazy pass that have never been accomplished by anyone,</v>

2480
01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:36.800
<v Speaker 2>and he does it with no fucking rope.</v>

2481
01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:37.540

<v Speaker 2>he goes at an angle the wrong way.</v>

2486
01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Like he goes at an angle like 15 degrees towards him and he climbs.</v>

2487
01:07:50.061 --> 01:07:50.751
<v Speaker 2>Look at Dutch.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's him with ropes.</v>

2490
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.690
<v Speaker 2>You could see a rope there,</v>

2491
01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:54.500
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:03.920
<v Speaker 2>He's got no rope there and he's got no road and he is incredible.</v>

2496
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:04.491

2513
01:08:20.631 --> 01:08:24.140
<v Speaker 2>there's people around them to make them feel more comfortable while doing it.</v>

2514
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:25.700
<v Speaker 2>You're on your own.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2527
01:08:42.951 --> 01:08:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I would like to help the guy,</v>

2528
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.960
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2529
01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.990
<v Speaker 2>there's the people that are in that industry,</v>

2530
01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:48.741
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote,</v>

2531
01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:48.981
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2532
01:08:48.981 --> 01:08:49.211
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2533
01:08:49.211 --> 01:08:50.510
<v Speaker 2>the free climbing world.</v>

2534
01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 2>They're terrified of him because they're like,</v>

2535
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:53.241
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2536
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:53.931
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

2537
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:54.431
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2538
01:08:54.431 --> 01:08:54.860
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2539
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:55.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2540
01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.000
<v Speaker 2>there was an interview that I watched on one of those major shows where I found</v>

2541
01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:00.680
<v Speaker 2>out about him where they said,</v>

2542
01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:00.921
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2543
01:09:00.921 --> 01:09:03.950
<v Speaker 2>it's not a matter of if he's going to fall,</v>

2544
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:06.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of when is he going to fall.</v>

2545
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:07.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2546
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:07.460
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

2547
01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:08.240
<v Speaker 2>He disagrees.</v>

2548
01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:08.721
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

2549
01:09:08.721 --> 01:09:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm doing.</v>

2550
01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2551
01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.270
<v Speaker 2>every time I do this,</v>

2552
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2553
01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I plot my strategy.</v>

2554
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:16.550
<v Speaker 2>I figure out what path I'm going to take.</v>

2555
01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.470
<v Speaker 2>He does it with ropes first.</v>

2556
01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:21.890
<v Speaker 2>He maps it all out and as he's mapping it out,</v>

2557
01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:23.300
<v Speaker 2>he's climbing up and he's seeing,</v>

2558
01:09:23.301 --> 01:09:23.601
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2559
01:09:23.601 --> 01:09:24.830
<v Speaker 2>well what can I do here?</v>

2560
01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:27.920
<v Speaker 2>But even told me on the podcast one time,</v>

2561
01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:31.220
<v Speaker 2>he was doing one of these fucking climbs and he started the climb,</v>

2562
01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.061
<v Speaker 2>got like,</v>

2563
01:09:32.061 --> 01:09:32.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2564
01:09:32.361 --> 01:09:34.550
<v Speaker 2>x amount of feet up and realize you forgot his powder.</v>

2565
01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:35.571
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2566
01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:35.781
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2567
01:09:35.781 --> 01:09:38.240
<v Speaker 2>they put that powder to keep their fingers are slipping.</v>

2568
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't even lift weights without fucking powder.</v>

2569
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:41.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2570
01:09:41.871 --> 01:09:43.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't even do kettle bells without this shit.</v>

2571
01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:46.940
<v Speaker 2>This guy's climbing 5,000 or so.</v>

2572
01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:47.431
<v Speaker 2>I'm a homeowner,</v>

2573
01:09:47.431 --> 01:09:49.490
<v Speaker 2>so how many fucking fee to be it will be is right here.</v>

2574
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:50.061
<v Speaker 2>Like look at that.</v>

2575
01:09:50.061 --> 01:09:51.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's an incredible,</v>

2576
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:52.790
<v Speaker 2>he's insane.</v>

2577
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.890
<v Speaker 2>But he did it without fucking powder.</v>

2578
01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.910
<v Speaker 2>God halfway up ran into some other climbers who couldn't believe he didn't have</v>

2579
01:09:58.911 --> 01:09:59.744
<v Speaker 2>any ropes.</v>

2580
01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:00.081
<v Speaker 2>They'll like,</v>

2581
01:10:00.081 --> 01:10:00.700
<v Speaker 2>you're just climbing.</v>

2582
01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:04.370
<v Speaker 2>They gave him a powder bag and then he finished the rest of the climb and then</v>

2583
01:10:04.371 --> 01:10:06.050
<v Speaker 2>left the powder bag at the top for them.</v>

2584
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I love the public,</v>

2585
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:07.910
<v Speaker 2>a heart monitor on him.</v>

2586
01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.040
<v Speaker 2>If you know something that would like show,</v>

2587
01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:10.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2588
01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.850
<v Speaker 2>what's his heart rate at when he does this and it's probably something like</v>

2589
01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:14.960
<v Speaker 2>disgustingly low.</v>

2590
01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2591
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.811
<v Speaker 2>but he says he,</v>

2592
01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:17.420
<v Speaker 2>it says it's really mellow.</v>

2593
01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:17.841
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

2594
01:10:17.841 --> 01:10:19.400
<v Speaker 2>if your heart gets,</v>

2595
01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:19.600
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2596
01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.500
<v Speaker 2>if there's a moment where your heart's racing,</v>

2597
01:10:21.501 --> 01:10:22.880
<v Speaker 2>you're probably fucked.</v>

2598
01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Like you probably made a really,</v>

2599
01:10:24.501 --> 01:10:24.921
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

2600
01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:26.540
<v Speaker 2>really terrible mistake,</v>

2601
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:28.340
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

2602
01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:28.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2603
01:10:28.611 --> 01:10:31.190
<v Speaker 2>your point is that there's guys that are like that.</v>

2604
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2605
01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:33.920
<v Speaker 2>what is more dangerous is fighting more dangerous and that,</v>

2606
01:10:33.921 --> 01:10:38.420
<v Speaker 2>well it depends right now fighting's more dangerous until he falls,</v>

2607
01:10:38.421 --> 01:10:40.280
<v Speaker 2>then that's way more far more.</v>

2608
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:41.420
<v Speaker 2>But there's going to be,</v>

2609
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.930
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2610
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:43.640
<v Speaker 2>there's people that have,</v>

2611
01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:48.740
<v Speaker 2>the reason why we have human beings in 2015 is because there's,</v>

2612
01:10:48.741 --> 01:10:53.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a genetic predisposition that some folks have to taking risks,</v>

2613
01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:54.980
<v Speaker 2>exploring new lands,</v>

2614
01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.000
<v Speaker 2>getting in boats,</v>

2615
01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.200
<v Speaker 2>going across the,</v>

2616
01:10:57.201 --> 01:10:59.570
<v Speaker 2>the ocean fighting and battles,</v>

2617
01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.410
<v Speaker 2>conquering new new environments.</v>

2618
01:11:02.411 --> 01:11:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2619
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:04.640
<v Speaker 2>this a part of being a human.</v>

2620
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:09.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a drive that some people have and it sort of speaks to this idea that</v>

2621
01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:15.090
<v Speaker 2>everyone has a role in this crazy dance that is life.</v>

2622
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.060
<v Speaker 2>And without each one of us,</v>

2623
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:19.230
<v Speaker 2>it would never work.</v>

2624
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:20.041
<v Speaker 2>And that all of us,</v>

2625
01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:21.030
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another,</v>

2626
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:26.150
<v Speaker 2>are integrated as this one gigantic super organism and we're moving humanity</v>

2627
01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:27.990
<v Speaker 2>towards some ultimate goal.</v>

2628
01:11:27.991 --> 01:11:29.970
<v Speaker 2>But without these risk takers,</v>

2629
01:11:29.971 --> 01:11:30.930
<v Speaker 2>without warriors,</v>

2630
01:11:30.931 --> 01:11:34.540
<v Speaker 2>without people that are willing to climb fucking rocks and all that,</v>

2631
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:36.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a part of who we are.</v>

2632
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.261
<v Speaker 2>Absolute.</v>

2633
01:11:37.261 --> 01:11:38.094
<v Speaker 2>And you can't,</v>

2634
01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:38.281
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2635
01:11:38.281 --> 01:11:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people say like mixed martial arts should be illegal.</v>

2636
01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:41.521
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2637
01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2638
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:42.031
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2639
01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:42.864
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>

2640
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:43.321
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

2641
01:11:43.321 --> 01:11:44.470
<v Speaker 2>You can't nerf the fucking world.</v>

2642
01:11:44.471 --> 01:11:45.304
<v Speaker 2>You're going to die no matter what.</v>

2643
01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:45.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2644
01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:46.840
<v Speaker 4>if you don't get head kicked,</v>

2645
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.830
<v Speaker 4>you're still going to die.</v>

2646
01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:48.971
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2647
01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:49.571
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2648
01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:49.781
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

2649
01:11:49.781 --> 01:11:50.614
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2650
01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:52.480
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of mitigating factors,</v>

2651
01:11:52.481 --> 01:11:53.620
<v Speaker 4>but the end of the day,</v>

2652
01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:53.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2653
01:11:53.921 --> 01:11:56.530
<v Speaker 4>every fighter chooses to do this,</v>

2654
01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:58.720
<v Speaker 4>it's on them to do it.</v>

2655
01:11:58.721 --> 01:11:59.001
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2656
01:11:59.001 --> 01:11:59.980
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2657
01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:00.670
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

2658
01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:02.320
<v Speaker 4>football is way worse.</v>

2659
01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:02.891
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2660
01:12:02.891 --> 01:12:04.930
<v Speaker 4>I called one season of college football.</v>

2661
01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.020
<v Speaker 4>There were two games where I saw guys,</v>

2662
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2663
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.820
<v Speaker 4>Tibias break in half in one game.</v>

2664
01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:15.120
<v Speaker 4>The Amaanah headshots you take if you're a defense or offensive linemen in those</v>

2665
01:12:15.341 --> 01:12:15.880
<v Speaker 4>games.</v>

2666
01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.250
<v Speaker 4>When I played football with Gi,</v>

2667
01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:21.250
<v Speaker 4>graduated from the Naval Academy and Oh three we didn't have anybody checking if</v>

2668
01:12:21.251 --> 01:12:22.450
<v Speaker 4>we had any concussions.</v>

2669
01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:23.340
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2670
01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:23.970
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>

2671
01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:28.450
<v Speaker 4>since then they have a band having a wedge on kickoff return.</v>

2672
01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.880
<v Speaker 4>I was the wedge breaker on kickoff team.</v>

2673
01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:34.780
<v Speaker 4>So I would take a couple of a Phaedra and I would sprint all the way down field</v>

2674
01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.140
<v Speaker 4>and I'd run rate into four dudes sitting right next to each other from Notre</v>

2675
01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:38.380
<v Speaker 4>Dame.</v>

2676
01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't stand a chance against these guys.</v>

2677
01:12:40.121 --> 01:12:42.790
<v Speaker 4>I just got to be a sacrificial lamb to bust this thing up.</v>

2678
01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:43.510
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2679
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:44.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2680
01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:46.330
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea if I've got a concussion doing that.</v>

2681
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:48.010
<v Speaker 4>I know it didn't feel good.</v>

2682
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:48.490
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2683
01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:49.000
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2684
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.230
<v Speaker 4>How does the federal help?</v>

2685
01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.370
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2686
01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:51.791
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

2687
01:12:51.791 --> 01:12:52.930
<v Speaker 4>It gets your heartbeat and real fast.</v>

2688
01:12:52.931 --> 01:12:54.190
<v Speaker 4>We thought it's just placebo.</v>

2689
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.481
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2690
01:12:54.481 --> 01:12:56.020
<v Speaker 4>a federal is like a stimulant.</v>

2691
01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:56.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2692
01:12:56.411 --> 01:12:57.071
<v Speaker 4>Remember they dal,</v>

2693
01:12:57.071 --> 01:12:58.360
<v Speaker 4>it's like a ton of caffeine,</v>

2694
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2695
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:59.860
<v Speaker 4>They banded shortly.</v>

2696
01:12:59.861 --> 01:13:01.240
<v Speaker 4>If we couldn't even use it anymore,</v>

2697
01:13:01.241 --> 01:13:02.560
<v Speaker 4>I think my senior year was banned.</v>

2698
01:13:02.561 --> 01:13:03.161
<v Speaker 4>It was tooken out.</v>

2699
01:13:03.161 --> 01:13:03.710
<v Speaker 4>All supplements.</v>

2700
01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:04.900
<v Speaker 4>So jujitsu class wants.</v>

2701
01:13:04.901 --> 01:13:08.520
<v Speaker 4>After I took a couple of rip fuels and I almost had a fucking heart attack.</v>

2702
01:13:08.521 --> 01:13:09.070
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that?</v>

2703
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.980
<v Speaker 4>I remember riff fuels,</v>

2704
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:13.600
<v Speaker 4>that shit used to be literally used to be able to go to GNC and buy crank it.</v>

2705
01:13:13.601 --> 01:13:14.890
<v Speaker 4>You can get it like sands,</v>

2706
01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:15.843
<v Speaker 4>Sam's club.</v>

2707
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:17.230
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking crank.</v>

2708
01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:18.083
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>

2709
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:22.120
<v Speaker 4>your heart would be and you feel like you could fucking run through a wall.</v>

2710
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:23.740
<v Speaker 4>It was so retarded</v>

2711
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:26.840
<v Speaker 2>that that stuff was completely legal is a very,</v>

2712
01:13:26.841 --> 01:13:29.390
<v Speaker 2>very bizarre thing that,</v>

2713
01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:32.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at the 2003 when you're talking about when you're playing</v>

2714
01:13:32.721 --> 01:13:33.350
<v Speaker 2>football,</v>

2715
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:36.830
<v Speaker 2>you look at that and you look at the reality of today.</v>

2716
01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Well what are you showing me here,</v>

2717
01:13:38.121 --> 01:13:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

2718
01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

2719
01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:42.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see it.</v>

2720
01:13:42.230 --> 01:13:43.450
<v Speaker 2>You didn't tell him you're going to show me anything.</v>

2721
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:44.360
<v Speaker 2>He's got the straw.</v>

2722
01:13:44.361 --> 01:13:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2723
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.470
<v Speaker 2>you just flew through the air and that'll ruin your day.</v>

2724
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude,</v>

2725
01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:50.953
<v Speaker 2>they're going to look at them.</v>

2726
01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2727
01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:54.210
<v Speaker 6>Paleo</v>

2728
01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.580
<v Speaker 4>and then it collapses and everybody cheers.</v>

2729
01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:57.690
<v Speaker 4>And back then,</v>

2730
01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was no protocol.</v>

2731
01:13:58.701 --> 01:13:59.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like when I played,</v>

2732
01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.900
<v Speaker 4>I played six years of Pop Warner football and one of the drills we do for our</v>

2733
01:14:03.901 --> 01:14:05.730
<v Speaker 4>tackling drills two times a week,</v>

2734
01:14:05.731 --> 01:14:07.230
<v Speaker 4>we'd line up the whole team in one line,</v>

2735
01:14:07.231 --> 01:14:08.070
<v Speaker 4>the first guy to get the ball,</v>

2736
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:09.630
<v Speaker 4>get to run through each guy individually.</v>

2737
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.351
<v Speaker 4>One on one,</v>

2738
01:14:10.351 --> 01:14:10.990
<v Speaker 4>just run,</v>

2739
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.823
<v Speaker 4>hit Ron.</v>

2740
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Hey</v>

2741
01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.410
<v Speaker 2>run hop Warner's little kids.</v>

2742
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:17.970
<v Speaker 2>We've got a bunch of dads are just guys from the neighborhood that Vaughn,</v>

2743
01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean they don't know anything about football.</v>

2744
01:14:19.541 --> 01:14:20.374
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything.</v>

2745
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.180
<v Speaker 2>It's been an incredible that human beings have been around for thousands and</v>

2746
01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:25.720
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands of years.</v>

2747
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.520
<v Speaker 2>And it was 2003 that's only 12 fucking years ago.</v>

2748
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knew that you were getting concussions all the time.</v>

2749
01:14:34.211 --> 01:14:35.080
<v Speaker 2>And this could be bad.</v>

2750
01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2751
01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.210
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't seem to make any sense.</v>

2752
01:14:37.211 --> 01:14:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Does it doesn't.</v>

2753
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.321
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2754
01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:38.861
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

2755
01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean it opens up a whole other door.</v>

2756
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.590
<v Speaker 2>We are still so prime</v>

2757
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:45.200
<v Speaker 4>for as advanced as we are technologically.</v>

2758
01:14:45.201 --> 01:14:49.370
<v Speaker 4>When you look at what's taking place in the world right now and,</v>

2759
01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.130
<v Speaker 4>and how easy it still is for people that take lives.</v>

2760
01:14:53.131 --> 01:14:53.291
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2761
01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:55.730
<v Speaker 4>I've seen studies on chimpanzees with aid,</v>

2762
01:14:55.731 --> 01:14:57.740
<v Speaker 4>they have murderer with chimps and things like that.</v>

2763
01:14:57.741 --> 01:15:01.190
<v Speaker 4>And so some scientists will argue that it's kind of predetermined in our</v>

2764
01:15:01.191 --> 01:15:02.930
<v Speaker 4>genetics and in our DNA that,</v>

2765
01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:03.411
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2766
01:15:03.411 --> 01:15:04.131
<v Speaker 4>we're aggressive,</v>

2767
01:15:04.131 --> 01:15:05.030
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do things like this.</v>

2768
01:15:05.031 --> 01:15:09.810
<v Speaker 4>But I mean there's still a lot of primal qualities that we have in humanity.</v>

2769
01:15:09.811 --> 01:15:09.951
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2770
01:15:09.951 --> 01:15:13.020
<v Speaker 4>you look at what took place in France today when I'm so,</v>

2771
01:15:13.021 --> 01:15:14.810
<v Speaker 4>so in France,</v>

2772
01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.310
<v Speaker 4>three guys who,</v>

2773
01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.680
<v Speaker 4>who are expected to be Muslim because they were,</v>

2774
01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.540
<v Speaker 4>they were chanting Muslim chants and they went in,</v>

2775
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:25.910
<v Speaker 4>they did an attack on a French magazine that does frequent cartoons,</v>

2776
01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:27.643
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2777
01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:28.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2778
01:15:28.071 --> 01:15:29.780
<v Speaker 4>basically making fun of the Muslim religion.</v>

2779
01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:34.580
<v Speaker 4>And so these guys attacked at separate everybody and executed I believe nine</v>

2780
01:15:34.581 --> 01:15:34.941
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2781
01:15:34.941 --> 01:15:37.460
<v Speaker 4>And then on the way out til killed two more police officers.</v>

2782
01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:37.990
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2783
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:39.260
<v Speaker 4>and these three men,</v>

2784
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2785
01:15:39.861 --> 01:15:40.051
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2786
01:15:40.051 --> 01:15:40.261
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2787
01:15:40.261 --> 01:15:40.871
<v Speaker 4>they think they,</v>

2788
01:15:40.871 --> 01:15:42.440
<v Speaker 4>they haven't released a lot of information on them,</v>

2789
01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:44.570
<v Speaker 4>but they went in there like they were trained military.</v>

2790
01:15:44.571 --> 01:15:46.280
<v Speaker 4>It didn't look like your average,</v>

2791
01:15:46.281 --> 01:15:46.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2792
01:15:46.461 --> 01:15:48.410
<v Speaker 4>typical terrorist who got recruited online,</v>

2793
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:50.060
<v Speaker 4>found a gun and wit and shoot somebody.</v>

2794
01:15:50.061 --> 01:15:50.691
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't the,</v>

2795
01:15:50.691 --> 01:15:51.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2796
01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.750
<v Speaker 4>the two brothers who made a pot bomb up in Boston.</v>

2797
01:15:53.751 --> 01:15:55.130
<v Speaker 4>These dudes knew what they were doing.</v>

2798
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:56.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2799
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:56.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2800
01:15:56.271 --> 01:15:56.470
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2801
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.720
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2802
01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:56.961
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2803
01:15:56.961 --> 01:15:59.090
<v Speaker 4>and it's huge news to couple with that.</v>

2804
01:15:59.091 --> 01:15:59.301
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2805
01:15:59.301 --> 01:16:00.230
<v Speaker 4>it's getting less news.</v>

2806
01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.031
<v Speaker 4>I think there was a,</v>

2807
01:16:01.031 --> 01:16:04.520
<v Speaker 4>a suicide bomb in Yemen that killed 30 people.</v>

2808
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.900
<v Speaker 2>This is incredible.</v>

2809
01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.040
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] parachuting.</v>

01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Suspects are still at large,</v>

2811
01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.260
<v Speaker 2>two of them are still at large,</v>

2812
01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:14.100
<v Speaker 2>and this was all over making fun of a fucking religion.</v>

2813
01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:15.090
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible,</v>

2814
01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:15.411
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2815
01:16:15.411 --> 01:16:15.531
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2816
01:16:15.531 --> 01:16:15.711
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2817
01:16:15.711 --> 01:16:16.191
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>

2818
01:16:16.191 --> 01:16:16.511
<v Speaker 4>one of them,</v>

2819
01:16:16.511 --> 01:16:17.600
<v Speaker 4>I think they showed one of the,</v>

2820
01:16:17.601 --> 01:16:20.460
<v Speaker 4>one of the cartoons and the main cartoonists day day,</v>

2821
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.800
<v Speaker 4>they knew her by name.</v>

2822
01:16:21.801 --> 01:16:24.230
<v Speaker 4>They knew people by name separate and they made sure she was killed.</v>

2823
01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2824
01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.350
<v Speaker 4>but she even did one on Mohamed.</v>

2825
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.633
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2826
01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:32.660
<v Speaker 2>And so what a crazy religion where you can't even draw their guy.</v>

2827
01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:33.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2828
01:16:33.381 --> 01:16:33.861
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

2829
01:16:33.861 --> 01:16:34.460
<v Speaker 2>you could have,</v>

2830
01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:34.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2831
01:16:34.701 --> 01:16:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Sam Kinison who used to be a preacher,</v>

2832
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:38.030
<v Speaker 2>had Jesus Christ,</v>

2833
01:16:38.031 --> 01:16:40.610
<v Speaker 2>jokes about him getting nailed to the cross.</v>

2834
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2835
01:16:41.361 --> 01:16:43.880
<v Speaker 2>he had jokes about Jesus Christ,</v>

2836
01:16:43.881 --> 01:16:46.100
<v Speaker 2>about his wife,</v>

2837
01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:46.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2838
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.850
<v Speaker 2>saying he's a loser and you're hanging out with the 12 apostles,</v>

2839
01:16:49.851 --> 01:16:50.481
<v Speaker 2>they're losers.</v>

2840
01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:51.320
<v Speaker 2>You're friends are losers.</v>

2841
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:53.720
<v Speaker 2>He mocked,</v>

2842
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:55.670
<v Speaker 2>openly mocked this religion that,</v>

2843
01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:56.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2844
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.250
<v Speaker 2>he used to be a part of no repercussions.</v>

2845
01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:01.520
<v Speaker 2>You draw Muhammad just drawn and you're fucking,</v>

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.880
<v Speaker 2>your suspect or you're a subject to this kind of shit.</v>

2848
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.740
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

2849
01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:06.201
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2850
01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:07.034
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2851
01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:08.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2852
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:08.340
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2853
01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 4>it never in my life,</v>

2854
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:11.510
<v Speaker 4>and obviously I haven't been everywhere,</v>

2855
01:17:11.511 --> 01:17:13.070
<v Speaker 4>so I'm pretty well traveled.</v>

2856
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:14.481
<v Speaker 4>I've just,</v>

2857
01:17:14.481 --> 01:17:17.990
<v Speaker 4>I've never been anywhere like my time in the Middle East where,</v>

2858
01:17:17.991 --> 01:17:19.700
<v Speaker 4>where I've seen not everybody,</v>

2859
01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:23.390
<v Speaker 4>but certain people value human life so little,</v>

2860
01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:24.613
<v Speaker 4>so little.</v>

2861
01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 4>And it's a really hard thing to comprehend when you're there and you try with a</v>

2862
01:17:29.001 --> 01:17:31.250
<v Speaker 4>language barrier to understand it more.</v>

2863
01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:33.980
<v Speaker 4>And the only thing I was able to conclude was that,</v>

2864
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2865
01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:39.760
<v Speaker 4>this certain population has been so accustomed to violence for so many centuries</v>

2866
01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:42.200
<v Speaker 4>that uh,</v>

2867
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.790
<v Speaker 4>their endurance for it is so much greater than Western civilization.</v>

2868
01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:47.300
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2869
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.081
<v Speaker 4>and that is,</v>

2870
01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:51.590
<v Speaker 4>that is part of the problem with us getting involved in conflicts over there</v>

2871
01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:52.401
<v Speaker 4>where look,</v>

2872
01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:52.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2873
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.880
<v Speaker 4>they're going to replenish their forces every time someone turns 16 they're</v>

2874
01:17:55.881 --> 01:17:58.160
<v Speaker 4>going to join the ranks or whatever age it may be.</v>

2875
01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:59.211
<v Speaker 4>Whereas,</v>

2876
01:17:59.211 --> 01:17:59.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2877
01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:00.374
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

2878
01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2879
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:02.240
<v Speaker 4>we're not able to do that,</v>

2880
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2881
01:18:02.661 --> 01:18:02.791
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

2882
01:18:02.791 --> 01:18:02.931
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

2883
01:18:02.931 --> 01:18:03.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2884
01:18:03.201 --> 01:18:06.920
<v Speaker 4>in order to be a son who had a great point or to be successful military campaign</v>

2885
01:18:06.921 --> 01:18:07.551
<v Speaker 4>need three things.</v>

2886
01:18:07.551 --> 01:18:08.151
<v Speaker 4>You need the people,</v>

2887
01:18:08.151 --> 01:18:11.030
<v Speaker 4>you need the government and you need the military without all three</v>

2888
01:18:11.031 --> 01:18:11.751
<v Speaker 4>synchronized,</v>

2889
01:18:11.751 --> 01:18:12.890
<v Speaker 4>you will not be successful.</v>

2890
01:18:12.891 --> 01:18:13.671
<v Speaker 4>If you lose one of them,</v>

2891
01:18:13.671 --> 01:18:14.504
<v Speaker 4>it's out.</v>

2892
01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.070
<v Speaker 4>And you could see Vietnam,</v>

2893
01:18:16.071 --> 01:18:17.120
<v Speaker 4>you could see Iraq.</v>

2894
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:18.860
<v Speaker 4>When the people get disgusted,</v>

2895
01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 4>then it becomes a problem and it's going to pull back the government.</v>

2896
01:18:21.891 --> 01:18:22.340
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>

2897
01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.570
<v Speaker 4>the military is going to pull back.</v>

2898
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.060
<v Speaker 4>And really you're going to see us get outlasted.</v>

2899
01:18:26.061 --> 01:18:26.211
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2900
01:18:26.211 --> 01:18:28.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making the argument that we belonged and you know,</v>

2901
01:18:28.521 --> 01:18:30.110
<v Speaker 4>that's a whole other bag of worms we can get there.</v>

2902
01:18:30.111 --> 01:18:31.460
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2903
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:32.571
<v Speaker 4>over there,</v>

2904
01:18:32.571 --> 01:18:35.120
<v Speaker 4>they know we're setting dates for when we're going to withdraw.</v>

2905
01:18:35.121 --> 01:18:35.331
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2906
01:18:35.331 --> 01:18:38.990
<v Speaker 4>they're just so much more use to violence that,</v>

2907
01:18:38.991 --> 01:18:39.651
<v Speaker 4>that not,</v>

2908
01:18:39.651 --> 01:18:40.880
<v Speaker 4>and I shouldn't generalize everybody,</v>

2909
01:18:40.881 --> 01:18:41.051
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2910
01:18:41.051 --> 01:18:42.060
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

2911
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.943
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2912
01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:43.581
<v Speaker 4>the units,</v>

2913
01:18:43.581 --> 01:18:43.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2914
01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.740
<v Speaker 4>I k al-Qaida Taliban,</v>

2915
01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:46.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2916
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.310
<v Speaker 4>they're so used to violence that they can stomach it and they're just,</v>

2917
01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:50.900
<v Speaker 4>it's just the way they've always lived.</v>

2918
01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:51.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2919
01:18:51.381 --> 01:18:54.710
<v Speaker 2>it's what you were saying about God's like a beep number Grumet off.</v>

2920
01:18:54.711 --> 01:18:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Growing up in Dagestan and growing up in these really harsh environments,</v>

2921
01:18:58.540 --> 01:18:58.760
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2922
01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.060
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2923
01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.320
<v Speaker 2>they become tougher.</v>

2924
01:19:00.321 --> 01:19:05.321
<v Speaker 2>People were so used to a certain easy way of life that these folks have this</v>

2925
01:19:06.381 --> 01:19:07.940
<v Speaker 2>much more intense,</v>

2926
01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:13.120
<v Speaker 2>much more dangerous environment that they live in and that is normal to them.</v>

2927
01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:16.310
<v Speaker 2>And when people grow up in certain environments,</v>

2928
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:18.380
<v Speaker 2>that becomes how they live.</v>

2929
01:19:18.381 --> 01:19:19.760
<v Speaker 2>And we're adaptable as hell.</v>

2930
01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:20.051
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2931
01:19:20.051 --> 01:19:20.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2932
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.751
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2933
01:19:20.751 --> 01:19:21.501
<v Speaker 4>you look at one of them,</v>

2934
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:24.320
<v Speaker 4>one of the most disturbing when when I try to explain,</v>

2935
01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.030
<v Speaker 4>because people will forget,</v>

2936
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:27.283
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2937
01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:28.580
<v Speaker 4>or they'll take for granted,</v>

2938
01:19:28.581 --> 01:19:30.650
<v Speaker 4>I should say how evil,</v>

2939
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2940
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.780
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

2941
01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.980
<v Speaker 4>or what kind of evil does exist in the world.</v>

2942
01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:34.150
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2943
01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:36.410
<v Speaker 4>and people will talk about Isis and you know,</v>

2944
01:19:36.411 --> 01:19:36.591
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2945
01:19:36.591 --> 01:19:36.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2946
01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:37.790
<v Speaker 4>Ben Affleck made a comment,</v>

2947
01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:39.650
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't even fill a baseball stadium,</v>

2948
01:19:39.651 --> 01:19:39.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2949
01:19:39.861 --> 01:19:41.540
<v Speaker 4>a Aa be at ball stadium or something like that.</v>

2950
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:42.374
<v Speaker 4>They're not a threat.</v>

2951
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:44.210
<v Speaker 4>People will take for granted,</v>

2952
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2953
01:19:44.901 --> 01:19:46.670
<v Speaker 4>that the type of evil that does exist in the world,</v>

2954
01:19:46.671 --> 01:19:48.650
<v Speaker 4>and it's not just obviously in the Muslim culture.</v>

2955
01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:49.011
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2956
01:19:49.011 --> 01:19:49.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2957
01:19:49.311 --> 01:19:49.911
<v Speaker 4>as an example,</v>

2958
01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:50.351
<v Speaker 4>it exists.</v>

2959
01:19:50.351 --> 01:19:53.540
<v Speaker 4>It exists plenty in Africa as well in certain areas.</v>

2960
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.610
<v Speaker 4>But one video all tell people,</v>

2961
01:19:55.611 --> 01:19:55.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2962
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:56.570
<v Speaker 4>checkout,</v>

2963
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:57.770
<v Speaker 4>and it's not for everybody.</v>

2964
01:19:57.950 --> 01:20:00.640
<v Speaker 4>But if you look at a video of the [inaudible] massacre,</v>

2965
01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:01.040
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

2966
01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.650
<v Speaker 4>which happened in Dagestan where Chechnyan,</v>

2967
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:04.371
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2968
01:20:04.371 --> 01:20:09.371
<v Speaker 4>rebels massacred Russian soldiers and they basically one by one while they're</v>

2969
01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:11.341
<v Speaker 4>alive,</v>

2970
01:20:11.341 --> 01:20:15.120
<v Speaker 4>behead them where it takes a long enemy and the video is disgusting.</v>

2971
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't recommend anybody here who's listening this go watch it.</v>

2972
01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:21.420
<v Speaker 4>This is when I get into intense debate with people that I know are mature enough</v>

2973
01:20:21.421 --> 01:20:22.171
<v Speaker 4>to handle it in,</v>

2974
01:20:22.171 --> 01:20:22.760
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2975
01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:24.570
<v Speaker 4>or trying to understand certain things.</v>

2976
01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:27.000
<v Speaker 4>I'll recommend you if you want to understand this a little bit,</v>

2977
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:27.834
<v Speaker 4>take a look at this.</v>

2978
01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2979
01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:33.540
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to watch to understand that that exists and to imagine that a human</v>

2980
01:20:33.541 --> 01:20:36.330
<v Speaker 4>being is capable not only of doing it once,</v>

2981
01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:41.250
<v Speaker 4>but repeatedly and talking casually like we are right now while they're doing</v>

2982
01:20:41.251 --> 01:20:41.371
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2983
01:20:41.371 --> 01:20:43.800
<v Speaker 4>While someone's squirms on the ground being decapitated,</v>

2984
01:20:44.190 --> 01:20:47.460
<v Speaker 4>that takes something inside that that is sickening,</v>

2985
01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:48.443
<v Speaker 4>that is frightening.</v>

2986
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:50.990
<v Speaker 2>And it exists throughout human history.</v>

2987
01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:51.501
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2988
01:20:51.501 --> 01:20:53.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a quality that solutely does.</v>

2989
01:20:53.151 --> 01:20:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Human beings can tap into and almost in a way that animals can't,</v>

2990
01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:57.941
<v Speaker 2>it's almost in the,</v>

2991
01:20:57.941 --> 01:20:58.101
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2992
01:20:58.101 --> 01:20:59.480
<v Speaker 2>the mind has the,</v>

2993
01:20:59.481 --> 01:21:04.100
<v Speaker 2>the human mind has this ability to compartmentalize and to rationalize and to be</v>

2994
01:21:04.101 --> 01:21:06.770
<v Speaker 2>capable of things that even animals aren't,</v>

2995
01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.200
<v Speaker 2>aren't capable of doing animals killed to eat.</v>

2996
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Or occasionally the intelligent animals like chimpanzees,</v>

2997
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.611
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2998
01:21:13.611 --> 01:21:13.791
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

2999
01:21:13.791 --> 01:21:18.791
<v Speaker 2>they'll kill to protect environments or proper overthrow overthrow the alpha.</v>

3000
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3001
01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.150
<v Speaker 2>But what these,</v>

3002
01:21:20.151 --> 01:21:20.780
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

3003
01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.070
<v Speaker 2>this is a different thing.</v>

3004
01:21:22.071 --> 01:21:22.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>

3005
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:24.680
<v Speaker 2>this is ritualized killing.</v>

3006
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:25.550
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

3007
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:29.720
<v Speaker 2>this is killing on a level that the justification of that is,</v>

3008
01:21:29.721 --> 01:21:33.500
<v Speaker 2>is it's hard to comprehend for the average person that lives in a nice,</v>

3009
01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:34.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3010
01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:37.310
<v Speaker 2>community and it goes to the supermarket and likes to go to a restaurant and</v>

3011
01:21:37.311 --> 01:21:38.450
<v Speaker 2>order a glass of wine,</v>

3012
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:39.680
<v Speaker 2>clink glasses.</v>

3013
01:21:39.681 --> 01:21:40.670
<v Speaker 2>And this is like,</v>

3014
01:21:40.671 --> 01:21:40.851
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3015
01:21:40.851 --> 01:21:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I support war.</v>

3016
01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.460
<v Speaker 2>You know what war is?</v>

3017
01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:44.930
<v Speaker 2>They have no idea.</v>

3018
01:21:44.931 --> 01:21:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3019
01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:45.730
<v Speaker 4>no idea.</v>

3020
01:21:45.730 --> 01:21:45.981
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3021
01:21:45.981 --> 01:21:46.814
<v Speaker 4>and it's not just,</v>

3022
01:21:46.930 --> 01:21:47.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3023
01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:49.510
<v Speaker 4>I certainly don't want the people at home to think we're generalizing the Middle</v>

3024
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.511
<v Speaker 4>East.</v>

3025
01:21:49.511 --> 01:21:52.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can go to Rwanda and look at what took places or one,</v>

3026
01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:55.030
<v Speaker 4>look what takes place in Sudan every single day.</v>

3027
01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:55.751
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3028
01:21:55.751 --> 01:21:57.760
<v Speaker 4>and it's sad cause you talked about how we're this,</v>

3029
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:58.271
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3030
01:21:58.271 --> 01:21:58.601
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3031
01:21:58.601 --> 01:22:02.560
<v Speaker 4>a global race of beings at all have a place at the table to,</v>

3032
01:22:02.561 --> 01:22:03.790
<v Speaker 4>to progress ourselves.</v>

3033
01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:06.010
<v Speaker 4>Yet there's still so many things,</v>

3034
01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:06.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3035
01:22:06.491 --> 01:22:08.800
<v Speaker 4>that show that we are still very primal.</v>

3036
01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:09.271
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3037
01:22:09.271 --> 01:22:12.180
<v Speaker 2>there's areas of the world that just have not caught up yet.</v>

3038
01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:16.050
<v Speaker 2>There's areas of the world that give us a window into the past would,</v>

3039
01:22:16.051 --> 01:22:18.840
<v Speaker 2>it must've been like to live thousands of years ago.</v>

3040
01:22:18.841 --> 01:22:23.520
<v Speaker 2>When you hear about all these barbaric events that happened in human history</v>

3041
01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:25.740
<v Speaker 2>that most people just like to look at and go,</v>

3042
01:22:25.741 --> 01:22:25.921
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3043
01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:27.390
<v Speaker 2>those were the dark ages.</v>

3044
01:22:27.391 --> 01:22:28.070
<v Speaker 2>This was,</v>

3045
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3046
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:30.030
<v Speaker 2>back in Gingiss cons day.</v>

3047
01:22:30.031 --> 01:22:30.870
<v Speaker 2>This was backward.</v>

3048
01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.540
<v Speaker 2>Alexander the Great was around,</v>

3049
01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:32.731
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3050
01:22:32.731 --> 01:22:32.890
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3051
01:22:32.890 --> 01:22:33.650
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3052
01:22:33.650 --> 01:22:35.820
<v Speaker 2>It's the fucking Congo doesn't 15.</v>

3053
01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:37.590
<v Speaker 2>If you were there right now in,</v>

3054
01:22:37.591 --> 01:22:37.831
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3055
01:22:37.831 --> 01:22:42.450
<v Speaker 2>in one of those areas where warlords or tearing into villages and machete and</v>

3056
01:22:42.451 --> 01:22:43.284
<v Speaker 2>people's to death,</v>

3057
01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.890
<v Speaker 2>you would watch exactly what,</v>

3058
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:48.420
<v Speaker 2>what would have happened a thousand years ago,</v>

3059
01:22:48.421 --> 01:22:49.440
<v Speaker 2>10,000 years ago.</v>

3060
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:49.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3061
01:22:49.921 --> 01:22:53.520
<v Speaker 2>the only difference is these people have clothes that were made in a factory and</v>

3062
01:22:53.521 --> 01:22:56.100
<v Speaker 2>machetes that were made in a factory and guns.</v>

3063
01:22:56.150 --> 01:22:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3064
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.091
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

3065
01:22:57.091 --> 01:22:58.770
<v Speaker 2>it's human barbarism.</v>

3066
01:22:58.860 --> 01:22:59.693
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3067
01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:00.631
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>

3068
01:23:00.631 --> 01:23:01.080
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3069
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:04.260
<v Speaker 2>it's very disconcerting for a lot of people because you know,</v>

3070
01:23:04.261 --> 01:23:04.710
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3071
01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:05.950
<v Speaker 2>when a child,</v>

3072
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:08.380
<v Speaker 2>especially when I was a kid,</v>

3073
01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm 47 and when I was,</v>

3074
01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:11.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3075
01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:12.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how old I was,</v>

3076
01:23:12.641 --> 01:23:15.250
<v Speaker 2>I was probably like nine or something,</v>

3077
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.170
<v Speaker 2>maybe 10 when the Vietnam war ended.</v>

3078
01:23:17.171 --> 01:23:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>

3079
01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:21.070
<v Speaker 2>but I was living in California and I remember it was on TV.</v>

3080
01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:24.430
<v Speaker 2>It was on the news where America is pulling out of the Vietnam bar.</v>

3081
01:23:24.450 --> 01:23:26.410
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking it was a little kid.</v>

3082
01:23:26.411 --> 01:23:26.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3083
01:23:26.531 --> 01:23:27.364
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>

3084
01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Glad we figured out that war is bad and we're never going to do this again</v>

3085
01:23:32.381 --> 01:23:35.050
<v Speaker 2>because everybody really hates war and we're moving on.</v>

3086
01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:40.051
<v Speaker 2>I remember having this idea in my mind as a child that we are evolving past war</v>

3087
01:23:41.411 --> 01:23:43.720
<v Speaker 2>and this is good that I grew up in a day,</v>

3088
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3089
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:44.741
<v Speaker 2>cause I talked to,</v>

3090
01:23:44.741 --> 01:23:45.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3091
01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:46.150
<v Speaker 2>my Stepdad,</v>

3092
01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:46.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3093
01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 2>he was worried about getting drafted and never did.</v>

3094
01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.060
<v Speaker 2>And there's people in my neighborhood that,</v>

3095
01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:52.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3096
01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:56.860
<v Speaker 2>had been to Vietnam and I talked to them about it and everybody was almost</v>

3097
01:23:56.861 --> 01:23:59.980
<v Speaker 2>unanimous that we shouldn't have been there and the war is bad.</v>

3098
01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.180
<v Speaker 2>And then I was a kid.</v>

3099
01:24:01.930 --> 01:24:05.740
<v Speaker 2>I was maybe 21 when we went into the first Gulf War.</v>

3100
01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.130
<v Speaker 2>And I remember watching on TV with my roommate and me and my,</v>

3101
01:24:09.131 --> 01:24:09.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3102
01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:10.210
<v Speaker 2>my friend Jimmy,</v>

3103
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.120
<v Speaker 2>my roommate,</v>

3104
01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:11.471
<v Speaker 2>we were like,</v>

3105
01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:12.460
<v Speaker 2>holy fucking shit.</v>

3106
01:24:12.461 --> 01:24:13.294
<v Speaker 2>We're doing it again.</v>

3107
01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:13.920
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't believe.</v>

3108
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.920
<v Speaker 2>But it was that long stretch that America had not been in like a real quote</v>

3109
01:24:19.301 --> 01:24:20.020
<v Speaker 2>unquote war.</v>

3110
01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.850
<v Speaker 2>We had gone through some military actions,</v>

3111
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:23.100
<v Speaker 2>a lot of covert shit,</v>

3112
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:25.480
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things that weren't in the news and daily basis.</v>

3113
01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:30.720
<v Speaker 2>And so people weren't really aware of how the world works and how much bloodshed</v>

3114
01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:35.110
<v Speaker 2>is required in order to keep peace in certain areas.</v>

3115
01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:37.210
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden it's on again.</v>

3116
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3117
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:38.231
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking,</v>

3118
01:24:38.231 --> 01:24:39.070
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this.</v>

3119
01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:39.440
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3120
01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.900
<v Speaker 4>and it's interesting too because you know,</v>

3121
01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:41.710
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

3122
01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:42.810
<v Speaker 4>people don't bring this up off.</v>

3123
01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:45.670
<v Speaker 4>And could you imagine what would happen if,</v>

3124
01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:50.110
<v Speaker 4>if our navy was so downsize that they no longer patrol the waters?</v>

3125
01:24:50.111 --> 01:24:50.331
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

3126
01:24:50.331 --> 01:24:52.060
<v Speaker 4>what would oil prices be like?</v>

3127
01:24:52.061 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 4>Shipping link is piracy is still a problem and we ended up doing most of,</v>

3128
01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:57.760
<v Speaker 4>or ma,</v>

3129
01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.410
<v Speaker 4>we do a lot of policing,</v>

3130
01:24:59.740 --> 01:24:59.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3131
01:24:59.981 --> 01:25:01.120
<v Speaker 4>out there in the seas with,</v>

3132
01:25:01.121 --> 01:25:02.770
<v Speaker 4>with constant appointments for our navy.</v>

3133
01:25:02.771 --> 01:25:03.970
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3134
01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:04.843
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3135
01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:05.861
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy,</v>

3136
01:25:05.861 --> 01:25:06.431
<v Speaker 4>but the world,</v>

3137
01:25:06.431 --> 01:25:06.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3138
01:25:06.641 --> 01:25:06.731
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3139
01:25:06.731 --> 01:25:06.901
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3140
01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:07.351
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3141
01:25:07.351 --> 01:25:07.500
<v Speaker 4>as in,</v>

3142
01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:07.741
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

3143
01:25:07.741 --> 01:25:08.830
<v Speaker 4>I got into discussion with a,</v>

3144
01:25:08.831 --> 01:25:10.480
<v Speaker 4>with a Harvard Law Grad today about it.</v>

3145
01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:10.931
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3146
01:25:10.931 --> 01:25:11.531
<v Speaker 4>what came first?</v>

3147
01:25:11.531 --> 01:25:12.221
<v Speaker 4>The chicken or the egg,</v>

3148
01:25:12.221 --> 01:25:12.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3149
01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:16.810
<v Speaker 4>had we not gone to them in the Middle East and interfered with that have</v>

3150
01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:19.480
<v Speaker 4>prevented a lot of the terrorist attacks that we've taken place.</v>

3151
01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.110
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3152
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:22.330
<v Speaker 4>And she threw that out there and I said,</v>

3153
01:25:22.331 --> 01:25:22.631
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3154
01:25:22.631 --> 01:25:23.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3155
01:25:23.050 --> 01:25:24.520
<v Speaker 4>this attack happened in France.</v>

3156
01:25:24.521 --> 01:25:26.920
<v Speaker 4>How much involvement is France had in Iraq and Afghanistan?</v>

3157
01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:27.971
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3158
01:25:27.971 --> 01:25:31.000
<v Speaker 4>and so it's hard to ever comprehend at this point,</v>

3159
01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:31.291
<v Speaker 4>but there,</v>

3160
01:25:31.291 --> 01:25:35.350
<v Speaker 4>there is a lot of violence in the world and there's a hatred that we can't</v>

3161
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:35.861
<v Speaker 4>comprehend.</v>

3162
01:25:35.861 --> 01:25:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Like the way that the al Qaeda in Iraq,</v>

3163
01:25:39.011 --> 01:25:39.910
<v Speaker 4>when I was there,</v>

3164
01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.410
<v Speaker 4>hated us.</v>

3165
01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:46.360
<v Speaker 4>We in America could never comprehend that kind of hatred.</v>

3166
01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.070
<v Speaker 4>We don't even know what it's like.</v>

3167
01:25:48.071 --> 01:25:49.030
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what it was like.</v>

3168
01:25:49.031 --> 01:25:49.661
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't have met.</v>

3169
01:25:49.661 --> 01:25:53.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean to the point where you are willing to not only try to kill me,</v>

3170
01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:59.460
<v Speaker 4>but you'll kill innocent children just to get at me and have no issues doing it.</v>

3171
01:26:02.501 --> 01:26:04.700
<v Speaker 4>You'll repeatedly tried to do that.</v>

3172
01:26:05.210 --> 01:26:07.970
<v Speaker 4>That what that does to the mind,</v>

3173
01:26:07.971 --> 01:26:08.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3174
01:26:08.241 --> 01:26:13.040
<v Speaker 4>when people will look at post traumatic stress and in it the is not meant to,</v>

3175
01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:13.341
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3176
01:26:13.341 --> 01:26:14.450
<v Speaker 4>to handle all of that.</v>

3177
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 4>Especially when it's a young kid.</v>

3178
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3179
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:17.241
<v Speaker 4>who's 18,</v>

3180
01:26:17.241 --> 01:26:19.190
<v Speaker 4>19 years old who most likely came from,</v>

3181
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3182
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:21.230
<v Speaker 4>a pretty poor background.</v>

3183
01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:23.720
<v Speaker 4>That's the reason they decided to enlist in the military during a time of two</v>

3184
01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:24.440
<v Speaker 4>wars.</v>

3185
01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:24.981
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>

3186
01:26:24.981 --> 01:26:25.814
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3187
01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:30.040
<v Speaker 4>it's an unbelievable debate and discussion that's going to take place for years</v>

3188
01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.530
<v Speaker 4>and we'll never know.</v>

3189
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:33.520
<v Speaker 4>We'll never fully know because of course there,</v>

3190
01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.910
<v Speaker 4>there's so much politics at play with it as well that clouds the,</v>

3191
01:26:37.911 --> 01:26:41.180
<v Speaker 4>the overall analysis of what truly takes place.</v>

3192
01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:41.811
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3193
01:26:41.811 --> 01:26:41.951
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3194
01:26:41.951 --> 01:26:42.261
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3195
01:26:42.261 --> 01:26:44.420
<v Speaker 4>that goes into a whole lot of discussion on how,</v>

3196
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:45.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3197
01:26:45.111 --> 01:26:47.270
<v Speaker 4>certain policies are made,</v>

3198
01:26:47.271 --> 01:26:47.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3199
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:49.190
<v Speaker 4>based on political timelines,</v>

3200
01:26:49.191 --> 01:26:50.420
<v Speaker 4>vice when they're actually needed.</v>

3201
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:52.570
<v Speaker 2>It's also one of the,</v>

3202
01:26:52.571 --> 01:26:57.571
<v Speaker 2>the true horrors about drones that is constantly up for debate because drones</v>

3203
01:26:59.181 --> 01:27:00.950
<v Speaker 2>are so nonspecific.</v>

3204
01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people that have been killed by drones that were absolutely</v>

3205
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:05.301
<v Speaker 2>innocent.</v>

3206
01:27:05.301 --> 01:27:06.440
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them children,</v>

3207
01:27:06.650 --> 01:27:07.640
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them women,</v>

3208
01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:08.930
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them completely,</v>

3209
01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3210
01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:14.560
<v Speaker 2>civilians and that a lot of people on the other side would say,</v>

3211
01:27:14.601 --> 01:27:14.811
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3212
01:27:14.811 --> 01:27:18.320
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about these horrific things they're done by the United</v>

3213
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:18.321
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

3214
01:27:18.321 --> 01:27:22.520
<v Speaker 2>but they're done in this weird way with a robot that flies in the sky and shoots</v>

3215
01:27:22.521 --> 01:27:23.354
<v Speaker 2>missiles.</v>

3216
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.750
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3217
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:26.510
<v Speaker 2>it's sterilized in the sense that it's not like the,</v>

3218
01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:26.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3219
01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:27.261
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3220
01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:27.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3221
01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:29.060
<v Speaker 2>these Russians,</v>

3222
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3223
01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:33.350
<v Speaker 2>killing Chechnyan rebels or Chechen rebels killing Russians with a knife.</v>

3224
01:27:33.450 --> 01:27:33.730
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3225
01:27:33.730 --> 01:27:34.160
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3226
01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.420
<v Speaker 2>it's sterilized in,</v>

3227
01:27:35.421 --> 01:27:38.570
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that no one has to get blood on their hands.</v>

3228
01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:40.160
<v Speaker 2>They're you using a remote control.</v>

3229
01:27:40.161 --> 01:27:41.120
<v Speaker 2>They're watching a monitor,</v>

3230
01:27:41.121 --> 01:27:42.020
<v Speaker 2>the pressing a button,</v>

3231
01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:44.330
<v Speaker 2>but the same result that's taking place.</v>

3232
01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:45.061
<v Speaker 4>Certainly.</v>

3233
01:27:45.061 --> 01:27:45.660
<v Speaker 4>And I mean it,</v>

3234
01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:45.841
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3235
01:27:45.841 --> 01:27:46.830
<v Speaker 4>the end result is,</v>

3236
01:27:46.890 --> 01:27:47.151
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

3237
01:27:47.151 --> 01:27:48.320
<v Speaker 4>is human life has been,</v>

3238
01:27:48.321 --> 01:27:49.140
<v Speaker 4>has been terminated.</v>

3239
01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:49.950
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>

3240
01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:51.990
<v Speaker 2>when you enlisted and you went over,</v>

3241
01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:56.580
<v Speaker 2>was this a part of like sort of the same drive that lead that lead you to be a</v>

3242
01:27:56.581 --> 01:27:57.180
<v Speaker 2>fighter?</v>

3243
01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:57.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3244
01:27:57.670 --> 01:27:58.540
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

3245
01:27:58.541 --> 01:27:58.841
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3246
01:27:58.841 --> 01:27:59.500
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

3247
01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:03.130
<v Speaker 4>I was in high school at the time and I was getting recruited by a bunch of</v>

3248
01:28:03.131 --> 01:28:06.640
<v Speaker 4>different schools to play football and I kind of already had a sense that,</v>

3249
01:28:06.641 --> 01:28:08.950
<v Speaker 4>that I really would like to attend a military academy.</v>

3250
01:28:08.951 --> 01:28:09.740
<v Speaker 4>But then,</v>

3251
01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:10.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3252
01:28:10.050 --> 01:28:12.670
<v Speaker 4>I also started getting heavily recruited by a lot of Ivy League schools.</v>

3253
01:28:12.671 --> 01:28:14.020
<v Speaker 4>And in my education mattered,</v>

3254
01:28:14.021 --> 01:28:16.060
<v Speaker 4>I looked at some of the graduation rate to some of the other,</v>

3255
01:28:16.330 --> 01:28:16.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3256
01:28:16.631 --> 01:28:20.230
<v Speaker 4>Division One AA schools recruit me in a West Virginia and Maryland and the</v>

3257
01:28:20.231 --> 01:28:21.520
<v Speaker 4>graduation rates were low.</v>

3258
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:22.540
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

3259
01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.051
<v Speaker 4>I knew,</v>

3260
01:28:23.051 --> 01:28:23.261
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3261
01:28:23.261 --> 01:28:24.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to go play professional football.</v>

3262
01:28:24.761 --> 01:28:25.391
<v Speaker 4>I need to go somewhere.</v>

3263
01:28:25.391 --> 01:28:26.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get education.</v>

3264
01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:28.390
<v Speaker 4>And the Naval Academy was free.</v>

3265
01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:29.320
<v Speaker 4>You don't get a full,</v>

3266
01:28:29.321 --> 01:28:31.120
<v Speaker 4>so you don't get a scholarship to an ivy league school.</v>

3267
01:28:31.121 --> 01:28:32.920
<v Speaker 4>So my mom was a home health nurse,</v>

3268
01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.140
<v Speaker 4>isn't gonna be able to afford to send me to Yale,</v>

3269
01:28:35.141 --> 01:28:36.190
<v Speaker 4>even with the financial aid.</v>

3270
01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:41.190
<v Speaker 4>So I went to the Naval Academy and also I've always been a pretty intense guy</v>

3271
01:28:41.921 --> 01:28:44.920
<v Speaker 4>who took things more seriously maybe than they need to be taken.</v>

3272
01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:45.761
<v Speaker 4>And so I thought,</v>

3273
01:28:45.761 --> 01:28:45.941
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3274
01:28:45.941 --> 01:28:48.700
<v Speaker 4>this is a place I'm going to go and I'm going to get along with the people</v>

3275
01:28:48.701 --> 01:28:49.420
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

3276
01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.550
<v Speaker 4>But when I was there initially it was time of peace.</v>

3277
01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:52.780
<v Speaker 4>You graduated,</v>

3278
01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:55.600
<v Speaker 4>you either went in the navy or the Marine Corps and you would deploy,</v>

3279
01:28:55.601 --> 01:28:56.470
<v Speaker 4>you'd go on a boat,</v>

3280
01:28:56.471 --> 01:28:58.900
<v Speaker 4>you'd float around a bunch of cities for six to seven months,</v>

3281
01:28:59.050 --> 01:28:59.920
<v Speaker 4>have a good time,</v>

3282
01:28:59.921 --> 01:29:00.790
<v Speaker 4>then come home,</v>

3283
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.340
<v Speaker 4>then maybe do one more,</v>

3284
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:04.050
<v Speaker 4>then moved to a different duty station.</v>

3285
01:29:04.051 --> 01:29:09.051
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't the same when I was a junior is when nine 11 happened and shit changed</v>

3286
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:10.380
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>

3287
01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 4>It was never the same.</v>

3288
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:12.371
<v Speaker 4>And then the,</v>

3289
01:29:12.371 --> 01:29:13.680
<v Speaker 4>the second Iraq war,</v>

3290
01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:15.030
<v Speaker 4>it actually started when I was a senior.</v>

3291
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:17.820
<v Speaker 4>So I had friends that were in the,</v>

3292
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:18.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3293
01:29:18.301 --> 01:29:21.510
<v Speaker 4>initial wave and the second Iraq war that I played football with.</v>

3294
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:22.291
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3295
01:29:22.291 --> 01:29:22.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3296
01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 4>before I'd even graduated.</v>

3297
01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:27.300
<v Speaker 4>So you didn't necessarily sign up to go to war,</v>

3298
01:29:27.301 --> 01:29:30.870
<v Speaker 4>you signed up because you felt like those were people that you would relate to</v>

3299
01:29:30.871 --> 01:29:31.440
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

3300
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:31.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3301
01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:32.281
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

3302
01:29:32.281 --> 01:29:35.730
<v Speaker 4>at the same time I bought into the whole package,</v>

3303
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3304
01:29:36.001 --> 01:29:37.320
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to serve my country.</v>

3305
01:29:37.321 --> 01:29:37.801
<v Speaker 4>I knew,</v>

3306
01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:38.101
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3307
01:29:38.101 --> 01:29:38.934
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3308
01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:39.773
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3309
01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 4>inside I felt like I was a warrior at the time and this is where I belong and</v>

3310
01:29:44.731 --> 01:29:45.564
<v Speaker 4>this is where,</v>

3311
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:46.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3312
01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:46.990
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

3313
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:50.460
<v Speaker 4>my leadership skills can be honed and I can develop and this is where I should</v>

3314
01:29:50.461 --> 01:29:51.030
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

3315
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:52.200
<v Speaker 4>When the war started,</v>

3316
01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:52.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3317
01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:54.510
<v Speaker 4>I could have easily chosen to go,</v>

3318
01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:55.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3319
01:29:55.471 --> 01:29:58.260
<v Speaker 4>I could have gone surface warfare and been on a boat and been pretty much away</v>

3320
01:29:58.261 --> 01:29:58.711
<v Speaker 4>from the fight.</v>

3321
01:29:58.711 --> 01:29:58.831
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3322
01:29:58.831 --> 01:30:00.000
<v Speaker 4>I chose to go marine corps,</v>

3323
01:30:00.001 --> 01:30:01.320
<v Speaker 4>chose to go infantry,</v>

3324
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3325
01:30:01.861 --> 01:30:04.710
<v Speaker 4>and chose to be there where I already had friends that were there.</v>

3326
01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:04.891
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3327
01:30:04.891 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 4>there was no way I wasn't going to be a guy who served at that time.</v>

3328
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:12.360
<v Speaker 4>What was it that drew you into doing infantry?</v>

3329
01:30:12.361 --> 01:30:13.194
<v Speaker 4>What was it like?</v>

3330
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.620
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

3331
01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:14.670
<v Speaker 4>when you decided,</v>

3332
01:30:14.671 --> 01:30:16.470
<v Speaker 4>when you made that commitment,</v>

3333
01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:17.551
<v Speaker 4>like what was,</v>

3334
01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:18.540
<v Speaker 4>what was on your mind?</v>

3335
01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3336
01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:20.820
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't see any other choice.</v>

3337
01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:21.121
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3338
01:30:21.121 --> 01:30:23.580
<v Speaker 4>I would feel guilty had I not,</v>

3339
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:24.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3340
01:30:24.121 --> 01:30:26.940
<v Speaker 4>before I had ever even gone infantry officer school,</v>

3341
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.631
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3342
01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Ronnie Winchester who played offensive tackle first when I was a sophomore,</v>

3343
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.153
<v Speaker 4>he was killed.</v>

3344
01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.360
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3345
01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.910
<v Speaker 4>and then while I was in infant officer course,</v>

3346
01:30:35.911 --> 01:30:36.750
<v Speaker 4>a guy at graduate,</v>

3347
01:30:36.751 --> 01:30:37.561
<v Speaker 4>JP blacksmith,</v>

3348
01:30:37.561 --> 01:30:38.580
<v Speaker 4>he was killed in Fallujah.</v>

3349
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:39.121
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3350
01:30:39.121 --> 01:30:39.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3351
01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:44.130
<v Speaker 4>there was a time period there for several years where when guys call that we</v>

3352
01:30:44.131 --> 01:30:45.060
<v Speaker 4>hadn't heard from in a while,</v>

3353
01:30:45.061 --> 01:30:46.320
<v Speaker 4>we almost didn't want to pick up the phone.</v>

3354
01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:47.071
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3355
01:30:47.071 --> 01:30:47.260
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

3356
01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:48.210
<v Speaker 4>it was really,</v>

3357
01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:50.100
<v Speaker 4>it was a really difficult time.</v>

3358
01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:51.293
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3359
01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:51.811
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3360
01:30:51.811 --> 01:30:52.500
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

3361
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.190
<v Speaker 4>that's war.</v>

3362
01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:53.401
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3363
01:30:53.401 --> 01:30:53.581
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3364
01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:54.414
<v Speaker 4>it's ugly.</v>

3365
01:30:54.690 --> 01:30:55.050
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3366
01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:56.010
<v Speaker 4>it sucks.</v>

3367
01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:56.291
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3368
01:30:56.291 --> 01:30:57.480
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing fun about it.</v>

3369
01:30:57.481 --> 01:30:57.651
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3370
01:30:57.651 --> 01:30:57.811
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3371
01:30:57.811 --> 01:30:58.644
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3372
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:03.600
<v Speaker 4>a pet peeve of mine is a lot of other cultures and even sometimes,</v>

3373
01:31:03.601 --> 01:31:03.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3374
01:31:03.781 --> 01:31:04.614
<v Speaker 4>in our own,</v>

3375
01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:07.530
<v Speaker 4>they make these assumptions about the men and women that go to war.</v>

3376
01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:07.861
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3377
01:31:07.861 --> 01:31:11.280
<v Speaker 4>I actually got asked in inline to a way in when I was in Japan,</v>

3378
01:31:11.281 --> 01:31:13.680
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to name the fighter because I don't want to insult anybody.</v>

3379
01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:15.630
<v Speaker 4>He looks at me and says,</v>

3380
01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:16.471
<v Speaker 4>while we're waiting,</v>

3381
01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:17.304
<v Speaker 4>we're about to go wham.</v>

3382
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:18.241
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3383
01:31:18.241 --> 01:31:18.870
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

3384
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:19.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3385
01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:23.040
<v Speaker 4>how do you justify going to Iraq and just killing generations of people?</v>

3386
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.931
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3387
01:31:24.931 --> 01:31:25.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3388
01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:29.070
<v Speaker 4>I think you're a little misinformed and I'm certainly willing to have that</v>

3389
01:31:29.071 --> 01:31:30.030
<v Speaker 4>discussion with you.</v>

3390
01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.020
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3391
01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:32.670
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think now's the appropriate time.</v>

3392
01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:32.941
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

3393
01:31:32.941 --> 01:31:33.181
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3394
01:31:33.181 --> 01:31:33.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking nosy.</v>

3395
01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:35.310
<v Speaker 4>So that's exact quote.</v>

3396
01:31:35.850 --> 01:31:36.451
<v Speaker 4>I'm nosy.</v>

3397
01:31:36.451 --> 01:31:37.141
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

3398
01:31:37.141 --> 01:31:37.420
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

3399
01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:37.601
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3400
01:31:37.601 --> 01:31:38.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm asking about it.</v>

3401
01:31:39.810 --> 01:31:40.531
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

3402
01:31:40.531 --> 01:31:40.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3403
01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:41.401
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3404
01:31:41.401 --> 01:31:42.330
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

3405
01:31:42.370 --> 01:31:42.560
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3406
01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.910
<v Speaker 4>the happiest moments of,</v>

3407
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:45.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3408
01:31:45.170 --> 01:31:45.811
<v Speaker 4>my specialty,</v>

3409
01:31:45.811 --> 01:31:46.890
<v Speaker 4>my second tour,</v>

3410
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:50.310
<v Speaker 4>there were two schools in our area of operations that never had school because</v>

3411
01:31:50.311 --> 01:31:51.870
<v Speaker 4>if the teachers taught they'd be killed,</v>

3412
01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:55.050
<v Speaker 4>I'll kinda would kill them immediately if they taught those students.</v>

3413
01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:57.060
<v Speaker 4>And this area had never been patrolled before.</v>

3414
01:31:57.061 --> 01:31:58.050
<v Speaker 4>So we started patrolling.</v>

3415
01:31:58.051 --> 01:32:01.630
<v Speaker 4>We started securing it five months into our deployment.</v>

3416
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:06.040
<v Speaker 4>We had the areas so secure that these kids were able to go to school again.</v>

3417
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:08.110
<v Speaker 4>And that was a really proud day.</v>

3418
01:32:08.111 --> 01:32:08.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean it wasn't,</v>

3419
01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.170
<v Speaker 4>it's not what a lot of people think where,</v>

3420
01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:11.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3421
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:15.250
<v Speaker 4>we go over there and all we want to do is kill,</v>

3422
01:32:15.251 --> 01:32:15.491
<v Speaker 4>kill,</v>

3423
01:32:15.491 --> 01:32:16.030
<v Speaker 4>kill.</v>

3424
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:20.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean 90% I mean you don't even see the enemy in these kinds of wars.</v>

3425
01:32:20.890 --> 01:32:21.600
<v Speaker 4>It's snipers.</v>

3426
01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:22.433
<v Speaker 4>It's Ibds,</v>

3427
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:24.160
<v Speaker 4>it's unseen enemies.</v>

3428
01:32:24.161 --> 01:32:27.580
<v Speaker 4>You're walking the streets trying to help these people getting blown up and shot</v>

3429
01:32:27.581 --> 01:32:28.150
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

3430
01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:28.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3431
01:32:28.511 --> 01:32:30.460
<v Speaker 4>where you came and tell where it's coming from.</v>

3432
01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:34.930
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and most of the scenarios and really what we found,</v>

3433
01:32:34.931 --> 01:32:38.230
<v Speaker 4>because the doctrine for this kind of war was never written in the military had</v>

3434
01:32:38.231 --> 01:32:42.160
<v Speaker 4>to adapt to it and we had to create this new counterinsurgency warfare.</v>

3435
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:43.570
<v Speaker 4>The key was the people,</v>

3436
01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:45.850
<v Speaker 4>whoever owned the trust of the people,</v>

3437
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.650
<v Speaker 4>one the conflict because the people,</v>

3438
01:32:47.651 --> 01:32:51.520
<v Speaker 4>if they trusted you would then give you the Intel necessary to find out where</v>

3439
01:32:51.521 --> 01:32:54.190
<v Speaker 4>I'll kite is coming in from and who they're influencing,</v>

3440
01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:54.971
<v Speaker 4>who they're using,</v>

3441
01:32:54.971 --> 01:32:56.650
<v Speaker 4>their who their informants are,</v>

3442
01:32:56.770 --> 01:32:57.471
<v Speaker 4>how to catch them,</v>

3443
01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:58.570
<v Speaker 4>what time you can catch him,</v>

3444
01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.010
<v Speaker 4>and that was the main factor.</v>

3445
01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:01.780
<v Speaker 4>By month six over there,</v>

3446
01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:05.110
<v Speaker 4>we were literally getting names and full descriptions of who was coming in and</v>

3447
01:33:05.111 --> 01:33:06.910
<v Speaker 4>we had snatched up 30 guys in a month.</v>

3448
01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:07.571
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3449
01:33:07.571 --> 01:33:10.960
<v Speaker 4>it was because the people at that point trusted us and believed,</v>

3450
01:33:10.961 --> 01:33:11.081
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3451
01:33:11.081 --> 01:33:11.720
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

3452
01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.000
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3453
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:12.191
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3454
01:33:12.191 --> 01:33:13.210
<v Speaker 4>these guys are helping us.</v>

3455
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.710
<v Speaker 4>They're injecting money into our economy,</v>

3456
01:33:14.711 --> 01:33:16.030
<v Speaker 4>helping us reopen the shops.</v>

3457
01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 4>They're securing the school so the kids can go to school.</v>

3458
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:19.780
<v Speaker 4>They're helping to clean up the garbage.</v>

3459
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.220
<v Speaker 4>They're really here to help.</v>

3460
01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:22.810
<v Speaker 4>And that's what made the biggest difference.</v>

3461
01:33:22.811 --> 01:33:24.820
<v Speaker 4>It was more shaking hands than it ever was,</v>

3462
01:33:24.821 --> 01:33:25.654
<v Speaker 4>pulling triggers,</v>

3463
01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.940
<v Speaker 4>yet I can't tell you how many comments,</v>

3464
01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:28.511
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3465
01:33:28.511 --> 01:33:29.800
<v Speaker 4>the biggest hatred all received,</v>

3466
01:33:29.801 --> 01:33:33.280
<v Speaker 4>both social media and even just in the fight world in general,</v>

3467
01:33:33.281 --> 01:33:34.700
<v Speaker 4>from mostly foreign culture,</v>

3468
01:33:34.701 --> 01:33:35.341
<v Speaker 4>sometimes even ours.</v>

3469
01:33:35.341 --> 01:33:37.420
<v Speaker 4>And America is all get called a murderer.</v>

3470
01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:38.081
<v Speaker 4>And look,</v>

3471
01:33:38.081 --> 01:33:38.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3472
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:40.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't take it personally because I know the truth.</v>

3473
01:33:40.241 --> 01:33:41.290
<v Speaker 4>Obviously I'm secure in that,</v>

3474
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:44.050
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of misinformation out there.</v>

3475
01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:45.181
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3476
01:33:45.181 --> 01:33:45.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3477
01:33:45.810 --> 01:33:48.540
<v Speaker 2>that's the main representation,</v>

3478
01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:49.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3479
01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:49.850
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3480
01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:53.190
<v Speaker 2>of people that go to war is that you're over there.</v>

3481
01:33:53.191 --> 01:33:54.600
<v Speaker 2>You're invading this country.</v>

3482
01:33:55.170 --> 01:33:57.500
<v Speaker 2>You never hear that you're,</v>

3483
01:33:57.501 --> 01:34:01.200
<v Speaker 2>you're getting the support of the people and that that's how you win those</v>

3484
01:34:01.201 --> 01:34:01.770
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

3485
01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:03.030
<v Speaker 2>That's how you win those battles.</v>

3486
01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:03.370
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3487
01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:06.000
<v Speaker 2>you always hear like we're invading in this country.</v>

3488
01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.380
<v Speaker 2>They don't want us there.</v>

3489
01:34:07.890 --> 01:34:09.990
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with a Muslim country.</v>

3490
01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:11.540
<v Speaker 2>But even in these is consciousness.</v>

3491
01:34:11.670 --> 01:34:12.870
<v Speaker 2>These Islamic countries,</v>

3492
01:34:13.050 --> 01:34:18.050
<v Speaker 2>these people that practice the Islamic religion are still against these radical</v>

3493
01:34:18.810 --> 01:34:22.950
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist people that are throwing acid in the face of the children that</v>

3494
01:34:22.951 --> 01:34:26.880
<v Speaker 2>are trying to go to school and trying to keep women from driving cars and all</v>

3495
01:34:26.881 --> 01:34:28.830
<v Speaker 2>the crazy shit that we keep hearing about.</v>

3496
01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:33.630
<v Speaker 2>So how much conflict is there like inter religion conflict?</v>

3497
01:34:33.631 --> 01:34:35.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems like it must be,</v>

3498
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:40.800
<v Speaker 2>it must be very difficult for these people in this as Islamic country to take</v>

3499
01:34:40.801 --> 01:34:43.770
<v Speaker 2>trust in these soldiers that come over from America.</v>

3500
01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:45.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh absolutely.</v>

3501
01:34:45.541 --> 01:34:48.120
<v Speaker 4>Especially when you first get there and you go to an area that's never been</v>

3502
01:34:48.121 --> 01:34:48.954
<v Speaker 4>patrol before,</v>

3503
01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:49.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3504
01:34:49.621 --> 01:34:49.741
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3505
01:34:49.741 --> 01:34:50.574
<v Speaker 4>in any,</v>

3506
01:34:50.730 --> 01:34:51.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3507
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:52.710
<v Speaker 4>any screw up that takes place.</v>

3508
01:34:52.711 --> 01:34:52.951
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3509
01:34:52.951 --> 01:34:53.221
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

3510
01:34:53.221 --> 01:34:53.850
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

3511
01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:54.331
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

3512
01:34:54.331 --> 01:34:55.164
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3513
01:34:55.290 --> 01:34:58.550
<v Speaker 4>if something happens and there is collateral damage,</v>

3514
01:34:58.551 --> 01:35:00.140
<v Speaker 4>if there you do get into a firefight,</v>

3515
01:35:00.141 --> 01:35:03.500
<v Speaker 4>the enemy only attacks you when you're surrounded by civilians.</v>

3516
01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 4>And so if something bad does happen,</v>

3517
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:06.890
<v Speaker 4>it will set you back.</v>

3518
01:35:07.130 --> 01:35:07.611
<v Speaker 4>Weeks,</v>

3519
01:35:07.611 --> 01:35:10.580
<v Speaker 4>months could even be years in the conflict.</v>

3520
01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:11.930
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

3521
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 4>and that goes against the maybe the 350 positive things that that took place at</v>

3522
01:35:16.851 --> 01:35:17.570
<v Speaker 4>that time.</v>

3523
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 4>But there were a lot of people,</v>

3524
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:20.091
<v Speaker 4>at least,</v>

3525
01:35:20.091 --> 01:35:20.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3526
01:35:20.271 --> 01:35:23.360
<v Speaker 4>I can speak from my perspective and the two area of operations I operate in,</v>

3527
01:35:23.361 --> 01:35:25.970
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of people that wanted us to be there.</v>

3528
01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:29.480
<v Speaker 4>There were a lot of people that had smartphones in a lot of people that saw how</v>

3529
01:35:29.481 --> 01:35:31.280
<v Speaker 4>people live in other civilizations.</v>

3530
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:33.800
<v Speaker 4>And we're fed up with having corrupt governments,</v>

3531
01:35:34.190 --> 01:35:34.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3532
01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:34.731
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3533
01:35:34.731 --> 01:35:38.180
<v Speaker 4>that word that we're basically taking from them at all times and using them as</v>

3534
01:35:38.181 --> 01:35:40.880
<v Speaker 4>pawns and they wanted to live that kind of life.</v>

3535
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:44.750
<v Speaker 4>And they get angry when these extremist groups set back their religion.</v>

3536
01:35:44.970 --> 01:35:45.181
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3537
01:35:45.181 --> 01:35:46.610
<v Speaker 4>and even just their culture,</v>

3538
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.971
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3539
01:35:46.971 --> 01:35:48.860
<v Speaker 4>when you see something like what happened in Paris,</v>

3540
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.261
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3541
01:35:49.261 --> 01:35:50.094
<v Speaker 4>we talked about that,</v>

3542
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:51.890
<v Speaker 4>that's going to bring back everybody saying,</v>

3543
01:35:51.891 --> 01:35:52.071
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3544
01:35:52.071 --> 01:35:52.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3545
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:53.271
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3546
01:35:53.271 --> 01:35:56.600
<v Speaker 4>the entire Islam religion is completely evil.</v>

3547
01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:56.931
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3548
01:35:56.931 --> 01:35:59.400
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get bill Maher out there saying it again and again.</v>

3549
01:35:59.401 --> 01:36:00.230
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

3550
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:03.950
<v Speaker 4>there are people in the Muslim religion that don't believe like that.</v>

3551
01:36:03.951 --> 01:36:06.170
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe in that and they're not extremist,</v>

3552
01:36:06.171 --> 01:36:06.770
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3553
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:07.400
<v Speaker 4>it's this,</v>

3554
01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.220
<v Speaker 4>it's this horrible conflict that we're dealing with right now.</v>

3555
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:11.240
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3556
01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.480
<v Speaker 4>and like so many others were not capable of having good open discussion.</v>

3557
01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:17.510
<v Speaker 4>You get someone who believes in this ideology all the way at the far end of the</v>

3558
01:36:17.511 --> 01:36:18.140
<v Speaker 4>table.</v>

3559
01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:19.940
<v Speaker 4>Then you get the other person who believes is here.</v>

3560
01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:21.020
<v Speaker 4>And for some reason,</v>

3561
01:36:21.021 --> 01:36:22.640
<v Speaker 4>both of them think they're 100% right,</v>

3562
01:36:22.641 --> 01:36:24.710
<v Speaker 4>which is absolute insanity.</v>

3563
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:25.491
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3564
01:36:25.491 --> 01:36:27.680
<v Speaker 4>what argument have you ever been in where you're 100% right?</v>

3565
01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:28.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3566
01:36:28.151 --> 01:36:28.451
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3567
01:36:28.451 --> 01:36:31.330
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to something like religion,</v>

3568
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:31.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3569
01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:34.960
<v Speaker 2>and the Islamic religion in general,</v>

3570
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:38.800
<v Speaker 2>it's such as such an old religion and it's got so many,</v>

3571
01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.800
<v Speaker 2>when you look at so many interpretations.</v>

3572
01:36:42.090 --> 01:36:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3573
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:43.263
<v Speaker 2>The look at,</v>

3574
01:36:43.450 --> 01:36:44.141
<v Speaker 2>you look at the,</v>

3575
01:36:44.141 --> 01:36:44.381
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3576
01:36:44.381 --> 01:36:49.381
<v Speaker 2>the Koran and you look at all the various things that people fight for and</v>

3577
01:36:49.871 --> 01:36:50.860
<v Speaker 2>people that believe,</v>

3578
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3579
01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.570
<v Speaker 2>just our doctrine.</v>

3580
01:36:52.571 --> 01:36:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3581
01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3582
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:53.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3583
01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.540
<v Speaker 2>the way women are supposed to be treated,</v>

3584
01:36:55.541 --> 01:36:57.310
<v Speaker 2>the way gays are supposed to be treated,</v>

3585
01:36:57.630 --> 01:36:58.750
<v Speaker 2>that all those things.</v>

3586
01:36:59.130 --> 01:36:59.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3587
01:36:59.381 --> 01:36:59.561
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3588
01:36:59.561 --> 01:37:02.530
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about some shit that's been around for thousands of years and</v>

3589
01:37:02.531 --> 01:37:02.641
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3590
01:37:02.641 --> 01:37:05.710
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to move past that stuff.</v>

3591
01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.030
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard when,</v>

3592
01:37:07.150 --> 01:37:10.270
<v Speaker 2>when that's ingrained in a culture and people are fighting for it and willing to</v>

3593
01:37:10.271 --> 01:37:11.920
<v Speaker 2>die for it as is,</v>

3594
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:15.280
<v Speaker 2>it's so difficult to re restructure that.</v>

3595
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.601
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3596
01:37:15.601 --> 01:37:15.991
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

3597
01:37:15.991 --> 01:37:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

3598
01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:17.790
<v Speaker 4>And yet we still,</v>

3599
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3600
01:37:18.181 --> 01:37:19.260
<v Speaker 4>we continue to try,</v>

3601
01:37:19.261 --> 01:37:19.411
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3602
01:37:19.411 --> 01:37:21.540
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting when you look at history like of Afghanistan,</v>

3603
01:37:21.541 --> 01:37:22.120
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3604
01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.580
<v Speaker 2>but we only try when there's resources there.</v>

3605
01:37:24.670 --> 01:37:24.791
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

3606
01:37:24.791 --> 01:37:26.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's really fucked up.</v>

3607
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're,</v>

3608
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:27.303
<v Speaker 2>we really only,</v>

3609
01:37:27.490 --> 01:37:30.700
<v Speaker 2>we really only get concerned about people's wellbeing when we can make some</v>

3610
01:37:30.701 --> 01:37:31.340
<v Speaker 2>money out of this</v>

3611
01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:32.060
<v Speaker 4>situation there.</v>

3612
01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:33.060
<v Speaker 4>There's gotta be,</v>

3613
01:37:33.061 --> 01:37:33.360
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3614
01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:33.880
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

3615
01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:36.930
<v Speaker 4>There's gotta be some kind of political agenda involved,</v>

3616
01:37:36.931 --> 01:37:37.764
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

3617
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:38.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3618
01:37:38.161 --> 01:37:40.170
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the more frustrating as you see.</v>

3619
01:37:40.171 --> 01:37:40.561
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3620
01:37:40.561 --> 01:37:40.951
<v Speaker 4>One more.</v>

3621
01:37:40.951 --> 01:37:43.740
<v Speaker 4>One of the more frustrating things you see in American politics where I just rip</v>

3622
01:37:43.741 --> 01:37:44.520
<v Speaker 4>my hair out.</v>

3623
01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:48.330
<v Speaker 2>If we found a fucking gigantic plot of oil under North Korea,</v>

3624
01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:49.770
<v Speaker 2>thanks for give very juicy.</v>

3625
01:37:49.771 --> 01:37:50.604
<v Speaker 2>Very quickly.</v>

3626
01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:54.420
<v Speaker 2>If we found out like tomorrow that this fucking hundred trillion dollars with an</v>

3627
01:37:54.421 --> 01:37:55.254
<v Speaker 2>oil in north,</v>

3628
01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.640
<v Speaker 2>this is a very particularly unusually rich mine of oil and be like,</v>

3629
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

3630
01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:02.580
<v Speaker 2>we did cut off their fucking Internet.</v>

3631
01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.320
<v Speaker 2>We'd cut off their electricity.</v>

3632
01:38:04.321 --> 01:38:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean shit would get crazy really quickly if they found out that all the</v>

3633
01:38:08.431 --> 01:38:09.264
<v Speaker 2>worlds,</v>

3634
01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:09.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3635
01:38:09.931 --> 01:38:11.430
<v Speaker 2>resource supplies,</v>

3636
01:38:11.431 --> 01:38:11.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3637
01:38:11.641 --> 01:38:12.960
<v Speaker 2>as far as like natural gas,</v>

3638
01:38:12.961 --> 01:38:13.470
<v Speaker 2>oil,</v>

3639
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:14.640
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck we need was,</v>

3640
01:38:14.641 --> 01:38:15.660
<v Speaker 2>it was in North Korea.</v>

3641
01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:16.260
<v Speaker 2>We could,</v>

3642
01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:17.670
<v Speaker 2>the whole world could live fine.</v>

3643
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:18.680
<v Speaker 2>We'd be there.</v>

3644
01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:18.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3645
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:19.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3646
01:38:19.161 --> 01:38:21.650
<v Speaker 3>and one of the other things though too is that we get the double edge sword</v>

3647
01:38:21.651 --> 01:38:23.390
<v Speaker 3>where if we don't go,</v>

3648
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:24.830
<v Speaker 3>we're criticized when we go,</v>

3649
01:38:24.831 --> 01:38:25.700
<v Speaker 3>we're criticized.</v>

3650
01:38:25.701 --> 01:38:26.331
<v Speaker 3>So I mean we're,</v>

3651
01:38:26.331 --> 01:38:26.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3652
01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:27.573
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3653
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3654
01:38:27.861 --> 01:38:27.981
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3655
01:38:27.981 --> 01:38:31.370
<v Speaker 3>there's always a lot more detailed and we're not privy to all the Intel reports.</v>

3656
01:38:31.371 --> 01:38:31.521
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3657
01:38:31.521 --> 01:38:32.121
<v Speaker 3>when people,</v>

3658
01:38:32.121 --> 01:38:35.450
<v Speaker 3>like when the Syrian rebellion started and people asked,</v>

3659
01:38:35.451 --> 01:38:35.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3660
01:38:35.691 --> 01:38:36.140
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3661
01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:37.310
<v Speaker 3>should we go into Syria?</v>

3662
01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Should we supply them with weapons?</v>

3663
01:38:38.691 --> 01:38:39.680
<v Speaker 3>What should we do?</v>

3664
01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:40.341
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3665
01:38:40.341 --> 01:38:43.370
<v Speaker 3>we're basing our assumptions off what the media tells us,</v>

3666
01:38:43.371 --> 01:38:46.370
<v Speaker 3>which there's so much bullshit wrapped up in that as well.</v>

3667
01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:50.180
<v Speaker 3>We're not privy to all the Intel that people in the Pentagon or getting.</v>

3668
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.871
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3669
01:38:50.871 --> 01:38:53.660
<v Speaker 3>so it's really hard for us to speculate on what we should do.</v>

3670
01:38:53.661 --> 01:38:54.494
<v Speaker 3>But in the end,</v>

3671
01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:57.740
<v Speaker 3>we ended up arming a whole lot of people and,</v>

3672
01:38:58.420 --> 01:38:59.253
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3673
01:38:59.270 --> 01:39:02.480
<v Speaker 3>at least a decent sized portion of those people ended up being isis,</v>

3674
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.381
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3675
01:39:03.381 --> 01:39:04.540
<v Speaker 3>which it's,</v>

3676
01:39:04.541 --> 01:39:04.841
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

3677
01:39:04.841 --> 01:39:05.220
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3678
01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:06.500
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy at the level,</v>

3679
01:39:06.501 --> 01:39:07.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3680
01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.570
<v Speaker 3>where's the accountability in that?</v>

3681
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:08.911
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3682
01:39:08.911 --> 01:39:10.340
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like the,</v>

3683
01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:12.510
<v Speaker 2>you know what you're saying is like that the,</v>

3684
01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:16.980
<v Speaker 2>the average person is not privy to the information that the Pentagon is getting,</v>

3685
01:39:16.981 --> 01:39:18.750
<v Speaker 2>but the Pentagon is not,</v>

3686
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:19.351
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

3687
01:39:19.351 --> 01:39:20.340
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3688
01:39:20.341 --> 01:39:25.290
<v Speaker 2>don't you really have to be there to get like hands on information and who the</v>

3689
01:39:25.291 --> 01:39:29.490
<v Speaker 2>fuck can do that other than the people that are directly interacting with them</v>

3690
01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.400
<v Speaker 2>and they're not dictating policy and what are they doing?</v>

3691
01:39:32.401 --> 01:39:32.491
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3692
01:39:32.491 --> 01:39:33.090
<v Speaker 2>but they're there.</v>

3693
01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:34.320
<v Speaker 2>They're feeding information,</v>

3694
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:35.280
<v Speaker 2>feeding information,</v>

3695
01:39:35.281 --> 01:39:36.360
<v Speaker 2>they're following orders,</v>

3696
01:39:36.361 --> 01:39:37.410
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting battles.</v>

3697
01:39:37.411 --> 01:39:38.490
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3698
01:39:38.491 --> 01:39:41.400
<v Speaker 2>ultimately you got two people that are against each other.</v>

3699
01:39:41.401 --> 01:39:43.110
<v Speaker 2>They don't speak the same fucking language.</v>

3700
01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:43.531
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

3701
01:39:43.531 --> 01:39:44.820
<v Speaker 2>you're in a country that,</v>

3702
01:39:44.821 --> 01:39:45.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3703
01:39:45.181 --> 01:39:48.390
<v Speaker 2>ideally we shouldn't be in the first place and you know,</v>

3704
01:39:48.450 --> 01:39:49.560
<v Speaker 2>people are trying to kill everybody.</v>

3705
01:39:49.561 --> 01:39:52.980
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is fucking crazy and t to be able to try to make sense out of</v>

3706
01:39:52.981 --> 01:39:53.580
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3707
01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:58.230
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that gives me any hope whatsoever is the idea that over time,</v>

3708
01:39:58.530 --> 01:40:01.560
<v Speaker 2>logic and reason and education will work out.</v>

3709
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:03.780
<v Speaker 2>And as long as we're on the right side of all that,</v>

3710
01:40:03.930 --> 01:40:06.490
<v Speaker 2>that with all the blunders and the mistakes and all the,</v>

3711
01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:07.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3712
01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:07.560
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3713
01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:07.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3714
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:08.521
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3715
01:40:08.521 --> 01:40:13.521
<v Speaker 2>the friendly fire and all the civilian casualties that are unfortunate that over</v>

3716
01:40:14.371 --> 01:40:15.001
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

3717
01:40:15.001 --> 01:40:18.210
<v Speaker 2>logic and reason will settle all these issues.</v>

3718
01:40:18.211 --> 01:40:21.810
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't say Shit Shit like that happening today in France.</v>

3719
01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:23.700
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like that's the case.</v>

3720
01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:27.720
<v Speaker 2>It seems like we're going to go birth to grave and live in this fucking crazy</v>

3721
01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:29.690
<v Speaker 2>world of bombs and bullets and,</v>

3722
01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:30.870
<v Speaker 2>and then we're going to,</v>

3723
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:32.590
<v Speaker 2>we're going to end and the,</v>

3724
01:40:32.591 --> 01:40:32.641
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3725
01:40:32.641 --> 01:40:33.720
<v Speaker 2>our generation,</v>

3726
01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:36.840
<v Speaker 2>the next generation is going to have to fucking pick up and carry the ball.</v>

3727
01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:37.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3728
01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.570
<v Speaker 3>And it's going to fuel the argument of,</v>

3729
01:40:38.571 --> 01:40:38.751
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3752
01:40:59.141 --> 01:41:00.760

3753
01:41:00.761 --> 01:41:01.720
<v Speaker 5>that's going to feel the argument of,</v>

01:41:01.721 --> 01:41:02.410
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3755

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3756
01:41:02.711 --> 01:41:06.460
<v Speaker 5>we have to be in these countries to control these things because they hate us so</v>

3757
01:41:06.461 --> 01:41:09.340
<v Speaker 5>much that they're willing to go to extremes that,</v>

3758
01:41:09.341 --> 01:41:10.174
<v Speaker 5>that we're not,</v>

3759

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3760
01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:11.411
<v Speaker 5>Isis,</v>

3761
01:41:11.411 --> 01:41:12.011
<v Speaker 5>Taliban,</v>

3762
01:41:12.011 --> 01:41:12.844
<v Speaker 5>al Qaeda,</v>

3763
01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:15.460
<v Speaker 5>they're never going to stop hating Western civilization.</v>

3764
01:41:15.461 --> 01:41:17.020
<v Speaker 5>They're never going to stop attacking us.</v>

3765
01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:18.190
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3766
01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:18.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3767
01:41:18.581 --> 01:41:18.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Palestine,</v>

3769
01:41:19.481 --> 01:41:21.160
<v Speaker 5>Israel never going to stop going back and forth,</v>

3770
01:41:21.161 --> 01:41:23.380
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the reasons they hate us anyways because of our support of</v>

3771
01:41:23.381 --> 01:41:24.214
<v Speaker 5>Israel as well.</v>

3772
01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:28.030
<v Speaker 5>It is such a complex scenario that,</v>

3773
01:41:28.031 --> 01:41:28.241
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3774
01:41:28.241 --> 01:41:28.401
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3775
01:41:28.401 --> 01:41:32.260
<v Speaker 5>you could discuss it with scholars for hours and hours,</v>

3776
01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:33.010
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3777
01:41:33.010 --> 01:41:35.980
<v Speaker 5>and you wonder when we're going to find a better way to solve these problems.</v>

3778
01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:36.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3779
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.741
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>

3780
01:41:36.741 --> 01:41:37.574
<v Speaker 5>if ever,</v>

3784
01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3785
01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:47.961

<v Speaker 5>they got rid of that asshole.</v>

3789
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:51.730
<v Speaker 5>Libby has way more fucked up now.</v>

3790
01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:52.593
<v Speaker 5>Who's running it?</v>

3791
01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:53.540
<v Speaker 5>We spent,</v>

3792
01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:54.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3793
01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:54.550
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

3794
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:55.091
<v Speaker 5>that's one,</v>

3795
01:41:55.091 --> 01:41:55.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3796
01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:55.751
<v Speaker 5>one of my,</v>

3797
01:41:55.751 --> 01:41:56.051
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3798
01:41:56.051 --> 01:41:57.460
<v Speaker 5>we spend a lot of money,</v>

3799
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:58.630
<v Speaker 5>a lot of money on some,</v>

3800
01:41:58.631 --> 01:41:58.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3801
01:41:58.871 --> 01:42:01.210
<v Speaker 5>and on some really stupid stuff too.</v>

3802
01:42:01.211 --> 01:42:01.601
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he,</v>

3803
01:42:01.601 --> 01:42:02.950
<v Speaker 5>if he had a chance to take a look at,</v>

3804
01:42:02.951 --> 01:42:03.784
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3805
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:04.631
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3806
01:42:04.631 --> 01:42:06.060
<v Speaker 5>what rand Paul was posting.</v>

3807
01:42:06.061 --> 01:42:08.350
<v Speaker 5>He was airing some grievances and he was talking about millions.</v>

3808
01:42:08.351 --> 01:42:09.184
<v Speaker 5>We expend to like,</v>

3809
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.791
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3810
01:42:09.791 --> 01:42:11.290
<v Speaker 5>monitor monkeys throwing,</v>

3811
01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:11.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

3812
01:42:11.770 --> 01:42:12.790
<v Speaker 5>throwing feces.</v>

3813
01:42:12.791 --> 01:42:13.031
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3814
01:42:13.031 --> 01:42:15.730
<v Speaker 5>we're weird things that we actually legitimately did spend money on,</v>

3815
01:42:15.731 --> 01:42:16.870
<v Speaker 5>which is just out of this world.</v>

3816
01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:20.620
<v Speaker 5>But we spent a lot of money on what we did in Libya and we have no,</v>

3817
01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:22.000
<v Speaker 5>does this administration,</v>

3818
01:42:22.001 --> 01:42:23.860
<v Speaker 5>do they have any idea who's in control of that?</v>

3819
01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.230
<v Speaker 5>We did something similar in Egypt too.</v>

3820
01:42:26.231 --> 01:42:26.531
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3821
01:42:26.531 --> 01:42:27.190
<v Speaker 5>it's just the,</v>

3822
01:42:27.190 --> 01:42:27.401
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3823
01:42:27.401 --> 01:42:27.731
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3824
01:42:27.731 --> 01:42:30.070
<v Speaker 5>the accountability and the dollar spent,</v>

3825
01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:31.293
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3826
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:32.830
<v Speaker 5>it's very frustrating.</v>

3827
01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:33.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3828
01:42:33.551 --> 01:42:34.870
<v Speaker 5>And incredibly frustrating.</v>

3829
01:42:34.871 --> 01:42:36.220
<v Speaker 5>And it's also,</v>

3830
01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:41.610
<v Speaker 5>it's hard for people that are in America who live this life of privilege.</v>

3831
01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:47.530
<v Speaker 5>And this easy first world civilization that we have.</v>

3832
01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.340
<v Speaker 5>It's hard for us to even understand that there's these things going on in these</v>

3833
01:42:51.341 --> 01:42:52.360
<v Speaker 5>other countries.</v>

3834
01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:54.010
<v Speaker 5>We see it on television,</v>

3835
01:42:54.190 --> 01:42:55.690
<v Speaker 5>we read about it in the news,</v>

3836
01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.790
<v Speaker 5>but to actually witness it,</v>

3837
01:42:57.820 --> 01:42:58.091
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3838
01:42:58.091 --> 01:43:00.580
<v Speaker 5>it's so difficult for us to,</v>

3839
01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.090
<v Speaker 5>to even comprehend war you.</v>

3840
01:43:04.210 --> 01:43:05.050
<v Speaker 5>You've been there,</v>

3841
01:43:05.170 --> 01:43:05.621
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3842
01:43:05.621 --> 01:43:06.071
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3843
01:43:06.071 --> 01:43:08.440
<v Speaker 5>you've taken part in and you've been there,</v>

3844
01:43:08.441 --> 01:43:10.000
<v Speaker 5>you've been boots on the ground,</v>

3845
01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:11.050
<v Speaker 5>you've experienced it,</v>

3846
01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:11.980
<v Speaker 5>you've lost friends.</v>

3847
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:13.420
<v Speaker 5>Your perspective,</v>

3848
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.850
<v Speaker 5>it must be so difficult to communicate with someone who has this idealistic</v>

3849
01:43:18.851 --> 01:43:20.500
<v Speaker 5>point of view where they've,</v>

3850
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:24.010
<v Speaker 5>they're completely insulated from the reality of what a war actually is.</v>

3851
01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:24.361
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3852
01:43:24.361 --> 01:43:25.390
<v Speaker 5>it's very hard.</v>

3853
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:26.201
<v Speaker 5>It's very hard.</v>

3854
01:43:26.201 --> 01:43:27.310
<v Speaker 5>And at the same time,</v>

3855
01:43:27.311 --> 01:43:29.530
<v Speaker 5>you have to fight against your own,</v>

3856
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:32.740
<v Speaker 5>your own bias because when you do go to war,</v>

3857
01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:33.580
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3858
01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:36.370
<v Speaker 5>of course you want to believe that you were there for all the right reasons.</v>

3859
01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:36.701
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3860
01:43:36.701 --> 01:43:38.680
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to believe in conspiracy theories,</v>

3861
01:43:38.681 --> 01:43:39.514
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

3862
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:40.330
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3863
01:43:40.330 --> 01:43:40.780
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

3864
01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:41.531
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to do.</v>

3865
01:43:41.531 --> 01:43:42.890
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to read all the,</v>

3866
01:43:42.891 --> 01:43:43.181
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3867
01:43:43.181 --> 01:43:43.391
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3868
01:43:43.391 --> 01:43:44.860
<v Speaker 5>now we're seeing lessons learned,</v>

3869
01:43:45.190 --> 01:43:45.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3870
01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:48.090
<v Speaker 5>was the Iraq war complete waste?</v>

3871
01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:48.581
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3872
01:43:48.581 --> 01:43:48.821
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>

3873
01:43:48.821 --> 01:43:50.640
<v Speaker 5>when you saw as we've withdrawed in,</v>

3874
01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 5>in what's place in</v>

3875
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.510
<v Speaker 3>Iraq to,</v>

3876
01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:56.530
<v Speaker 3>to people like me and in all my friends and,</v>

3877
01:43:56.531 --> 01:43:56.691
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3878
01:43:56.691 --> 01:43:56.951
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3879
01:43:56.951 --> 01:43:57.471
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3880
01:43:57.471 --> 01:43:59.900
<v Speaker 3>my generation of military that have gone over there.</v>

3881
01:43:59.901 --> 01:44:04.901
<v Speaker 3>And that's heartbreaking to see it begin to collapse and violence spiked to the</v>

3882
01:44:05.721 --> 01:44:06.810
<v Speaker 3>levels that have,</v>

3883
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:09.860
<v Speaker 3>that have started since isis has been born.</v>

3884
01:44:10.130 --> 01:44:10.641
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

3885
01:44:10.641 --> 01:44:11.061
<v Speaker 3>the argument,</v>

3886
01:44:11.061 --> 01:44:11.181
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3887
01:44:11.181 --> 01:44:13.610
<v Speaker 3>if we never went over in the first place in Isis would never been born,</v>

3888
01:44:13.611 --> 01:44:15.230
<v Speaker 3>but have we never left prematurely,</v>

3889
01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:16.580
<v Speaker 3>they probably wouldn't have been born either.</v>

3890
01:44:16.581 --> 01:44:20.930
<v Speaker 3>There's so many ways you can go with it and everybody wants to be right.</v>

3891
01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:21.831
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3892
01:44:21.831 --> 01:44:25.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody truly has all the information to say exactly what would</v>

3893
01:44:25.321 --> 01:44:26.180
<v Speaker 3>have been the right decision,</v>

3894
01:44:26.181 --> 01:44:28.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's all just really,</v>

3895
01:44:28.131 --> 01:44:28.851
<v Speaker 3>really sad.</v>

3896
01:44:28.851 --> 01:44:28.981
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3897
01:44:28.981 --> 01:44:29.814
<v Speaker 3>and we,</v>

3898
01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:32.900
<v Speaker 3>we elect people to make these decisions for us.</v>

3899
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:34.430
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3900
01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:35.293
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3901
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:38.060
<v Speaker 3>I can't say that I feel comfortable with all those people in there.</v>

3902
01:44:38.061 --> 01:44:38.271
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3903
01:44:38.271 --> 01:44:43.271
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the private sector is much more accountable today than the</v>

3904
01:44:44.991 --> 01:44:45.824
<v Speaker 3>government sector.</v>

3905
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:46.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3906
01:44:46.161 --> 01:44:47.870
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to get fire in the private sector.</v>

3907
01:44:47.871 --> 01:44:50.100
<v Speaker 3>You either deliver towards the bottom line or you don't,</v>

3908
01:44:50.101 --> 01:44:52.460
<v Speaker 3>and you go away in the public sector,</v>

3909
01:44:52.670 --> 01:44:56.120
<v Speaker 3>you can do all kinds of stuff and still get reelected.</v>

3910
01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3911
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:57.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3912
01:44:57.241 --> 01:45:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Marion Barry came back as the mayor of Washington DC after he got caught smoking</v>

3913
01:45:01.951 --> 01:45:02.311
<v Speaker 2>crack,</v>

3914
01:45:02.311 --> 01:45:03.270
<v Speaker 2>he came back and won.</v>

3915
01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:05.760
<v Speaker 2>That's an extreme example obviously,</v>

3916
01:45:05.761 --> 01:45:06.690
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

3917
01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:09.900
<v Speaker 2>the shit that goes on behind the scenes that we don't know about,</v>

3918
01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.510
<v Speaker 2>and then you compare it to what we do know about,</v>

3919
01:45:12.511 --> 01:45:13.800
<v Speaker 2>you've got a guy like Dick Cheney,</v>

3920
01:45:14.010 --> 01:45:16.480
<v Speaker 2>who was the CEO of Halliburton accompany,</v>

3921
01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:21.060
<v Speaker 2>that's they make their money off of rebuilding shit that he blew up.</v>

3922
01:45:21.330 --> 01:45:24.060
<v Speaker 2>And then he gets into office and he's the fucking vice president.</v>

3923
01:45:24.061 --> 01:45:28.710
<v Speaker 2>And also we're blowing shit up and Halliburton is getting these huge fucking no</v>

3924
01:45:28.711 --> 01:45:29.700
<v Speaker 2>bid contracts.</v>

3925
01:45:29.701 --> 01:45:30.390
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

3926
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:31.830
<v Speaker 2>no one competing against them.</v>

3927
01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:35.250
<v Speaker 2>And they're making billions of dollars rebuilding.</v>

3928
01:45:35.251 --> 01:45:37.290
<v Speaker 2>And if you talk to the people that are involved in the rebuilding,</v>

3929
01:45:37.291 --> 01:45:37.561
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3930
01:45:37.561 --> 01:45:38.040
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3931
01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:42.080
<v Speaker 2>we're just putting fucking water treatment plants and factories in place that we</v>

3932
01:45:42.090 --> 01:45:42.480
<v Speaker 2>don't even,</v>

3933
01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.231
<v Speaker 2>they don't even need,</v>

3934
01:45:43.231 --> 01:45:44.280
<v Speaker 2>they're not even gonna use,</v>

3935
01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:45.930
<v Speaker 2>but we have the contracts to do them.</v>

3936
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.700
<v Speaker 2>So we're building this</v>

3937
01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:48.520
<v Speaker 3>so we could submit it and we can get paid.</v>

3938
01:45:48.521 --> 01:45:49.480
<v Speaker 3>So we get smitten invoice.</v>

3939
01:45:49.481 --> 01:45:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Yet it's,</v>

3940
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:50.743
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3941
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:52.180
<v Speaker 3>it's sad and look,</v>

3942
01:45:52.181 --> 01:45:52.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3943
01:45:52.451 --> 01:45:55.600
<v Speaker 3>people love to point at America at our corruption,</v>

3944
01:45:55.601 --> 01:45:56.321
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3945
01:45:56.321 --> 01:45:56.980
<v Speaker 3>we talked about him.</v>

3946
01:45:56.980 --> 01:45:57.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3947
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:59.620
<v Speaker 3>there's corruption at every single level.</v>

3948
01:45:59.790 --> 01:46:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>

3949
01:46:00.130 --> 01:46:00.841
<v Speaker 3>every single click,</v>

3950
01:46:00.841 --> 01:46:01.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3951
01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.440
<v Speaker 3>when you put money and power on the line does something to a human being,</v>

3952
01:46:06.450 --> 01:46:07.380
<v Speaker 2>especially power.</v>

3953
01:46:07.381 --> 01:46:07.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3954
01:46:07.621 --> 01:46:11.370
<v Speaker 2>that's my argument when all this police brutality shit's going on in everybody's</v>

3955
01:46:11.371 --> 01:46:11.551
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3956
01:46:11.551 --> 01:46:11.791
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3957
01:46:11.791 --> 01:46:11.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3958
01:46:11.941 --> 01:46:13.110
<v Speaker 2>the police need to be accountable.</v>

3959
01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3960
01:46:14.410 --> 01:46:14.640
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

3961
01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:15.510
<v Speaker 2>they absolutely do.</v>

3962
01:46:15.511 --> 01:46:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Here's part of the problem.</v>

3963
01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody is fucking qualified to be a cop.</v>

3964
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:22.110
<v Speaker 2>I think when you're a cop for 2030 years,</v>

3965
01:46:22.111 --> 01:46:25.630
<v Speaker 2>you're dodging bullets and every fucking door you opened up every domestic</v>

3966
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:26.431
<v Speaker 2>dispute.</v>

3967
01:46:26.431 --> 01:46:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Some chick might stab you in the neck for arresting her husband that beat the</v>

3968
01:46:30.061 --> 01:46:30.990
<v Speaker 2>shit out of her.</v>

3969
01:46:31.230 --> 01:46:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3970
01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.450
<v Speaker 2>people are fucking crazy.</v>

3971
01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:37.140
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with worst case scenario almost every day.</v>

3972
01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:39.030
<v Speaker 2>And I think we,</v>

3973
01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:41.100
<v Speaker 2>we want cops to be better at their job.</v>

3974
01:46:41.101 --> 01:46:42.510
<v Speaker 2>We don't want cops to kill people,</v>

3975
01:46:42.511 --> 01:46:47.250
<v Speaker 2>but I really don't know how many people are qualified for that fucking job.</v>

3976
01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:48.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many people can do it.</v>

3977
01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like we</v>

3978
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:53.330
<v Speaker 4>get the same caliber person that goes on to be a doctor that ends up being and</v>

3979
01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.720
<v Speaker 4>going to be a police officer.</v>

3980
01:46:54.721 --> 01:46:55.520
<v Speaker 4>It's a very different,</v>

3981
01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:56.341
<v Speaker 4>it's like you said,</v>

3982
01:46:56.341 --> 01:46:57.930
<v Speaker 4>it's a very difficult job,</v>

3983
01:46:58.350 --> 01:47:00.360
<v Speaker 4>but they're human and we are,</v>

3984
01:47:00.361 --> 01:47:01.470
<v Speaker 4>we are flawed.</v>

3985
01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.041
<v Speaker 4>I mean we are,</v>

3986
01:47:02.041 --> 01:47:04.350
<v Speaker 4>we are all completely flawed and it's uh,</v>

3987
01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:04.891
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3988
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:05.341
<v Speaker 4>I mean that,</v>

3989
01:47:05.341 --> 01:47:06.174
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3990
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:08.610
<v Speaker 4>that's been a frustrating thing,</v>

3991
01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:09.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3992
01:47:09.271 --> 01:47:11.910
<v Speaker 4>in this country where we see this argument and in that goes back to what I</v>

3993
01:47:11.911 --> 01:47:12.750
<v Speaker 4>talked about before.</v>

3994
01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Depending on what news station you go on,</v>

3995
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:17.520
<v Speaker 4>you get one side completely over here.</v>

3996
01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:21.150
<v Speaker 4>Then you get the other side completely over there and nobody willing to really</v>

3997
01:47:21.151 --> 01:47:25.860
<v Speaker 4>discuss this middle area cause both sides make really good points in certain</v>

3998
01:47:25.861 --> 01:47:26.460
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>

3999
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:27.930
<v Speaker 4>but nobody wants to discuss the weight.</v>

4000
01:47:27.931 --> 01:47:28.764
<v Speaker 4>Hey guys,</v>

4001
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:32.190
<v Speaker 4>there is a possibility that both of you guys are right in certain areas and</v>

4002
01:47:32.191 --> 01:47:33.750
<v Speaker 4>maybe if we can come to terms on this,</v>

4003
01:47:33.751 --> 01:47:34.920
<v Speaker 4>we could actually fix the problem.</v>

4004
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.990
<v Speaker 2>I really felt that with Ferguson,</v>

4005
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:37.951
<v Speaker 2>with Ferguson,</v>

4006
01:47:37.951 --> 01:47:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I felt like God damn everybody's digging their line in the sand.</v>

4007
01:47:41.161 --> 01:47:46.161
<v Speaker 2>And there's people on one side that think that the j the killing was unjustified</v>

4008
01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:51.390
<v Speaker 2>and that the cop should have been tried and should go to jail.</v>

4009
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:55.140
<v Speaker 2>But they're unwilling to look at the fact that that guy robbed a fucking</v>

4010
01:47:55.141 --> 01:47:58.530
<v Speaker 2>convenience store moments before he was shot.</v>

4011
01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:01.200
<v Speaker 2>That guy definitely tried to get the gun from the cop.</v>

4012
01:48:01.410 --> 01:48:02.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had,</v>

4013
01:48:02.150 --> 01:48:02.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4014
01:48:02.650 --> 01:48:02.930
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4015
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:06.240
<v Speaker 2>he was shot in his fucking hand that he was trying,</v>

4016
01:48:06.241 --> 01:48:09.360
<v Speaker 2>it was a close range in this cop's car and they're like,</v>

4017
01:48:09.361 --> 01:48:10.021
<v Speaker 2>look at its face.</v>

4018
01:48:10.021 --> 01:48:11.100
<v Speaker 2>The cop was barely hit.</v>

4019
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Now you know as well as,</v>

4020
01:48:12.751 --> 01:48:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I know you could go through a fucking five round fight and look like you were</v>

4021
01:48:16.511 --> 01:48:17.520
<v Speaker 2>not barely hit.</v>

4022
01:48:17.730 --> 01:48:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

4023
01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:22.770
<v Speaker 2>you're getting rocked like sometimes swelling takes hours to show up.</v>

4024
01:48:22.770 --> 01:48:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people don't do,</v>

4025
01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:25.140
<v Speaker 2>they don't swell.</v>

4026
01:48:25.170 --> 01:48:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you get caught clean and there's no mark on.</v>

4027
01:48:27.991 --> 01:48:30.210
<v Speaker 2>You get knocked out cold and you look fine.</v>

4028
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Like this idea that he should have a fucking hatchet wound in his forehead</v>

4029
01:48:34.021 --> 01:48:34.590
<v Speaker 2>before he,</v>

4030
01:48:34.590 --> 01:48:36.300
<v Speaker 2>he's pulling the trigger on this kid.</v>

4031
01:48:36.690 --> 01:48:39.660
<v Speaker 2>Then you look at the other side that says,</v>

4032
01:48:39.661 --> 01:48:40.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4033
01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.180
<v Speaker 2>these are terrible people and the,</v>

4034
01:48:42.181 --> 01:48:42.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4035
01:48:42.481 --> 01:48:44.910
<v Speaker 2>he should have been shot because he was a bad person.</v>

4036
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4037
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:47.700
<v Speaker 2>what would you be like if you grew up in that and absolutely.</v>

4038
01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:50.220
<v Speaker 2>What would you be like if you were that kid and that fucking impoverished</v>

4039
01:48:50.221 --> 01:48:51.720
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood with no hope?</v>

4040
01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:53.730
<v Speaker 2>Everyone around you is doing drugs.</v>

4041
01:48:53.731 --> 01:48:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Everyone around you is involved in crime.</v>

4042
01:48:55.710 --> 01:48:57.360
<v Speaker 2>That's the real fucking problem.</v>

4043
01:48:57.361 --> 01:49:01.230
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is you're wasting the potential of this young human being</v>

4044
01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.970
<v Speaker 2>because he's being forced to develop in this horrible situation that nobody</v>

4045
01:49:05.971 --> 01:49:09.660
<v Speaker 2>seems to have any incentive to go in and try to fix.</v>

4046
01:49:09.810 --> 01:49:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Nobody is talking about going into these neighborhoods and trying to clean them</v>

4047
01:49:13.891 --> 01:49:18.480
<v Speaker 2>up and using massive federal resources and money to try to try to calm these</v>

4048
01:49:18.481 --> 01:49:22.350
<v Speaker 2>fucking places down and try to give these people some hope.</v>

4049
01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Then there's both sides.</v>

4050
01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:24.241
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4051
01:49:24.241 --> 01:49:24.721
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

4052
01:49:24.721 --> 01:49:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Digging their heels in the sand.</v>

4053
01:49:26.261 --> 01:49:26.331
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4054
01:49:26.331 --> 01:49:26.590
<v Speaker 2>And we</v>

4055
01:49:26.590 --> 01:49:29.590
<v Speaker 4>asked these police officers to do an awfully tough job.</v>

4056
01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:29.831
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4057
01:49:29.831 --> 01:49:30.061
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4058
01:49:30.061 --> 01:49:30.610
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

4059
01:49:30.610 --> 01:49:33.580
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to get credit for all the everyday right things they're going</v>

4060
01:49:33.581 --> 01:49:33.851
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>

4061
01:49:33.851 --> 01:49:34.600
<v Speaker 4>but when,</v>

4062
01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:37.660
<v Speaker 4>when it hits the fan and they got to make the really tough decision,</v>

4063
01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:40.090
<v Speaker 4>we scrutinize the living hell out of Oh,</v>

4064
01:49:40.091 --> 01:49:40.540
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

4065
01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:41.710
<v Speaker 4>And it becomes very difficult,</v>

4066
01:49:41.711 --> 01:49:43.000
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't agree more.</v>

4067
01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.200
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4068
01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:44.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4069
01:49:44.770 --> 01:49:45.603
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

4070
01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:46.421
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

4071
01:49:46.421 --> 01:49:46.581
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4072
01:49:46.581 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 4>I to say that I hate</v>

4073
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.870
<v Speaker 5>both political parties equally.</v>

4074
01:49:50.230 --> 01:49:50.860
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4075
01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:51.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4076
01:49:51.191 --> 01:49:51.921
<v Speaker 5>just because of the,</v>

4077
01:49:51.921 --> 01:49:52.041
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4078
01:49:52.041 --> 01:49:52.271
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4079
01:49:52.271 --> 01:49:53.440
<v Speaker 5>the lack of integrity.</v>

4080
01:49:53.650 --> 01:49:57.340
<v Speaker 5>I tend in a lot of areas to lean more towards the conservative side,</v>

4081
01:49:57.341 --> 01:49:58.780
<v Speaker 5>but then there's some areas where,</v>

4082
01:49:58.980 --> 01:49:59.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4083
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.090
<v Speaker 5>I've got completely liberal views as well.</v>

4084
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:02.223
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4085
01:50:02.590 --> 01:50:03.820
<v Speaker 5>but on this one,</v>

4086
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:04.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4087
01:50:04.211 --> 01:50:05.260
<v Speaker 5>when you really look,</v>

4088
01:50:05.261 --> 01:50:05.861
<v Speaker 5>and I've had these,</v>

4089
01:50:05.861 --> 01:50:07.300
<v Speaker 5>these great conversations with,</v>

4090
01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:09.130
<v Speaker 5>with kids who did grow up in neighborhoods like this,</v>

4091
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:12.100
<v Speaker 5>and you try and have these discussions and you look at it and you look at it,</v>

4092
01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:14.980
<v Speaker 5>the one thing that you can look at to say,</v>

4093
01:50:14.981 --> 01:50:15.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4094
01:50:15.610 --> 01:50:17.860
<v Speaker 5>at least one thing that can be the equalizers.</v>

4095
01:50:17.861 --> 01:50:18.694
<v Speaker 5>Education.</v>

4096
01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:19.960
<v Speaker 5>You know where I live in,</v>

4097
01:50:19.961 --> 01:50:20.771
<v Speaker 5>I live in a suburb,</v>

4098
01:50:20.771 --> 01:50:24.850
<v Speaker 5>north Atlanta and in the school districts by where I live are the best in the</v>

4099
01:50:24.851 --> 01:50:25.684
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>

4100
01:50:25.810 --> 01:50:26.111
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

4101
01:50:26.111 --> 01:50:30.220
<v Speaker 5>if I had to send my kids to a South Fulton County,</v>

4102
01:50:30.221 --> 01:50:33.490
<v Speaker 5>which is in south Atlanta to one of those public schools,</v>

4103
01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:35.080
<v Speaker 5>there's no way in hell it's on my daughter's here.</v>

4104
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:36.183
<v Speaker 5>No Way.</v>

4105
01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:37.330
<v Speaker 5>Both public schools,</v>

4106
01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.490
<v Speaker 5>both funded by taxes,</v>

4107
01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:43.540
<v Speaker 5>but the difference is completely different than the one fucked one is a platinum</v>

4108
01:50:43.541 --> 01:50:44.374
<v Speaker 5>level school.</v>

4109
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:45.820
<v Speaker 5>And the other one isn't.</v>

4110
01:50:45.850 --> 01:50:46.301
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4111
01:50:46.301 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Speaker 5>d minus level school.</v>

4112
01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:52.210
<v Speaker 5>And so these kids don't have a choice to which parents they're born or which</v>

4113
01:50:52.211 --> 01:50:53.320
<v Speaker 5>household they're born into.</v>

4114
01:50:53.530 --> 01:50:54.161
<v Speaker 5>Our forced,</v>

4115
01:50:54.161 --> 01:50:54.431
<v Speaker 5>if they,</v>

4116
01:50:54.431 --> 01:50:54.821
<v Speaker 5>if they,</v>

4117
01:50:54.821 --> 01:50:58.690
<v Speaker 5>if they already have parents that were caught in a poverty cycle that don't have</v>

4118
01:50:58.691 --> 01:51:00.820
<v Speaker 5>a whole lot of education and perspectives to their home,</v>

4119
01:51:00.821 --> 01:51:01.690
<v Speaker 5>life isn't great,</v>

4120
01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:04.540
<v Speaker 5>then they go to a school that's not so great and,</v>

4121
01:51:04.770 --> 01:51:06.020
<v Speaker 5>and then you've got the,</v>

4122
01:51:06.021 --> 01:51:08.910
<v Speaker 5>the criminal justice system that can continually just recycles.</v>

4123
01:51:08.911 --> 01:51:09.151
<v Speaker 5>And we,</v>

4124
01:51:09.151 --> 01:51:09.640
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

4125
01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:10.401
<v Speaker 5>we put them in jail,</v>

4126
01:51:10.401 --> 01:51:10.501
<v Speaker 5>ain't,</v>

4127
01:51:10.501 --> 01:51:11.334
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

4128
01:51:11.530 --> 01:51:14.620
<v Speaker 5>it's a situation where the odds are not in their favor.</v>

4129
01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:15.640
<v Speaker 5>And if there's one,</v>

4130
01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:15.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4131
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 5>if there's two things that in this country that we should have with all the</v>

4132
01:51:18.671 --> 01:51:20.620
<v Speaker 5>money we have and that we send overseas,</v>

4133
01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:23.700
<v Speaker 5>I mean one of them should definitely be platinum schools are,</v>

4134
01:51:23.701 --> 01:51:25.180
<v Speaker 5>our schools should be phenomenal.</v>

4135
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:25.601
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4136
01:51:25.601 --> 01:51:26.830
<v Speaker 5>you've got this tenure thing,</v>

4137
01:51:26.831 --> 01:51:29.200
<v Speaker 5>which makes it really hard to fire a bad teacher.</v>

4138
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:29.861
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4139
01:51:29.861 --> 01:51:34.840
<v Speaker 5>the whole system needs to be reformed badly because education could be that</v>

4140
01:51:34.841 --> 01:51:38.350
<v Speaker 5>great equalizer regardless of what ethnicity you are.</v>

4141
01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:41.230
<v Speaker 5>And when you find out how much teachers get paid.</v>

4142
01:51:41.231 --> 01:51:41.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4143
01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:43.750
<v Speaker 5>I know UFC fighters complain about pay.</v>

4144
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:46.000
<v Speaker 5>Find out how much a fucking teacher gets paid.</v>

4145
01:51:46.050 --> 01:51:47.200
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ,</v>

4146
01:51:47.201 --> 01:51:49.090
<v Speaker 5>they're making a teacher salary in one night.</v>

4147
01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:49.570
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4148
01:51:49.570 --> 01:51:50.560
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>

4149
01:51:50.561 --> 01:51:51.970
<v Speaker 5>obviously you can't compare the two,</v>

4150
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:52.380
<v Speaker 5>but you,</v>

4151
01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:52.710
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4152
01:51:52.710 --> 01:51:53.543
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4153
01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:54.910
<v Speaker 5>you have to look at the,</v>

4154
01:51:54.911 --> 01:51:59.911
<v Speaker 5>just the sheer ridiculousness of teacher salaries and the idea that this is,</v>

4155
01:52:00.190 --> 01:52:04.990
<v Speaker 5>these are the people that are supposed to literally teach our children the</v>

4156
01:52:04.991 --> 01:52:08.080
<v Speaker 5>skills they need to get through life successfully.</v>

4157
01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:09.141
<v Speaker 5>And we're,</v>

4158
01:52:09.141 --> 01:52:10.720
<v Speaker 5>we're giving them no incentive.</v>

4159
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:11.111
<v Speaker 5>We're,</v>

4160
01:52:11.111 --> 01:52:16.060
<v Speaker 5>we're asking them to do it almost against their best interest financially.</v>

4161
01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:16.780
<v Speaker 5>We're almost like,</v>

4162
01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:16.991
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

4163
01:52:16.991 --> 01:52:17.824
<v Speaker 5>I know you're smart.</v>

4164
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:19.630
<v Speaker 5>I know you have all this education.</v>

4165
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:23.230
<v Speaker 5>I know he could probably make a lot of money going and working for some company</v>

4166
01:52:23.231 --> 01:52:24.370
<v Speaker 5>that's very profitable.</v>

4167
01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:25.750
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

4168
01:52:25.751 --> 01:52:26.860
<v Speaker 5>you want to be a teacher,</v>

4169
01:52:26.861 --> 01:52:27.211
<v Speaker 5>guess what?</v>

4170
01:52:27.211 --> 01:52:29.440
<v Speaker 5>You're going to make 35 grand a year and you know,</v>

4171
01:52:29.441 --> 01:52:29.860
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna,</v>

4172
01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:32.590
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna have months off and you know,</v>

4173
01:52:32.591 --> 01:52:33.520
<v Speaker 5>while you're in school,</v>

4174
01:52:33.521 --> 01:52:33.821
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4175
01:52:33.821 --> 01:52:36.610
<v Speaker 5>you're going to fucking deal with the dregs of society's children.</v>

4176
01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:41.850
<v Speaker 5>People that you know have all sorts of criminal pasts and all sorts of drug</v>

4177
01:52:41.981 --> 01:52:43.960
<v Speaker 5>problems and violence.</v>

4178
01:52:43.961 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 5>These kids are gonna grow up with violence and you're going to be forced to</v>

4179
01:52:46.371 --> 01:52:48.950
<v Speaker 5>corral them and try to wrangle them in class.</v>

4180
01:52:48.951 --> 01:52:53.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've seen videos of of teachers getting assaulted in classes where you</v>

4181
01:52:53.601 --> 01:52:53.841
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

4182
01:52:53.841 --> 01:52:54.231
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4183
01:52:54.231 --> 01:52:57.200
<v Speaker 5>there was some video or some girl jumped up of receipt,</v>

4184
01:52:57.201 --> 01:52:59.930
<v Speaker 5>started beating the shit out of this teacher and then he just started fighting</v>

4185
01:52:59.931 --> 01:53:03.260
<v Speaker 5>back and then other kids jumped a teacher and it just fucking chaos.</v>

4186
01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.440
<v Speaker 5>Imagine you're doing this for 35 grand a year or whatever the fuck they're</v>

4187
01:53:06.441 --> 01:53:07.274
<v Speaker 5>getting paid.</v>

4188
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.660
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

4189
01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:08.451
<v Speaker 5>my older sister,</v>

4190
01:53:08.451 --> 01:53:09.440
<v Speaker 5>she was a teacher for years.</v>

4191
01:53:09.441 --> 01:53:11.990
<v Speaker 5>She left because that reason she wasn't getting paid very much.</v>

4192
01:53:11.991 --> 01:53:14.600
<v Speaker 5>And then anytime that she had a problem with a student,</v>

4193
01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:16.520
<v Speaker 5>if the parent got involved,</v>

4194
01:53:16.730 --> 01:53:19.730
<v Speaker 5>the administration would normally take the side of the parent and the student</v>

4195
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:21.900
<v Speaker 5>and she wasn't allowed to,</v>

4196
01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:26.480
<v Speaker 5>to actually teach and discipline a child who is putting up their own barriers to</v>

4197
01:53:26.481 --> 01:53:27.171
<v Speaker 5>their education.</v>

4198
01:53:27.171 --> 01:53:29.690
<v Speaker 5>It became very frustrating for you and you're dealing with,</v>

4199
01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:29.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4200
01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:30.950
<v Speaker 5>you deal with a kid,</v>

4201
01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:32.690
<v Speaker 5>get a kid that's 16 years old,</v>

4202
01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:35.480
<v Speaker 5>16 years of conditioning,</v>

4203
01:53:35.481 --> 01:53:36.311
<v Speaker 5>of life,</v>

4204
01:53:36.311 --> 01:53:40.310
<v Speaker 5>of experiences and all the stuff that they're getting from their home.</v>

4205
01:53:40.311 --> 01:53:40.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4206
01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:42.020
<v Speaker 5>you can only guess,</v>

4207
01:53:42.021 --> 01:53:43.400
<v Speaker 5>you can only guess as to what,</v>

4208
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:45.740
<v Speaker 5>what their background is like it's her.</v>

4209
01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:48.410
<v Speaker 5>It's really horrific and a lot of ways that we have.</v>

4210
01:53:49.670 --> 01:53:54.670
<v Speaker 5>The one thing that is just so important is human beings like the developing</v>

4211
01:53:55.821 --> 01:53:56.451
<v Speaker 5>human beings.</v>

4212
01:53:56.451 --> 01:53:57.260
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if you want it,</v>

4213
01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:57.921
<v Speaker 5>I've always said this,</v>

4214
01:53:57.921 --> 01:54:00.410
<v Speaker 5>if you want to have a culture with less losers,</v>

4215
01:54:00.650 --> 01:54:03.920
<v Speaker 5>like wouldn't that be like the best way to keep America strong,</v>

4216
01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:05.600
<v Speaker 5>develop less losers?</v>

4217
01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:05.961
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4218
01:54:05.961 --> 01:54:07.130
<v Speaker 5>where do you develop less losers?</v>

4219
01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:08.540
<v Speaker 5>You fucking go with children.</v>

4220
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:11.210
<v Speaker 5>You try to figure out what's the best way to develop children.</v>

4221
01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:15.320
<v Speaker 5>And it's one of the least the areas where we put the least amount of resources</v>

4222
01:54:15.321 --> 01:54:15.950
<v Speaker 5>in this country.</v>

4223
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:16.581
<v Speaker 5>And when you look at,</v>

4224
01:54:16.581 --> 01:54:16.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4225
01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:19.760
<v Speaker 5>what is it less than 50% of people pay their taxes?</v>

4226
01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:21.140
<v Speaker 5>Is that true at the,</v>

4227
01:54:21.170 --> 01:54:22.140
<v Speaker 5>it's somewhere around that.</v>

4228
01:54:22.370 --> 01:54:23.300
<v Speaker 5>Look up that stat.</v>

4229
01:54:23.301 --> 01:54:24.050
<v Speaker 5>If he can,</v>

4230
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:28.250
<v Speaker 5>but I mean there there's a big percentage of people that don't pay their taxes</v>

4231
01:54:28.251 --> 01:54:29.780
<v Speaker 5>and so you get a lot of people to complain.</v>

4232
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.883
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4233
01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:33.440
<v Speaker 5>guys like I don't even want to know what you pay in taxes.</v>

4234
01:54:33.441 --> 01:54:36.830
<v Speaker 5>I know I pay a lot in taxes and it sucks every time you get to write that check,</v>

4235
01:54:36.831 --> 01:54:38.600
<v Speaker 5>you're paying a ton in taxes.</v>

4236
01:54:38.601 --> 01:54:43.100
<v Speaker 5>But imagine what it's like if you got a lot of people that,</v>

4237
01:54:43.101 --> 01:54:48.101
<v Speaker 5>that vice living off the government are now providing for themselves and paying</v>

4238
01:54:48.201 --> 01:54:49.760
<v Speaker 5>taxes and you know,</v>

4239
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:50.660
<v Speaker 5>it's what you said,</v>

4240
01:54:50.661 --> 01:54:50.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4241
01:54:50.871 --> 01:54:53.240
<v Speaker 5>having a country with less losers and it really,</v>

4242
01:54:53.241 --> 01:54:54.680
<v Speaker 5>the key is education.</v>

4243
01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:55.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4244
01:54:55.341 --> 01:54:57.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't get the,</v>

4245
01:54:57.170 --> 01:55:01.520
<v Speaker 5>I know there's a lot of people that have a gigantic issue when you look it up,</v>

4246
01:55:01.850 --> 01:55:04.640
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people have a gigantic issue with taxes.</v>

4247
01:55:04.641 --> 01:55:04.941
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4248
01:55:04.941 --> 01:55:05.111
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

4249
01:55:05.111 --> 01:55:05.420
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

4250
01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:07.700
<v Speaker 5>my issue is waste and fraud.</v>

4251
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:10.040
<v Speaker 5>My issue is bureaucracy.</v>

4252
01:55:10.041 --> 01:55:14.280
<v Speaker 5>My issue is the amount of people that have jobs and only exist because the,</v>

4253
01:55:14.281 --> 01:55:14.501
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4254
01:55:14.501 --> 01:55:14.601
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4255
01:55:14.601 --> 01:55:18.500
<v Speaker 5>the government is trying to create jobs for these people because this is sort of</v>

4256
01:55:18.501 --> 01:55:20.030
<v Speaker 5>some way to feed into the economy.</v>

4257
01:55:20.031 --> 01:55:20.361
<v Speaker 5>And this is,</v>

4258
01:55:20.361 --> 01:55:22.460
<v Speaker 5>this is a bunch of unnecessary fucking jobs.</v>

4259
01:55:22.670 --> 01:55:26.090
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of laws that shouldn't exist as a bunch of people reinforcing</v>

4260
01:55:26.091 --> 01:55:30.470
<v Speaker 5>those ridiculous jobs and the reinforcing those ridiculous laws and that becomes</v>

4261
01:55:30.471 --> 01:55:30.831
<v Speaker 5>a job.</v>

4262
01:55:30.831 --> 01:55:31.850
<v Speaker 5>It becomes an industry.</v>

4263
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.151
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4264
01:55:32.151 --> 01:55:33.980
<v Speaker 5>the war on drugs is a perfect example of that.</v>

4265
01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:39.130
<v Speaker 5>And I think that if we could figure out a way to utilize taxes in some sort of</v>

4266
01:55:41.271 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 5>an efficient and equitable</v>

4267
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.850
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

4268
01:55:44.850 --> 01:55:46.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for paying taxes.</v>

4269
01:55:46.261 --> 01:55:46.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4270
01:55:46.441 --> 01:55:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I pay him anyway.</v>

4271
01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:49.110
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to not do it.</v>

4272
01:55:49.150 --> 01:55:50.160
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to jail.</v>

4273
01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not Wesley Snipes in it.</v>

4274
01:55:51.901 --> 01:55:54.680
<v Speaker 2>And just trying to avoid taxes and they leave,</v>

4275
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:58.050
<v Speaker 2>walked up Lauren Hill from the fucking food Fujis like she's some sort of a</v>

4276
01:55:58.051 --> 01:55:58.884
<v Speaker 2>threat to the,</v>

4277
01:55:59.010 --> 01:56:00.960
<v Speaker 2>the general piece of our culture.</v>

4278
01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:01.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

4279
01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:01.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4280
01:56:01.801 --> 01:56:02.160
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

4281
01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:03.900
<v Speaker 2>it's 26% is that what it says?</v>

4282
01:56:03.901 --> 01:56:08.901
<v Speaker 2>46% of American households won't pay federal income taxes in 2008 that was 2011.</v>

4283
01:56:09.001 --> 01:56:10.190
<v Speaker 2>It's probably even higher now still.</v>

4284
01:56:10.191 --> 01:56:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4285
01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:11.210
<v Speaker 2>it's still pretty high.</v>

4286
01:56:11.210 --> 01:56:11.480
<v Speaker 4>But it,</v>

4287
01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:11.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4288
01:56:11.761 --> 01:56:13.050
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting you say that because,</v>

4289
01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:14.273
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4290
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4291
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:14.731
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

4292
01:56:14.731 --> 01:56:14.951
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

4293
01:56:14.951 --> 01:56:15.750
<v Speaker 4>when you look at,</v>

4294
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:16.411
<v Speaker 4>at lockup,</v>

4295
01:56:16.411 --> 01:56:21.030
<v Speaker 4>so there's 50 new crime laws on average made a year,</v>

4296
01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:24.300
<v Speaker 4>which is about a total of 4,500 laws,</v>

4297
01:56:24.301 --> 01:56:27.690
<v Speaker 4>which is 2,700 pages of criminal laws.</v>

4298
01:56:28.110 --> 01:56:33.110
<v Speaker 4>And then over 50% of the jail population are over drugs for nonviolent crimes.</v>

4299
01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:37.773
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

4300
01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:38.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4301
01:56:38.341 --> 01:56:38.941
<v Speaker 4>we've got,</v>

4302
01:56:38.941 --> 01:56:39.391
<v Speaker 4>in America,</v>

4303
01:56:39.391 --> 01:56:41.220
<v Speaker 4>we've got 5% of the world's population,</v>

4304
01:56:41.221 --> 01:56:45.690
<v Speaker 4>25% though of the world's prisoners are in American and incredible.</v>

4305
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:49.260
<v Speaker 4>And in 53% of the people that go to jail or beneath the poverty line,</v>

4306
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:57.080
<v Speaker 2>53% are below the poverty line as if you expect people that are just scratching</v>

4307
01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:59.670
<v Speaker 2>by to follow the rules.</v>

4308
01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:00.121
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

4309
01:57:00.121 --> 01:57:01.020
<v Speaker 2>how do you fix that?</v>

4310
01:57:01.210 --> 01:57:01.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4311
01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.491
<v Speaker 4>if you look at what,</v>

4312
01:57:02.491 --> 01:57:02.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4313
01:57:02.881 --> 01:57:04.500
<v Speaker 4>when you look at Brazil for instance,</v>

4314
01:57:04.501 --> 01:57:04.861
<v Speaker 4>where the,</v>

4315
01:57:04.861 --> 01:57:05.160
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4316
01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:05.670
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4317
01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:09.660
<v Speaker 4>we think that there's a gap between the haves and have nots in America.</v>

4318
01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.030
<v Speaker 4>It's enormous in Brazil.</v>

4319
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:13.350
<v Speaker 4>It is enormous.</v>

4320
01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:16.590
<v Speaker 4>And it's funny because when you human beings,</v>

4321
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:17.790
<v Speaker 4>we have ingenuity.</v>

4322
01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:20.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like you talk about we have a drive for discovery,</v>

4323
01:57:20.581 --> 01:57:21.870
<v Speaker 4>we will find a way.</v>

4324
01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:23.161
<v Speaker 4>And when you,</v>

4325
01:57:23.161 --> 01:57:25.530
<v Speaker 4>when you have that poverty trap in certain areas,</v>

4326
01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:26.680
<v Speaker 4>they're going to find a way in,</v>

4327
01:57:26.681 --> 01:57:26.801
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

4328
01:57:26.801 --> 01:57:28.190
<v Speaker 4>in Brazil and some of those novellas,</v>

4329
01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.340
<v Speaker 4>they found a black market illegal way of sustaining life.</v>

4330
01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:32.840
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4331
01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:33.121
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4332
01:57:33.121 --> 01:57:35.040
<v Speaker 4>and it's very difficult there.</v>

4333
01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:35.701
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4334
01:57:35.701 --> 01:57:37.230
<v Speaker 4>were these favelas in the hills?</v>

4335
01:57:37.231 --> 01:57:39.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean those police don't have a whole lot of control over those.</v>

4336
01:57:40.010 --> 01:57:40.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4337
01:57:40.410 --> 01:57:41.280
<v Speaker 4>If any at all.</v>

4338
01:57:41.890 --> 01:57:42.101
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4339
01:57:42.101 --> 01:57:46.240
<v Speaker 2>The favelas is a very fascinating situation where you've got this group of</v>

4340
01:57:46.241 --> 01:57:50.650
<v Speaker 2>people above the people that have money and the people that are in these places</v>

4341
01:57:50.651 --> 01:57:53.830
<v Speaker 2>with this incredible view are the people that are really poor.</v>

4342
01:57:54.010 --> 01:57:54.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4343
01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:56.320
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite of how it is in California.</v>

4344
01:57:56.590 --> 01:58:00.740
<v Speaker 2>The Hollywood hills where all the rich folks live and down on the bottoms were</v>

4345
01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:01.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4346
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:02.200
<v Speaker 2>the regular folks live.</v>

4347
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:04.090
<v Speaker 2>The people that can afford to live in the hills,</v>

4348
01:58:04.091 --> 01:58:07.300
<v Speaker 2>they get that incredible view that people that are down on the ground,</v>

4349
01:58:07.570 --> 01:58:08.860
<v Speaker 2>those are the people that a man,</v>

4350
01:58:08.861 --> 01:58:11.860
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to live up in those hills and the hills.</v>

4351
01:58:11.861 --> 01:58:13.000
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of crazy.</v>

4352
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.781
<v Speaker 2>Just wedged in,</v>

4353
01:58:13.781 --> 01:58:13.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4354
01:58:13.991 --> 01:58:16.240
<v Speaker 2>stacked boxes on top of one another with,</v>

4355
01:58:16.241 --> 01:58:18.190
<v Speaker 2>with just a horrible standard of living.</v>

4356
01:58:18.191 --> 01:58:19.024
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

4357
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.481
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4358
01:58:19.481 --> 01:58:23.540
<v Speaker 2>it makes it really difficult when you look at our criminal justice system and</v>

4359
01:58:23.541 --> 01:58:23.711
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

4360
01:58:23.711 --> 01:58:24.850
<v Speaker 2>in some of those things you talked about.</v>

4361
01:58:24.851 --> 01:58:26.190
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that,</v>

4362
01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:29.380
<v Speaker 2>that I look at too is where you get these career politicians that,</v>

4363
01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:30.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4364
01:58:30.081 --> 01:58:30.411
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4365
01:58:30.411 --> 01:58:32.030
<v Speaker 4>they've got experienced balancing a budget,</v>

4366
01:58:32.031 --> 01:58:33.530
<v Speaker 4>but they've got a staff that kind of looks at it.</v>

4367
01:58:34.190 --> 01:58:34.431
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4368
01:58:34.431 --> 01:58:36.320
<v Speaker 4>my experience coming from the military,</v>

4369
01:58:36.321 --> 01:58:39.950
<v Speaker 4>then over to the private sector in seeing the accountability there.</v>

4370
01:58:40.570 --> 01:58:40.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4371
01:58:40.820 --> 01:58:43.510
<v Speaker 4>if a CFO of a publicly traded company,</v>

4372
01:58:43.810 --> 01:58:47.950
<v Speaker 4>you are scrutinized to the t on every expenditure,</v>

4373
01:58:48.370 --> 01:58:50.020
<v Speaker 4>what that's gonna do to your stock price.</v>

4374
01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:52.390
<v Speaker 4>These are men and women that are very,</v>

4375
01:58:52.391 --> 01:58:57.391
<v Speaker 4>very capable of going into Washington DC in leaning out some of the problems we</v>

4376
01:58:58.121 --> 01:58:58.960
<v Speaker 4>have there.</v>

4377
01:58:58.980 --> 01:59:00.400
<v Speaker 4>They're very capable of doing that,</v>

4378
01:59:00.401 --> 01:59:02.400
<v Speaker 4>but of course they don't want to give up all their,</v>

4379
01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:03.250
<v Speaker 4>their freedoms.</v>

4380
01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:06.250
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to get paid 170 k year because they're making a heck of a lot</v>

4381
01:59:06.251 --> 01:59:06.971
<v Speaker 4>more than that with this,</v>

4382
01:59:06.971 --> 01:59:08.470
<v Speaker 4>this publicly traded company too,</v>

4383
01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:12.730
<v Speaker 4>but to go be a politician of every little bit of their life scrutinize like,</v>

4384
01:59:12.731 --> 01:59:12.941
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

4385
01:59:12.941 --> 01:59:14.740
<v Speaker 4>this lady back in high school did this.</v>

4386
01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:19.150
<v Speaker 4>That deters a lot of these really brilliant people in the private sector from</v>

4387
01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:21.490
<v Speaker 4>going and running for office where you don't,</v>

4388
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:25.630
<v Speaker 4>they may be a lot more capable than his career long politician who got an office</v>

4389
01:59:25.631 --> 01:59:30.460
<v Speaker 4>when they were 32 years old and has been in public office since.</v>

4390
01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:30.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4391
01:59:30.931 --> 01:59:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it kind of a crazy situation we find ourselves in,</v>

4392
01:59:34.050 --> 01:59:39.050
<v Speaker 2>especially today with social media and the Internet and the accountability that</v>

4393
01:59:40.291 --> 01:59:43.300
<v Speaker 2>these people have about their private lives is the only people that were going</v>

4394
01:59:43.301 --> 01:59:47.790
<v Speaker 2>to get to run for office are people that no one can fucking relate to cause</v>

4395
01:59:47.791 --> 01:59:49.260
<v Speaker 2>they've never taken any chances.</v>

4396
01:59:49.410 --> 01:59:50.790
<v Speaker 2>They never done anything fucked up.</v>

4397
01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:54.000
<v Speaker 2>They never had a fucking orgy that never done coke.</v>

4398
01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:55.530
<v Speaker 2>They've never done anything stupid.</v>

4399
01:59:55.531 --> 01:59:55.981
<v Speaker 2>They never,</v>

4400
01:59:55.981 --> 01:59:56.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4401
01:59:56.430 --> 02:00:01.430
<v Speaker 2>they did just everything that they've done that was crazy or fun would</v>

4402
02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:05.040
<v Speaker 2>automatically disqualify them for the job.</v>

4403
02:00:05.041 --> 02:00:07.590
<v Speaker 2>But we can't take into the,</v>

4404
02:00:07.710 --> 02:00:12.710
<v Speaker 2>we can't in our minds rationalize the idea that people make mistakes and through</v>

4405
02:00:14.521 --> 02:00:17.070
<v Speaker 2>those mistakes you build character and you become a better,</v>

4406
02:00:17.770 --> 02:00:18.141
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you,</v>

4407
02:00:18.141 --> 02:00:18.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4408
02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:20.440
<v Speaker 4>I run a company and you know,</v>

4409
02:00:20.441 --> 02:00:23.200
<v Speaker 4>the people that we bring into the company and the company helps veterans get</v>

4410
02:00:23.201 --> 02:00:24.034
<v Speaker 4>jobs and get out.</v>

4411
02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:28.300
<v Speaker 4>One of my prerequisites is I don't want perfect people on staff.</v>

4412
02:00:28.301 --> 02:00:29.320
<v Speaker 4>Not that we're,</v>

4413
02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:32.110
<v Speaker 4>we don't discriminate against them by any means,</v>

4414
02:00:32.111 --> 02:00:34.570
<v Speaker 4>but I like bringing people on my team,</v>

4415
02:00:34.571 --> 02:00:36.160
<v Speaker 4>specifically my leadership team,</v>

4416
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:38.080
<v Speaker 4>who have been down and out before,</v>

4417
02:00:38.290 --> 02:00:42.340
<v Speaker 4>who have had to dig themselves back up and overcome adversity because when</v>

4418
02:00:42.341 --> 02:00:43.061
<v Speaker 4>things go bad,</v>

4419
02:00:43.061 --> 02:00:43.691
<v Speaker 4>they don't panic.</v>

4420
02:00:43.691 --> 02:00:46.960
<v Speaker 4>You know how they're gonna respond already because they've been through things</v>

4421
02:00:46.961 --> 02:00:49.000
<v Speaker 4>in their life before where it's been very difficult.</v>

4422
02:00:49.001 --> 02:00:52.510
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the values that we pitched to companies on hiring more veterans is,</v>

4423
02:00:52.511 --> 02:00:53.110
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

4424
02:00:53.110 --> 02:00:55.360
<v Speaker 4>you're going to hire these folks when there's a bad day at work.</v>

4425
02:00:55.361 --> 02:00:57.310
<v Speaker 4>Sales are down or somebody didn't show up for work.</v>

4426
02:00:57.640 --> 02:00:58.810
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to panic about it.</v>

4427
02:00:58.811 --> 02:00:58.961
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

4428
02:00:58.961 --> 02:00:59.141
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4429
02:00:59.141 --> 02:00:59.410
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

4430
02:00:59.410 --> 02:01:00.580
<v Speaker 4>that's small to them.</v>

4431
02:01:00.581 --> 02:01:01.450
<v Speaker 4>This is minor.</v>

4432
02:01:01.810 --> 02:01:02.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4433
02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:03.490
<v Speaker 4>that's a very good point.</v>

4434
02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:03.971
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4435
02:01:03.971 --> 02:01:04.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4436
02:01:04.301 --> 02:01:06.610
<v Speaker 4>those are the people that I want on my team.</v>

4437
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:08.080
<v Speaker 4>Same thing in political office.</v>

4438
02:01:08.081 --> 02:01:08.261
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4439
02:01:08.261 --> 02:01:09.370
<v Speaker 4>you get all these perfect people,</v>

4440
02:01:09.371 --> 02:01:12.160
<v Speaker 4>then you throw them into DC where then they start having orgies.</v>

4441
02:01:12.370 --> 02:01:14.080
<v Speaker 4>That's when they start going a little crazy.</v>

4442
02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:15.550
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4443
02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:18.780
<v Speaker 4>they have a contained for so long and you get the Anthony Wiener's up there.</v>

4444
02:01:18.850 --> 02:01:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Well this fucking shit that's going on with Clinton.</v>

4445
02:01:21.251 --> 02:01:21.581
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4446
02:01:21.581 --> 02:01:21.851
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4447
02:01:21.851 --> 02:01:24.250
<v Speaker 2>this thing that this guy who,</v>

4448
02:01:24.251 --> 02:01:24.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4449
02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:28.660
<v Speaker 2>had an island and essentially had these underage sex slaves.</v>

4450
02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about this whole thing?</v>

4451
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4452
02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I went and visited this island.</v>

4453
02:01:32.230 --> 02:01:32.531
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4454
02:01:32.531 --> 02:01:33.281
<v Speaker 2>fucking Christ.</v>

4455
02:01:33.281 --> 02:01:33.941
<v Speaker 2>Google that.</v>

4456
02:01:33.941 --> 02:01:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

4457
02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:35.493
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4458
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:39.070
<v Speaker 4>I got an a ton of heat and social media because I said yesterday,</v>

4459
02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:39.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4460
02:01:39.801 --> 02:01:40.460
<v Speaker 4>the John Jones</v>

4461
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:41.011
<v Speaker 5>thing comes out in,</v>

4462
02:01:41.011 --> 02:01:42.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to get to perform off 70.</v>

4463
02:01:42.141 --> 02:01:42.471
<v Speaker 5>But I said,</v>

4464
02:01:42.471 --> 02:01:42.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4465
02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:43.431
<v Speaker 5>they asked,</v>

4466
02:01:43.431 --> 02:01:43.611
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4467
02:01:43.611 --> 02:01:44.960
<v Speaker 5>will he ever be able to overcome this?</v>

4468
02:01:44.961 --> 02:01:45.201
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

4469
02:01:45.201 --> 02:01:49.460
<v Speaker 5>look in a country where Bill Clinton can do what he did and then become more the</v>

4470
02:01:49.461 --> 02:01:52.070
<v Speaker 5>highest paid public speakers in the hero of his political party.</v>

4471
02:01:52.190 --> 02:01:52.521
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4472
02:01:52.521 --> 02:01:53.780
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones can be forgiven for,</v>

4473
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:54.740
<v Speaker 5>for snorting cocaine.</v>

4474
02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:55.161
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4475
02:01:55.161 --> 02:01:59.230
<v Speaker 5>He said a 27 year old people went nuts and on social media it was all stand can</v>

4476
02:01:59.240 --> 02:01:59.661
<v Speaker 5>pears,</v>

4477
02:01:59.661 --> 02:02:00.830
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones to Bill Clinton.</v>

4478
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:02.421
<v Speaker 5>Well you did.</v>

4479
02:02:02.421 --> 02:02:03.440
<v Speaker 5>But it's correct.</v>

4480
02:02:03.441 --> 02:02:04.400
<v Speaker 5>It's a good comparison.</v>

4481
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:05.360
<v Speaker 5>It's the scenario.</v>

4482
02:02:05.410 --> 02:02:06.470
<v Speaker 5>We'll look at this man,</v>

4483
02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:06.741
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

4484
02:02:06.741 --> 02:02:08.630
<v Speaker 5>this is really fucking crazy.</v>

4485
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:09.270
<v Speaker 5>This.</v>

4486
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:10.103
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4487
02:02:10.190 --> 02:02:13.220
<v Speaker 5>especially if Hillary is running for president right now,</v>

4488
02:02:13.221 --> 02:02:15.980
<v Speaker 5>which apparently it looks like it's going to be Hillary versus Jeb Bush.</v>

4489
02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.061
<v Speaker 5>This guy,</v>

4490
02:02:17.061 --> 02:02:18.410
<v Speaker 5>Jeffrey Epstein,</v>

4491
02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:22.380
<v Speaker 5>was accused of luring underage girls to his,</v>

4492
02:02:22.381 --> 02:02:23.214
<v Speaker 5>he had some,</v>

4493
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:24.163
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>

4494
02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:28.730
<v Speaker 5>some retreat somewhere and Clinton went there several times.</v>

4495
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:32.330
<v Speaker 5>So it's just fucked me.</v>

4496
02:02:32.331 --> 02:02:32.571
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4497
02:02:32.571 --> 02:02:33.860
<v Speaker 5>he's a fucking wild man.</v>

4498
02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:36.080
<v Speaker 5>Bill Clinton was a god damn wild man.</v>

4499
02:02:36.110 --> 02:02:37.550
<v Speaker 5>We know that for a fact.</v>

4500
02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:38.120
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4501
02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:38.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4502
02:02:38.361 --> 02:02:39.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to divulge his name,</v>

4503
02:02:39.741 --> 02:02:43.460
<v Speaker 5>but I spent time with a guy who's worth $2 billion.</v>

4504
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.701
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

4505
02:02:43.701 --> 02:02:48.350
<v Speaker 5>he's one of the most successful CEOs in the country.</v>

4506
02:02:48.351 --> 02:02:48.571
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4507
02:02:48.571 --> 02:02:52.070
<v Speaker 5>and he told me a story where he hung out with Bill Clinton one time when he was</v>

4508
02:02:52.071 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 5>president and,</v>

4509
02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:54.230
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

4510
02:02:54.231 --> 02:02:58.040
<v Speaker 5>they're at some there at some establishment and bill says,</v>

4511
02:02:58.041 --> 02:02:58.520
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4512
02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.290
<v Speaker 5>we should buy those girls down there shots.</v>

4513
02:03:00.291 --> 02:03:01.070
<v Speaker 5>And the guy,</v>

4514
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:02.100
<v Speaker 5>the gentleman I know goes,</v>

4515
02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:04.070
<v Speaker 5>Mr President,</v>

4516
02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:05.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's a good idea.</v>

4517
02:03:05.721 --> 02:03:06.531
<v Speaker 5>If you want to do that,</v>

4518
02:03:06.531 --> 02:03:08.180
<v Speaker 5>let me order them and send them down.</v>

4519
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.781
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

4520
02:03:08.781 --> 02:03:08.931
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4521
02:03:08.931 --> 02:03:09.081
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4522
02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:10.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go ahead and do it.</v>

4523
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:12.380
<v Speaker 5>And he said that his personal security,</v>

4524
02:03:12.381 --> 02:03:15.290
<v Speaker 5>his secret service members used to call Bill Clinton's to call him Elvis.</v>

4525
02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:17.450
<v Speaker 5>That was their code name for him with Elvis.</v>

4526
02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:19.430
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

4527
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:21.290
<v Speaker 5>Who's a wild motherfucker.</v>

4528
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.281
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

4529
02:03:22.281 --> 02:03:23.390
<v Speaker 5>he had that sickness.</v>

4530
02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:24.711
<v Speaker 5>He had it.</v>

4531
02:03:24.711 --> 02:03:26.530
<v Speaker 5>He had a full blown people to,</v>

4532
02:03:26.531 --> 02:03:29.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean his Iq is supposedly off the charts.</v>

4533
02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:31.040
<v Speaker 5>He's one of the brightest guys.</v>

4534
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:32.900
<v Speaker 5>That's why he likes pussy so much.</v>

4535
02:03:32.901 --> 02:03:35.150
<v Speaker 5>He knows Mike Tyson said it best.</v>

4536
02:03:35.151 --> 02:03:35.631
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

4537
02:03:35.631 --> 02:03:37.370
<v Speaker 5>if God may found better than puts,</v>

4538
02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:38.540
<v Speaker 5>he kept it to himself.</v>

4539
02:03:38.570 --> 02:03:38.940
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4540
02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:42.020
<v Speaker 5>I've got a phrase that I use to all married men.</v>

4541
02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:42.913
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4542
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:44.143
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4543
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:45.290
<v Speaker 5>I tell him all the time,</v>

4544
02:03:45.291 --> 02:03:45.591
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

4545
02:03:45.591 --> 02:03:46.220
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

4546
02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:46.491
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4547
02:03:46.491 --> 02:03:48.770
<v Speaker 5>and I tell to a lot of fighters when they're married as well because they</v>

4548
02:03:48.771 --> 02:03:49.281
<v Speaker 5>travel,</v>

4549
02:03:49.281 --> 02:03:50.330
<v Speaker 5>there's gonna be a lot of temptation.</v>

4550
02:03:50.331 --> 02:03:50.601
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

4551
02:03:50.601 --> 02:03:51.434
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

4552
02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:53.750
<v Speaker 5>pussy is undefeated.</v>

4553
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:54.763
<v Speaker 5>It's never like,</v>

4554
02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.050
<v Speaker 5>it's never lost.</v>

4555
02:03:57.051 --> 02:03:58.370
<v Speaker 5>If you go head to head with it,</v>

4556
02:03:58.371 --> 02:03:59.630
<v Speaker 5>you are going to lose.</v>

4557
02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:01.940
<v Speaker 5>And you need to avoid those situations.</v>

4558
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:03.800
<v Speaker 5>You need to avoid those situations.</v>

4559
02:04:03.801 --> 02:04:03.921
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4560
02:04:03.921 --> 02:04:04.671
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

4561
02:04:04.671 --> 02:04:06.950
<v Speaker 5>I've got certain protocols if I go out to call a fight,</v>

4562
02:04:06.951 --> 02:04:07.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4563
02:04:07.251 --> 02:04:07.731
<v Speaker 5>and in a,</v>

4564
02:04:07.731 --> 02:04:07.881
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

4565
02:04:07.881 --> 02:04:08.061
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

4566
02:04:08.061 --> 02:04:08.780
<v Speaker 5>if I'm,</v>

4567
02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:10.880
<v Speaker 5>if I'm going to go out and it's Vegas like last weekend,</v>

4568
02:04:11.210 --> 02:04:11.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4569
02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:14.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to go out and have more than two drinks out in public,</v>

4570
02:04:14.001 --> 02:04:16.220
<v Speaker 5>in an environment where I am not with my wife.</v>

4571
02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:17.840
<v Speaker 5>And then once its second drink is up,</v>

4572
02:04:17.841 --> 02:04:18.561
<v Speaker 5>I'm going back to her.</v>

4573
02:04:18.561 --> 02:04:19.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even gonna,</v>

4574
02:04:19.210 --> 02:04:21.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna put myself in that situation.</v>

4575
02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:21.950
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4576
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:23.300
<v Speaker 5>when you've got a Ferrari at home,</v>

4577
02:04:23.301 --> 02:04:25.880
<v Speaker 5>you don't go out test driving Cadillacs and you know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 5>And so kind of like brings a good car these days.</v>

4579
02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:32.720
<v Speaker 5>CTSV you ever drive one Goddamn hell of an automobile?</v>

4580
02:04:33.170 --> 02:04:34.300
<v Speaker 5>Probably more reliable there.</v>

4581
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:35.450
<v Speaker 5>You're ruining your room.</v>

4582
02:04:36.230 --> 02:04:36.891
<v Speaker 5>I know what you're saying.</v>

4583
02:04:36.891 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm just standing up with Cadillacs.</v>

4584
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:38.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm a car guy.</v>

4585
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.863
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

4586
02:04:39.930 --> 02:04:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

4587
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Canada land,</v>

4588
02:04:41.150 --> 02:04:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Cat Ferrari's,</v>

4589
02:04:42.301 --> 02:04:43.770
<v Speaker 2>a fucking breakdown on the highway.</v>

4590
02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:44.900
<v Speaker 2>That's there.</v>

4591
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:45.780
<v Speaker 2>But either way,</v>

4592
02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:46.860
<v Speaker 2>don't take it on.</v>

4593
02:04:47.130 --> 02:04:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Don't take it on head to head.</v>

4594
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:49.560
<v Speaker 2>Don't go head to head with it.</v>

4595
02:04:49.561 --> 02:04:50.311
<v Speaker 2>You will lose.</v>

4596
02:04:50.311 --> 02:04:51.091
<v Speaker 2>It's never lost.</v>

4597
02:04:51.091 --> 02:04:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4598
02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I like what you're saying up to that point up to the Cadillac Ferrari thing,</v>

4599
02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:56.213
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>

4600
02:04:58.620 --> 02:04:58.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4601
02:04:58.861 --> 02:04:59.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4602
02:04:59.220 --> 02:04:59.461
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4603
02:04:59.461 --> 02:04:59.611
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

4604
02:04:59.611 --> 02:05:00.020
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

4605
02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:03.120
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting fucking thousands of years of DNA.</v>

4606
02:05:03.121 --> 02:05:03.601
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

4607
02:05:03.601 --> 02:05:05.460
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting all the DNA that existed,</v>

4608
02:05:05.461 --> 02:05:10.290
<v Speaker 2>that kept human beings alive when 50% of the babies would die when most people</v>

4609
02:05:10.291 --> 02:05:11.910
<v Speaker 2>never live to be past 30 I mean,</v>

4610
02:05:12.210 --> 02:05:13.170
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting that.</v>

4611
02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean the urge that men have to,</v>

4612
02:05:15.441 --> 02:05:15.770
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

4613
02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:16.830
<v Speaker 2>to procreate,</v>

4614
02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:17.640
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

4615
02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:19.120
<v Speaker 2>that's the reason why there's people,</v>

4616
02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:21.660
<v Speaker 2>we were lazy about procreating,</v>

4617
02:05:21.661 --> 02:05:24.930
<v Speaker 2>about having sex if it's having sex was as all right.</v>

4618
02:05:25.110 --> 02:05:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Nobody would have fucking kids.</v>

4619
02:05:26.770 --> 02:05:27.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4620
02:05:27.150 --> 02:05:28.830
<v Speaker 2>none of them have children and I have children.</v>

4621
02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:33.510
<v Speaker 2>You would never know what a great experience it is to be a father,</v>

4622
02:05:33.511 --> 02:05:34.560
<v Speaker 2>how fantastic it is,</v>

4623
02:05:34.561 --> 02:05:35.580
<v Speaker 2>how enriching it is.</v>

4624
02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:39.660
<v Speaker 2>If you just looked at it from watching some guy and his wife with the kids</v>

4625
02:05:39.661 --> 02:05:42.990
<v Speaker 2>crying at the movie theater or someone at the airport like,</v>

4626
02:05:42.991 --> 02:05:43.824
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

4627
02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:44.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm young.</v>

4628
02:05:44.611 --> 02:05:45.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm single.</v>

4629
02:05:45.301 --> 02:05:46.134
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

4630
02:05:46.290 --> 02:05:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I like waking up when I want without someone yelling at me without some fucking</v>

4631
02:05:50.700 --> 02:05:52.590
<v Speaker 2>kid that I have to clean their diaper.</v>

4632
02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:54.270
<v Speaker 2>But then you have kids you understand like,</v>

4633
02:05:54.300 --> 02:05:54.841
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4634
02:05:54.841 --> 02:05:56.580
<v Speaker 2>this isn't somebody else's kid.</v>

4635
02:05:56.581 --> 02:05:57.540
<v Speaker 2>This is my kid,</v>

4636
02:05:57.720 --> 02:05:58.830
<v Speaker 2>this is a part of me.</v>

4637
02:05:58.831 --> 02:05:59.900
<v Speaker 2>This is love.</v>

4638
02:05:59.910 --> 02:06:01.500
<v Speaker 2>That's indescribable.</v>

4639
02:06:01.501 --> 02:06:06.501
<v Speaker 2>And then it becomes this sort of new level of your life that it's very difficult</v>

4640
02:06:06.661 --> 02:06:09.060
<v Speaker 2>to explain to someone who doesn't have children.</v>

4641
02:06:09.110 --> 02:06:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4642
02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:11.040
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of single friends.</v>

4643
02:06:11.190 --> 02:06:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of comics that are my friends that you know,</v>

4644
02:06:13.951 --> 02:06:14.910
<v Speaker 2>that don't have kids.</v>

4645
02:06:14.911 --> 02:06:15.570
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>

4646
02:06:15.570 --> 02:06:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking willy nilly crazy slinging dick all over the world.</v>

4647
02:06:19.231 --> 02:06:20.310
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking wild men.</v>

4648
02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:22.140
<v Speaker 2>And I tried it.</v>

4649
02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:22.471
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

4650
02:06:22.471 --> 02:06:22.921
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4651
02:06:22.921 --> 02:06:23.021
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4652
02:06:23.021 --> 02:06:23.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4653
02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:23.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4654
02:06:23.491 --> 02:06:24.690
<v Speaker 2>I would hate to have kids.</v>

4655
02:06:24.691 --> 02:06:24.961
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4656
02:06:24.961 --> 02:06:25.171
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4657
02:06:25.171 --> 02:06:26.004
<v Speaker 2>you say that.</v>

4658
02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:27.120
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>

4659
02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:27.630
<v Speaker 3>It's the meat.</v>

4660
02:06:27.630 --> 02:06:27.991
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

4661
02:06:27.991 --> 02:06:28.950
<v Speaker 3>it's the meaning of life.</v>

4662
02:06:29.010 --> 02:06:30.570
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't imagine,</v>

4663
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:31.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4664
02:06:31.081 --> 02:06:35.790
<v Speaker 3>I had my first daughter and it wasn't that long after I'd gotten back from Iraq</v>

4665
02:06:35.791 --> 02:06:36.511
<v Speaker 3>the second time.</v>

4666
02:06:36.511 --> 02:06:38.040
<v Speaker 3>And it was such a powerful,</v>

4667
02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:39.960
<v Speaker 3>one of the most powerful experience in my life.</v>

4668
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:43.380
<v Speaker 3>You go from an environment where you see so much life taken.</v>

4669
02:06:43.890 --> 02:06:46.440
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm sitting in a roommate and I see,</v>

4670
02:06:46.710 --> 02:06:47.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4671
02:06:47.041 --> 02:06:47.850
<v Speaker 3>life given.</v>

4672
02:06:47.850 --> 02:06:48.900
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

4673
02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:52.530
<v Speaker 3>for me at that time I was already thinking about getting out of the military and</v>

4674
02:06:52.531 --> 02:06:55.320
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of guilt inside me for doing that because I was so,</v>

4675
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I was so good at being a marine officer.</v>

4676
02:06:58.471 --> 02:07:00.270
<v Speaker 3>I loved leading marines.</v>

4677
02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:00.541
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4678
02:07:00.541 --> 02:07:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I didn't love going to what I loved leading marines and you feel guilty because</v>

4679
02:07:03.691 --> 02:07:03.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4680
02:07:03.961 --> 02:07:06.390
<v Speaker 3>these guys are going to keep going back and what you should do.</v>

4681
02:07:06.810 --> 02:07:07.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4682
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:09.000
<v Speaker 3>but when my first daughter was born,</v>

4683
02:07:09.001 --> 02:07:11.760
<v Speaker 3>it was just an absolutely life changing experience.</v>

4684
02:07:11.761 --> 02:07:11.941
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4685
02:07:11.941 --> 02:07:12.660
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

4686
02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:14.430
<v Speaker 3>the rest of this is a puppet show.</v>

4687
02:07:14.730 --> 02:07:15.051
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

4688
02:07:15.051 --> 02:07:15.231
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4689
02:07:15.231 --> 02:07:15.361
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4690
02:07:15.361 --> 02:07:18.150
<v Speaker 3>we do all these things that we can get home to where we want to be.</v>

4691
02:07:18.151 --> 02:07:18.984
<v Speaker 3>I can get on my,</v>

4692
02:07:19.190 --> 02:07:23.040
<v Speaker 3>my living room floor and just be with my three daughters and they bring out the</v>

4693
02:07:23.041 --> 02:07:23.761
<v Speaker 3>best side of me.</v>

4694
02:07:23.761 --> 02:07:24.810
<v Speaker 3>They inspire me.</v>

4695
02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:27.180
<v Speaker 3>They're by far my best accomplishment.</v>

4696
02:07:27.181 --> 02:07:27.421
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4697
02:07:27.421 --> 02:07:29.970
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely live for them and you know,</v>

4698
02:07:29.971 --> 02:07:30.181
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4699
02:07:30.181 --> 02:07:30.901
<v Speaker 3>you can relate.</v>

4700
02:07:30.901 --> 02:07:31.051
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4701
02:07:31.051 --> 02:07:34.210
<v Speaker 3>when you sit down and you lay next to a girl that,</v>

4702
02:07:34.211 --> 02:07:35.170
<v Speaker 3>that you may have just had,</v>

4703
02:07:35.171 --> 02:07:35.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4704
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:37.390
<v Speaker 3>a random relations with,</v>

4705
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:40.360
<v Speaker 3>that's nothing like laying down next to your child is a fall asleep and they</v>

4706
02:07:40.361 --> 02:07:41.380
<v Speaker 3>lean over and just tell you,</v>

4707
02:07:41.410 --> 02:07:41.861
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>

4708
02:07:41.861 --> 02:07:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Daddy</v>

4709
02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:43.320
<v Speaker 2>is very different.</v>

4710
02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:44.940
<v Speaker 2>But if the chicks really hot,</v>

4711
02:07:44.941 --> 02:07:45.774
<v Speaker 2>it's still awesome.</v>

4712
02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying if you're not married and the chicks really high,</v>

4713
02:07:49.351 --> 02:07:50.340
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty God damn good,</v>

4714
02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:52.410
<v Speaker 2>especially whatever.</v>

4715
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:53.581
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

4716
02:07:53.581 --> 02:07:54.930
<v Speaker 2>there's just a different level.</v>

4717
02:07:54.931 --> 02:07:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4718
02:07:55.230 --> 02:07:55.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4719
02:07:55.710 --> 02:07:58.620
<v Speaker 2>I visited my daughter at school today and she didn't know we're going to be</v>

4720
02:07:58.621 --> 02:07:59.180
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

4721
02:07:59.180 --> 02:07:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4722
02:07:59.550 --> 02:08:00.383
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

4723
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:02.280
<v Speaker 2>she turns around and sees me,</v>

4724
02:08:02.281 --> 02:08:02.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4725
02:08:02.491 --> 02:08:06.390
<v Speaker 2>she's six and her eyes light up and she runs over and gives me a hug.</v>

4726
02:08:06.391 --> 02:08:11.190
<v Speaker 2>And this is a warm that comes over you that no one will ever understand unless</v>

4727
02:08:11.191 --> 02:08:12.240
<v Speaker 2>you have a kid.</v>

4728
02:08:12.241 --> 02:08:13.074
<v Speaker 2>He just won't,</v>

4729
02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:13.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4730
02:08:13.531 --> 02:08:17.070
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying that it's a better life and I'm not saying that I'm a better</v>

4731
02:08:17.071 --> 02:08:17.904
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

4732
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that everybody has to go out and have a kid cause I hate those</v>

4733
02:08:20.761 --> 02:08:21.211
<v Speaker 2>arguments.</v>

4734
02:08:21.211 --> 02:08:22.860
<v Speaker 2>And I used to hate those arguments when I was single.</v>

4735
02:08:23.010 --> 02:08:23.520
<v Speaker 2>People would say,</v>

4736
02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:24.031
<v Speaker 2>look good.</v>

4737
02:08:24.031 --> 02:08:24.340
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

4738
02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Fucking,</v>

4739
02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:26.430
<v Speaker 2>you're not mature until you have a kid.</v>

4740
02:08:26.431 --> 02:08:26.760
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4741
02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I believe there's a lot of people that don't need to have kids.</v>

4742
02:08:29.670 --> 02:08:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I believe there's a lot of people that they can contribute to this society,</v>

4743
02:08:33.091 --> 02:08:33.751
<v Speaker 2>to this culture,</v>

4744
02:08:33.751 --> 02:08:35.550
<v Speaker 2>to this world without ever procreate.</v>

4745
02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:36.061
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

4746
02:08:36.061 --> 02:08:37.350
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

4747
02:08:37.380 --> 02:08:38.340
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

4748
02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:39.690
<v Speaker 2>For me though,</v>

4749
02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm such a selfish person.</v>

4750
02:08:41.970 --> 02:08:42.151
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4751
02:08:42.151 --> 02:08:43.500
<v Speaker 2>so I shouldn't even say self.</v>

4752
02:08:43.501 --> 02:08:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm so self obsessed with my,</v>

4753
02:08:45.770 --> 02:08:47.060
<v Speaker 2>my own goals and my,</v>

4754
02:08:47.070 --> 02:08:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm always in my head.</v>

4755
02:08:48.510 --> 02:08:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm always concentrating on my thoughts and my emotions.</v>

4756
02:08:51.841 --> 02:08:56.841
<v Speaker 2>That having a child made me rewire it rewired all of my thinking because</v>

4757
02:08:58.710 --> 02:09:00.300
<v Speaker 2>everything I do now,</v>

4758
02:09:00.301 --> 02:09:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I think about my children.</v>

4759
02:09:02.611 --> 02:09:07.170
<v Speaker 2>I think about them as little human beings and I'm responsible for little human</v>

4760
02:09:07.171 --> 02:09:08.004
<v Speaker 2>beings that I,</v>

4761
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:09.510
<v Speaker 2>and I can't do anything too crazy.</v>

4762
02:09:09.511 --> 02:09:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I can't do anything that's going to risk my life.</v>

4763
02:09:11.881 --> 02:09:12.091
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4764
02:09:12.091 --> 02:09:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I have to take care of them.</v>

4765
02:09:13.321 --> 02:09:13.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4766
02:09:13.531 --> 02:09:13.941
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

4767
02:09:13.941 --> 02:09:18.360
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing about that I never used to think or worry about.</v>

4768
02:09:18.690 --> 02:09:18.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4769
02:09:18.901 --> 02:09:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I certainly didn't want to die before,</v>

4770
02:09:21.630 --> 02:09:25.320
<v Speaker 2>but I never used to think about it the way I think about it now because now I</v>

4771
02:09:25.321 --> 02:09:28.770
<v Speaker 2>think about leaving behind my children and that's a horrific idea.</v>

4772
02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:29.531
<v Speaker 3>Powerful.</v>

4773
02:09:29.531 --> 02:09:29.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4774
02:09:29.730 --> 02:09:29.920
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

4775
02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:31.270
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't say it any better.</v>

4776
02:09:31.271 --> 02:09:33.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was at the time I had my first daughter,</v>

4777
02:09:33.731 --> 02:09:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I had zero fears.</v>

4778
02:09:34.961 --> 02:09:35.111
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4779
02:09:35.111 --> 02:09:37.240
<v Speaker 3>I took a lot of risks,</v>

4780
02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:38.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4781
02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:38.240
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

4782
02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:40.480
<v Speaker 3>in my job at that time and did not care.</v>

4783
02:09:40.481 --> 02:09:43.600
<v Speaker 3>Then all of a sudden you have this child and this fear is introduced to your</v>

4784
02:09:43.601 --> 02:09:44.170
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

4785
02:09:44.170 --> 02:09:45.490
<v Speaker 3>Not just about you dying,</v>

4786
02:09:45.491 --> 02:09:46.001
<v Speaker 3>lean behind,</v>

4787
02:09:46.001 --> 02:09:47.830
<v Speaker 3>but what about the child?</v>

4788
02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:48.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4789
02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:49.360
<v Speaker 3>they're going to drive one day,</v>

4790
02:09:49.361 --> 02:09:51.580
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get their heartbroken when day or what happens here.</v>

4791
02:09:51.581 --> 02:09:52.390
<v Speaker 3>He and I had a,</v>

4792
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:56.140
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend of mine who lives right up the block and he,</v>

4793
02:09:56.141 --> 02:09:57.310
<v Speaker 3>his firstborn son,</v>

4794
02:09:57.311 --> 02:10:02.311
<v Speaker 3>11 years old or on a ski trip in Colorado and someone was towing a paraplegic</v>

4795
02:10:02.921 --> 02:10:03.754
<v Speaker 3>down the slope.</v>

4796
02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:04.351
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

4797
02:10:04.351 --> 02:10:06.160
<v Speaker 3>the wire they were using to tow him,</v>

4798
02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:08.560
<v Speaker 3>hit his son in the neck and killed him instantly.</v>

4799
02:10:08.890 --> 02:10:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

4800
02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:10.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

4801
02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:12.910
<v Speaker 3>and it to today to be there for him.</v>

4802
02:10:13.330 --> 02:10:15.100
<v Speaker 3>And not that I was able to do much,</v>

4803
02:10:15.101 --> 02:10:15.371
<v Speaker 3>but to,</v>

4804
02:10:15.371 --> 02:10:17.980
<v Speaker 3>to see him have to recover from that is,</v>

4805
02:10:18.610 --> 02:10:18.911
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4806
02:10:18.911 --> 02:10:19.151
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

4807
02:10:19.151 --> 02:10:20.550
<v Speaker 3>I've been on the battlefield and,</v>

4808
02:10:20.551 --> 02:10:21.550
<v Speaker 3>and I've seen a lot of,</v>

4809
02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:23.740
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things I would never wish on anybody.</v>

4810
02:10:24.010 --> 02:10:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4811
02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:28.180
<v Speaker 3>but losing your own child is just brutal.</v>

4812
02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.073
<v Speaker 3>It's brutal.</v>

4813
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:32.260
<v Speaker 2>It must be indescribable.</v>

4814
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:36.410
<v Speaker 2>What did you know Jeremy Stevens brought this up when he was on a podcast about</v>

4815
02:10:36.411 --> 02:10:38.360
<v Speaker 2>fighters having daughters?</v>

4816
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:39.470
<v Speaker 2>All daughters.</v>

4817
02:10:39.710 --> 02:10:40.700
<v Speaker 2>You've got all daughters.</v>

4818
02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones has all daughters.</v>

4819
02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Mark Coleman has r.</v>

4820
02:10:43.311 --> 02:10:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

4821
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:44.323
<v Speaker 2>All daughters.</v>

4822
02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:46.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is like a long list.</v>

4823
02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Alpha males of these savages that only have daughters is that the universe is</v>

4824
02:10:50.781 --> 02:10:51.920
<v Speaker 2>trying to balance itself out.</v>

4825
02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:52.813
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4826
02:10:53.210 --> 02:10:53.900
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

4827
02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:54.920
<v Speaker 2>There's something with it with,</v>

4828
02:10:54.921 --> 02:10:55.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4829
02:10:55.191 --> 02:10:57.340
<v Speaker 2>your natural testosterone count is so hot.</v>

4830
02:10:57.341 --> 02:10:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4831
02:10:58.060 --> 02:10:58.850
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

4832
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:59.130
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

4833
02:10:59.130 --> 02:11:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I've read different articles about it.</v>

4834
02:11:00.621 --> 02:11:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I remember before I had my third,</v>

4835
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Chris Weidman was trying to give me some tips,</v>

4836
02:11:05.001 --> 02:11:05.101
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4837
02:11:05.101 --> 02:11:06.140
<v Speaker 2>you got to eat this.</v>

4838
02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:07.191
<v Speaker 2>They got to do it.</v>

4839
02:11:07.191 --> 02:11:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Just like that.</v>

4840
02:11:08.121 --> 02:11:08.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4841
02:11:08.301 --> 02:11:08.600
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4842
02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:12.380
<v Speaker 2>he gave me the play by play and he says that's how he had his boy.</v>

4843
02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:13.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4844
02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:13.100
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4845
02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:13.311
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

4846
02:11:13.311 --> 02:11:14.720
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly how he did it.</v>

4847
02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:15.980
<v Speaker 2>And he followed the steps scenario.</v>

4848
02:11:16.190 --> 02:11:16.641
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

4849
02:11:16.641 --> 02:11:19.100
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't patient enough to put in the amount of time he did.</v>

4850
02:11:19.101 --> 02:11:20.160
<v Speaker 2>And I don't believe it.</v>

4851
02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Dumb luck.</v>

4852
02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:22.101
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

4853
02:11:22.101 --> 02:11:22.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4854
02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:24.110
<v Speaker 2>the fucking Zigzag,</v>

4855
02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:24.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4856
02:11:24.681 --> 02:11:24.911
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4857
02:11:24.911 --> 02:11:27.470
<v Speaker 2>the right fucking sperm gets to the right egg.</v>

4858
02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:28.080
<v Speaker 2>But Bam,</v>

4859
02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:28.881
<v Speaker 2>Jetson millionaire,</v>

4860
02:11:28.881 --> 02:11:31.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any logic or science to it.</v>

4861
02:11:31.371 --> 02:11:32.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of old wives' tales.</v>

4862
02:11:32.650 --> 02:11:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4863
02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:33.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4864
02:11:33.231 --> 02:11:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I go home and I am surrounded by estrogen meets around it.</v>

4865
02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:38.840
<v Speaker 2>It's an incredible,</v>

4866
02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:40.700
<v Speaker 2>it's a weakness.</v>

4867
02:11:40.730 --> 02:11:41.210
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4868
02:11:41.210 --> 02:11:41.721
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get,</v>

4869
02:11:41.721 --> 02:11:42.410
<v Speaker 2>they get you.</v>

4870
02:11:42.410 --> 02:11:43.243
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4871
02:11:43.250 --> 02:11:45.710
<v Speaker 2>I got a bit I'm doing about it in my act right now.</v>

4872
02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:49.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just cause it's so like when you're around a bunch of people who think</v>

4873
02:11:49.071 --> 02:11:50.270
<v Speaker 2>completely different than you,</v>

4874
02:11:50.450 --> 02:11:52.360
<v Speaker 2>you really understand like the,</v>

4875
02:11:52.361 --> 02:11:52.581
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4876
02:11:52.581 --> 02:11:56.150
<v Speaker 2>the troubles that men and women have tried.</v>

4877
02:11:56.210 --> 02:11:57.043
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4878
02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:57.590
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4879
02:11:57.590 --> 02:12:00.200
<v Speaker 2>this thing where we're trying to figure out how to get along together.</v>

4880
02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:00.650
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

4881
02:12:00.650 --> 02:12:00.980
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4882
02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:03.110
<v Speaker 2>you really understand it at a base level.</v>

4883
02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4884
02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh this is like,</v>

4885
02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:06.590
<v Speaker 2>this is like a totally different animal.</v>

4886
02:12:06.710 --> 02:12:11.240
<v Speaker 2>This is like a kangaroo trying to live within Orangutang like you guys are</v>

4887
02:12:11.241 --> 02:12:13.010
<v Speaker 2>fucking w there's so different.</v>

4888
02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:14.630
<v Speaker 2>It's so different.</v>

4889
02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:19.780
<v Speaker 2>And then you have these weird traders that sort of like cross the barrier and</v>

4890
02:12:20.061 --> 02:12:22.460
<v Speaker 2>try to meet in the middle and like mineral assholes.</v>

4891
02:12:22.461 --> 02:12:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm different and they try to like sell themselves internetive to men.</v>

4892
02:12:27.290 --> 02:12:30.830
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile they are men and then your wives are using it as an example in an</v>

4893
02:12:30.831 --> 02:12:34.460
<v Speaker 2>argument with you that that got some fucking creep and then they always get</v>

4894
02:12:34.461 --> 02:12:38.690
<v Speaker 2>caught doing something fucking gross and those get caught raping somebody or</v>

4895
02:12:38.691 --> 02:12:39.080
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

4896
02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:39.410
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

4897
02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:39.711
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4898
02:12:39.711 --> 02:12:40.480
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

4899
02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4900
02:12:40.670 --> 02:12:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Like Bill Cosby,</v>

4901
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:42.650
<v Speaker 2>perfect example.</v>

4902
02:12:42.860 --> 02:12:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Bill Cosby forever was telling Comedians don't tell dirty jokes.</v>

4903
02:12:46.161 --> 02:12:47.480
<v Speaker 2>She never tell dirty jokes.</v>

4904
02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Crushing Eddie Murphy for he was,</v>

4905
02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:50.480
<v Speaker 2>oh and not just Eddie Murphy.</v>

4906
02:12:50.481 --> 02:12:52.190
<v Speaker 2>He did it to v Chris Rock.</v>

4907
02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:56.450
<v Speaker 2>He did it to a host of especially black comedians.</v>

4908
02:12:56.630 --> 02:12:57.463
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

4909
02:12:57.830 --> 02:13:01.200
<v Speaker 2>if the stories are true with 30 women aren't buyers,</v>

4910
02:13:01.550 --> 02:13:03.080
<v Speaker 2>it's getting a little ridiculous,</v>

4911
02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:03.690
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

4912
02:13:03.690 --> 02:13:05.060
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what you find out.</v>

4913
02:13:05.061 --> 02:13:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean Ted Haggard,</v>

4914
02:13:06.410 --> 02:13:11.410
<v Speaker 2>that fucking that preacher who was a always like a railing against gay people</v>

4915
02:13:12.111 --> 02:13:12.820
<v Speaker 2>and against,</v>

4916
02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:13.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4917
02:13:13.190 --> 02:13:15.650
<v Speaker 2>God says that gay men should not be married.</v>

4918
02:13:15.651 --> 02:13:16.411
<v Speaker 2>It's an abomination.</v>

4919
02:13:16.411 --> 02:13:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Me By always doing math and fucking getting gay hookers.</v>

4920
02:13:19.610 --> 02:13:20.630
<v Speaker 2>It's all the same shit.</v>

4921
02:13:20.631 --> 02:13:21.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like these,</v>

4922
02:13:21.450 --> 02:13:23.630
<v Speaker 2>these fucking traitors that cross this,</v>

4923
02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:24.381
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4924
02:13:24.381 --> 02:13:28.970
<v Speaker 2>this line where they're trying to portray themselves as the alternative to tea</v>

4925
02:13:29.020 --> 02:13:29.790
<v Speaker 2>to reality.</v>

4926
02:13:29.790 --> 02:13:31.350
<v Speaker 2>They believe they're the enlightened one.</v>

4927
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:33.320
<v Speaker 5>Fucking gross scams,</v>

4928
02:13:33.330 --> 02:13:34.860
<v Speaker 5>disgusting male feminists.</v>

4929
02:13:34.861 --> 02:13:35.694
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're talking about.</v>

4930
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:36.930
<v Speaker 5>You'll hear me out there.</v>

4931
02:13:36.931 --> 02:13:37.764
<v Speaker 5>You creeps.</v>

4932
02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:40.500
<v Speaker 5>You need to do dead lifts all of you.</v>

4933
02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:44.820
<v Speaker 5>It is funny because there's been a couple times where I've started to get</v>

4934
02:13:44.821 --> 02:13:45.480
<v Speaker 5>pretty,</v>

4935
02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:47.370
<v Speaker 5>pretty serious on the podcast here.</v>

4936
02:13:47.550 --> 02:13:48.500
<v Speaker 5>And then Joel complete,</v>

4937
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:50.270
<v Speaker 5>like when I talked about the Friday and the county,</v>

4938
02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:53.220
<v Speaker 5>he completely turned important or you know,</v>

4939
02:13:53.221 --> 02:13:53.521
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

4940
02:13:53.521 --> 02:13:53.881
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4941
02:13:53.881 --> 02:13:54.421
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4942
02:13:54.421 --> 02:13:54.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4943
02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:55.493
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

4944
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:57.690
<v Speaker 5>he's laying next to my daughter instead of like,</v>

4945
02:13:57.691 --> 02:13:57.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4946
02:13:57.871 --> 02:13:58.450
<v Speaker 5>another woman,</v>

4947
02:13:58.450 --> 02:13:59.370
<v Speaker 5>he throws that one in there.</v>

4948
02:13:59.371 --> 02:14:00.204
<v Speaker 5>It reminds me,</v>

4949
02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:02.370
<v Speaker 5>I did the Howard stern show once,</v>

4950
02:14:02.580 --> 02:14:06.210
<v Speaker 5>and this is back in 2000 I was an active duty Marine Corps captain.</v>

4951
02:14:06.330 --> 02:14:07.470
<v Speaker 5>Was that when you were in the WC?</v>

4952
02:14:07.471 --> 02:14:08.550
<v Speaker 5>We do light heavyweight champion.</v>

4953
02:14:08.551 --> 02:14:09.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4954
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:11.520
<v Speaker 5>And so the versus network,</v>

4955
02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:13.020
<v Speaker 5>God rest their souls,</v>

4956
02:14:13.021 --> 02:14:13.854
<v Speaker 5>rest in peace.</v>

4957
02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:16.800
<v Speaker 5>They somehow get me on the Howard stern show and I go,</v>

4958
02:14:16.801 --> 02:14:16.941
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4959
02:14:16.941 --> 02:14:18.060
<v Speaker 5>what am I going on for it?</v>

4960
02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:20.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm worried it's an active duty captain.</v>

4961
02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:20.491
<v Speaker 5>The Marine Corps.</v>

4962
02:14:20.491 --> 02:14:23.010
<v Speaker 5>I can get in a lot of trouble for saying the wrong thing here.</v>

4963
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:24.870
<v Speaker 5>And so they tell me,</v>

4964
02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:25.231
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4965
02:14:25.231 --> 02:14:25.621
<v Speaker 5>don't worry,</v>

4966
02:14:25.621 --> 02:14:27.990
<v Speaker 5>you're just there to present a check from the WEC.</v>

4967
02:14:27.991 --> 02:14:30.180
<v Speaker 5>But if he will start asking you questions,</v>

4968
02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:32.040
<v Speaker 5>try to stay on as long as you can.</v>

4969
02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:32.641
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

4970
02:14:32.641 --> 02:14:32.941
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>

4971
02:14:32.941 --> 02:14:33.930
<v Speaker 5>What's the contest?</v>

4972
02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:37.410
<v Speaker 5>The hottest chick with the ugliest car.</v>

4973
02:14:37.710 --> 02:14:38.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>

4974
02:14:39.090 --> 02:14:39.781
<v Speaker 5>I mean hip,</v>

4975
02:14:39.781 --> 02:14:41.220
<v Speaker 5>the ugliest scar.</v>

4976
02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:43.590
<v Speaker 5>And so a fuck.</v>

4977
02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:44.041
<v Speaker 5>But it,</v>

4978
02:14:44.041 --> 02:14:44.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4979
02:14:44.251 --> 02:14:46.050
<v Speaker 5>at one point there's actually still,</v>

4980
02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:46.590
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4981
02:14:46.590 --> 02:14:48.210
<v Speaker 5>I think the video is still somewhere,</v>

4982
02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:48.571
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

4983
02:14:48.571 --> 02:14:49.404
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4984
02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:51.140
<v Speaker 5>we're doing this interview and,</v>

4985
02:14:51.210 --> 02:14:54.990
<v Speaker 5>and Howard was being very serious and he was asking me what it's like for these</v>

4986
02:14:54.991 --> 02:14:57.330
<v Speaker 5>young men and women that deploy and how difficult it is.</v>

4987
02:14:57.331 --> 02:14:59.160
<v Speaker 5>And I'm getting into it and,</v>

4988
02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:00.810
<v Speaker 5>and I could see his wheels turning,</v>

4989
02:15:00.811 --> 02:15:01.960
<v Speaker 5>like he's getting sympathetic and every,</v>

4990
02:15:01.961 --> 02:15:03.000
<v Speaker 5>and there's really serious,</v>

4991
02:15:03.001 --> 02:15:04.050
<v Speaker 5>and this isn't his brand.</v>

4992
02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:07.770
<v Speaker 5>So he thinks on his feet and he's nimble and right out of nowhere he comes.</v>

4993
02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.180
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

4994

02:15:09.901 --> 02:15:10.561
<v Speaker 5>How old are you?</v>

4996
02:15:10.561 --> 02:15:11.540
<v Speaker 5>25 years.</v>

4997
02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:12.840
<v Speaker 5>The pressure,</v>

4998

02:17:28.111 --> 02:17:28.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5123
02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:33.100
<v Speaker 2>like a base level having a baby grow up to be a little girl and you go and,</v>

5124
02:17:33.101 --> 02:17:35.440
<v Speaker 2>and also see the variations between the two of them.</v>

5125
02:17:35.940 --> 02:17:36.460
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

5126
02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:40.780
<v Speaker 2>And when I say like I get angry at male feminism,</v>

5127
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:42.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that I'm,</v>

5128
02:17:42.041 --> 02:17:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that everyone should have equal rights cause that's not what I</v>

5129
02:17:44.861 --> 02:17:45.371
<v Speaker 2>mean at all.</v>

5130
02:17:45.371 --> 02:17:50.371
<v Speaker 2>I just think there's a lot of policies out there that are passing themselves off</v>

5131
02:17:50.471 --> 02:17:53.650
<v Speaker 2>as a better alternative to a masculine man.</v>

5132
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:57.580
<v Speaker 2>And that masculinity for whatever reason is under attack is wrong.</v>

5133
02:17:57.700 --> 02:17:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5134
02:17:58.240 --> 02:17:58.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5135
02:17:58.421 --> 02:17:58.841
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

5136
02:17:58.841 --> 02:17:59.081
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5137
02:17:59.081 --> 02:17:59.881
<v Speaker 2>it's wrong for you.</v>

5138
02:17:59.881 --> 02:18:01.810
<v Speaker 2>The strong toxic masculinity.</v>

5139
02:18:01.811 --> 02:18:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I've heard this expression many times like what are you fucking talking about?</v>

5140
02:18:05.621 --> 02:18:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Like there's nothing wrong with women being feminine either.</v>

5141
02:18:08.350 --> 02:18:11.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's the other thing about women being feminine is that somehow or</v>

5142
02:18:11.741 --> 02:18:12.220
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

5143
02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:17.110
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these women who are like pro equal rights will get upset if a girl</v>

5144
02:18:17.111 --> 02:18:18.250
<v Speaker 2>wants to dress sexy.</v>

5145
02:18:18.251 --> 02:18:22.180
<v Speaker 2>If a girl wants to wear what's considered by our society to be sexually</v>

5146
02:18:22.181 --> 02:18:22.631
<v Speaker 2>attractive,</v>

5147
02:18:22.631 --> 02:18:23.351
<v Speaker 2>high heels,</v>

5148
02:18:23.351 --> 02:18:26.360
<v Speaker 2>short skirts that this is playing into men's hands stuff.</v>

5149
02:18:26.530 --> 02:18:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Guess what?</v>

5150
02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Some women like it,</v>

5151
02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:29.560
<v Speaker 2>they liked dressing.</v>

5152
02:18:29.561 --> 02:18:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

5153
02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:33.340
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with a guy who wants to dress like that either.</v>

5154
02:18:33.460 --> 02:18:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Who gives a fuck like this live and let live for whatever reason.</v>

5155
02:18:38.021 --> 02:18:38.440
<v Speaker 2>It only,</v>

5156
02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:43.180
<v Speaker 2>it only works for some people if it suits their purpose or their ideology as</v>

5157
02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:44.080
<v Speaker 2>soon as it doesn't.</v>

5158
02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Any guy that likes to compete and an aggressive sport must be a piece of shit.</v>

5159
02:18:48.730 --> 02:18:49.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

5160
02:18:49.090 --> 02:18:50.050
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

5161
02:18:50.051 --> 02:18:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I know it's not true.</v>

5162
02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:52.660
<v Speaker 2>I've experienced it.</v>

5163
02:18:52.661 --> 02:18:56.710
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of guys that are really nice people that also like to fight.</v>

5164
02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely and plenty of them in this,</v>

5165
02:18:58.761 --> 02:19:01.690
<v Speaker 2>this idea that that's incomprehensible that the,</v>

5166
02:19:01.691 --> 02:19:02.021
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

5167
02:19:02.021 --> 02:19:04.120
<v Speaker 2>these things are mutually exclusive.</v>

5168
02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:05.171
<v Speaker 2>I reject that.</v>

5169
02:19:05.171 --> 02:19:05.621
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

5170
02:19:05.621 --> 02:19:06.760
<v Speaker 2>I think it's preposterous.</v>

5171
02:19:06.761 --> 02:19:10.870
<v Speaker 2>And I think that idea is perpetrated by people who are trying to present this</v>

5172
02:19:10.871 --> 02:19:12.340
<v Speaker 2>alternative to the norm,</v>

5173
02:19:12.490 --> 02:19:15.190
<v Speaker 2>that they know they can't compete as men.</v>

5174
02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:18.070
<v Speaker 2>And so they want to pretend that somehow or another,</v>

5175
02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:20.680
<v Speaker 2>all the things that we associate with men,</v>

5176
02:19:20.890 --> 02:19:22.150
<v Speaker 2>muscle cars,</v>

5177
02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:23.230
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>

5178
02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:23.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5179
02:19:23.621 --> 02:19:24.161
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

5180
02:19:24.161 --> 02:19:25.090
<v Speaker 2>having a big Dick,</v>

5181
02:19:25.091 --> 02:19:26.500
<v Speaker 2>all those things are terrible.</v>

5182
02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 2>And that was what they are.</v>

5183
02:19:28.191 --> 02:19:28.800
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

5184
02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:32.780
<v Speaker 2>this guy who cries every time he sees a fucking a commercial in it with a puppy.</v>

5185
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:33.440
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

5186
02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:34.790
<v Speaker 2>that's the better choice.</v>

5187
02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:35.331
<v Speaker 3>And you're in,</v>

5188
02:19:35.331 --> 02:19:36.500
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong for being the other way.</v>

5189
02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:36.741
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5190
02:19:36.741 --> 02:19:36.941
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5191
02:19:36.941 --> 02:19:39.980
<v Speaker 3>it's envy and insecurity can,</v>

5192
02:19:39.981 --> 02:19:40.251
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

5193
02:19:40.251 --> 02:19:41.630
<v Speaker 3>can make any one of us,</v>

5194
02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:42.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean really ugly.</v>

5195
02:19:42.861 --> 02:19:43.371
<v Speaker 3>And then you hear it,</v>

5196
02:19:43.371 --> 02:19:43.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5197
02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:44.480
<v Speaker 3>the green have you,</v>

5198
02:19:44.481 --> 02:19:45.314
<v Speaker 3>makes you ugly and everything.</v>

5199
02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:45.950
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>

5200
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:48.200
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of that is what it is,</v>

5201
02:19:48.201 --> 02:19:49.580
<v Speaker 3>creates that intolerance.</v>

5202
02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:50.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5203
02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:50.871
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5204
02:19:50.871 --> 02:19:52.010
<v Speaker 3>people ask me all the time,</v>

5205
02:19:52.250 --> 02:19:52.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5206
02:19:52.501 --> 02:19:52.681
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5207
02:19:52.681 --> 02:19:52.871
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

5208
02:19:52.871 --> 02:19:53.111
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

5209
02:19:53.111 --> 02:19:53.721
<v Speaker 3>you're white.</v>

5210
02:19:53.721 --> 02:19:54.680
<v Speaker 3>You were in the Marine Corp,</v>

5211
02:19:54.681 --> 02:19:55.461
<v Speaker 3>so all,</v>

5212
02:19:55.461 --> 02:19:56.294
<v Speaker 3>you must be,</v>

5213
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5214
02:19:56.810 --> 02:19:58.070
<v Speaker 2>flea against all this,</v>

5215
02:19:58.071 --> 02:19:58.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5216
02:19:58.371 --> 02:20:00.050
<v Speaker 2>a homosexual stuff in the marriage.</v>

5217
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit.</v>

5218
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Don't care at all.</v>

5219
02:20:03.740 --> 02:20:06.230
<v Speaker 2>With his month is much hate as I've seen in the world.</v>

5220
02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:07.520
<v Speaker 2>What do I care about?</v>

5221
02:20:07.521 --> 02:20:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Two people love each other.</v>

5222
02:20:08.930 --> 02:20:09.681
<v Speaker 2>I have no issues.</v>

5223
02:20:09.681 --> 02:20:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Why whatsoever with that whatsoever.</v>

5224
02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:12.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5225
02:20:12.591 --> 02:20:14.750
<v Speaker 2>My issues with people that have a problem with it.</v>

5226
02:20:14.751 --> 02:20:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I have a real issue for people that have a problem with people who just love</v>

5227
02:20:18.081 --> 02:20:18.680
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

5228
02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's like to want to love a man.</v>

5229
02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:21.351
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

5230
02:20:21.351 --> 02:20:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe my wife loves me.</v>

5231
02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:25.160
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe any women love men.</v>

5232
02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want Dick that?</v>

5233
02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:27.693
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

5234
02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:27.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

5235
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:29.270
<v Speaker 2>to me it's like having,</v>

5236
02:20:29.271 --> 02:20:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Dick is like having a magic trick.</v>

5237
02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't believe this works.</v>

5238
02:20:33.370 --> 02:20:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I can pull a rabbit out of my hat.</v>

5239
02:20:35.091 --> 02:20:37.130
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you want to see this.</v>

5240
02:20:37.250 --> 02:20:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't understand it,</v>

5241
02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:42.890
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that somehow or another it's evil that a man wants it,</v>

5242
02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:44.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's not evil that a woman,</v>

5243
02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:45.440
<v Speaker 2>let's fucking preposterous.</v>

5244
02:20:45.450 --> 02:20:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Who gives a shit.</v>

5245
02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:47.000
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

5246
02:20:47.001 --> 02:20:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if men wear high heels.</v>

5247
02:20:48.921 --> 02:20:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if women dress like a fucking biker.</v>

5248
02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck as long as you're nice.</v>

5249
02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:54.471
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5250
02:20:54.471 --> 02:20:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

5251
02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I have had friends and relations with some of the weirdest fucking people across</v>

5252
02:21:00.290 --> 02:21:02.030
<v Speaker 2>the full spectrum of humanity.</v>

5253
02:21:02.031 --> 02:21:03.530
<v Speaker 2>And all I care about is,</v>

5254
02:21:03.531 --> 02:21:04.400
<v Speaker 2>are you nice?</v>

5255
02:21:04.850 --> 02:21:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Are you interesting to talk to?</v>

5256
02:21:06.321 --> 02:21:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Are you intelligent?</v>

5257
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Can I,</v>

5258
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:13.030
<v Speaker 2>can I enjoy my time with you without feeling like your judging me or you're</v>

5259
02:21:13.250 --> 02:21:16.100
<v Speaker 2>being aggressive towards me or passive aggressive towards me?</v>

5260
02:21:16.101 --> 02:21:16.970
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

5261
02:21:16.971 --> 02:21:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I've had some of the weirdest,</v>

5262
02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:18.980
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

5263

<v Speaker 2>Don't create any enemies that aren't really your enemy.</v>

5282
02:21:55.810 --> 02:21:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

02:21:58.841 --> 02:21:59.021
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5288
02:21:59.021 --> 02:21:59.920
<v Speaker 3>when you look at that,</v>

5289
02:21:59.921 --> 02:22:01.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean the live and let live means,</v>

5291
02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:06.010
<v Speaker 3>be be concerned with your circle and be tolerant of all those around and try to</v>

5292
02:22:06.011 --> 02:22:06.641
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>

5293
02:22:06.641 --> 02:22:06.791
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

5294
02:22:06.791 --> 02:22:07.331
<v Speaker 3>which we all,</v>

5302
02:22:21.911 --> 02:22:24.250
<v Speaker 3>really insecure looking for other people's approval.</v>

02:22:24.670 --> 02:22:24.881
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5313
02:22:35.431 --> 02:22:39.570
<v Speaker 4>it's everybody's trying to one up each other and it's this environment where we</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5318
02:22:44.390 --> 02:22:46.380
<v Speaker 4>I can't call a fight card without,</v>

5319
02:22:46.381 --> 02:22:46.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's no way around it.</v>

5333
02:23:07.090 --> 02:23:10.840
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about two guys throwing fucking bones at each other in a cage.</v>

5334
02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5346
02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:27.430
<v Speaker 2>that's where Goldie gets in trouble.</v>

5347
02:23:28.100 --> 02:23:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Goldberg fucking engages with these people.</v>

5348
02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I had to pull them aside after the NFL thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>who knows what they're doing.</v>

5359
02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:42.221
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>

5360
02:23:42.221 --> 02:23:43.210
<v Speaker 2>they don't even have an Avatar.</v>

5363
02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:45.490
<v Speaker 2>And even if it isn't Avatar,</v>

5366
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:49.210
<v Speaker 2>it could be anybody.</v>

5367
02:23:49.211 --> 02:23:53.560
<v Speaker 2>They could have taken a picture out of a fucking magazine taking a camera photo</v>

5368
02:23:53.561 --> 02:23:54.394
<v Speaker 2>of that picture.</v>

5369
02:23:54.430 --> 02:23:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Use that as an Avatar.</v>

5370
02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:56.351
<v Speaker 2>You're a fat fuck.</v>

5371
02:23:56.351 --> 02:23:57.071
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know them.</v>

5372
02:23:57.071 --> 02:23:57.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5373
02:23:57.431 --> 02:23:58.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what they look like.</v>

5374
02:23:58.391 --> 02:23:59.224
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea.</v>

5375
02:23:59.290 --> 02:24:00.970
<v Speaker 2>You're arguing with fucking goats.</v>

5376
02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5377
02:24:02.210 --> 02:24:03.250
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is too,</v>

5378
02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:04.181
<v Speaker 2>that people have to is,</v>

5379
02:24:04.181 --> 02:24:05.050
<v Speaker 2>is the people</v>

5380
02:24:05.090 --> 02:24:08.930
<v Speaker 4>well that will engage like he does in a lot of instances.</v>

5381
02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:12.740
<v Speaker 4>They tend to be very passionate and care a lot about what they do.</v>

5382
02:24:12.741 --> 02:24:14.390
<v Speaker 4>So it's easy to lure them in there.</v>

5383
02:24:14.391 --> 02:24:18.800
<v Speaker 4>So while you're trying to destroy them and you're trying to break them down,</v>

5384
02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:20.690
<v Speaker 4>at least understanding knowledge like that,</v>

5385
02:24:20.691 --> 02:24:23.370
<v Speaker 4>they really do care about their job and the product they're putting out there.</v>

5386
02:24:23.380 --> 02:24:25.160
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to be good.</v>

5387
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:26.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5388
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:29.210
<v Speaker 4>and obviously maybe they made some mistakes and you were able to lure them in</v>

5389
02:24:29.211 --> 02:24:30.800
<v Speaker 4>into to saying things they didn't mean.</v>

5390
02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:32.520
<v Speaker 2>But there are guys out there,</v>

5391
02:24:32.521 --> 02:24:32.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5392
02:24:32.851 --> 02:24:34.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to name any names,</v>

5393
02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:38.580
<v Speaker 2>but there are guys out there that do commentary for MMA that should not be doing</v>

5394
02:24:38.581 --> 02:24:39.120
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

5395
02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:40.950
<v Speaker 2>And I can't listen.</v>

5396
02:24:40.951 --> 02:24:44.130
<v Speaker 2>There's guys that I can't listen to that I literally have to turn the fucking</v>

5397
02:24:44.131 --> 02:24:46.370
<v Speaker 2>volume down and other organizations because they,</v>

5398
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:47.760
<v Speaker 2>they just drive me crazy.</v>

5399
02:24:47.761 --> 02:24:48.081
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>

5400
02:24:48.081 --> 02:24:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck they're doing.</v>

5401
02:24:49.471 --> 02:24:50.610
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what they're talking about.</v>

5402
02:24:50.730 --> 02:24:51.660
<v Speaker 2>And I get crazy.</v>

5403
02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:52.650
<v Speaker 2>So I understand it.</v>

5404
02:24:52.770 --> 02:24:54.180
<v Speaker 2>And if you think I'm one of those guys,</v>

5405
02:24:54.181 --> 02:24:54.780
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

5406
02:24:54.780 --> 02:24:55.613
<v Speaker 2>I think you're wrong,</v>

5407
02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:56.473
<v Speaker 2>but I get it.</v>

5408
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

5409
02:24:57.600 --> 02:24:58.710
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

5410
02:24:59.130 --> 02:24:59.970
<v Speaker 2>I think this,</v>

5411
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:03.510
<v Speaker 2>this ability to reach people and to express your opinion,</v>

5412
02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:06.180
<v Speaker 2>it's way more valuable than it's negative.</v>

5413
02:25:06.730 --> 02:25:08.090
<v Speaker 2>I get a lot out of it.</v>

5414
02:25:08.091 --> 02:25:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I get a lot of the underground,</v>

5415
02:25:09.660 --> 02:25:12.180
<v Speaker 2>I get a lot of the criticism and sometimes the right,</v>

5416
02:25:12.181 --> 02:25:12.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5417
02:25:12.391 --> 02:25:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not all perfect.</v>

5418
02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

5419
02:25:13.950 --> 02:25:16.560
<v Speaker 2>I fuck up call sometimes or I'll,</v>

5420
02:25:16.590 --> 02:25:16.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5421
02:25:16.861 --> 02:25:18.360
<v Speaker 2>miss things or you know,</v>

5422
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:20.310
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that people need to consider,</v>

5423
02:25:20.670 --> 02:25:21.490
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to consider,</v>

5424
02:25:21.490 --> 02:25:22.890
<v Speaker 2>but when you're watching fights,</v>

5425
02:25:22.891 --> 02:25:24.220
<v Speaker 2>you're watching in the octagon.</v>

5426
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:25.360
<v Speaker 2>When we're watching,</v>

5427
02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:26.710
<v Speaker 2>there's oftentimes like,</v>

5428
02:25:26.830 --> 02:25:28.150
<v Speaker 2>I think a punch landed,</v>

5429
02:25:28.270 --> 02:25:28.691
<v Speaker 2>but it really,</v>

5430
02:25:28.691 --> 02:25:31.350
<v Speaker 2>a guy tripped and it's because of the guys back is to me.</v>

5431
02:25:31.351 --> 02:25:34.900
<v Speaker 2>And you can't tell if someone's standing and your back's to you and someone</v>

5432
02:25:34.901 --> 02:25:37.510
<v Speaker 2>throws a punch and they see the guy fall backwards.</v>

5433
02:25:37.511 --> 02:25:39.790
<v Speaker 2>You think the guy got hurt and then they're,</v>

5434
02:25:39.791 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 2>the people that are watching at home have the benefit of watching it from the</v>

5435
02:25:42.221 --> 02:25:43.870
<v Speaker 2>side and they're seeing a punch,</v>

5436
02:25:43.871 --> 02:25:44.704
<v Speaker 2>not land.</v>

5437
02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:46.030
<v Speaker 2>All that kind of stuff happens.</v>

5438
02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:46.893
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

5439
02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:48.910
<v Speaker 2>you could watch the monitors I guess.</v>

5440
02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:49.960
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I do,</v>

5441
02:25:49.961 --> 02:25:50.741
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

5442
02:25:50.741 --> 02:25:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I want to watch it live.</v>

5443
02:25:51.731 --> 02:25:52.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch those fucking</v>

5444
02:25:52.700 --> 02:25:54.680
<v Speaker 4>monitors so much better to watch live,</v>

5445
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:55.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5446
02:25:55.011 --> 02:25:55.844
<v Speaker 4>as a fan.</v>

5447
02:25:56.060 --> 02:25:56.390
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

5448
02:25:56.390 --> 02:25:59.750
<v Speaker 4>I tried to stick to the monitors because I remember the first card I call was in</v>

5449
02:25:59.751 --> 02:26:04.130
<v Speaker 4>Rio when Phil Davis Fault Yoda Machita and Machita through a whole bunch of his</v>

5450
02:26:04.131 --> 02:26:06.770
<v Speaker 4>blitzes going away from me in India,</v>

5451
02:26:06.771 --> 02:26:07.431
<v Speaker 4>Phil Davidson,</v>

5452
02:26:07.431 --> 02:26:10.010
<v Speaker 4>it looked like they all landed and I watched some of the replaced,</v>

5453
02:26:10.011 --> 02:26:10.940
<v Speaker 4>not all of them landed.</v>

5454
02:26:10.941 --> 02:26:11.481
<v Speaker 4>So it was,</v>

5455
02:26:11.481 --> 02:26:14.810
<v Speaker 4>it was one of those difficult things where with the monitor I think I can,</v>

5456
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:16.190
<v Speaker 4>I can see more.</v>

5457
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.970
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5458
02:26:16.970 --> 02:26:18.800
<v Speaker 4>but there's times when they're close to me,</v>

5459
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:19.700
<v Speaker 4>I can't help it.</v>

5460
02:26:19.701 --> 02:26:24.260
<v Speaker 4>I want to look through the cage because I need to get in wrapped into that fight</v>

5461
02:26:24.261 --> 02:26:25.880
<v Speaker 4>and feel the crowd feel them.</v>

5462
02:26:25.881 --> 02:26:26.271
<v Speaker 4>Because look,</v>

5463
02:26:26.271 --> 02:26:26.421
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5464
02:26:26.421 --> 02:26:28.340
<v Speaker 4>it's our job to,</v>

5465
02:26:28.341 --> 02:26:29.660
<v Speaker 4>to be provocative,</v>

5466
02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:31.280
<v Speaker 4>to break things down,</v>

5467
02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:34.220
<v Speaker 4>to make it entertaining and all our true to do that.</v>

5468
02:26:34.310 --> 02:26:35.840
<v Speaker 4>There's also a voice in our ear,</v>

5469
02:26:35.841 --> 02:26:38.600
<v Speaker 4>multiple voices in our ear telling us all kinds of wild,</v>

5470
02:26:38.601 --> 02:26:39.111
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>

5471
02:26:39.111 --> 02:26:40.810
<v Speaker 4>I've got the replay and was a Headbutt,</v>

5472
02:26:40.820 --> 02:26:41.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5473
02:26:41.031 --> 02:26:41.510
<v Speaker 4>so there's,</v>

5474
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:42.081
<v Speaker 4>there's things,</v>

5475
02:26:42.081 --> 02:26:45.470
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of things going on during that seven hour period.</v>

5476
02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:46.280
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5477
02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:48.770
<v Speaker 4>that that can also lead to a distraction or lead to,</v>

5478
02:26:48.771 --> 02:26:49.604
<v Speaker 4>to a misstep.</v>

5479
02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:50.180
<v Speaker 4>Those,</v>

5480
02:26:50.180 --> 02:26:50.610
<v Speaker 4>those</v>

5481
02:26:50.610 --> 02:26:51.480
<v Speaker 2>voices in your ear,</v>

5482
02:26:51.481 --> 02:26:53.050
<v Speaker 2>a brutal when you're in the middle of talk,</v>

5483
02:26:54.090 --> 02:26:55.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like a big point you're trying to make.</v>

5484
02:26:55.771 --> 02:26:56.720
<v Speaker 2>And then someone's like,</v>

5485
02:26:56.730 --> 02:26:56.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5486
02:26:56.890 --> 02:26:58.040
<v Speaker 2>we got a replay on Ron.</v>

5487
02:26:58.041 --> 02:26:58.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5488
02:26:58.320 --> 02:26:59.250
<v Speaker 2>look at your monitor,</v>

5489
02:26:59.251 --> 02:27:00.001
<v Speaker 2>look at the B monitor.</v>

5490
02:27:00.001 --> 02:27:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Like Ah,</v>

5491
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.521
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

5492
02:27:01.521 --> 02:27:05.880
<v Speaker 2>you hear someone talking in your ear while you're talking and you know that a</v>

5493
02:27:05.881 --> 02:27:09.450
<v Speaker 2>fucking million and a half people are here plus our hearing you.</v>

5494
02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:12.390
<v Speaker 2>And then who knows how many fucking people are gonna hear over the course of</v>

5495
02:27:12.391 --> 02:27:13.224
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

5496
02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:14.790
<v Speaker 2>They're going to listen to that,</v>

5497
02:27:14.820 --> 02:27:15.780
<v Speaker 2>that broadcast.</v>

5498
02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I watched that Phil Davis,</v>

5499
02:27:17.251 --> 02:27:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Leo Machida fight the other day.</v>

5500
02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:20.400
<v Speaker 2>It was way closer than I thought it was.</v>

5501
02:27:20.610 --> 02:27:21.061
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>

5502
02:27:21.061 --> 02:27:22.200
<v Speaker 2>I could see Phil winning.</v>

5503
02:27:22.201 --> 02:27:22.471
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5504
02:27:22.471 --> 02:27:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Phil did get takedowns and did do damage on the ground.</v>

5505
02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:28.020
<v Speaker 2>And like you were saying like a lot of those shots,</v>

5506
02:27:28.021 --> 02:27:29.280
<v Speaker 2>that mosquito is very,</v>

5507
02:27:29.281 --> 02:27:29.701
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

5508
02:27:29.701 --> 02:27:30.780
<v Speaker 2>very close fight.</v>

5509
02:27:30.930 --> 02:27:33.240
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of people were calling in one of the greatest robberies ever.</v>

5510
02:27:33.241 --> 02:27:33.991
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

5511
02:27:33.991 --> 02:27:34.711
<v Speaker 2>I watched it again.</v>

5512
02:27:34.711 --> 02:27:35.010
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5513
02:27:35.010 --> 02:27:35.251
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

5514
02:27:35.251 --> 02:27:35.731
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

5515
02:27:35.731 --> 02:27:36.564
<v Speaker 2>not so much.</v>

5516
02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:38.040
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think it's one of the greatest robberies.</v>

5517
02:27:38.090 --> 02:27:39.260
<v Speaker 2>It's very fucking close.</v>

5518
02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:41.250
<v Speaker 4>And even the Cheadle Italia and you know,</v>

5519
02:27:41.430 --> 02:27:44.580
<v Speaker 4>when I talked to him before his fight with CBD Holloway,</v>

5520
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.971
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5521
02:27:44.971 --> 02:27:49.830
<v Speaker 4>he's had to adapt his style though because he had a whole bunch of really</v>

5522
02:27:49.831 --> 02:27:50.940
<v Speaker 4>contested decisions.</v>

5523
02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:51.541
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5524
02:27:51.541 --> 02:27:54.720
<v Speaker 4>his rampage Jackson fight his fight with Phil Davis.</v>

5525
02:27:54.721 --> 02:27:57.690
<v Speaker 4>He was leaving a lot of fights where he felt like,</v>

5526
02:27:57.691 --> 02:27:58.021
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5527
02:27:58.021 --> 02:27:58.231
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

5528
02:27:58.231 --> 02:27:59.640
<v Speaker 4>I was in total control,</v>

5529
02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:00.893
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't.</v>

5530
02:28:00.930 --> 02:28:01.101
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

5531
02:28:01.101 --> 02:28:01.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5532
02:28:01.351 --> 02:28:03.120
<v Speaker 4>he made it confusing for the judges.</v>

5533
02:28:03.121 --> 02:28:03.721
<v Speaker 4>And when you do that,</v>

5534
02:28:03.721 --> 02:28:03.931
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

5535
02:28:03.931 --> 02:28:04.800
<v Speaker 4>judges are human too.</v>

5536
02:28:04.801 --> 02:28:07.380
<v Speaker 4>We've talked all tonight about how flawed we are as humans.</v>

5537
02:28:07.390 --> 02:28:08.340
<v Speaker 4>We all make mistakes.</v>

5538
02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:12.930
<v Speaker 4>And that happens there that absolutely you've got to do the things he's had to</v>

5539
02:28:12.931 --> 02:28:13.830
<v Speaker 4>get more aggressive.</v>

5540
02:28:13.980 --> 02:28:16.920
<v Speaker 4>He can't just counter punch his head to get a little bit more offensive with his</v>

5541
02:28:16.921 --> 02:28:21.650
<v Speaker 4>style to ensure that he's going to get those decisions because if doesn't get</v>

5542
02:28:21.651 --> 02:28:21.741
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

5543
02:28:21.741 --> 02:28:22.160
<v Speaker 4>he can't</v>

5544
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:24.800
<v Speaker 5>be totally disappointed when he's got a little bit of a passive style.</v>

5545
02:28:24.890 --> 02:28:25.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5546
02:28:25.101 --> 02:28:28.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad he went down to one 85 I think he should have been there all along,</v>

5547
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:31.760
<v Speaker 5>but she does one of those guys who would weigh in at two oh three two oh four</v>

5548
02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:32.780
<v Speaker 5>didn't cut any weight,</v>

5549
02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:33.860
<v Speaker 5>not crazy.</v>

5550
02:28:33.950 --> 02:28:34.850
<v Speaker 5>And he's not a huge,</v>

5551
02:28:34.851 --> 02:28:35.690
<v Speaker 5>he's not a huge middle weight.</v>

5552
02:28:35.691 --> 02:28:35.871
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5553
02:28:35.871 --> 02:28:36.530
<v Speaker 5>he walks,</v>

5554
02:28:36.530 --> 02:28:37.363
<v Speaker 5>he'll be,</v>

5555
02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:37.821
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5556
02:28:37.821 --> 02:28:41.410
<v Speaker 5>one 97 196 when I fought at middle weight,</v>

5557
02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:45.320
<v Speaker 5>I would show up to the venue at two oh seven on Tuesday,</v>

5558
02:28:45.650 --> 02:28:47.600
<v Speaker 5>make one 85 Friday,</v>

5559
02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:49.820
<v Speaker 5>fight back at tool seven on Saturday.</v>

5560
02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:50.661
<v Speaker 5>That was crazy.</v>

5561
02:28:50.661 --> 02:28:51.860
<v Speaker 5>And I was big then.</v>

5562
02:28:51.861 --> 02:28:53.600
<v Speaker 5>Now I look at these dudes now.</v>

5563
02:28:53.601 --> 02:28:55.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're almost all like that anymore.</v>

5564
02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:55.900
<v Speaker 5>Well look at Weidman.</v>

5565
02:28:55.900 --> 02:28:56.733
<v Speaker 5>Why machine?</v>

5566
02:28:57.080 --> 02:29:02.080
<v Speaker 5>He's a big fucking guy to 25 to 30 he's a big thick guy and he's strong as shit.</v>

5567
02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:06.470
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of the things I think Machita realized in that fight.</v>

5568
02:29:06.471 --> 02:29:06.621
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

5569
02:29:06.621 --> 02:29:07.010
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

5570
02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:08.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a big middle weight.</v>

5571
02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:08.591
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

5572
02:29:08.591 --> 02:29:09.800
<v Speaker 5>You know when you're fighting Weidman,</v>

5573
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:13.220
<v Speaker 5>you unload everything but the kitchen sink and then he waves the in afterwards.</v>

5574
02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:17.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean he unloaded on Weidman and Weidman was still there and the fact that why,</v>

5575
02:29:17.331 --> 02:29:21.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean who thought round one Weidman gets rate and Machida's face and starts out</v>

5576
02:29:21.951 --> 02:29:23.120
<v Speaker 5>striking first three rounds,</v>

5577
02:29:23.121 --> 02:29:24.440
<v Speaker 5>he out struck Machita.</v>

5578
02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:27.020
<v Speaker 5>Now it's not a pure kickboxing match.</v>

5579
02:29:27.021 --> 02:29:30.620
<v Speaker 5>The threat of the takedown certainly opens up your arsenal more and limits</v>

5580
02:29:30.621 --> 02:29:31.454
<v Speaker 5>Leo's,</v>

5581
02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:32.630
<v Speaker 5>but it was still,</v>

5582
02:29:32.631 --> 02:29:36.830
<v Speaker 5>we've never seen someone go in there and take that route towards beating</v>

5583
02:29:36.831 --> 02:29:37.340
<v Speaker 5>Machita.</v>

5584
02:29:37.340 --> 02:29:37.521
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5585
02:29:37.521 --> 02:29:41.600
<v Speaker 5>he's very confident in his chin and his knock out power and he also has a really</v>

5586
02:29:41.601 --> 02:29:43.070
<v Speaker 5>good sense of distance.</v>

5587
02:29:43.090 --> 02:29:43.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5588
02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:45.110
<v Speaker 5>That's one thing that people don't give him enough credit.</v>

5589
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:47.300
<v Speaker 5>They think he's just his face forward attacking guy.</v>

5590
02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:50.600
<v Speaker 5>Now he moves in and then he moves back and he moves in and moves back.</v>

5591
02:29:50.780 --> 02:29:54.720
<v Speaker 5>He's throwing faints a lot and breed long goes such a good fucking striking</v>

5592
02:29:54.721 --> 02:29:55.430
<v Speaker 5>coach.</v>

5593
02:29:55.430 --> 02:29:56.930
<v Speaker 5>Especially with wrestlers,</v>

5594
02:29:57.140 --> 02:29:59.570
<v Speaker 5>you know that he really understands how to,</v>

5595
02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:01.200
<v Speaker 5>how to teach those guys how to,</v>

5596
02:30:01.330 --> 02:30:06.330
<v Speaker 5>how to fight with the constant threat of the takedown and then attack off of</v>

5597
02:30:06.771 --> 02:30:07.221
<v Speaker 5>those.</v>

5598
02:30:07.221 --> 02:30:08.480
<v Speaker 5>Off of those opportunities.</v>

5599
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:12.200
<v Speaker 5>You talk about controlling distanced me when someone knocks you out with a</v>

5600
02:30:12.210 --> 02:30:13.520
<v Speaker 5>counter elbow.</v>

5601
02:30:13.710 --> 02:30:14.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5602
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:14.910
<v Speaker 5>How often?</v>

5603
02:30:14.910 --> 02:30:19.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is really hard to do to Timon elbow on a counter strike and knock</v>

5604
02:30:19.881 --> 02:30:20.714
<v Speaker 5>somebody out.</v>

5605
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:23.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's understanding the range of your opponent,</v>

5606
02:30:23.061 --> 02:30:24.650
<v Speaker 5>how far they're a feel.</v>

5607
02:30:24.830 --> 02:30:28.820
<v Speaker 5>It's a feel that not every fighter has and Chris definitely hasn't yet long ago.</v>

5608
02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:30.680
<v Speaker 5>Well it was also one of those guys technically,</v>

5609
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:31.521
<v Speaker 5>but he also,</v>

5610
02:30:31.521 --> 02:30:34.460
<v Speaker 5>I think he makes his fighters feel like they're better than they should be.</v>

5611
02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Like he makes them feel like their rate or run through that brick wall cause</v>

5612
02:30:36.951 --> 02:30:39.880
<v Speaker 5>he's just that tough northeast gritty do like,</v>

5613
02:30:40.130 --> 02:30:40.851
<v Speaker 5>hey ray,</v>

5614
02:30:40.851 --> 02:30:42.660
<v Speaker 5>how do you think he's going to do against Weidman and end?</v>

5615
02:30:42.661 --> 02:30:43.730
<v Speaker 5>He told me two days before the flight,</v>

5616
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:45.620
<v Speaker 5>aw he's Brian,</v>

5617
02:30:45.621 --> 02:30:46.520
<v Speaker 5>he's going to smoke them.</v>

5618
02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:48.350
<v Speaker 5>This'll be ego run rate the room.</v>

5619
02:30:48.351 --> 02:30:48.531
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

5620
02:30:48.531 --> 02:30:51.260
<v Speaker 5>it's so funny to hear his confidence and how tough he is.</v>

5621
02:30:51.470 --> 02:30:51.621
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5622
02:30:51.621 --> 02:30:54.470
<v Speaker 5>he told me it was one of Weidman's earlier victories.</v>

5623
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:55.310
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5624
02:30:55.310 --> 02:30:56.050
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

5625
02:30:56.050 --> 02:30:56.883
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5626
02:30:57.020 --> 02:30:59.000
<v Speaker 5>I think after he fought Tom Lawler,</v>

5627
02:30:59.530 --> 02:30:59.960
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5628
02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:00.500
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

5629
02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:01.040
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

5630
02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:03.380
<v Speaker 5>I was in the cage with them and ray long goes,</v>

5631
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:04.790
<v Speaker 5>he's a motherfucker.</v>

5632
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:06.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you his kids,</v>

5633
02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:11.480
<v Speaker 5>a motherfucker think he said to me about why and when he goes,</v>

5634
02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:13.130
<v Speaker 5>we're all lucky he's fighting.</v>

5635
02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:14.353
<v Speaker 5>Trust me,</v>

5636
02:31:14.540 --> 02:31:18.620
<v Speaker 5>we're all lucky he's in a fucking cage fighting because if he was out there,</v>

5637
02:31:18.770 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 5>if he didn't have an outlet,</v>

5638
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:21.090
<v Speaker 5>oh Christ,</v>

5639
02:31:21.210 --> 02:31:21.840
<v Speaker 5>no shows.</v>

5640
02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:23.820
<v Speaker 5>I've seen some shit with this kid and the gym.</v>

5641
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:27.730
<v Speaker 5>That'd be a great land and will be a great Reebok tee shirt for wide.</v>

5642
02:31:27.740 --> 02:31:28.220
<v Speaker 5>All luck.</v>

5643
02:31:28.220 --> 02:31:32.100
<v Speaker 5>He's fighting it that or he's a motherfucker when you look at him too.</v>

5644
02:31:32.101 --> 02:31:34.680
<v Speaker 5>He's so handsome and so it looks so nice.</v>

5645
02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:38.130
<v Speaker 5>He's a little more respectable looking young man to be such a fucking murderer</v>

5646
02:31:38.131 --> 02:31:38.460
<v Speaker 5>in there.</v>

5647
02:31:38.460 --> 02:31:39.061
<v Speaker 5>He did that.</v>

5648
02:31:39.061 --> 02:31:39.621
<v Speaker 5>He did the,</v>

5649
02:31:39.621 --> 02:31:40.920
<v Speaker 5>the desk show at this one time.</v>

5650
02:31:40.921 --> 02:31:41.760
<v Speaker 5>He's got his wife,</v>

5651
02:31:41.761 --> 02:31:42.810
<v Speaker 5>his kids up there.</v>

5652
02:31:42.811 --> 02:31:43.860
<v Speaker 5>And it's like you said,</v>

5653
02:31:44.010 --> 02:31:45.290
<v Speaker 5>just because someone's a fighter,</v>

5654
02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:47.100
<v Speaker 5>does it mean it they're this aggressive,</v>

5655
02:31:47.101 --> 02:31:47.990
<v Speaker 5>atrocious human being.</v>

5656
02:31:47.991 --> 02:31:51.480
<v Speaker 5>An exact Frankie Edgar's one of the greatest guys ever.</v>

5657
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:54.600
<v Speaker 5>And probably the pound for pound or forget,</v>

5658
02:31:54.601 --> 02:31:55.230
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

5659
02:31:55.230 --> 02:31:57.480
<v Speaker 5>toughest guy in the UFC?</v>

5660
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:58.380
<v Speaker 5>He's a savage.</v>

5661
02:31:58.440 --> 02:31:58.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5662
02:31:58.710 --> 02:32:01.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean gritty like the,</v>

5663
02:32:01.060 --> 02:32:01.250
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

5664
02:32:01.250 --> 02:32:04.290
<v Speaker 5>the heart that that guy has and the pace that he puts on you.</v>

5665
02:32:04.290 --> 02:32:04.561
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5666
02:32:04.561 --> 02:32:05.190
<v Speaker 5>he'd go,</v>

5667
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:09.190
<v Speaker 5>I think that guy pays for pace is like there's,</v>

5668
02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:11.310
<v Speaker 5>there's almost no one who could beat that.</v>

5669
02:32:11.550 --> 02:32:15.840
<v Speaker 5>There's almost no one who has a work ethic like him in pain doesn't register the</v>

5670
02:32:15.841 --> 02:32:16.621
<v Speaker 5>same with him,</v>

5671
02:32:16.621 --> 02:32:16.871
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

5672
02:32:16.871 --> 02:32:16.961
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5673
02:32:16.961 --> 02:32:18.120
<v Speaker 5>and he's totally sane.</v>

5674
02:32:18.121 --> 02:32:19.020
<v Speaker 5>We've had some fires,</v>

5675
02:32:19.021 --> 02:32:19.471
<v Speaker 5>Nafta and that.</v>

5676
02:32:19.471 --> 02:32:20.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't think pain registered with you.</v>

5677
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:21.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they were all there.</v>

5678
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.620
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5679
02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:24.750
<v Speaker 5>Frankie's a guy that when he feels it hurt,</v>

5680
02:32:24.751 --> 02:32:25.501
<v Speaker 5>his heart's burning,</v>

5681
02:32:25.501 --> 02:32:26.191
<v Speaker 5>his lungs built,</v>

5682
02:32:26.191 --> 02:32:26.551
<v Speaker 5>burning,</v>

5683
02:32:26.551 --> 02:32:27.181
<v Speaker 5>he just teaches,</v>

5684
02:32:27.181 --> 02:32:28.140
<v Speaker 5>tells himself to go forward.</v>

5685
02:32:28.170 --> 02:32:29.040
<v Speaker 5>He just keeps going.</v>

5686
02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:30.001
<v Speaker 5>And the other thing I,</v>

5687
02:32:30.001 --> 02:32:30.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5688
02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:31.950
<v Speaker 5>when you see a mountain public,</v>

5689
02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:33.173
<v Speaker 5>none of it's gone.</v>

5690
02:32:33.250 --> 02:32:33.451
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5691
02:32:33.451 --> 02:32:37.050
<v Speaker 5>he's still the same kid that'll go eat like a bowl of pasta down to the local,</v>

5692
02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:39.240
<v Speaker 5>you know that the corner store with everybody.</v>

5693
02:32:39.241 --> 02:32:39.541
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

5694
02:32:39.541 --> 02:32:39.721
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5695
02:32:39.721 --> 02:32:41.700
<v Speaker 5>his whole community just loves that guy.</v>

5696
02:32:41.790 --> 02:32:42.181
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5697
02:32:42.181 --> 02:32:42.990
<v Speaker 5>He's a great guy.</v>

5698
02:32:42.990 --> 02:32:43.471
<v Speaker 5>He is.</v>

5699
02:32:43.471 --> 02:32:43.801
<v Speaker 5>He's it.</v>

5700
02:32:43.801 --> 02:32:45.240
<v Speaker 5>He's a is a perfect example.</v>

5701
02:32:45.241 --> 02:32:45.721
<v Speaker 5>What you were saying,</v>

5702
02:32:45.721 --> 02:32:46.980
<v Speaker 5>like you'd think of a cage fighter,</v>

5703
02:32:46.981 --> 02:32:48.360
<v Speaker 5>especially a champion,</v>

5704
02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:49.590
<v Speaker 5>a championship level,</v>

5705
02:32:49.591 --> 02:32:52.590
<v Speaker 5>UFC fighter in this nicest fucking guy you ever want to meet.</v>

5706
02:32:52.591 --> 02:32:53.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5707
02:32:53.160 --> 02:32:53.490
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

5708
02:32:53.490 --> 02:32:55.140
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of those in this sport.</v>

5709
02:32:55.170 --> 02:32:58.350
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of those guys in the sport that defy the stereotypes.</v>

5710
02:32:58.660 --> 02:33:00.630
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of the things that I love about the sport and the,</v>

5711
02:33:00.631 --> 02:33:01.920
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons for that I think,</v>

5712
02:33:01.921 --> 02:33:03.960
<v Speaker 5>is that so many fighters,</v>

5713
02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:08.130
<v Speaker 5>they develop this understanding of who they really are in the gym.</v>

5714
02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:09.360
<v Speaker 5>This you can't have,</v>

5715
02:33:09.810 --> 02:33:12.600
<v Speaker 5>you can have an unchecked ego and be a basketball player.</v>

5716
02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:13.051
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5717
02:33:13.051 --> 02:33:15.840
<v Speaker 5>you could really think of the fucking greatest thing since sliced bread.</v>

5718
02:33:15.870 --> 02:33:19.320
<v Speaker 5>You're slammed Dunkin people because you're not getting strangled every day.</v>

5719
02:33:19.470 --> 02:33:21.120
<v Speaker 5>You're not getting guys with a run,</v>

5720
02:33:21.121 --> 02:33:24.630
<v Speaker 5>a fresh guy in every five minutes and they're all murderers and they're all just</v>

5721
02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:26.071
<v Speaker 5>on top of you,</v>

5722
02:33:26.071 --> 02:33:28.410
<v Speaker 5>smothering you need and you in the Dick,</v>

5723
02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:29.191
<v Speaker 5>you know you're not,</v>

5724
02:33:29.191 --> 02:33:30.240
<v Speaker 5>you're not getting that.</v>

5725
02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:35.430
<v Speaker 5>And that humility that you get from training and tapping and losing and,</v>

5726
02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:37.170
<v Speaker 5>and getting it all beaten out of you.</v>

5727
02:33:37.171 --> 02:33:42.171
<v Speaker 5>Also the aggression that you expend in the gym to just blow it all out of your</v>

5728
02:33:42.361 --> 02:33:43.080
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

5729
02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:45.420
<v Speaker 5>You don't have any need to get in fights outside.</v>

5730
02:33:45.690 --> 02:33:46.980
<v Speaker 5>And you know what I've noticed too,</v>

5731
02:33:47.010 --> 02:33:48.870
<v Speaker 5>it for me at least personally helped me a lot.</v>

5732
02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:51.720
<v Speaker 5>When you go through this really hard workouts,</v>

5733
02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:53.090
<v Speaker 5>you get on with this,</v>

5734
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:54.023
<v Speaker 5>when it's over,</v>

5735
02:33:54.210 --> 02:33:58.020
<v Speaker 5>you get this moment of almost euphoria where you gain perspective.</v>

5736
02:33:58.460 --> 02:33:58.730
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5737
02:33:58.730 --> 02:33:59.760
<v Speaker 5>and for me,</v>

5738
02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:00.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5739
02:34:00.810 --> 02:34:05.520
<v Speaker 5>MMA fighting help me with a lot of demons that I carried over that I never had</v>

5740
02:34:05.521 --> 02:34:06.071
<v Speaker 5>issues with them.</v>

5741
02:34:06.071 --> 02:34:07.230
<v Speaker 5>I in my personal life,</v>

5742
02:34:07.470 --> 02:34:07.711
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5743
02:34:07.711 --> 02:34:10.710
<v Speaker 5>because I had fighting is my outlet and you know,</v>

5744
02:34:10.711 --> 02:34:14.160
<v Speaker 5>you would finish these workouts or you'd finish a fight and have the high of</v>

5745
02:34:14.161 --> 02:34:17.890
<v Speaker 5>winning a fight and it would give you this perspective on your life and all of a</v>

5746
02:34:17.891 --> 02:34:18.100
<v Speaker 5>sudden</v>

5747
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:18.933
<v Speaker 4>you have more of this,</v>

5748
02:34:19.090 --> 02:34:22.840
<v Speaker 4>this clear thought process to make decisions and not rush decisions or see</v>

5749
02:34:22.841 --> 02:34:25.600
<v Speaker 4>things a little more clearly and not get angry about x,</v>

5750
02:34:25.601 --> 02:34:25.811
<v Speaker 4>y,</v>

5751
02:34:25.811 --> 02:34:28.990
<v Speaker 4>or z because all of a sudden now you're seeing them a little differently and you</v>

5752
02:34:28.991 --> 02:34:30.100
<v Speaker 4>get that when you're,</v>

5753
02:34:30.250 --> 02:34:31.450
<v Speaker 4>when you're exhausted.</v>

5754
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5755
02:34:32.330 --> 02:34:32.571
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5756
02:34:32.571 --> 02:34:33.091
<v Speaker 2>When you did,</v>

5757
02:34:33.091 --> 02:34:36.740
<v Speaker 2>you've expended all your biological need for aggression,</v>

5758
02:34:36.890 --> 02:34:38.030
<v Speaker 2>which men,</v>

5759
02:34:38.090 --> 02:34:39.380
<v Speaker 2>you have to stoss throne.</v>

5760
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:40.221
<v Speaker 2>You have a dick.</v>

5761
02:34:40.221 --> 02:34:40.731
<v Speaker 2>It works.</v>

5762
02:34:40.731 --> 02:34:40.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5763
02:34:40.941 --> 02:34:43.220
<v Speaker 2>this is a reason why people go to war.</v>

5764
02:34:43.221 --> 02:34:45.440
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff is a part of our genetics.</v>

5765
02:34:45.441 --> 02:34:46.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a part of our DNA.</v>

5766
02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:48.020
<v Speaker 2>And to expend it,</v>

5767
02:34:48.021 --> 02:34:53.021
<v Speaker 2>to just get it all out of your system creates this balance and that balance</v>

5768
02:34:53.870 --> 02:34:55.430
<v Speaker 2>doesn't exist in a lot of people.</v>

5769
02:34:55.431 --> 02:34:59.660
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people out there that have this unaddressed aggression inside</v>

5770
02:34:59.661 --> 02:34:59.990
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

5771
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:02.570
<v Speaker 2>That's why I see people that would never get into a fight.</v>

5772
02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:03.381
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

5773
02:35:03.381 --> 02:35:04.041
<v Speaker 2>They're in their car,</v>

5774
02:35:04.041 --> 02:35:06.530
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking finger in people and lay it on a horse.</v>

5775
02:35:06.531 --> 02:35:07.281
<v Speaker 2>I'm screaming.</v>

5776
02:35:07.281 --> 02:35:08.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is their release.</v>

5777
02:35:08.901 --> 02:35:10.670
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't have a real release.</v>

5778
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:12.830
<v Speaker 2>And so since we're not living in a world,</v>

5779
02:35:12.831 --> 02:35:17.060
<v Speaker 2>we have to worry about barbarians running over the hill with broad swords every</v>

5780
02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:20.360
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks and you're not fighting off Jaguars that are trying to kill your</v>

5781
02:35:20.361 --> 02:35:21.320
<v Speaker 2>babies and eat them.</v>

5782
02:35:21.350 --> 02:35:21.621
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

5783
02:35:21.621 --> 02:35:21.831
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5784
02:35:21.831 --> 02:35:22.220
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5785
02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:26.420
<v Speaker 2>we go through this life with all these genetic needs that are never met.</v>

5786
02:35:26.890 --> 02:35:27.201
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

5787
02:35:27.201 --> 02:35:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5788
02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:29.550
<v Speaker 2>in many ways it,</v>

5789
02:35:29.551 --> 02:35:34.310
<v Speaker 2>it's just the downfall of our culture that I've always said,</v>

5790
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:36.770
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get rid of bullying,</v>

5791
02:35:36.890 --> 02:35:37.880
<v Speaker 2>teach people how to fight.</v>

5792
02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:39.440
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people think that that's like,</v>

5793
02:35:39.441 --> 02:35:40.370
<v Speaker 2>that's counterintuitive.</v>

5794
02:35:40.371 --> 02:35:41.121
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

5795
02:35:41.121 --> 02:35:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Like you're going to make bullies that know how to fight better.</v>

5796
02:35:43.281 --> 02:35:44.560
<v Speaker 2>The stronger blue's gonna Merge,</v>

5797
02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:45.980
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna kick everybody's ass.</v>

5798
02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I bet not.</v>

5799
02:35:47.690 --> 02:35:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I bet not.</v>

5800
02:35:48.410 --> 02:35:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I bet what you're going to do is you're going to get people that have a greater</v>

5801
02:35:50.811 --> 02:35:53.330
<v Speaker 2>understanding of where this aggression is coming from,</v>

5802
02:35:53.450 --> 02:35:54.710
<v Speaker 2>where their bullying is coming.</v>

5803
02:35:54.730 --> 02:35:57.260
<v Speaker 2>They will understand this is a lot of it is insecurity.</v>

5804
02:35:57.310 --> 02:35:57.611
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

5805
02:35:57.611 --> 02:35:58.291
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

5806
02:35:58.291 --> 02:36:01.180
<v Speaker 4>It confidence is the number one deterrent for bullies.</v>

5807
02:36:01.181 --> 02:36:03.550
<v Speaker 4>If bully bullies don't bully confident kids,</v>

5808
02:36:03.551 --> 02:36:04.360
<v Speaker 4>they just don't.</v>

5809
02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:08.410
<v Speaker 4>If there's a possible threat that that kid may hit you back or,</v>

5810
02:36:08.411 --> 02:36:09.550
<v Speaker 4>or may actually beat you,</v>

5811
02:36:09.551 --> 02:36:10.450
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to bully you.</v>

5812
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:12.100
<v Speaker 4>And so I would talk to parents,</v>

5813
02:36:12.101 --> 02:36:12.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5814
02:36:12.281 --> 02:36:13.330
<v Speaker 4>when I would teach kids,</v>

5815
02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:14.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5816
02:36:14.010 --> 02:36:15.100
<v Speaker 4>all the time that look,</v>

5817
02:36:15.101 --> 02:36:15.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5818
02:36:15.790 --> 02:36:17.980
<v Speaker 4>learning to defend yourself as a life skill.</v>

5819
02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:20.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a life skill to learn how to do that.</v>

5820
02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:22.150
<v Speaker 4>And it gives you,</v>

5821
02:36:22.151 --> 02:36:23.650
<v Speaker 4>it bleeds into other areas.</v>

5822
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:24.101
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5823
02:36:24.101 --> 02:36:27.160
<v Speaker 4>if you can push yourself and get comfortable as in these really uncomfortable</v>

5824
02:36:27.161 --> 02:36:27.994
<v Speaker 4>situations,</v>

5825
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:30.700
<v Speaker 4>it's going to help you when you have to go and maybe speak in front of the</v>

5826
02:36:30.701 --> 02:36:31.360
<v Speaker 4>class.</v>

5827
02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:31.481
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5828
02:36:31.481 --> 02:36:34.290
<v Speaker 4>the first time you grapple against somebody with all that Pr,</v>

5829
02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:35.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean you get the kids get nervous.</v>

5830
02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:36.640
<v Speaker 4>And when I would train,</v>

5831
02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:39.610
<v Speaker 4>I would train marines and the first time it would make them grapple.</v>

5832
02:36:39.611 --> 02:36:39.911
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

5833
02:36:39.911 --> 02:36:41.680
<v Speaker 4>I had one that threw up right after.</v>

5834
02:36:42.190 --> 02:36:43.001
<v Speaker 4>There's so much pride.</v>

5835
02:36:43.001 --> 02:36:43.780
<v Speaker 4>They were afraid.</v>

5836
02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:47.470
<v Speaker 4>I got tapped out for all my other classmates and it's such an Alpha Male,</v>

5837
02:36:47.471 --> 02:36:47.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5838
02:36:47.831 --> 02:36:48.461
<v Speaker 4>play and,</v>

5839
02:36:48.461 --> 02:36:51.040
<v Speaker 4>and they got so nervous a couple of weeks later.</v>

5840
02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:51.431
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5841
02:36:51.431 --> 02:36:53.950
<v Speaker 4>they're all in and they're comfortable in that environment.</v>

5842
02:36:54.130 --> 02:36:56.080
<v Speaker 4>Maybe now public speaking comes more,</v>

5843
02:36:56.081 --> 02:36:56.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5844
02:36:56.501 --> 02:36:57.071
<v Speaker 4>more naturally.</v>

5845
02:36:57.071 --> 02:36:57.461
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>

5846
02:36:57.461 --> 02:36:59.140
<v Speaker 4>they get that fear and they get over it.</v>

5847
02:36:59.141 --> 02:37:00.850
<v Speaker 4>That bleeds into other areas of your life.</v>

5848
02:37:00.970 --> 02:37:01.803
<v Speaker 4>No doubt.</v>

5849
02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:02.080
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5850
02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've seen people in class for the first time hyperventilating,</v>

5851
02:37:05.380 --> 02:37:07.410
<v Speaker 2>not like guys who've done all sorts of sports,</v>

5852
02:37:07.530 --> 02:37:10.200
<v Speaker 2>but someone mounts him and all sudden you see them like they can't fucking</v>

5853
02:37:10.201 --> 02:37:10.891
<v Speaker 2>breathe and you're like,</v>

5854
02:37:10.891 --> 02:37:11.724
<v Speaker 2>calm down dude.</v>

5855
02:37:11.850 --> 02:37:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Think of this as a game.</v>

5856
02:37:12.991 --> 02:37:13.920
<v Speaker 2>You're playing pool here,</v>

5857
02:37:13.921 --> 02:37:14.970
<v Speaker 2>you're playing basketball.</v>

5858
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.771
<v Speaker 2>It's a game.</v>

5859
02:37:15.771 --> 02:37:16.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

5860
02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:17.900
<v Speaker 2>it's game of arm bars and chokes.</v>

5861
02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:18.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5862
02:37:18.311 --> 02:37:20.360
<v Speaker 2>you mess around with some of these pro football players.</v>

5863
02:37:20.361 --> 02:37:20.601
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5864
02:37:20.601 --> 02:37:20.801
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

5865
02:37:20.801 --> 02:37:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I've spent some time with Glaser who trains a lot of those NFL guys.</v>

5866
02:37:23.780 --> 02:37:27.050
<v Speaker 2>You mess around with them and you start dominating them and they start to panic.</v>

5867
02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Their egos are so big and there's so you wait a minute,</v>

5868
02:37:30.411 --> 02:37:33.140
<v Speaker 2>why is this smaller guy than me doing to me what he's doing?</v>

5869
02:37:33.141 --> 02:37:34.850
<v Speaker 2>And they begin to panic and hyperventilate.</v>

5870
02:37:34.851 --> 02:37:35.684
<v Speaker 2>Just like you said.</v>

5871
02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also football players.</v>

5872
02:37:37.970 --> 02:37:39.200
<v Speaker 2>They never really go.</v>

5873
02:37:39.201 --> 02:37:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean they kind of go one on one,</v>

5874
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:44.570
<v Speaker 2>but for these brief moments and then whistles are blown,</v>

5875
02:37:44.571 --> 02:37:46.650
<v Speaker 2>flags are raised seconds.</v>

5876
02:37:47.330 --> 02:37:52.100
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have that dig down deep Frankie Edgar type heart and very few</v>

5877
02:37:52.101 --> 02:37:52.611
<v Speaker 2>of them do.</v>

5878
02:37:52.611 --> 02:37:56.300
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so rare when you see a guy like Hershel Walker subjects himself</v>

5879
02:37:56.301 --> 02:38:00.530
<v Speaker 2>to that shit in his late forties what a fucking stud that guy is.</v>

5880
02:38:00.531 --> 02:38:02.330
<v Speaker 2>He's the scariest guy of all time,</v>

5881
02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:03.800
<v Speaker 2>48 years old,</v>

5882
02:38:03.801 --> 02:38:06.620
<v Speaker 2>smashing people in strike force and you just go,</v>

5883
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:07.060
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

5884
02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:11.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean he probably would be like John Jones if he started into his ego his young</v>

5885
02:38:11.601 --> 02:38:12.020
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

5886
02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean the athleticism he had and little his physique at that age,</v>

5887
02:38:14.991 --> 02:38:16.490
<v Speaker 2>you just push ups and sit ups.</v>

5888
02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:17.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe him.</v>

5889
02:38:17.810 --> 02:38:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

5890
02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Cause he says a lot of shit that's just not scientifically possible.</v>

5891
02:38:22.310 --> 02:38:22.851
<v Speaker 2>Like he says,</v>

5892
02:38:22.851 --> 02:38:27.851
<v Speaker 2>he only eats a salad and one meal a day that's a here to fucking be so skinny.</v>

5893
02:38:28.430 --> 02:38:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5894
02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:30.830
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think he's the lion.</v>

5895
02:38:30.890 --> 02:38:31.760
<v Speaker 2>This is what I think.</v>

5896
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:32.181
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5897
02:38:32.181 --> 02:38:35.060
<v Speaker 2>he has trauma induced,</v>

5898
02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:35.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5899
02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:40.610
<v Speaker 2>issues that he's had from football where he has multiple personality disorder.</v>

5900
02:38:40.850 --> 02:38:41.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5901
02:38:41.181 --> 02:38:43.160
<v Speaker 2>he's spoken openly about those,</v>

5902
02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:45.950
<v Speaker 2>that he has more than one person inside of his head.</v>

5903
02:38:45.951 --> 02:38:50.660
<v Speaker 2>And I know he's dealt with this variety of different ways.</v>

5904
02:38:50.661 --> 02:38:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Therapy.</v>

5905
02:38:51.390 --> 02:38:51.561
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5906
02:38:51.561 --> 02:38:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if he's on medication,</v>

5907
02:38:53.031 --> 02:38:53.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the deal is,</v>

5908
02:38:53.931 --> 02:38:58.130
<v Speaker 2>but if you have multiple personalities and they're all living inside of your</v>

5909
02:38:58.131 --> 02:38:58.640
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

5910
02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:00.590
<v Speaker 2>you might have one guy who just eats soup.</v>

5911
02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:06.050
<v Speaker 2>The fuck is another guy doing dead lifts and eating fucking steak.</v>

5912
02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5913
02:39:06.890 --> 02:39:10.730
<v Speaker 2>That guy just doesn't talk to you as a guy that you don't,</v>

5914
02:39:10.910 --> 02:39:11.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5915
02:39:11.211 --> 02:39:11.781
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

5916
02:39:11.781 --> 02:39:11.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5917
02:39:11.991 --> 02:39:13.280
<v Speaker 2>I think it for sure.</v>

5918
02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:17.450
<v Speaker 2>He definitely did a lot of his exercises just doing chin ups and pushups and</v>

5919
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.841
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

5920
02:39:17.841 --> 02:39:18.680
<v Speaker 2>if you do enough of them,</v>

5921
02:39:18.681 --> 02:39:19.940
<v Speaker 2>you can get pretty fucking swole.</v>

5922
02:39:19.970 --> 02:39:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5923
02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:24.410
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guys who calisthenics and build them a great body,</v>

5924
02:39:24.411 --> 02:39:25.790
<v Speaker 2>but you're getting all set.</v>

5925
02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:28.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting on this really serious scientific risk.</v>

5926
02:39:29.230 --> 02:39:31.270
<v Speaker 2>There may be one due to eat soup inside it.</v>

5927
02:39:31.310 --> 02:39:31.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5928
02:39:31.551 --> 02:39:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it is.</v>

5929
02:39:32.601 --> 02:39:32.991
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

5930
02:39:32.991 --> 02:39:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5931
02:39:33.780 --> 02:39:38.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of crazy that he went into MMA after this trauma induced multiple</v>

5932
02:39:39.681 --> 02:39:43.550
<v Speaker 2>personality disorder and I don't mean not necessarily trauma physically,</v>

5933
02:39:43.551 --> 02:39:46.880
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a lot of emotional trauma and mental trauma as well.</v>

5934
02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:51.020
<v Speaker 2>But then again also a lifelong career of getting hit in the end.</v>

5935
02:39:51.021 --> 02:39:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5936
02:39:51.410 --> 02:39:54.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean the collisions that that guy was a part of our on record,</v>

5937
02:39:54.741 --> 02:39:57.410
<v Speaker 2>you can watch them and nobody rides for free.</v>

5938
02:39:57.411 --> 02:39:59.300
<v Speaker 2>They're all just fucking crash into each other.</v>

5939
02:39:59.301 --> 02:40:04.301
<v Speaker 2>Super Athletes sprinting full blast and fucking elbows and head to head</v>

5940
02:40:04.521 --> 02:40:07.370
<v Speaker 2>collisions and back before there was this concussion protocol.</v>

5941
02:40:07.371 --> 02:40:07.731
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

5942
02:40:07.731 --> 02:40:09.950
<v Speaker 2>where guys get them now and they're out for weeks,</v>

5943
02:40:10.460 --> 02:40:11.000
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>

5944
02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.070
<v Speaker 2>you're back the next play back then,</v>

5945
02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:18.100
<v Speaker 2>what do you think is the number of times where a person can be knocked out</v>

5946
02:40:18.831 --> 02:40:20.870
<v Speaker 2>before the athletic commission steps in and says,</v>

5947
02:40:20.871 --> 02:40:21.704
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

5948
02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:22.760
<v Speaker 2>this is enough?</v>

5949
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

5950
02:40:23.300 --> 02:40:24.030
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>

5951
02:40:24.030 --> 02:40:24.930
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

5952
02:40:24.931 --> 02:40:25.171
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5953
02:40:25.171 --> 02:40:25.380
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

5954
02:40:25.380 --> 02:40:26.250
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

5955
02:40:26.251 --> 02:40:29.340
<v Speaker 4>I think at the athletic commissions need to have a limit to where it,</v>

5956
02:40:29.370 --> 02:40:29.851
<v Speaker 4>once you,</v>

5957
02:40:29.851 --> 02:40:32.310
<v Speaker 4>if you get knocked out three times,</v>

5958
02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:33.181
<v Speaker 4>then you,</v>

5959
02:40:33.181 --> 02:40:36.810
<v Speaker 4>I think you should have to go in front of a board to get your license in my</v>

5960
02:40:36.811 --> 02:40:38.340
<v Speaker 4>opinion and I'm sure that you know,</v>

5961
02:40:38.341 --> 02:40:41.780
<v Speaker 4>I haven't fully thought through this to cover also for people started bashing me</v>

5962
02:40:41.781 --> 02:40:42.510
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

5963
02:40:42.510 --> 02:40:44.730
<v Speaker 4>but look you and you can defend yourself.</v>

5964
02:40:44.731 --> 02:40:45.270
<v Speaker 4>Hey Look,</v>

5965
02:40:45.270 --> 02:40:47.430
<v Speaker 4>you know I've got three but in this one I'm not out.</v>

5966
02:40:47.431 --> 02:40:48.450
<v Speaker 4>The ref stops this,</v>

5967
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.930
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

5968
02:40:48.930 --> 02:40:49.890
<v Speaker 4>I was exhausted.</v>

5969
02:40:49.891 --> 02:40:52.650
<v Speaker 4>You could visually and then you have,</v>

5970
02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:52.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5971
02:40:52.951 --> 02:40:56.280
<v Speaker 4>a panel at the organization's involved to make a decision on whether you can be</v>

5972
02:40:56.281 --> 02:40:57.060
<v Speaker 4>commissioned again.</v>

5973
02:40:57.060 --> 02:41:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you think if this is the case and if we're really going to be careful about</v>

5974
02:41:01.111 --> 02:41:01.291
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

5975
02:41:01.291 --> 02:41:06.291
<v Speaker 2>do you think that fighter's should be required to film training sessions so that</v>

5976
02:41:06.751 --> 02:41:10.830
<v Speaker 2>we can review so that we know exactly like if you're sparring,</v>

5977
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:12.023
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

5978
02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:15.480
<v Speaker 2>like you know how many times guys been knocked out in the gym?</v>

5979
02:41:15.650 --> 02:41:15.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5980
02:41:15.951 --> 02:41:16.220
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5981
02:41:16.220 --> 02:41:18.920
<v Speaker 4>it'd be tough because they don't think they have the capital to put in the right</v>

5982
02:41:18.921 --> 02:41:19.720
<v Speaker 4>kind of equipment.</v>

5983
02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so either.</v>

5984
02:41:20.561 --> 02:41:21.520
<v Speaker 2>But I mean if,</v>

5985
02:41:21.790 --> 02:41:26.790
<v Speaker 2>if you can go $40,000 for a fucking blood test and they have 500 fighters that</v>

5986
02:41:27.671 --> 02:41:29.290
<v Speaker 2>are possibly subject to this,</v>

5987
02:41:29.291 --> 02:41:30.420
<v Speaker 2>if they make it too,</v>

5988
02:41:31.590 --> 02:41:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean most guys are just going to get urine tested up until a certain point in</v>

5989
02:41:35.231 --> 02:41:35.980
<v Speaker 2>their career,</v>

5990
02:41:35.980 --> 02:41:37.870
<v Speaker 2>but then they get to a certain point and you're going to,</v>

5991
02:41:37.930 --> 02:41:41.110
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to go through the full water testing.</v>

5992
02:41:41.410 --> 02:41:42.250
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case.</v>

5993
02:41:42.251 --> 02:41:42.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5994
02:41:42.431 --> 02:41:44.560
<v Speaker 2>how much does it cost to put Gopros and gyms?</v>

5995
02:41:44.770 --> 02:41:44.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5996
02:41:44.981 --> 02:41:45.850
<v Speaker 2>how much does it cost to me,</v>

5997
02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:50.470
<v Speaker 2>there's ones that we have now that are wifi enabled.</v>

5998
02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:55.620
<v Speaker 2>They can all be linked up to a UFC database and the UFC could be monitored or at</v>

5999
02:41:56.861 --> 02:42:00.430
<v Speaker 2>least storing all of the footage of,</v>

6000
02:42:00.460 --> 02:42:00.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6001
02:42:00.701 --> 02:42:03.370
<v Speaker 2>all these gyms and then make them sign contracts like saying,</v>

6002
02:42:03.371 --> 02:42:03.850
<v Speaker 2>look it,</v>

6003
02:42:03.850 --> 02:42:05.380
<v Speaker 2>you have to let us know if you're,</v>

6004
02:42:05.381 --> 02:42:07.660
<v Speaker 2>you're sustaining a concussion in the gym.</v>

6005
02:42:07.660 --> 02:42:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Like there's so many fights where you see guys get knocked out,</v>

6006
02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:11.471
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

6007
02:42:11.471 --> 02:42:15.070
<v Speaker 2>well that doesn't even look right cause you know that that guy got knocked out</v>

6008
02:42:15.071 --> 02:42:16.450
<v Speaker 2>in the gym a bunch of times.</v>

6009
02:42:16.780 --> 02:42:17.613
<v Speaker 2>Like um,</v>

6010
02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:18.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6011
02:42:18.340 --> 02:42:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Travis Luder versus who's the guy that veto for Marvin Eastman?</v>

6012
02:42:22.450 --> 02:42:23.520
<v Speaker 2>You ever remember that fight?</v>

6013
02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Marvin Eastman?</v>

6014
02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:26.860
<v Speaker 2>The word was that he got knocked out not once,</v>

6015
02:42:26.861 --> 02:42:31.240
<v Speaker 2>but twice in camp leading up to that fight once by Tito Ortiz,</v>

6016
02:42:31.241 --> 02:42:33.330
<v Speaker 2>he got hit with a knee or something and once in,</v>

6017
02:42:33.370 --> 02:42:35.290
<v Speaker 2>during a take down he got knocked out again.</v>

6018
02:42:35.470 --> 02:42:38.890
<v Speaker 2>So you're dealing with a guy who had like six serious trauma.</v>

6019
02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:41.320
<v Speaker 2>And then Travis catches him with a punch,</v>

6020
02:42:41.321 --> 02:42:42.760
<v Speaker 2>which is a pretty decent punch,</v>

6021
02:42:43.060 --> 02:42:44.440
<v Speaker 2>but it catches him on the end of it.</v>

6022
02:42:44.590 --> 02:42:45.820
<v Speaker 2>And Marvin goes down,</v>

6023
02:42:45.821 --> 02:42:47.800
<v Speaker 2>like he got shot by a sniper rifle</v>

6024
02:42:48.470 --> 02:42:49.081
<v Speaker 4>Jitsu guy,</v>

6025
02:42:49.081 --> 02:42:50.550
<v Speaker 4>knocks out the striker out of nowhere.</v>

6026
02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Travis get hit hard.</v>

6027
02:42:51.710 --> 02:42:52.511
<v Speaker 2>He's a tough guy,</v>

6028
02:42:52.511 --> 02:42:54.700
<v Speaker 2>but it was just a weird Kao.</v>

6029
02:42:54.701 --> 02:42:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

6030
02:42:55.020 --> 02:42:55.260
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

6031
02:42:55.260 --> 02:42:55.921
<v Speaker 4>Same thing happened.</v>

6032
02:42:55.921 --> 02:42:56.551
<v Speaker 4>Rashad Evans,</v>

6033
02:42:56.551 --> 02:42:57.510
<v Speaker 4>when he fought loaded Machida,</v>

6034
02:42:58.170 --> 02:42:59.820
<v Speaker 4>his last sparring session,</v>

6035
02:42:59.970 --> 02:43:01.590
<v Speaker 4>he got rocked bat,</v>

6036
02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:04.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean dropped and he got hit in the same exact spot in the Cheetah would</v>

6037
02:43:04.741 --> 02:43:05.970
<v Speaker 4>eventually knock them out it by who?</v>

6038
02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:07.141
<v Speaker 4>Oh Gosh,</v>

6039
02:43:07.141 --> 02:43:07.974
<v Speaker 4>you that wasn't,</v>

6040
02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:10.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was Jardeen.</v>

6041
02:43:11.770 --> 02:43:12.581
<v Speaker 4>I'm forgetting who,</v>

6042
02:43:12.581 --> 02:43:12.940
<v Speaker 4>but I remember,</v>

6043
02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:13.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6044
02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:15.250
<v Speaker 4>he could tell the story better than I,</v>

6045
02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:15.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

6046
02:43:15.450 --> 02:43:18.160
<v Speaker 4>I've heard the Forrest Griffin leading up to the Anderson Silva fight was</v>

6047
02:43:18.161 --> 02:43:19.510
<v Speaker 4>knocked out pretty badly too.</v>

6048
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:21.830
<v Speaker 4>And the way he used to spar him.</v>

6049
02:43:21.831 --> 02:43:22.330
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

6050
02:43:22.330 --> 02:43:22.751
<v Speaker 4>I used to,</v>

6051
02:43:22.751 --> 02:43:22.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6052
02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:23.920
<v Speaker 4>I've sparred with him.</v>

6053
02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6054
02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:28.060
<v Speaker 4>I sparred with him three days,</v>

6055
02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:30.610
<v Speaker 4>three days after I got back from my second tour in Iraq.</v>

6056
02:43:30.850 --> 02:43:32.290
<v Speaker 4>I still had sand in my ears.</v>

6057
02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:32.861
<v Speaker 4>And Scott,</v>

6058
02:43:32.861 --> 02:43:33.730
<v Speaker 4>never Scott Adams.</v>

6059
02:43:33.731 --> 02:43:34.930
<v Speaker 4>The matchmaker if the WC.</v>

6060
02:43:34.931 --> 02:43:35.764
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

6061
02:43:35.780 --> 02:43:36.521
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

6062
02:43:36.521 --> 02:43:36.641
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

6063
02:43:36.641 --> 02:43:36.851
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

6064
02:43:36.851 --> 02:43:37.870
<v Speaker 4>I need to get you out here real quick.</v>

6065
02:43:37.870 --> 02:43:38.860
<v Speaker 4>I need you a photo shoot.</v>

6066
02:43:38.861 --> 02:43:39.760
<v Speaker 4>We're going to promote your fight,</v>

6067
02:43:39.761 --> 02:43:40.001

02:43:41.310 --> 02:43:41.880
<v Speaker 4>and I'd just,</v>

6070
02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:42.250
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

6071
02:43:42.250 --> 02:43:44.680
<v Speaker 4>I'll go to Vegas and bring my wife sight see a little bit.</v>

6072
02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:45.250
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

6073
02:43:45.250 --> 02:43:48.670
<v Speaker 4>We go straight to this gym and I'm in a ring.</v>

6074
02:43:48.671 --> 02:43:51.400
<v Speaker 4>I had to borrow all this care of no mouthpiece and he's like,</v>

6075
02:43:51.401 --> 02:43:51.521
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

6076
02:43:51.521 --> 02:43:52.540
<v Speaker 4>I want you to spar this guy.</v>

6077
02:43:52.541 --> 02:43:53.021
<v Speaker 4>You need to get,</v>

6078
02:43:53.021 --> 02:43:53.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6079
02:43:53.201 --> 02:43:54.760
<v Speaker 4>you need to get back in the gym and get in shape.</v>

6080
02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.140
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea who the guy is.</v>

6081
02:43:56.141 --> 02:43:57.700
<v Speaker 4>I just know he's way bigger than me.</v>

6082
02:43:58.050 --> 02:44:01.030
<v Speaker 4>Turns out it's Roy Nelson and the coach goes,</v>

6083
02:44:01.031 --> 02:44:02.170
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do five minute rounds.</v>

6084
02:44:02.171 --> 02:44:02.320
<v Speaker 4>Guys.</v>

6085
02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:03.610
<v Speaker 4>I had never done five minutes before.</v>

6086
02:44:03.850 --> 02:44:05.380
<v Speaker 4>I thought you only did that fights like,</v>

6087
02:44:05.390 --> 02:44:06.011
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy.</v>

6088
02:44:06.011 --> 02:44:06.910
<v Speaker 4>Nobody does five rounds.</v>

6089
02:44:07.390 --> 02:44:10.240
<v Speaker 4>Roy's hitting me with these overhand rights and dude,</v>

6090
02:44:10.241 --> 02:44:12.370
<v Speaker 4>sand is still flying out of my ears.</v>

6091
02:44:12.370 --> 02:44:12.521
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

6092
02:44:12.521 --> 02:44:12.701
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6093
02:44:12.701 --> 02:44:13.630
<v Speaker 4>it was bad.</v>

6094
02:44:13.631 --> 02:44:16.630
<v Speaker 4>It was literally survival mode two times.</v>

6095
02:44:16.631 --> 02:44:17.261
<v Speaker 4>He almost knocked me.</v>

6096
02:44:17.261 --> 02:44:17.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6097
02:44:17.501 --> 02:44:18.000
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>

6098
02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.100
<v Speaker 4>you like the rocky four up and over the ropes in any,</v>

6099
02:44:21.101 --> 02:44:22.120
<v Speaker 4>threw me back in.</v>

6100
02:44:22.510 --> 02:44:24.310
<v Speaker 4>And then as soon as we finished there,</v>

6101
02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:25.461
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

6102
02:44:25.461 --> 02:44:25.690
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6103
02:44:25.690 --> 02:44:26.770
<v Speaker 4>that's morning sparring here.</v>

6104
02:44:26.771 --> 02:44:28.940
<v Speaker 4>We're going to go to sparring over at Randy couture's new gym.</v>

6105
02:44:28.941 --> 02:44:29.181
<v Speaker 4>So I'd,</v>

6106
02:44:29.181 --> 02:44:31.180
<v Speaker 4>I'd go down there and it's Forrest Griffin.</v>

6107
02:44:31.181 --> 02:44:32.140
<v Speaker 4>I've got no mouth piece.</v>

6108
02:44:32.141 --> 02:44:32.501
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

6109
02:44:32.501 --> 02:44:32.860
<v Speaker 4>the kosher,</v>

6110
02:44:32.860 --> 02:44:33.041
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

6111
02:44:33.041 --> 02:44:34.360
<v Speaker 4>he's got no mouthpiece for,</v>

6112
02:44:34.361 --> 02:44:36.160
<v Speaker 4>she's in the military's got free dental chips.</v>

6113
02:44:36.161 --> 02:44:36.994
<v Speaker 4>My teeth.</v>

6114
02:44:37.150 --> 02:44:37.361
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6115
02:44:37.361 --> 02:44:39.220
<v Speaker 4>but he used to get after it.</v>

6116
02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:39.611
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6117
02:44:39.611 --> 02:44:41.830
<v Speaker 4>spark as hard as humanly possible.</v>

6118
02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:42.611
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6119
02:44:42.611 --> 02:44:43.444
<v Speaker 4>Well look at him now.</v>

6120
02:44:43.450 --> 02:44:43.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6121
02:44:43.780 --> 02:44:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Fucked up now because of it.</v>

6122
02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:45.160
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

6123
02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:46.660
<v Speaker 4>he's his shoulder so bad.</v>

6124
02:44:46.661 --> 02:44:47.630
<v Speaker 4>I can't even brush his teeth.</v>

6125
02:44:47.631 --> 02:44:48.370
<v Speaker 4>And supposedly,</v>

6126
02:44:48.370 --> 02:44:49.203
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

6127
02:44:49.470 --> 02:44:51.350
<v Speaker 4>he's apparently he's right shoulder.</v>

6128
02:44:51.351 --> 02:44:51.791
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

6129
02:44:51.791 --> 02:44:52.930
<v Speaker 4>it's just not working.</v>

6130
02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:54.041
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6131
02:44:54.041 --> 02:44:54.581
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's,</v>

6132
02:44:54.581 --> 02:44:56.620
<v Speaker 4>he's lost a lot of mass when he looked at them.</v>

6133
02:44:56.650 --> 02:44:57.250
<v Speaker 4>Get all these,</v>

6134
02:44:57.250 --> 02:44:58.750
<v Speaker 4>had a lot of atrophy in his body.</v>

6135
02:44:59.170 --> 02:44:59.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6136
02:44:59.530 --> 02:45:02.350
<v Speaker 4>that guy fought fucking hard and trained hard.</v>

6137
02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:02.891
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6138
02:45:02.891 --> 02:45:05.120
<v Speaker 4>Randy couture always said nobody works harder than forest green.</v>

6139
02:45:05.121 --> 02:45:05.954
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6140
02:45:06.020 --> 02:45:06.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6141
02:45:06.210 --> 02:45:07.720
<v Speaker 4>But it's not always work hard.</v>

6142
02:45:07.721 --> 02:45:07.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6143
02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:08.531
<v Speaker 4>It's work.</v>

6144
02:45:08.531 --> 02:45:11.200
<v Speaker 4>Smart guys are getting so much smarter about that now.</v>

6145
02:45:11.201 --> 02:45:11.381
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6146
02:45:11.381 --> 02:45:12.071
<v Speaker 4>you look at like,</v>

6147
02:45:12.071 --> 02:45:13.360
<v Speaker 4>you know a guy like Anthony who's been,</v>

6148
02:45:13.390 --> 02:45:13.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6149
02:45:13.571 --> 02:45:14.950
<v Speaker 4>he's been injured frequently,</v>

6150
02:45:14.951 --> 02:45:18.010
<v Speaker 4>but he's had to change his whole training residence that he yes,</v>

6151
02:45:18.011 --> 02:45:18.701
<v Speaker 4>he gets himself,</v>

6152
02:45:18.701 --> 02:45:21.760
<v Speaker 4>they're healthy cowboy Serone for as crazy as he is,</v>

6153
02:45:21.970 --> 02:45:22.391
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>

6154
02:45:22.391 --> 02:45:22.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6155
02:45:22.540 --> 02:45:23.680
<v Speaker 4>three fights ago.</v>

6156
02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:25.900
<v Speaker 4>He got dinged a little bit in practice.</v>

6157
02:45:25.901 --> 02:45:28.510
<v Speaker 4>He just eliminated sparring and just stopped doing it.</v>

6158
02:45:28.511 --> 02:45:30.430
<v Speaker 4>That entire camp does a lot.</v>

6159
02:45:30.431 --> 02:45:33.160
<v Speaker 4>He does a lot less now than people realize.</v>

6160
02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:37.420
<v Speaker 4>And in everybody he spars with is someone hand selected and that understands,</v>

6161
02:45:37.421 --> 02:45:38.500
<v Speaker 4>and this is a wild man,</v>

6162
02:45:38.501 --> 02:45:39.281
<v Speaker 4>but he knows,</v>

6163
02:45:39.281 --> 02:45:39.521
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

6164
02:45:39.521 --> 02:45:40.090
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

6165
02:45:40.090 --> 02:45:40.990
<v Speaker 4>things are changing.</v>

6166
02:45:40.991 --> 02:45:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Coaches are finally sort of relates because back when I was fighting,</v>

6167
02:45:43.331 --> 02:45:47.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean none of these coaches actually fought in the Onco,</v>

6168
02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:48.410
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6169
02:45:48.410 --> 02:45:50.230
<v Speaker 4>They were playing jazz at that point.</v>

6170
02:45:50.231 --> 02:45:52.980
<v Speaker 4>Nobody really knew the formula to how to win in this state.</v>

6171
02:45:52.981 --> 02:45:53.860
<v Speaker 4>They acted like it,</v>

6172
02:45:53.861 --> 02:45:56.560
<v Speaker 4>but now they're finally starting to learn and now we're starting to have guys</v>

6173
02:45:56.561 --> 02:46:00.850
<v Speaker 4>like Ludwig who grew up doing it and now it's switched to the other side and</v>

6174
02:46:00.851 --> 02:46:04.060
<v Speaker 4>become a coach or seeing more guys like that as well that understand,</v>

6175
02:46:04.061 --> 02:46:04.630
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

6176
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:06.610
<v Speaker 4>you got to hold these guys back from themselves,</v>

6177
02:46:06.611 --> 02:46:07.391
<v Speaker 4>pulled them back,</v>

6178
02:46:07.391 --> 02:46:08.141
<v Speaker 4>train less,</v>

6179
02:46:08.141 --> 02:46:12.140
<v Speaker 4>less rounds them healthy to the fight and there'll be way more productive.</v>

6180
02:46:12.590 --> 02:46:12.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6181
02:46:12.891 --> 02:46:16.310
<v Speaker 2>it's really going to be interesting to see what Duke roof is does with cm punk</v>

6182
02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:19.580
<v Speaker 2>because Duke Roufus is essentially taking this guy once,</v>

6183
02:46:19.610 --> 02:46:22.370
<v Speaker 2>I read this article today where they're interviewing Duke and he said,</v>

6184
02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:22.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6185
02:46:22.671 --> 02:46:24.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to build this guy up from the,</v>

6186
02:46:24.410 --> 02:46:25.340
<v Speaker 2>from the ground up,</v>

6187
02:46:25.610 --> 02:46:27.080
<v Speaker 2>and he's not gonna spar with anybody but me.</v>

6188
02:46:27.380 --> 02:46:27.741
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

6189
02:46:27.741 --> 02:46:28.100
<v Speaker 2>he's got,</v>

6190
02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have him spot with me because I know that no one's going to hurt</v>

6191
02:46:30.711 --> 02:46:30.840
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

6192
02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:31.101
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

6193
02:46:31.101 --> 02:46:33.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have give them have total control,</v>

6194
02:46:33.350 --> 02:46:34.101
<v Speaker 2>but I'm gonna correct.</v>

6195
02:46:34.101 --> 02:46:38.360
<v Speaker 2>All of them is mistakes and it's a great call to have a guy like Duke do that</v>

6196
02:46:38.361 --> 02:46:42.410
<v Speaker 2>because he is a master striker and a master instructor and he couldn't get a</v>

6197
02:46:42.411 --> 02:46:44.990
<v Speaker 2>better coach for MMA for striking in MMA.</v>

6198
02:46:45.140 --> 02:46:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I put him right up there with Dwayne and with for Rasa hobby and you know,</v>

6199
02:46:49.611 --> 02:46:50.840
<v Speaker 2>all the Matt Hume,</v>

6200
02:46:50.841 --> 02:46:51.680
<v Speaker 2>all the great guys.</v>

6201
02:46:52.010 --> 02:46:57.010
<v Speaker 2>But I think that a guy like that is like an interesting sort of a test ground.</v>

6202
02:46:57.800 --> 02:46:58.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6203
02:46:58.310 --> 02:46:59.860
<v Speaker 2>first of all for the,</v>

6204
02:47:00.230 --> 02:47:03.710
<v Speaker 2>the public's just let me just credibility.</v>

6205
02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:04.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>

6206
02:47:04.151 --> 02:47:06.680
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a guy who was no amateur wrestling bouts,</v>

6207
02:47:06.860 --> 02:47:08.270
<v Speaker 2>no amateur karate belts,</v>

6208
02:47:08.450 --> 02:47:09.860
<v Speaker 2>no amateur kickboxing bowels,</v>

6209
02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:11.120
<v Speaker 2>no amateur boxing bouts,</v>

6210
02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:12.380
<v Speaker 2>no sumo,</v>

6211
02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:13.513
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

6212
02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Just pro-wrestling.</v>

6213
02:47:15.350 --> 02:47:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

6214
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:16.101
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

6215
02:47:16.101 --> 02:47:16.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6216
02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:17.031
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>

6217
02:47:17.031 --> 02:47:18.860
<v Speaker 2>So he's some sort of an athlete.</v>

6218
02:47:18.890 --> 02:47:21.710
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's in good shape down a little Jiu Jitsu training.</v>

6219
02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:22.221
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6220
02:47:22.221 --> 02:47:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I dunno how much she wears a white belt.</v>

6221
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6222
02:47:24.410 --> 02:47:25.130
<v Speaker 2>that ain't good.</v>

6223
02:47:25.130 --> 02:47:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

6224
02:47:25.550 --> 02:47:26.383
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>

6225
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:27.411
<v Speaker 2>he's getting there,</v>

6226
02:47:27.411 --> 02:47:30.440
<v Speaker 2>he's going to fight in the UFC and a lot of people have issues with it.</v>

6227
02:47:30.441 --> 02:47:30.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6228
02:47:30.591 --> 02:47:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones said he hopes he gets knocked out,</v>

6229
02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:33.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6230
02:47:33.441 --> 02:47:34.190
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

6231
02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of people that find a Ben [inaudible] pissed is all hell</v>

6232
02:47:37.910 --> 02:47:39.080
<v Speaker 2>with a good right to be</v>

6233
02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:40.280
<v Speaker 4>and he's going to be coaching him now.</v>

6234
02:47:40.330 --> 02:47:40.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6235
02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:41.750
<v Speaker 4>he absolutely right to be</v>

6236
02:47:42.090 --> 02:47:42.361
<v Speaker 2>Ben.</v>

6237
02:47:42.361 --> 02:47:42.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6238
02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:45.570
<v Speaker 2>they will say Ben has and doesn't have enough experience than the UFC hires is</v>

6239
02:47:45.571 --> 02:47:49.230
<v Speaker 2>zero and zero guy to fight in the fucking UFC.</v>

6240
02:47:49.250 --> 02:47:50.910
<v Speaker 2>And against who though?</v>

6241
02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Another guy that they're going to handpick for that zero and zero guy who also</v>

6242
02:47:55.020 --> 02:47:56.370
<v Speaker 2>doesn't belong in the UFC,</v>

6243
02:47:56.640 --> 02:47:58.980
<v Speaker 2>which is going to be really fascinating.</v>

6244
02:47:59.010 --> 02:47:59.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6245
02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:02.190
<v Speaker 2>how do they make it compelling match for cm punk?</v>

6246
02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:05.510
<v Speaker 4>I think him by himself is that compelling?</v>

6247
02:48:05.511 --> 02:48:10.511
<v Speaker 4>He has such a draw and that people want to see him come out of character who</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6288
02:48:56.731 --> 02:48:58.170
<v Speaker 4>where they're going with it as well.</v>

6289
02:48:58.380 --> 02:48:59.580
<v Speaker 4>But the good thing for him,</v>

6290
02:48:59.581 --> 02:49:00.840
<v Speaker 4>and when I spoke to him actually,</v>

6291
02:49:00.841 --> 02:49:01.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6292
02:49:01.051 --> 02:49:02.010
<v Speaker 4>this past weekend,</v>

6293
02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:03.600
<v Speaker 4>there's no timeline from,</v>

02:49:03.601 --> 02:49:06.180
<v Speaker 4>he can go train as long as he wants to train.</v>

6295
02:49:06.181 --> 02:49:07.014
<v Speaker 4>And when his,</v>

6296
02:49:07.290 --> 02:49:09.120
<v Speaker 4>when Duke says he's ready,</v>

6297
02:49:09.390 --> 02:49:10.560
<v Speaker 4>that's when they get to match them up.</v>

6298
02:49:10.770 --> 02:49:14.160
<v Speaker 4>What I want to know is at what point did they start getting impatient,</v>

6299
02:49:14.161 --> 02:49:14.721
<v Speaker 4>tapping their toes,</v>

6300
02:49:14.721 --> 02:49:14.881
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

6301

<v Speaker 4>Are you ready to fight yet or not?</v>

6305
02:49:18.810 --> 02:49:19.330
<v Speaker 2>UFC?</v>

6306
02:49:19.330 --> 02:49:20.060
<v Speaker 2>What's the point?</v>

6307
02:49:20.060 --> 02:49:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6308
02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:21.610
<v Speaker 2>that's a very good point.</v>

6309
02:49:21.850 --> 02:49:22.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6310
02:49:22.181 --> 02:49:22.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6311
02:49:22.451 --> 02:49:23.500
<v Speaker 2>as long as he does that,</v>

6312
02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:23.681
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6313
02:49:23.681 --> 02:49:24.790
<v Speaker 2>that's a smart thing to do.</v>

6314
02:49:24.791 --> 02:49:24.921
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

6315
02:49:24.921 --> 02:49:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I've always said that it,</v>

6316
02:49:25.811 --> 02:49:26.890
<v Speaker 2>Brock Lesnar did that.</v>

6317
02:49:27.100 --> 02:49:29.020
<v Speaker 2>He would have been one of the greatest champions of all time.</v>

6318
02:49:29.021 --> 02:49:30.580
<v Speaker 2>If Brock Lesnar went to,</v>

6319
02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:30.851
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6320
02:49:30.851 --> 02:49:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hume or for Rasa,</v>

6321
02:49:32.381 --> 02:49:35.490
<v Speaker 2>hobby type dude and had someone just analyze his,</v>

6322
02:49:35.570 --> 02:49:38.200
<v Speaker 2>his physical movements and everything,</v>

6323
02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:40.330
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do everything half speed.</v>

6324
02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:42.130
<v Speaker 2>We're for four fucking months.</v>

6325
02:49:42.131 --> 02:49:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6326
02:49:42.430 --> 02:49:42.791
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

6327
02:49:42.791 --> 02:49:43.660
<v Speaker 2>when I throw a kick,</v>

6328
02:49:43.661 --> 02:49:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I want your knee to come up and I want you to check it.</v>

6329
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:47.080
<v Speaker 2>When you throw a left hook,</v>

6330
02:49:47.081 --> 02:49:50.140
<v Speaker 2>I want to right leg kick just to be coming out on instinct.</v>

6331
02:49:50.350 --> 02:49:51.610
<v Speaker 2>When someone throws a punch,</v>

6332
02:49:51.700 --> 02:49:53.770
<v Speaker 2>I want you instantly to roll with it.</v>

6333
02:49:53.771 --> 02:49:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I want to be it to be a part of your anatomy.</v>

6334
02:49:55.811 --> 02:49:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a part of your DNA.</v>

6335
02:49:57.490 --> 02:50:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Drillers are killers and it never became that guy.</v>

6336
02:50:00.221 --> 02:50:02.400
<v Speaker 2>He was just kind of brute force,</v>

6337
02:50:02.410 --> 02:50:03.430
<v Speaker 2>super athlete.</v>

6338
02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:04.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

6339
02:50:04.330 --> 02:50:06.820
<v Speaker 2>it was like someone giving you a corvette Zr one,</v>

6340
02:50:06.821 --> 02:50:08.260
<v Speaker 2>but never teaching you how to drive.</v>

6341
02:50:08.530 --> 02:50:10.750
<v Speaker 2>And he'd get on the fucking highway and you've got a few moves,</v>

6342
02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:12.790
<v Speaker 2>you know how to turn left and you know it turned right.</v>

6343
02:50:12.791 --> 02:50:15.400
<v Speaker 2>And for most cars it's going to be enough to beat him.</v>

6344
02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:18.730
<v Speaker 2>But then you get this Cain Velasquez cart that knows how to do everything and</v>

6345
02:50:18.731 --> 02:50:18.950
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

6346
02:50:18.950 --> 02:50:19.240
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

6347
02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:20.051
<v Speaker 2>fuck dude,</v>

6348
02:50:20.051 --> 02:50:21.000
<v Speaker 2>that's an evil car.</v>

6349
02:50:21.010 --> 02:50:21.830
<v Speaker 2>It's an evil cards.</v>

6350
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Scary car.</v>

6351
02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:24.830
<v Speaker 2>After John beat Daniel Cormier,</v>

6352
02:50:24.990 --> 02:50:25.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6353
02:50:25.391 --> 02:50:27.130
<v Speaker 2>and he said he would fight cane and a heartbeat.</v>

6354
02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Boy Did I get excited about that fight.</v>

6355
02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:30.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited about that fight.</v>

6356
02:50:30.341 --> 02:50:31.500
<v Speaker 2>As much as I'm excited about it.</v>

6357
02:50:31.501 --> 02:50:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Gustafson rematch or rumble?</v>

6358
02:50:33.341 --> 02:50:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Johnson fight almost.</v>

6359
02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:37.000
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what happens in the Gustafson rumble.</v>

6360
02:50:37.001 --> 02:50:37.834
<v Speaker 2>Johnson fight.</v>

6361
02:50:38.020 --> 02:50:43.020
<v Speaker 2>If Gustafson knocks out rumble Johnson or rumble Johnson knocks out Gustafson.</v>

6362
02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:46.540
<v Speaker 2>If one of those guys finishes the other guy in a very definitive way,</v>

6363
02:50:46.541 --> 02:50:47.470
<v Speaker 2>then I want to see that fight.</v>

6364
02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6365
02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:50.910
<v Speaker 2>But until that John versus came,</v>

6366
02:50:50.911 --> 02:50:52.090
<v Speaker 2>he be fucking crazy too.</v>

6367
02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:54.850
<v Speaker 2>You know how long canes been out over a year?</v>

6368
02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:56.091
<v Speaker 4>Does he,</v>

6369
02:50:56.091 --> 02:50:57.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>

6370
02:50:57.350 --> 02:51:01.550
<v Speaker 4>we expect because he was so dominant that he comes back true to form,</v>

6371
02:51:01.551 --> 02:51:02.271
<v Speaker 4>but you got to wonder,</v>

6372
02:51:02.271 --> 02:51:03.104
<v Speaker 4>does he,</v>

6373
02:51:03.330 --> 02:51:03.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6374
02:51:03.501 --> 02:51:03.801
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

6375
02:51:03.801 --> 02:51:05.690
<v Speaker 4>He's had a lot of injuries and,</v>

6376
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:07.010
<v Speaker 4>and certainly,</v>

6377
02:51:07.250 --> 02:51:07.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6378
02:51:07.521 --> 02:51:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Verdomme he,</v>

6379
02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:11.060
<v Speaker 4>he gets overlooked time and time again.</v>

6380
02:51:11.061 --> 02:51:11.271
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6381
02:51:11.271 --> 02:51:13.100
<v Speaker 4>I certainly did when he fought Travis Brown,</v>

6382
02:51:13.580 --> 02:51:17.060
<v Speaker 4>I thought Travis Browne was going to have a lot more success man for doom.</v>

6383
02:51:18.080 --> 02:51:18.321
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6384
02:51:18.321 --> 02:51:18.571
<v Speaker 4>he may,</v>

6385
02:51:18.571 --> 02:51:19.401
<v Speaker 4>he made him look,</v>

6386
02:51:19.401 --> 02:51:20.510
<v Speaker 4>he made them look mediocre.</v>

6387
02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:21.800
<v Speaker 2>How about the Double Jab?</v>

6388
02:51:21.801 --> 02:51:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Where the fuck did he developed a fucking Lennox Lewis Style Double Jab?</v>

6389
02:51:25.850 --> 02:51:26.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6390
02:51:26.091 --> 02:51:27.410
