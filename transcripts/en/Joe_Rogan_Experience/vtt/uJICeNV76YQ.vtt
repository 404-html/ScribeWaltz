<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Have you had your man period lately?</v>

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.873
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>What's and I have this theory that when we shit,</v>

5
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>then it's all bloody in there that it's possible that he does it at the same</v>

6
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>time like it's based on the moon.</v>

7
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.791
<v Speaker 1>How often do you guys,</v>

8
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Shit when you get born your shit happens.</v>

9
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Happens every couple of months.</v>

10
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:20.740
<v Speaker 1>It goes for like a week feeling weak.</v>

11
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>The hemorrhoid thing,</v>

12
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.323
<v Speaker 1>my hope.</v>

13
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

14
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>and then you wipe and you just like,</v>

15
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.571
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

16
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm still wiping a lot of shit.</v>

17
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:28.861
<v Speaker 1>Be like,</v>

18
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:29.001
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

19
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>It was just soaking red blood.</v>

20
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

21
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.681
<v Speaker 1>There's no shit in it.</v>

22
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Die On your hand and I got to go straight through the toilet papers.</v>

23
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Then you guys both need to go to a doctor together and find out what aliens are</v>

24
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>raping you in the middle of a shit study.</v>

25
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Do a fucking camera over your bed.</v>

26
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.730
<v Speaker 1>That's something really watched.</v>

27
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Aliens come in the room and take you through the walls in the middle of the</v>

28
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

29
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Return you later.</v>

30
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes when you stand up at your toilet seat.</v>

31
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Looks like Dexter,</v>

32
00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>like the blood spots that you know,</v>

33
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>we didn't go in the water if you have too low and man,</v>

34
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>if you guys are both shitting out that much blood.</v>

35
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

36
00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean it pours.</v>

37
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.640
<v Speaker 1>It's the warmth.</v>

38
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like a warm faucet and turn it over.</v>

39
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Real thin beaker</v>

40
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>sell you up for the shot girls.</v>

41

<v Speaker 1>Those that much water.</v>

42
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Not something to be proud of.</v>

43
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>You guys are both really sick.</v>

44
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:15.960

<v Speaker 1>Or you and I in the same boat?</v>

47
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you this though.</v>

48
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I did have a massive diarrhea problem last week.</v>

49
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>It was really worst diarrhea problem I've had with a long time.</v>

50
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I do not know multiple days or one diarrhea and multiple days.</v>

51
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was a stomach cold.</v>

52
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was something that I ate that didn't agree with me,</v>

53
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>but it was like one day I had a headache and my head was like,</v>

54
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:38.101
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

55
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I feel sad.</v>

56
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a food poisoning issue cause I had an ha a headache and I was</v>

57
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:42.241
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

58
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:42.601
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

59
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I feel weak because it was the hairball.</v>

60
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

61
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.104
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>

62
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.973
<v Speaker 1>Definitely no more that.</v>

63
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>it was um,</v>

65
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.841
<v Speaker 1>no it was,</v>

66
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>it was post ham but I hadn't eaten a ham for days,</v>

67
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely wasn't that.</v>

68
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>It was something that I'd had I think that day or before that day anyway,</v>

69
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>diarrhea.</v>

70
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

71
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was more than a week after I'd eaten the Ham.</v>

72
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Now that I think about it.</v>

73
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Did you mix it with a regular dump and have like a no dude,</v>

74
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>it was just over the,</v>

75
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened in our whatever was going on inside my stomach was</v>

76
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>converting everything.</v>

77
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I ate into this liquid and I didn't even make sense.</v>

78
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>It was like define physics.</v>

79
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>How solidified was it?</v>

80
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>It was water.</v>

81
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>If you dropped it on a UN inclined table at a 40 degree in client,</v>

82
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>would it go straight off the table?</v>

83
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Take a minute to go ride like a fucking great wave straight through great brown</v>

84
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>wave of destruction.</v>

85
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.361
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

86
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.111
<v Speaker 1>it would rumble,</v>

87
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>my stomach would rumble and then I would go,</v>

88
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 1>oh shit and I'd have really bathroom.</v>

89
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.341
<v Speaker 1>Then I'd get to the,</v>

90
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>and I would hold it up whole Marshall's like listen,</v>

91
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

92
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I was brave enough to fart.</v>

93
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>There was no way.</v>

94
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>There was no way cause I would get into that tub or get it out of the bowl</v>

95
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>

96
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>And I would just hear whoosh just,</v>

97
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

98
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>just water tub my ass.</v>

99
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Complete water for like two days.</v>

100
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And then it like very untrustworthy shit.</v>

101
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel something that's worth day.</v>

102
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And I got hemorrhoids.</v>

104
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:12.691
<v Speaker 1>I had to go get preparation h oh no I bought one squeezing it and pushing it,</v>

105
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>trying to get it to come out so long,</v>

106
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>which is really bad.</v>

107
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Pushed air bubbles into your asshole.</v>

108
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.471
<v Speaker 1>Well I think,</v>

109
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:17.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:03:17.671 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>squeezing your ass like that,</v>

111
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 1>trying to poop is very bad for you.</v>

112
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to do that.</v>

113
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's apparently one of the things that causes hemorrhoids.</v>

114
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Long dumps.</v>

115
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.471
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

116
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>but the preparation h is a motherfucker dude.</v>

117
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Cause one day of that cleared it right up really,</v>

118
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:31.200
<v Speaker 1>really quickly.</v>

119
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Just get the cooling their core ranch one or the cool</v>

120
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.660
<v Speaker 1>for cool ranch sets.</v>

121
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Smell refreshing.</v>

122
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Find out people are like putting it on food.</v>

123
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't eat that sir.</v>

124
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.311
<v Speaker 1>Preparation,</v>

125
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>h measure preparation.</v>

126
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.390
<v Speaker 1>It was totally edible.</v>

127
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it does it,</v>

128
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>it really works good and a good fixing any sort of a hemorrhoid situation he got</v>

129
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:55.781
<v Speaker 1>down there,</v>

130
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>they went away like within a day.</v>

131
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>But man for fucking days,</v>

132
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>four days of totally untrustworthy shits the pasty shit where it's like you</v>

133
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>could spread it on brick.</v>

134
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh I could spread it and stuff.</v>

135
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it was like leaves in there and shit cause I still eat healthy but it was</v>

136
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of liquid.</v>

137
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It was some sort of a stomach bug,</v>

138
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

139
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.731
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

140
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any idea where it came from food or whether it came from just</v>

141
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 1>catching a cold and you know that this cold manifested itself as a stomach bug.</v>

142
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>But whatever it was,</v>

143
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:25.631
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

144
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy for a few days and I felt real weak.</v>

145
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I go to pull my bow back and it was like kind of difficult to pull the bow</v>

146
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>back cause you're waiting from stumping?</v>

147
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

148
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>no I was weak.</v>

149
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I was weak.</v>

150
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Like I would like pick things out having it.</v>

151
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

152
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I could feel it.</v>

153
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Her friends.</v>

154
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

156
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>definitely dehydrated but also just I wasn't eating right.</v>

157
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't scared.</v>

158
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't getting hungry either.</v>

159
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was eating right and that I was having like lettuce and s and salads</v>

160
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:52.061
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that,</v>

161
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't eating very much.</v>

162
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't eating like a like light meals during the day because my stomach was so</v>

163
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 1>untrustworthy that when that happened at the area,</v>

164
00:04:59.171 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

165
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>What's happening?</v>

166
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.091
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man,</v>

167
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it was just digesting it just too much.</v>

168
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I would eat like a steak.</v>

169
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I would have steak and some salad and it would turn it a water.</v>

170
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Like how does steak and a salad become?</v>

171
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean my,</v>

172
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 1>my body was liquefying it and they would come out just whoa,</v>

173
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:16.850
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

174
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Is it too much stomach acid that just breaking down racism?</v>

175
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

176
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>The the process.</v>

177
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I should probably know that shit on your hand a little bit and sort of smelled</v>

178
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 1>it right then and see if there's some on it.</v>

179
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Enzymes on enzymes are solving a digestion on it.</v>

180
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Pippy piles.</v>

181
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>That's how it got me out of it.</v>

182
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I just had to do the time.</v>

183
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I just had to let my body process.</v>

184
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>That sounds you just drink a lot of water but in the Reps.</v>

185
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it was.</v>

186
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely thinking that I was probably getting dehydrated from,</v>

187
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I was like so much water's coming out of my ass.</v>

188
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I better make sure I drink a lot to go with it.</v>

189
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.631
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

190
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Does your a hemorrhoid when it happens,</v>

191
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>does it,</v>

192
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>do you even feel the hammering?</v>

193
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Cause I can still feel it.</v>

194
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's like,</v>

195
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 1>oh I still have,</v>

196
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.320
<v Speaker 1>there's still some stuff I've got to wipe off really?</v>

197
00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Like oh that's just,</v>

198
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.203
<v Speaker 1>that's just my ass</v>

199
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>a little while my bleeds.</v>

200
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.894
<v Speaker 1>I go whale.</v>

201
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Cause like a giant Turd.</v>

202
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>That's just my ass now.</v>

203
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>That's my shit.</v>

204
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

205
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>It feels like what leads out.</v>

206
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even feel anything.</v>

207
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

208
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 1>that's that wheel that exploded inside,</v>

209
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.820
<v Speaker 1>isn't it in a way inside.</v>

210
00:06:14.821 --> 00:06:15.351
<v Speaker 1>I don't even feel it.</v>

211
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Mine's,</v>

212
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.390
<v Speaker 1>mine's on the breast.</v>

213
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>They're a diet that you can take,</v>

214
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>stops that from happening.</v>

215
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Probably stuck behind hemorrhoids.</v>

216
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Finding foods.</v>

217
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Stop eating broken checks.</v>

218
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Lodge up inside your anal binding foods and stay away from them.</v>

219
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:31.431
<v Speaker 1>Or do you a lot of them?</v>

220
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what it is.</v>

221
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh well you should probably know,</v>

222
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those two.</v>

223
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>So rice was in that group.</v>

224
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Binding foods are definitely away from him or keep eat a lot of them.</v>

225
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't really go by the regimen,</v>

226
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>but if you do do that it would help prevent hemorroids.</v>

227
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.043
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

228
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.160
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

229
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>that's my doctors don't want to.</v>

230
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

231
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

232
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 1>that's the 19th.</v>

233
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you need a lot of solid research?</v>

234
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:53.091
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

235
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:53.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

236
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

237
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Does that help at all?</v>

238
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

239
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it makes you shit more often.</v>

240
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

241
00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

242
00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

243
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.010
<v Speaker 1>if you doesn't it come out like we need a lot of salads.</v>

244
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>It comes out real easy.</v>

245
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.660

250
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I guess a scraping,</v>

251

<v Speaker 1>Peace.</v>

291
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.673
<v Speaker 1>Jagged chunk.</v>

292
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Tearing you apart is your shit.</v>

293
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I would have to reach in sometimes in terror.</v>

294
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

295
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>you had to do that dog had to get a castrated.</v>

296
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

297
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Johnny,</v>

298
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I can't get his balls removed because two things.</v>

299
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:13.791
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

300
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:18.791
<v Speaker 1>he had an inflated prostate that was pressing up against his colon and it was</v>

301
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>making them constipated and he was a in the,</v>

302
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>in the hospital for a over a week.</v>

303
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I had to bring them in and they had to try to figure out how to get him to</v>

304
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>defecate because it's [inaudible] it was back down and then they found out the</v>

305
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.770
<v Speaker 1>devastation was backed up cause he was like,</v>

306
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:38.050
<v Speaker 1>he would like go to defecate,</v>

307
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:38.691
<v Speaker 1>but then he wouldn't,</v>

308
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>it would get on this road and it's like fucking Dover at Crouch,</v>

309
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:41.774
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't poop.</v>

310
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.190
<v Speaker 1>And I knew there was something wrong.</v>

311
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.470
<v Speaker 1>So I brought him in and they found out that it was,</v>

312
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.500
<v Speaker 1>his prostate was enlarged and you know,</v>

313
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>he's an older male dog.</v>

314
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>He's like seven now.</v>

315
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.021
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

316
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

317
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I got them fixed.</v>

318
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.440
<v Speaker 1>So they take his testicles away,</v>

319
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.740
<v Speaker 1>which makes the prostate decreased to,</v>

320
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.040
<v Speaker 1>and then you got to have room to shit up.</v>

321
00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

322
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:58.891
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

323
00:08:58.891 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

324
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.030
<v Speaker 1>some people say that,</v>

325
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

326
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:00.991
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>

327
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

328
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>you should get a dog fixed and it's like,</v>

329
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>it's healthier and happier for the dog.</v>

330
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 1>But I had a veterinary,</v>

331
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>didn't agree with that at all.</v>

332
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 1>He said it's totally natural for that animal to have its testicles.</v>

333
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.501
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

334
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 1>if the dog is,</v>

335
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.290
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

336
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't want them to breed and as a female around,</v>

337
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>get the female fixed.</v>

338
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.521
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

339
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to get the dog fixed,</v>

340
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:19.651
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

341
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to get the dog fixed.</v>

342
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

343
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:22.893
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>

344
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.260
<v Speaker 1>you're not making your dog a dad,</v>

345
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>like forcing your dog to have to breed and make unwanted puppies.</v>

346
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 1>If you're not being irresponsible with the dogs sexuality,</v>

347
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 1>like you don't have to get the dog fix.</v>

348
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Can you just get it a sec to me?</v>

349
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Why if a cut the balls off,</v>

350
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.980
<v Speaker 1>let it still fuck doggie condoms.</v>

351
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

352
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want that sense of a dog condoms.</v>

353
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that swelling.</v>

354
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It's the swelling that comes from the,</v>

355
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:44.401
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

356
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 1>the testicles and the,</v>

357
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:45.961
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

358
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 1>the enlargement of the prostate that happens as they get older.</v>

359
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>And that can be alleviated by castrating the dog.</v>

360
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 1>So the people get that.</v>

361
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.371
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

362
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they do.</v>

363
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.691
<v Speaker 1>Humans were like,</v>

364
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:55.021

367
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Just come on.</v>

369
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.450

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure people do.</v>

372
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's people who've done that.</v>

373
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's,</v>

374
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:04.610
<v Speaker 1>people have just been tired of being a prisoner to their cock and balls and just</v>

375
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:04.831
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

381
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:13.560
<v Speaker 1>People had done that.</v>

382
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Cut Your own balls off.</v>
