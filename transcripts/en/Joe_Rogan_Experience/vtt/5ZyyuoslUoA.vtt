00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Holder.</v>

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're both older.</v>

3
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I think Johnny's probably 37 in Lombard is older than that.</v>

4
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I think Johnny's only 32.</v>

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.353
<v Speaker 1>So we just said,</v>

10
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.873
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

56
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>They're hating on me or fuck or whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't really,</v>

58
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>we can't worry about that,</v>

59
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:32.721
<v Speaker 1>but just explain,</v>

60
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>but explain what happened.</v>

61
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.250

64
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.131
<v Speaker 1>He made way you look,</v>

65
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:38.881
<v Speaker 1>you were smiling,</v>

66
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>you were laughing and saw the video.</v>

67
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I've never made weight that easy in my entire career.</v>

68
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.531
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

69
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean you ask anybody the usually,</v>

70
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>you stopped drinking water 24 hours out from Wayne's,</v>

72
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I cut weight the night,</v>

74
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.991
<v Speaker 1>that night,</v>

75
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Thursday night and I,</v>

76
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>it was going so well that I had probably five glasses of ice water.</v>

77
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

78
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Pop is the first fight.</v>

79
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>So you bet to get us are gonna be excited to get cracking with a stupid story.</v>

80
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>So then I figured,</v>

81
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:05.601
<v Speaker 1>fuck I can,</v>

82
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:06.301
<v Speaker 1>I can eat a little bit.</v>

83
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>So I try to eat a little bit of salad and I threw that up,</v>

84
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>but I figured that was just the,</v>

85
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:10.111
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>

87
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

88
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>the dressing or something that there was messing my stomach up.</v>

89
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

90
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.100
<v Speaker 1>So I had at least a cup of a,</v>

91
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:16.930
<v Speaker 1>of almonds,</v>

92
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.191
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>

93
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>five cups of water.</v>

94
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I cut the rest in the morning.</v>

95
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And then when I was trying to gain any weight back,</v>

96
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>my body wouldn't,</v>

97
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>

98
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't hold on to anything.</v>

99
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>He just kept throwing up.</v>

100
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I kept throwing up everything.</v>

101
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:26.951
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>

102
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>see I woke up Saturday morning at one 31 should,</v>

103
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I had only gained five pounds and four of those pounds had been because UFC gave</v>

104
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.054
<v Speaker 1>me two ivy bags.</v>

105
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And how much did you cut?</v>

106
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>The UFC gave you ivy bags?</v>

107
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.163
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

109
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>You are allowed to use an IV?</v>

110
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

111
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:43.330
<v Speaker 1>because they were just,</v>

112
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 1>they would do that.</v>

113
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd go to the fucking hospital,</v>

114
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second.</v>

115
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I thought you can't use an ivy and then fight.</v>

116
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:49.411
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

118
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:49.541
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

119
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:49.780
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

120
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.800
<v Speaker 1>they were just doing it as,</v>

121
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>as a precaution because either way I was gonna need it.</v>

122
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.011
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

123
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

124
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that the whole thing about cutting weight is that it's much more</v>

125
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>difficult now because you can't use an IV.</v>

126
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>So they gave you an exemption.</v>

127
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I got so some sort of an exemption,</v>

128
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't even have to get an exemption because I ended up getting pulled.</v>

129
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:05.381
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody know?</v>

130
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.214
<v Speaker 1>But is this like a new,</v>

131
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.560
<v Speaker 1>is this like the first time anyone's hearing this that you did an ivy get yelled</v>

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

150
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I made weight so easily that it was,</v>

151
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy because anything I'd put in my body I'd throw back up.</v>

152
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck man,</v>

153
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>can you use it?</v>

154
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.630
<v Speaker 1>You can use an ivy or you can't use an ob.</v>

155
00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:37.464
<v Speaker 1>He's an ivy.</v>

156
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 1>You get the exemption,</v>

157
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know the rules.</v>

158
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>And then again,</v>

159
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I was also sick the whole time,</v>

160
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>so I don't what the fuck was going on.</v>

161
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

162
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.800
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

164
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>they gave me the two ivy bags.</v>

165
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I ingested maybe a pound of water or whatever myself.</v>

166
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing I keep down.</v>

167
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.390
<v Speaker 1>But like I said,</v>

168
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I buy by the next morning,</v>

169
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>you still hadn't eaten.</v>

170
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.491
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

171
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:57.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

172
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

173
00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.330
<v Speaker 1>it's still only gain five pounds.</v>

174
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.511
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

175
00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:00.191
<v Speaker 1>but you'd only eat,</v>

176
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:00.911
<v Speaker 1>drink water.</v>

177
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 1>You hadn't eaten anything,</v>

178
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>but I was born and I hadn't eaten any of everything.</v>

179
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.331
<v Speaker 1>I tried to eat.</v>

180
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I threw up and I was throwing up in front of all the,</v>

181
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>all the other fighters,</v>

182
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>every single chance we ended up had to be in a group in public.</v>

183
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I ended up fucking throwing up.</v>

184
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>So then you go to the doctor I the next day I'm like,</v>

185
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:14.921
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

186
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:15.491
<v Speaker 1>give me two more.</v>

187
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd be bags.</v>

188
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Give me some Zofran for ivy backs total.</v>

189
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I asked what I ended up getting more,</v>

190
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

191
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I asked him and I'm like,</v>

192
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:22.661
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

193
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:22.811
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

194
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>just let me fight.</v>

195
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Give me,</v>

196
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>give me,</v>

197
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>give me two more heavy bags,</v>

198
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.600
<v Speaker 1>condition,</v>

199
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Zofran so I can go brown to help your stomach.</v>

200
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 1>So then I can hold some food down,</v>

201
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>some antinausea stuff.</v>

202
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>And they looked at me like,</v>

203
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>no dude,</v>

204
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>you need to go to the hospital.</v>

205
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

206
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.203
<v Speaker 1>and then they fade out.</v>

207
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Then they were going to do emergency gallbladder surgery,</v>

208
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>which they didn't have to do.</v>

209
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Then go hats.</v>

210
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

211
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>emergency gallbladder surgery.</v>

212
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:43.361
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

213
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Remove your gallbladder.</v>

214
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>They've did this whole thing is scared the shit out of me.</v>

215
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

216
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

217
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:49.190
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

218
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>what did you sit on it up?</v>

219
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.351
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

220
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

221
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>you could die and never know.</v>

223
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:52.031
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

224
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck do you mean?</v>

225
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.500
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

226
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>So when they say emergency gallbladder surgery,</v>

227
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:56.111
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

228
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>what is going on with your broader,</v>

229
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>like what would they say?</v>

230
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>It was super,</v>

231
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.124
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

232
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>it was what was shrunk,</v>

233
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I guess when you say contracted,</v>

234
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>just from the dehydration I guess.</v>

235
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 1>And then so then they saw shadowing and some other stuff and they thought I had,</v>

236
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 1>the gallbladder,</v>

238
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>they thought I had gallstones.</v>

239
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Speaker 1>So then the Aza,</v>

240
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>as they're trying to set everything up,</v>

241
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

242
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>well let's get a more in depth,</v>

243
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>the more advanced version of what we just did.</v>

244
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>So then they took me in the back,</v>

245
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 1>hit me with a bunch of morphine and I'm like,</v>

246
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>if you have to dig anything in my stomach again,</v>

247
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna Punch him.</v>

248
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.251
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

249
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:27.830
<v Speaker 1>so just at least knock me out and a bunch of morphine and sent me on the table.</v>

250
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:28.980
<v Speaker 1>What is your gallbladder do?</v>

251
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know toxins,</v>

252
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

253
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was where your liver does.</v>

254
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Does the gallbladder do that as well?</v>

255
00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

256
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

257
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>does anybody know what a gallbladder does?</v>

258
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things where if you had a name,</v>

259
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 1>like a crucial Oregon's,</v>

260
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:40.331
<v Speaker 1>you'd go,</v>

261
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:41.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

262
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.893
<v Speaker 1>I think we got them.</v>

263
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.260
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

264
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

265
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

266
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>So then they do a more advanced version of the,</v>

267
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

268
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>of the ultrasound and they didn't see anything,</v>

269
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't have to do that.</v>

270
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>And so basically we're just running tests.</v>

271
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 1>I've been running tests all week.</v>

272
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>So your gallbladder is obviously,</v>

273
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue because of the dehydration,</v>

274
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>like yes,</v>

275
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>it was falling apart.</v>

276
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

277
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 1>So that sucked.</v>

278
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.523
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

279
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

280
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

281
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even,</v>

282
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm still skinny,</v>

283
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:08.241
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

284
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

285
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

286
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't been,</v>

287
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>I went home a day later and I was supposed to go home and I was still under 135</v>

288
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

289
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>It's probably 132 pounds.</v>

290
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>And will you eating by then?</v>

291
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't able to hold food down until like Tuesday.</v>

292
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it was so good in my body.</v>

293
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking failed me.</v>

294
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

295
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Make that a little larger please.</v>

296
00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

297
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 1>when is that?</v>

298
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

299
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>when is the Tue not required for an ivy infusion if the athlete has an acute</v>

300
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>medical condition where an ivy lines essential for treatment in the hospital</v>

301
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>admission surgical procedure or clinical investigation.</v>

302
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Examples of be a severely dehydrated athlete with signs of circulatory</v>

303
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:45.824
<v Speaker 1>compromise.</v>

304
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.333
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

305
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>A need for an ivy line during a surgical procedure and an IV line in the</v>

306
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>antibiotic treatment of an acute infection,</v>

307
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

308
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 1>So I guess they decided they made a judgement call.</v>

309
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.690
<v Speaker 1>They decided but they were going to let you fight with an IV,</v>

310
00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 1>which is kinda crazy.</v>

311
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I think they kind of knew I wasn't going to fight the whole time.</v>

312
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>They were just a really pat me on the head.</v>

313
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:05.241
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

314
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:05.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

315
00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 1>you'll be all right.</v>

316
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Little Buddy.</v>

317
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 1>So you think they're giving you the ivy just to make you stay alive or some just</v>

318
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 1>to keep me not nine cry fucking hate weight cutting with every ounce of my</v>

319
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:14.590
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

320
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>The really difficult part is I had the best weight cut of my let you didn't you,</v>

321
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 1>you had the best weight cut of your life where you obviously got down to 125</v>

322
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>

323
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 1>but your body was shutting down.</v>

324
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

325
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:26.180
<v Speaker 1>you can't say I had the best weight cut of my life.</v>

326
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 1>If you almost died,</v>

327
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.981
<v Speaker 1>you have a point.</v>

328
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:28.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

329
00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:30.540
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole thing is so until that point,</v>

330
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.270
<v Speaker 1>up until that point.</v>

331
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

332
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:32.451
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

333
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>It's so bananas at the fucking practice of weight cutting is so crazy.</v>

334
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

335
00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 1>And of course there's something still tied to what happened in Ireland with me</v>

336
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>and most people don't know.</v>

337
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 1>But I was in the hospital two,</v>

338
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:44.001
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

339
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 1>four times before that fight with some Vasovagal syncope where my,</v>

340
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.381
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

341
00:07:48.381 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

342
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 1>my esophagus would,</v>

343
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 1>would freak out and I've done it passing out.</v>

344
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 1>And this is before the weight cut.</v>

345
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.463
<v Speaker 1>This is before,</v>

346
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>this is in training camp for the Ireland fight.</v>

347
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.780
<v Speaker 1>And then what causes that?</v>

348
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:00.643
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know.</v>

349
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to get tests done.</v>

350
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:03.170
<v Speaker 1>They've have had endoscopy.</v>

351
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get another camera.</v>

352
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:06.140
<v Speaker 1>He'll be down my throat pipe sticking out of my ass.</v>

353
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 1>And you were like,</v>

354
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to fight anyway.</v>

355
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

356
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

357
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what I liked doing.</v>

358
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.591
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

359
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather do this.</v>

360
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

361
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 1>This fight is about to start.</v>

362
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 1>So let's go with the very first round.</v>

363
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

364
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.050
<v Speaker 1>could we get the card up on the screen so we could tell who's fighting here?</v>

365
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Felder is so much fun.</v>

366

421
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because like this is not a fight that a lot of people have been</v>

422
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:47.581
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

423

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:53.871
<v Speaker 1>Felder just like a year ago was like the guy to watch at one 55 and then,</v>

428
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>he is technically great just watching good head movement,</v>

429
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 1>punching off his ankles and everything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

432
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 1>it just been a ban against super elite fighters.</v>

433
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:08.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

442
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.393
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

443
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.020
<v Speaker 1>So what happens now with your,</v>

444
00:10:20.021 --> 00:10:21.360
<v Speaker 1>your medical treatment?</v>

445
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Did they,</v>

446
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

447
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.090
<v Speaker 1>is there a way that it can do some sort of a comprehensive scan and find out</v>

448
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with your body?</v>

449
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

450
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:29.484
<v Speaker 1>that there,</v>

451
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a lot of testing.</v>

453
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to figure out they've done like blood,</v>

454
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.133
<v Speaker 1>hair,</v>

455
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:34.951
<v Speaker 1>whatever else,</v>

456
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:35.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

457
00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 1>and that check your hair.</v>

458
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

459
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 1>That's check your hair.</v>

460
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:38.431
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know.</v>

461
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:39.264
<v Speaker 1>I don't ask questions.</v>

462
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.871
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that.</v>

463
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:43.060
<v Speaker 1>If they like the hair tells you everything we check,</v>

464
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 1>is there an area above and beyond like to check everything,</v>

465
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 1>doing eastern medicine,</v>

466
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 1>like all kinds of shit.</v>

467
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully within the next couple of weeks I'll,</v>

468
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll at least understand,</v>

469
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

470
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.833
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong.</v>

471
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

472
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Partially what's wrong and we can fix it.</v>

473
00:10:57.631 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm,</v>

474
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm in amazing shape.</v>

475
00:10:59.250 --> 00:10:59.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

476
00:10:59.461 --> 00:10:59.651
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

477
00:10:59.651 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I've just had a really string of bad luck.</v>

478
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.841
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is though.</v>

479
00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:05.130
<v Speaker 1>It sounds pretty significant.</v>

480
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>

481
00:11:06.101 --> 00:11:08.040
<v Speaker 1>if every time you're getting down to weight,</v>

482
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 1>your body starts falling apart,</v>

483
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 1>that seems Oh,</v>

484
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>beautiful spin there.</v>

485
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:17.250
<v Speaker 1>It'd lucky turned it from a spinning back fist to spinning elbow in the middle</v>

486
00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:19.050
<v Speaker 1>of that Oh right hand.</v>

487
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.401
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

488
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>you got a good point.</v>

489
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I should probably get this under control before I cut weight and I don't come</v>

490
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:25.840
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

491
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.640
<v Speaker 1>You think as a professional fighter that there is a way to get people to stop</v>

492
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:30.151
<v Speaker 1>cutting weight.</v>

493
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:30.971
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's a way,</v>

494
00:11:30.971 --> 00:11:34.260
<v Speaker 1>if the UFC made a concerted effort the same way they've made an effort to cut</v>

495
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:35.011
<v Speaker 1>out all the,</v>

496
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

497
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancing drugs by having Novitsky and Usada run the program and</v>

498
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 1>make sure that they're doing all these random tests on people and brutal,</v>

499
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.113
<v Speaker 1>brutal sanctions.</v>

500
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.351
<v Speaker 1>That's enough though,</v>

501
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:48.410
<v Speaker 1>because people would still cut weight and try to,</v>

502
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get crazy.</v>

503
00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:50.670
<v Speaker 1>People get crazy if they got,</v>

504
00:11:50.671 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 1>you got a data recover,</v>

505
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.750
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go full blown nuts,</v>

506
00:11:53.751 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 1>soy,</v>

507
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 2>so that if you got to fight the same day,</v>

508
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't go that crazy and you might be right because you'll lose.</v>

509
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you're going to make it through.</v>

510
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

511
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

512
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 2>that's what we do in an Ebi 35 at,</v>

513
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.691
<v Speaker 2>at a,</v>

514
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 2>at [inaudible] up any lower than that in a way.</v>

515
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Do you think though that a,</v>

516
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 2>you would worry,</v>

517
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was the reason why they had,</v>

518
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.033
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

519
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>for day before Wayne's in boxing was I think it was the duck who Kim fight.</v>

520
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I think they changed the wins and I think they also changed the number of</v>

521
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:21.514
<v Speaker 2>rounds.</v>

522
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 12 yeah,</v>

523
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the fight that did that.</v>

524
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 2>But they used to weigh in the day of the fight.</v>

525
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

526
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.150
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

527
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.770
<v Speaker 2>guys used to mean that was,</v>

528
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 2>that was the standard.</v>

529
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 2>It was the way they did it.</v>

530
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:33.071
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

531
00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:38.071
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you go back to like those old school Tommy Hearns sugar ray</v>

532
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Leonard fight with us,</v>

533
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.881
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't,</v>

534
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't no 15 rounds in those fights.</v>

535
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:43.743
<v Speaker 2>Oh I'm sure.</v>

536
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.351
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

537
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

538
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Kim Can fight was when the seventies eighties he was the eighties six I was in</v>

539
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:53.010
<v Speaker 2>high school cause I remember I was a big rain man,</v>

540
00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:57.380
<v Speaker 2>senior fan and when that guy died it was just like a Dharma loud.</v>

541
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh Felder got them until over.</v>

542
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.141
<v Speaker 2>I want he,</v>

543
00:13:04.141 --> 00:13:04.301
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

544
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 2>he caught him with something before</v>

545
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 2>you know Ibj Jeff Does Matt side,</v>

546
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 2>wham.</v>

547
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Like you weigh in and then you compete.</v>

548
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.271
<v Speaker 2>I liked that too,</v>

549
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:14.104
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

550
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:15.880
<v Speaker 2>but guys in fights,</v>

551
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:20.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a different feeling to go into a fight and there's so much psychological</v>

552
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.940
<v Speaker 2>shit going on that there's certain,</v>

553
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.350
<v Speaker 2>oh he's limping to this crazy.</v>

554
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.290
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to go crazy with the weight cut.</v>

555
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to do all that extreme stuff.</v>

556
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:27.731
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

557
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:28.640
<v Speaker 2>But that's not what I'm saying.</v>

558
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.470
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is some guys just wouldn't make the weight if they had a Duke</v>

559
00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:34.410
<v Speaker 2>cage side and then what the fuck do you do?</v>

560
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.493
<v Speaker 2>Backups,</v>

561
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.730
<v Speaker 2>make it part of the sport.</v>

562
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.593
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>

563
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 2>there are some guys,</v>

564
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.420
<v Speaker 2>we all know that this happens.</v>

565
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Some guys that just get real close and I'm good man.</v>

566
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 2>They get real close.</v>

567
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 2>And then the day of the fight,</v>

568
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.080
<v Speaker 2>they just don't fucking make weight.</v>

569
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.300
<v Speaker 2>That's when they do big events.</v>

570
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:48.971
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>

571
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:50.460
<v Speaker 2>if you're forced to not be,</v>

572
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.460
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you can make a big cut of it's same day or Matt side.</v>

573
00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

574
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.320
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that crazy gnarly shit.</v>

575
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.263
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to do it.</v>

576
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 2>You could cut a little bit,</v>

577
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:00.550
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to be 15 pounds.</v>

578
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that's when it gets dangerous?</v>

579
00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think also they need more weight classes.</v>

580
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I liked the way classes.</v>

581
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Did they bake it?</v>

582
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I like more,</v>

583
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:08.643
<v Speaker 2>but I think it would be,</v>

584
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.640
<v Speaker 2>don't you think there's a giant gap between 85 and two oh five and that giant</v>

585
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 2>gap between two oh five and heavyweight.</v>

586
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's a bunch of people that just don't have a home.</v>

587
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem with the weight,</v>

588
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 2>with the weight divisions.</v>

589
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Zero problems with that.</v>

590
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:23.014
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

591
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.401
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

592
00:14:23.401 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly debatable.</v>

593
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 2>I think they could do 10 pounds.</v>

594
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

595
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I feel like every 10 pounds.</v>

596
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 2>55 right?</v>

597
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

598
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 2>But I see it.</v>

599
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:31.594
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

600
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.840
<v Speaker 2>55 657585905205 to 15 I like dentistry of the way it is now.</v>

601
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to rewrite it.</v>

602
00:14:41.021 --> 00:14:42.070
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to change.</v>

603
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:42.940
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>

604
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.391
<v Speaker 2>what they did,</v>

605
00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:43.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

606
00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:45.500
<v Speaker 2>they used to be 200 used to be light heavyweight,</v>

607
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.880
<v Speaker 2>and then they turned to change the two oh five when Tito Tito Ortiz first</v>

608
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:51.170
<v Speaker 2>started competing and he was 200 yeah,</v>

609
00:14:51.171 --> 00:14:51.921
<v Speaker 2>they've changed it.</v>

610
00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

611
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.503
<v Speaker 3>they could do that.</v>

612
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.650
<v Speaker 3>They own the fucking,</v>

613
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:55.300
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

614
00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.200
<v Speaker 4>lay Aleke weight.</v>

615
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.810
<v Speaker 4>Light heavyweight is never been two oh five and boxing.</v>

616
00:14:58.811 --> 00:15:02.400
<v Speaker 4>It was always one 75 they turned light heavyweight into two oh five which is</v>

617
00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.360
<v Speaker 4>bizarre as it is.</v>

618
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.780
<v Speaker 4>Like welterweight welterweight was one 47 when we were kids.</v>

619
00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.000
<v Speaker 4>Sugar Ray Leonard One 47 right.</v>

620
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.240
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden welterweight was one 70 like that's bizarre.</v>

621
00:15:12.241 --> 00:15:13.051
<v Speaker 4>Like in boxing,</v>

622
00:15:13.051 --> 00:15:14.400
<v Speaker 4>that's a Weirdo weight class.</v>

623
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 4>That was when Roy Jones Jr was one 68 he was super middle away and it was like,</v>

624
00:15:20.401 --> 00:15:22.050
<v Speaker 4>what kind of bullshit division is that?</v>

625
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.110
<v Speaker 4>Like there's middleweight and there's light heavyweight kind of nonsense is</v>

626
00:15:25.111 --> 00:15:25.560
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

627
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.240
<v Speaker 4>And everybody thought the idea of going from middle to light heavyweight,</v>

628
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:28.891
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy,</v>

629
00:15:28.891 --> 00:15:31.110
<v Speaker 4>but that's only 15 pounds in the UFC.</v>

630
00:15:31.111 --> 00:15:32.310
<v Speaker 4>That's a normal jump.</v>

631
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.593
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

632
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.190
<v Speaker 4>it was way too big.</v>

633
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you man,</v>

634
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Rogan fighting championship.</v>

635
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.570
<v Speaker 4>He wants to organize the,</v>

636
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.160
<v Speaker 4>my idea of doing it in a basket,</v>

637
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.920
<v Speaker 3>the and the man of basketball court.</v>

638
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.210
<v Speaker 3>So way to go.</v>

639
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

640
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:47.740
<v Speaker 3>In rash guards.</v>

641
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.613
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

642
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.040
<v Speaker 3>If you want to know your force it,</v>

643
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:56.530
<v Speaker 3>you have to where you have to wear rushcards and tights because sports</v>

644
00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.880
<v Speaker 3>organizations at every year they meet and they discuss how they can make their</v>

645
00:16:00.881 --> 00:16:02.440
<v Speaker 3>sport more offensive.</v>

646
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.060
<v Speaker 3>Basketball does it.</v>

647
00:16:04.061 --> 00:16:04.420
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

648
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.031
<v Speaker 3>Baseball dot.</v>

649
00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:08.080
<v Speaker 3>It's all about how can we make it more offensive and they really need to look</v>

650
00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:09.400
<v Speaker 3>into the greasing problem.</v>

651
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.210
<v Speaker 3>In MMA there's a,</v>

652
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.280
<v Speaker 3>greasing is definitely an issue because it's officially illegal.</v>

653
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.890
<v Speaker 3>It's officially illegal to Greece.</v>

654
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Explain how people get away with it though,</v>

655
00:16:19.421 --> 00:16:20.440
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of people don't know.</v>

656
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:21.590
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

657
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.423
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

658
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.710
<v Speaker 3>in MMA,</v>

659
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:24.603
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

660
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.490
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times the matchups will be a striker against a guy who has way better</v>

661
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.343
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>

662
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

663
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.351
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

664
00:16:32.351 --> 00:16:33.670
<v Speaker 3>it's old school.</v>

665
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.060
<v Speaker 3>It's an old school MMA tactic that a,</v>

666
00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:37.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

667
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.930
<v Speaker 3>if you're a Moyie Thai guy and you're going against a Jujitsu guy in an MMA</v>

668
00:16:40.931 --> 00:16:41.440
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

669
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.273
<v Speaker 3>grease up,</v>

670
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 3>and some people do it by,</v>

671
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:44.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

672
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.150
<v Speaker 3>getting in a bathtub.</v>

673
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.440
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anybody do it,</v>

674
00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:52.150
<v Speaker 3>but everyone talks about it as getting in a bath tub of baby oil the night</v>

675
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.450
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

676
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:52.960
<v Speaker 3>And then the,</v>

677
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.580
<v Speaker 3>and then it soaks into your pores so deep that you could take like a light</v>

678
00:16:57.581 --> 00:16:58.510
<v Speaker 3>shower and you're,</v>

679
00:16:58.511 --> 00:16:59.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

680
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.910
<v Speaker 3>if you sweat in the fight,</v>

681
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.460
<v Speaker 3>the oil's going to come out again and then you're gonna be really great.</v>

682
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:03.771
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

683
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:05.270
<v Speaker 4>You just get more slippery.</v>

684
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 4>And the difference being is your,</v>

685
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:11.000
<v Speaker 4>it's not like anything that they could put like something on your skin and find</v>

686
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:11.810
<v Speaker 4>out that you,</v>

687
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

688
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.460
<v Speaker 3>The only way that you can do that flicker,</v>

689
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.301
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal,</v>

690
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:15.950
<v Speaker 3>but there's no test for it.</v>

691
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:17.570
<v Speaker 3>So there's a problem there.</v>

692
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.560
<v Speaker 3>It is a problem.</v>

693
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.700
<v Speaker 3>And what it does is if you,</v>

694
00:17:20.701 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 3>you want the sport to be more offensive,</v>

695
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.700
<v Speaker 3>the more grease the less offensive on the ground.</v>

696
00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:26.920
<v Speaker 3>That's why people want standups.</v>

697
00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Cause in the third round it's just a grease fest.</v>

698
00:17:29.571 --> 00:17:29.930
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

699
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.380
<v Speaker 3>they put Vaseline all over their faces that gets all over the body.</v>

700
00:17:33.381 --> 00:17:34.880
<v Speaker 3>They're super greasy,</v>

701
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 3>hard to submit.</v>

702
00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 3>When it's super greasy,</v>

703
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.240
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal.</v>

704
00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:39.650
<v Speaker 3>The grease but no one's checking,</v>

705
00:17:39.651 --> 00:17:40.484
<v Speaker 3>there's no test.</v>

706
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 3>It would be better and easier instead of developing some kind of tests like</v>

707
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 3>after the fight they get a swab and then they go down the fighters backs and if</v>

708
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:50.490
<v Speaker 3>it has 85% oil or whatever,</v>

709
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:51.324
<v Speaker 3>then they're busted.</v>

710
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 3>They could do something elaborate like that,</v>

711
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

712
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 3>But it's easier to just have them wear rash guards.</v>

713
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 3>The Reebok rash guards,</v>

714
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 3>Reebok tights that solves your problem.</v>

715
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:04.710
<v Speaker 3>You can grease if you got a girls were rash guard sort of.</v>

716
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.060
<v Speaker 3>They don't want anything to covers their arms but I they shouldn't.</v>

717
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:08.933
<v Speaker 3>They should.</v>

718
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.920
<v Speaker 3>It's backwards thinking,</v>

719
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:11.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

720
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.160
<v Speaker 3>you want to promote or offense on the ground.</v>

721
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.480
<v Speaker 3>If the let the,</v>

722
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 3>if we eliminate all the grease and have everyone aligned rash guards,</v>

723
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 3>people aren't slipping out of stuff.</v>

724
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 3>Less defense more often.</v>

725
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:23.371
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

726
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens.</v>

727
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.230
<v Speaker 3>The more grease,</v>

728
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.520
<v Speaker 3>the more defense,</v>

729
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.540
<v Speaker 3>the less authentic you want to see a grease a slop fest on the ground or do you</v>

730
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 3>want to see awesome submissions?</v>

731
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.950
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather see submissions from a business standpoint.</v>

732
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.900
<v Speaker 3>If we were able to do more sponsorship stuff,</v>

733
00:18:36.901 --> 00:18:38.340
<v Speaker 3>yes we look like fucking NASCAR's.</v>

734
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

735
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 3>But Reebok into it.</v>

736
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.180
<v Speaker 3>If we can make money off it,</v>

737
00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

738
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

739
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't like fight with clothes on.</v>

740
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

741
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:47.680
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying and don't purchase.</v>

742
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.773
<v Speaker 3>I get what you're saying.</v>

743
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.010
<v Speaker 4>Point of view too.</v>

744
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.730
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe making it an option wouldn't be the worst idea because if you do</v>

745
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:55.710
<v Speaker 4>have a rash guard and your opponent does,</v>

746
00:18:55.711 --> 00:18:56.790
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have one,</v>

747
00:18:56.791 --> 00:18:58.030
<v Speaker 4>you definitely would be able to control</v>

748
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.580
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

749
00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:58.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

750
00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.840
<v Speaker 3>You still have a barrier.</v>

751
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.390
<v Speaker 3>It's still,</v>

752
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.280
<v Speaker 3>there's still that barrier.</v>

753
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.750
<v Speaker 3>You want less,</v>

754
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

755
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.080
<v Speaker 3>less of a Turkish oil wrestling match on the ground.</v>

756
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.150
<v Speaker 3>You want to go away from that.</v>

757
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Right</v>

758
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:09.813
<v Speaker 4>is a good point.</v>

759
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.470
<v Speaker 4>And I think that the idea of seeing more submissions,</v>

760
00:19:14.471 --> 00:19:19.390
<v Speaker 4>also being able to control people on the ground more would probably lessen the,</v>

761
00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:19.661
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

762
00:19:19.661 --> 00:19:21.060
<v Speaker 4>amount of,</v>

763
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:21.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

764
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.250
<v Speaker 4>standups that you would have to have because guys would get things done better.</v>

765
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.640
<v Speaker 3>It would sound solve the greasing issue just like that.</v>

766
00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.110
<v Speaker 3>You make Reebok rash guards,</v>

767
00:19:29.111 --> 00:19:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Reebok tights,</v>

768
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.180
<v Speaker 3>no grease problem.</v>

769
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.520
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

770
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.740
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a problem with,</v>

771
00:19:32.741 --> 00:19:33.574
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal.</v>

772
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.890
<v Speaker 3>There's a problem and no one's doing anything about it.</v>

773
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.200
<v Speaker 3>And if you think guys are guys that fight Jujitsu,</v>

774
00:19:38.201 --> 00:19:40.190
<v Speaker 3>black belts are in Greece and well then you,</v>

775
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:41.130
<v Speaker 3>you'll probably be crazy.</v>

776
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Watch CNN.</v>

777
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

778
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.670
<v Speaker 3>don't go there and talk to it.</v>

779
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

780
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.423
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>

781
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.480
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

782
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.380
<v Speaker 4>we're not done.</v>

783
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this board has done as far as figuring out all the best ways to go</v>

784
00:19:54.971 --> 00:19:55.450
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

785
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:55.630
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

786
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't think ever.</v>

787
00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.050
<v Speaker 4>We're always going to be evolving.</v>

788
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.830
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about longer rounds or short around?</v>

789
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.460
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that the five minute round is the right length or do you think like</v>

790
00:20:06.461 --> 00:20:06.640
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

791
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.280
<v Speaker 4>I've heard people argue they should have three minute rounds because people</v>

792
00:20:09.281 --> 00:20:09.950
<v Speaker 4>could fight,</v>

793
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.430
<v Speaker 4>fall out faster and harder for three minutes,</v>

794
00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.670
<v Speaker 4>then they can for five and then I've heard the other arguments for 10 minute</v>

795
00:20:15.671 --> 00:20:18.220
<v Speaker 4>rounds because you get to go out of the ground like the old pride days.</v>

796
00:20:18.221 --> 00:20:21.070
<v Speaker 4>You have that first round and you have plenty of time to get something</v>

797
00:20:21.071 --> 00:20:21.904
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

798
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:23.470
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

799
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.670
<v Speaker 3>I would like the longer rounds fucking drown.</v>

800
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.010
<v Speaker 3>Somebody's taking in a deep water and that that's,</v>

801
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:29.560
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

802
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.261
<v Speaker 3>that's separate.</v>

803
00:20:30.261 --> 00:20:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

804
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

805
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.460
<v Speaker 4>It's a big deal.</v>

806
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.031
<v Speaker 4>It also,</v>

807
00:20:32.031 --> 00:20:34.220
<v Speaker 4>it allows more tactics.</v>

808
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:34.500
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

809
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.190
<v Speaker 4>It allows you to figure out how to pace yourself more.</v>

810
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.690
<v Speaker 4>It allows you to figure out,</v>

811
00:20:38.691 --> 00:20:41.270
<v Speaker 4>like to be very smart about when you put it on them,</v>

812
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.841
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

813
00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:44.870
<v Speaker 4>and and be able to feel a person's timing out and feel whether or not they're</v>

814
00:20:44.871 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 4>fading.</v>

815
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:45.931
<v Speaker 4>Guy,</v>

816
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:47.090
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you guys on that.</v>

817
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 4>Think 10 minutes is</v>

818
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.813
<v Speaker 2>the right way to go.</v>

819
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:50.663
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit sad.</v>

820
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.740
<v Speaker 2>Being an opportunist.</v>

821
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

822
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I can see the benefits of fighting with,</v>

823
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:55.931
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

824
00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:57.790
<v Speaker 2>with a rash guard on if you're going to choke somebody out,</v>

825
00:20:57.791 --> 00:20:58.410
<v Speaker 2>whether we haven't have,</v>

826
00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 2>have better or grappling or,</v>

827
00:20:59.531 --> 00:21:00.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

828
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:00.993
<v Speaker 2>positional stuff.</v>

829
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:01.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

830
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:01.601
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

831
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:03.910
<v Speaker 2>It'd be better rapport and there's no problems with it.</v>

832
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were,</v>

833
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:05.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

834
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 2>like crazy rules are still exist.</v>

835
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Like you can wear tights,</v>

836
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.500
<v Speaker 2>compression shorts to your knees,</v>

837
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.030
<v Speaker 2>but not to the end goal that hang the calf is dangerous.</v>

838
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.313
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

839
00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

840
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I hope you rack up your ankles and some places,</v>

841
00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.050
<v Speaker 2>George,</v>

842
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.880
<v Speaker 2>that George Schlatter apolis yeah.</v>

843
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Then we made them happen.</v>

844
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.211
<v Speaker 2>It just fucking,</v>

845
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:29.044
<v Speaker 2>he used to have</v>

846
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.790
<v Speaker 2>the less grease,</v>

847
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.940
<v Speaker 2>the more often you want more avance particularly on the ground for it to sound</v>

848
00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:45.400
<v Speaker 2>crazy that you could fight in a rash guard and it's not going to be a problem.</v>

849
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.420
<v Speaker 2>People aren't going to grab it.</v>

850
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Girls on grabbing each other's rash guards and sports bras,</v>

851
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.050
<v Speaker 2>they're not being grabbed it.</v>

852
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:51.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

853
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:52.181
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

854
00:21:52.181 --> 00:21:52.810
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

855
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.680
<v Speaker 2>If you were a rash guard took on a grubbing,</v>

856
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

857
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.151
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

858
00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Grabbing is illegal.</v>

859
00:21:56.321 --> 00:21:57.880
<v Speaker 2>You don't grab them real simple.</v>

860
00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's grabbing anything.</v>

861
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Rash guard is way better than shorts cause shorts could grab all the fucking</v>

862
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

863
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

864
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I think honestly like what do you see Tyron Woodley wearing right there?</v>

865
00:22:06.011 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to go.</v>

866
00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:07.503
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

867
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.381
<v Speaker 2>Let's do,</v>

868
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:11.620
<v Speaker 2>it should be the way to go on a basketball court.</v>

869
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.130
<v Speaker 2>See it's time for that.</v>

870
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it all together.</v>

871
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.450

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.080

00:26:15.081 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 4>some espionage.</v>

1021
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>some rich leader just likes him.</v>

1025
00:26:20.391 --> 00:26:20.810
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1026
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.230
<v Speaker 4>I paid him to fucking go hang out with him.</v>

1027
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.360
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1028
00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 4>He likes those dudes to come over and party with them.</v>

1029
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.771
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1030
00:26:24.771 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 4>when you're a super powerful baller in some other country,</v>

1031
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:29.540
<v Speaker 4>that's like the ultimate,</v>

1032
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 4>you get the heavyweight champion,</v>

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:32.751

<v Speaker 4>put this hat on.</v>

1037
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:33.950
<v Speaker 4>Take a picture with me.</v>

1038
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:34.783
<v Speaker 4>Here it is.</v>

1039
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Bravo,</v>

1040
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.620
<v Speaker 4>Tony Ferguson,</v>

1041
00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:37.300
<v Speaker 4>Habib number,</v>

1042
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:37.790
<v Speaker 4>Madoff.</v>

1043
00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.080
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1044
00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:39.680
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1045
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.000
<v Speaker 4>That's just a couple of weeks away.</v>

1046
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:41.834
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be,</v>

1047
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:42.950
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be there for that.</v>

1048
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:44.983
<v Speaker 3>That'd be awesome.</v>

1049
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be fucking nuts,</v>

1050
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:46.980
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1051
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1052
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.060
<v Speaker 3>we're doing it.</v>

1053
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 3>You mean Tony is,</v>

1054
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.170
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1055
00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:53.250
<v Speaker 3>that's an exciting fight man.</v>

1056
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:53.611
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1057
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:54.810
<v Speaker 3>We can't talk about strategy.</v>

1058
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.153
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1060
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

1061
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.510
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy fight between the number one and the number two contender in that</v>

1062
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:01.344
<v Speaker 3>division.</v>

1063
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.700
<v Speaker 3>The obvious strategy for Khabib is to try to take Tony down and the obvious</v>

1064
00:27:05.701 --> 00:27:09.060
<v Speaker 3>strategy for Tony is to keep it up and dot.</v>

1065
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:09.894
<v Speaker 3>I'm up on his feet.</v>

1066
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the obvious and everybody knows that.</v>

1067
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Let me think.</v>

1068
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.360
<v Speaker 3>How much do you think,</v>

1069
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:15.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1070
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.860
<v Speaker 3>like opinion changed when he got clipped by Michael Johnson and got wobbled?</v>

1071
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 3>People are saying,</v>

1072
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.310
<v Speaker 3>and I mean if you're looking at,</v>

1073
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's pretty obvious.</v>

1074
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:23.701
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1075
00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:23.870
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1076
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:24.703
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1077
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:25.230
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1078
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 3>he's human.</v>

1079
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1080
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.980
<v Speaker 3>That's really what you saw.</v>

1081
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1082
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.730
<v Speaker 3>Cause for 24 or five or 23 fights before that,</v>

1083
00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:33.080
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1084
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.600
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] mall and motherfuckers basically says that he does,</v>

1085
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.530
<v Speaker 3>he's not one of those guys that can take anything.</v>

1086
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.011
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1087
00:27:41.011 --> 00:27:42.720
<v Speaker 3>there's guys out there that can take any shot.</v>

1088
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.340
<v Speaker 3>They haven't been rocked yet.</v>

1089
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1090
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing a little,</v>

1091
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 3>maybe a little chink,</v>

1092
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:48.350
<v Speaker 3>a little tiny Cenk.</v>

1093
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's looking at that.</v>

1094
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.791
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1095
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:52.440
<v Speaker 3>It's going to give people confidence,</v>

1096
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:55.890
<v Speaker 3>but he's so good at taking people down and mauling him.</v>

1097
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.461
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1098
00:27:56.461 --> 00:27:59.280
<v Speaker 3>that that is the hardest thing to stop.</v>

1099
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.660
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1100
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:05.220
<v Speaker 3>we're doing everything we can to prepare for the best.</v>

1101
00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:05.910
<v Speaker 3>The worst,</v>

1102
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.020
<v Speaker 3>the worst case scenario.</v>

1103
00:28:07.021 --> 00:28:08.480
<v Speaker 3>The best scenario where we're,</v>

1104
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.433
<v Speaker 3>we're doing,</v>

1105
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean Tony's doing everything really.</v>

1106
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:12.174
<v Speaker 3>Tony is a fucking,</v>

1107
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.010
<v Speaker 3>he's a maniac is the most fascinating fight in the division for me outside of</v>

1108
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:18.320
<v Speaker 3>Conor McGregor versus IB.</v>

1109
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Those two fights.</v>

1110
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Conor McGregor versus,</v>

1111
00:28:20.921 --> 00:28:22.800
<v Speaker 3>that'd be even Tony Ferguson versus could be.</v>

1112
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Those are the two most exciting fights and in my opinion,</v>

1113
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 3>without giving anything away,</v>

1114
00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:33.051
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows based on the past that Tony can seriously choke people.</v>

1115
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Anybody out like any,</v>

1116
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:41.990
<v Speaker 3>any wrong move on the ground and he could hit that Doris from any position and</v>

1117
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:43.291
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>

1118
00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:44.124
<v Speaker 3>it just keeps</v>

1119
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.930
<v Speaker 3>growing and expanding and he's,</v>

1120
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:53.150
<v Speaker 3>he's become so unorthodox on his feet on the ground is pulling guard,</v>

1121
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:55.290
<v Speaker 3>flying him a nice,</v>

1122
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.610
<v Speaker 3>he's all over the place.</v>

1123
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.050
<v Speaker 3>He's doing gymnastics,</v>

1124
00:28:58.051 --> 00:28:58.890
<v Speaker 3>he's doing flips.</v>

1125
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.850
<v Speaker 3>He's doing but he's doing now what he's doing.</v>

1126
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.020
<v Speaker 3>He does ever all thing.</v>

1127
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:05.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't even really know.</v>

1128
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 3>I tried to do it in big bear.</v>

1129
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:07.164
<v Speaker 3>I'm like Ah.</v>

1130
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.990
<v Speaker 3>He does [inaudible] ball.</v>

1131
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1132
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Steel Bowling Ball and he does all this crazy like almost like dancing does with</v>

1133
00:29:14.111 --> 00:29:14.181
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1134
00:29:14.181 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 3>It looks like he brought a wing Chung dummy up to big bear.</v>

1135
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.910
<v Speaker 3>He's into wing Chung.</v>

1136
00:29:18.911 --> 00:29:20.010
<v Speaker 3>He's into everything.</v>

1137
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Everything man.</v>

1138
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:23.210
<v Speaker 3>He is a true sign.</v>

1139
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.400
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't like a joke that he's really into it.</v>

1140
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.330
<v Speaker 3>He likes,</v>

1141
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.670
<v Speaker 3>he trains like no one I've ever seen before.</v>

1142
00:29:30.671 --> 00:29:33.690
<v Speaker 3>It just hours and hours just out in the front up in big bear.</v>

1143
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:34.530
<v Speaker 3>He built everything,</v>

1144
00:29:34.531 --> 00:29:34.981
<v Speaker 3>the bags,</v>

1145
00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:35.581
<v Speaker 3>the stands,</v>

1146
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:36.060
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1147
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 3>He builds everything.</v>

1148
00:29:37.051 --> 00:29:37.890
<v Speaker 3>He's got a house out there.</v>

1149
00:29:37.891 --> 00:29:38.910
<v Speaker 3>He's the ultimate macgyver.</v>

1150
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:39.031
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1151
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:41.100
<v Speaker 3>he rented it and built it the first two days.</v>

1152
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.213
<v Speaker 3>Brought it all out</v>

1153
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:42.761
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

1154
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:44.320
<v Speaker 5>He's like the ultimate macgyver,</v>

1155
00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.050
<v Speaker 5>a construction carpenter.</v>

1156
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.200
<v Speaker 5>He can build a Sarah McMahon would take down.</v>

1157
00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.820
<v Speaker 5>Damn do when I put my hands on her,</v>

1158
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:55.031

1159
00:29:55.031 --> 00:29:56.890

1160
00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.840

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.730

1176
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.530
<v Speaker 5>Like he does all these strange moves with it.</v>

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.780
<v Speaker 5>Like did you ever ask him like what his philosophy is?</v>

1178
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:17.913
<v Speaker 5>Philosophy is,</v>

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 5>He's always doing something for people trying to sync this up at home.</v>

1188
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.970
<v Speaker 5>It's round one.</v>

1189
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:41.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry I didn't do this for the first fight.</v>

1190
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:42.221

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:48.581
<v Speaker 5>That's a wrap.</v>

1194
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:50.490
<v Speaker 5>Sam Sarah McMahon.</v>

1195
00:30:50.491 --> 00:30:52.360
<v Speaker 5>He just pumped that girl back.</v>

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:53.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1198
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.210
<v Speaker 5>You know what she's hoping around?</v>

1199
00:30:55.290 --> 00:31:00.290
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she may be the first girl Jesus that's known for taking people down,</v>

1200
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.400
<v Speaker 5>passing their garden,</v>

1201
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.880
<v Speaker 5>choking him out like that there.</v>

1202
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:06.371
<v Speaker 5>Go to,</v>

1203
00:31:06.371 --> 00:31:08.020
<v Speaker 5>you got to stop that fucking,</v>

1204
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:09.653
<v Speaker 5>what did she say?</v>

1205
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:12.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the hell she was saying.</v>

1206
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.880
<v Speaker 5>She's fucking scary.</v>

1207
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:15.611
<v Speaker 5>One of the girl.</v>

1210
00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:18.140
<v Speaker 5>Does that take some down passes that garden chokes?</v>

1211
00:31:18.141 --> 00:31:19.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't can choke the shit.</v>

1212
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.680
<v Speaker 5>That could be your shit right there.</v>

1213
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.191
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1214
00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:23.170
<v Speaker 5>you know she got tagged by Amanda Nunez,</v>

1215
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.320
<v Speaker 5>choked out herself like her stand up.</v>

1216
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.000
<v Speaker 5>She has power and her punches.</v>

1217
00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:32.290
<v Speaker 5>She's a big power puncher but she doesn't have the kind of power that Nunez as</v>

1218
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.830
<v Speaker 5>Nunez is going to be a real problem for post guidance.</v>

1219
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.130
<v Speaker 5>She might not need it.</v>

1220
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.720
<v Speaker 5>The way she closed that arm triangle.</v>

1221
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:38.710
<v Speaker 5>It's so professional.</v>

1222
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:40.630
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>

1223
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:41.463
<v Speaker 5>she could,</v>

1224
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.860
<v Speaker 5>she could take most girls down because of a ruffling.</v>

1225
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.410
<v Speaker 5>She understands she's a finisher.</v>

1226
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.303
<v Speaker 5>She can't take</v>

1227
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.471
<v Speaker 5>her husband's.</v>

1228
00:31:50.471 --> 00:31:52.020
<v Speaker 5>Did you get to black belt right?</v>

1229
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.421
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:31:52.421 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 5>Isn't he a,</v>

1231
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.370
<v Speaker 5>I believe he's a Jujitsu instructor.</v>

1232
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:55.390
<v Speaker 5>She did it from the mount to,</v>

1233
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:55.810
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1234
00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 5>Very interesting.</v>

1235
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.590
<v Speaker 5>I saw total pumping that grow up.</v>

1236
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:01.250
<v Speaker 5>That's what she's doing and he's coached.</v>

1237
00:32:01.251 --> 00:32:02.860
<v Speaker 5>Shown her she's going to be going to be all right.</v>

1238
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.390
<v Speaker 5>I had,</v>

1239
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:07.780
<v Speaker 5>I had some doubts about her early cause she said some things about Jujitsu when</v>

1240
00:32:07.781 --> 00:32:08.980
<v Speaker 5>she first came out in the UFC,</v>

1241
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.311
<v Speaker 5>the judge,</v>

1242
00:32:09.311 --> 00:32:10.250
<v Speaker 5>she didn't like Jujitsu.</v>

1243
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.680
<v Speaker 5>She doesn't train Jujitsu or something like that.</v>

1244
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:16.681
<v Speaker 5>She was like old school wrestler type of mentality but it looks like she finally</v>

1245
00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 5>had her mind opened.</v>

1246
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.560
<v Speaker 5>You know that was some good,</v>

1247
00:32:20.561 --> 00:32:21.011
<v Speaker 5>that was good.</v>

1248
00:32:21.011 --> 00:32:24.670
<v Speaker 5>Solid guard passing wrestlers just don't pass guards like that unless they train</v>

1249
00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:25.504
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu,</v>

1250
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:26.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1251
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:26.800
<v Speaker 5>wrestlers.</v>

1252
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 5>Some wrestlers never learned how to pass the guard.</v>

1253
00:32:28.631 --> 00:32:30.730
<v Speaker 5>It kind of seems like that's a thing of the past though,</v>

1254
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:31.564
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it?</v>

1255
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.021
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1256
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:32.561
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1257
00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 5>That's why I was kind of worried cause she would say something like that.</v>

1258
00:32:35.111 --> 00:32:35.581
<v Speaker 5>She was saying,</v>

1259
00:32:35.581 --> 00:32:35.701
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

1260
00:32:35.701 --> 00:32:36.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't train Jujitsu.</v>

1261
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.353
<v Speaker 5>Go wait a minute.</v>

1262
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 5>It's 2017 everybody needs to train Jujitsu.</v>

1263
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.490
<v Speaker 3>If you're fighting in the UFC.</v>

1264
00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:42.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:43.940
<v Speaker 3>You have to love it.</v>

1266
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I never heard her say that.</v>

1267
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.123
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>

1268
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 3>what did she say that it was it like real early,</v>

1269
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:50.060
<v Speaker 3>early on,</v>

1270
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:50.893
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1271
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:52.303
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1272
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.760
<v Speaker 3>she did say something that she,</v>

1273
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:58.580
<v Speaker 3>something to the effect that she hasn't liked Jujitsu.</v>

1274
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Well my,</v>

1275
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 3>I guess being a wrestler early and it's an old school wrestler mentality,</v>

1276
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:04.550
<v Speaker 3>that's all.</v>

1277
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:05.383
<v Speaker 3>No big deal.</v>

1278
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.130
<v Speaker 3>The only rust like that.</v>

1279
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:07.761
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1280
00:33:07.761 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1281
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.450
<v Speaker 3>They're still Russell's like that and there's been a bunch that were famous to,</v>

1282
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.080
<v Speaker 3>well there's always a bunch of people that get super attached to their style</v>

1283
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:16.160
<v Speaker 3>that they started out with.</v>

1284
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.861
<v Speaker 3>They want to prove that.</v>

1285
00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:17.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't blame you.</v>

1286
00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.081
<v Speaker 3>I don't blame.</v>

1287
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:18.530
<v Speaker 3>The rest was,</v>

1288
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.071
<v Speaker 3>look what happened.</v>

1289
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii's shows up.</v>

1290
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Everyone,</v>

1291
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.920
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1292
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 3>these Midwestern wrestlers are looking at this.</v>

1293
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Who's this little Mexican kid choking everybody out beating Russ and they're,</v>

1294
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.760
<v Speaker 3>they're doing challenge matches and great.</v>

1295
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:29.271
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1296
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:30.260
<v Speaker 3>fuck these guys,</v>

1297
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1298
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.410
<v Speaker 3>How are they going to take me down and do that shit?</v>

1299
00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Most of,</v>

1300
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.790
<v Speaker 3>most of the rest of that I ended that are like that.</v>

1301
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.331
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

1302
00:33:35.331 --> 00:33:37.100
<v Speaker 3>they do that because they're fucking lazy.</v>

1303
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.233
<v Speaker 3>That's what it says.</v>

1304
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is because they,</v>

1305
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:39.680
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1306
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.310
<v Speaker 3>they're so good at wrestling and they just,</v>

1307
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.350
<v Speaker 3>I just seems like it's just a weird little like lazy thing for one because it's</v>

1308
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:49.161
<v Speaker 3>extra work in too,</v>

1309
00:33:49.161 --> 00:33:52.370
<v Speaker 3>because you're going to get fucking choked out and don't want to lose.</v>

1310
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:53.423
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1311
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 3>It's that kind of thing where it's hard for wrestlers to progress.</v>

1312
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1313
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1314
00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it stems from,</v>

1315
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.630
<v Speaker 3>it stems from the Gracies coming out,</v>

1316
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Speaker 3>challenging everybody and beat him getting wrestlers.</v>

1317
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:06.021
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1318
00:34:06.021 --> 00:34:06.350
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>

1319
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Dan Severn gets choked out.</v>

1320
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.290
<v Speaker 3>Mark Coleman's coming in,</v>

1321
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 3>mark homeless and trying to pass the guard.</v>

1322
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.800
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to beat Jujitsu to hold you down.</v>

1323
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.400
<v Speaker 3>But it also stems from the same thing is with kickboxers.</v>

1324
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.650
<v Speaker 3>Kickboxers don't want to train Jujitsu either.</v>

1325
00:34:18.651 --> 00:34:21.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was always the problem with certain fighters.</v>

1326
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:24.650
<v Speaker 3>They just didn't want to get tapped because we're still good standing again.</v>

1327
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.540
<v Speaker 3>That's from the UFC cause you also saw the strikers getting taken down easily</v>

1328
00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 3>and getting choked out easily.</v>

1329
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:33.150
<v Speaker 3>So right away dude has been training 15 years striking.</v>

1330
00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.980
<v Speaker 3>It's thinking fuck these Jujitsu guys fucked though.</v>

1331
00:34:35.981 --> 00:34:38.810
<v Speaker 3>I want to learn a little take down the fence and I'm a fucking knock 'em out.</v>

1332
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Well that's learning it.</v>

1333
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.270
<v Speaker 3>Fuck learning yet I'm alert.</v>

1334
00:34:41.271 --> 00:34:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Some take down the fence and I'm still,</v>

1335
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to still knock us cro cop.</v>

1336
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.500
<v Speaker 3>So back in the day,</v>

1337
00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah there was not to stand up.</v>

1338
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.060
<v Speaker 3>Even this whole,</v>

1339
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.780
<v Speaker 3>even this whole thoughts on the cage and his training in different,</v>

1340
00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:53.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1341
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:54.400
<v Speaker 3>you're like no man,</v>

1342
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:59.550
<v Speaker 3>you and then that was wrestler versus striker that that rivalry when you eat</v>

1343
00:35:00.591 --> 00:35:03.140
<v Speaker 3>gorge bulb [inaudible] Mark Kurt,</v>

1344
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:04.250
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>

1345
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 3>That do you remember how that fight went down?</v>

1346
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Mark change can crack them.</v>

1347
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:08.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1348
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1349
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Mark and mark curb took him down at will and then got tired,</v>

1350
00:35:12.801 --> 00:35:13.760
<v Speaker 3>would never pass the guard.</v>

1351
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Never tried passing the gods above.</v>

1352
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 3>Changin had a decent guard.</v>

1353
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:18.500
<v Speaker 3>He had a good survival guard.</v>

1354
00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.920
<v Speaker 3>He had good guard recovery and Mark Curtain,</v>

1355
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1356
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.870
<v Speaker 3>admittedly never worked on passing.</v>

1357
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:25.550
<v Speaker 3>He just felt that he could just stay in the garden,</v>

1358
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:26.330
<v Speaker 3>pound someone,</v>

1359
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.290
<v Speaker 3>but you couldn't do it.</v>

1360
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.130
<v Speaker 3>Devolved off chance involved,</v>

1361
00:35:28.131 --> 00:35:30.590
<v Speaker 3>potentially kept tying them up and then late in the round,</v>

1362
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:31.671
<v Speaker 3>late in the fight,</v>

1363
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:33.230
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't take them down anymore.</v>

1364
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 3>They were both on their feet.</v>

1365
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Marker was folding and that's when you got to vote.</v>

1366
00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Changin</v>

1367
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.730
<v Speaker 5>lit him up.</v>

1368
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:39.563
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>

1369
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.160
<v Speaker 5>It was very interesting back then.</v>

1370
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Speaker 5>If Mark Kerr what had just spent day one,</v>

1371
00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 5>once he decided to do MMA,</v>

1372
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.480
<v Speaker 5>let me get rid of good passing and mountain.</v>

1373
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.841
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1374
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:49.530
<v Speaker 5>But will.</v>

1375
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.670
<v Speaker 5>But in all fairness,</v>

1376
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.140
<v Speaker 5>that was the least of his problems.</v>

1377
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.980
<v Speaker 5>That guy was on a million different drugs that documented this smashing</v>

1378
00:35:55.981 --> 00:35:56.430
<v Speaker 5>machines.</v>

1379
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:57.840
<v Speaker 5>Such a crazy documentary.</v>

1380
00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.630
<v Speaker 5>Shouldn't find out what exactly he was doing.</v>

1381
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:00.901
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1382
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:01.321
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1383
00:36:01.321 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 5>Like that guy was fighting the toughest fighters in the world while he was</v>

1384
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:05.280
<v Speaker 5>shooting heroin.</v>

1385
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:05.971
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1386
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:06.331
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

1387
00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:09.190
<v Speaker 5>he was shooting like all sorts of crazy paint.</v>

1388
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.360
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1389
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.230
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>

1390
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:10.450
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1391
00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.080
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

1392
00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.540
<v Speaker 5>did you ever see this smashing machine who shooting up opiates shooting now he</v>

1393
00:36:14.541 --> 00:36:14.730
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>

1394
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.860
<v Speaker 5>It was all pharmaceutical grade,</v>

1395
00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:17.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1396
00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.670
<v Speaker 5>painkillers.</v>

1397
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:20.250
<v Speaker 5>He raised up all the steroids and stuff.</v>

1398
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.600
<v Speaker 5>Crazy documentary.</v>

1399
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.553
<v Speaker 5>You never saw a number this?</v>

1400
00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1401
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.500
<v Speaker 5>but I just remember the steroid part.</v>

1402
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.050
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1403
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:25.883
<v Speaker 5>that was nothing.</v>

1404
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.360
<v Speaker 5>He was slamming painkillers and it was fucking veins and he would just sit in</v>

1405
00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.850
<v Speaker 5>there and letting them film the whole thing.</v>

1406
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.733
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1407
00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:36.590
<v Speaker 5>It's like fucking yes,</v>

1408
00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:37.740
<v Speaker 5>exactly what I was described for help.</v>

1409
00:36:37.741 --> 00:36:37.981
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1410
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 5>fresh bottles of whatever painkiller he was fucking taking,</v>

1411
00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:42.840
<v Speaker 5>judging it straight in his arm.</v>

1412
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.900
<v Speaker 5>They thought when they were filming him that they were filming the baddest</v>

1413
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:47.640
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker on the planet earth and they were like,</v>

1414
00:36:47.641 --> 00:36:48.061
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1415
00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 5>we're watching this guy.</v>

1416
00:36:48.901 --> 00:36:50.130
<v Speaker 5>Right as he falls apart,</v>

1417
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.900
<v Speaker 5>like right as the filming started beginning getting,</v>

1418
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:53.940
<v Speaker 5>he was falling apart.</v>

1419
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.430
<v Speaker 5>Here it is Tony Ferguson.</v>

1420
00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:57.350
<v Speaker 5>So here's the sleep.</v>

1421
00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.080
<v Speaker 5>Sheer luck,</v>

1422
00:36:59.081 --> 00:36:59.700
<v Speaker 5>luck.</v>

1423
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.331
<v Speaker 5>What's going on,</v>

1424
00:37:00.331 --> 00:37:02.040
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be very hard to take down.</v>

1425
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:04.350
<v Speaker 5>And if Khabib takes him down,</v>

1426
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 5>he's got to be really worried about them.</v>

1427
00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:07.860
<v Speaker 5>Chokes that we've already seen.</v>

1428
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:08.400
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1429
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.060
<v Speaker 5>So He's,</v>

1430
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.320
<v Speaker 5>he can just take down Tony,</v>

1431
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:15.160
<v Speaker 5>like he did Michael Johnson and not worry about legit chokes from all sorts of</v>

1432
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.640
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

1433
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:15.810
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1434
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:17.130
<v Speaker 5>it's all in the transition.</v>

1435
00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.360
<v Speaker 5>So it tends to in great Marcella teens,</v>

1436
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:22.530
<v Speaker 5>if he raps,</v>

1437
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:23.920
<v Speaker 5>he's always looking for Darcy.</v>

1438
00:37:23.921 --> 00:37:24.754
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1439
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1440
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:26.063
<v Speaker 5>could be,</v>

1441
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:26.903
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1442
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.120
<v Speaker 5>he's one of the best grapplers in the UFC.</v>

1443
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.900
<v Speaker 5>No doubt.</v>

1444
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:35.000
<v Speaker 5>He may be the best at a grounding and pounding and controlling you like a,</v>

1445
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:37.620
<v Speaker 5>like a legit high level black belt.</v>

1446
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.753
<v Speaker 5>He passes.</v>

1447
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.910
<v Speaker 5>Who knows how it's going to match up against Tony Man.</v>

1448
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:43.500
<v Speaker 5>But we're preparing everything we can.</v>

1449
00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:43.641
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

1450
00:37:43.641 --> 00:37:44.730
<v Speaker 5>we're doing everything we can.</v>

1451
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how it's going to look when it's all said and done,</v>

1452
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:52.400
<v Speaker 5>but we're doing the best we can to prepare for the worst case scenario.</v>

1453
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.390
<v Speaker 5>Who knows what's going to happen.</v>

1454
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:55.590
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

1455
00:37:55.591 --> 00:38:00.540
<v Speaker 5>the one thing's for sure is one mistake on the ground and Tony's going to wrap</v>

1456
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.960
<v Speaker 5>your that.</v>

1457
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.793
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1458
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.420
<v Speaker 5>but this motherfucker as well.</v>

1459
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:03.691
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1460
00:38:03.691 --> 00:38:05.330
<v Speaker 5>one mistake on the ground and Habib number,</v>

1461
00:38:05.331 --> 00:38:07.090
<v Speaker 5>good Madoff's going to fucking break your arms.</v>

1462
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.740
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

1463
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.431
<v Speaker 5>he's a freak.</v>

1464
00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:10.170
<v Speaker 5>And that's why this is so an interesting,</v>

1465
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.700
<v Speaker 5>because Tony's a freak too.</v>

1466
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.240
<v Speaker 5>And like when you see Tony fucking up Hofeld dos Anjos here.</v>

1467
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:15.960
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1468
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.290
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1469
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:20.100
<v Speaker 5>Tony Ferguson easily could have been the UFC lightweight champion of the world</v>

1470
00:38:20.101 --> 00:38:23.220
<v Speaker 5>if he caught Hofeld Dosantos when dos Anjos had the bell,</v>

1471
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 5>he could have got him.</v>

1472
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.471
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1473
00:38:25.471 --> 00:38:25.860
<v Speaker 5>Tony,</v>

1474
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.510
<v Speaker 5>I think Tony could do that to anybody.</v>

1475
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:28.140
<v Speaker 5>How did the,</v>

1476
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.940
<v Speaker 5>how did he beat,</v>

1477
00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:29.610
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1478
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:30.600
<v Speaker 5>Barboza was he,</v>

1479
00:38:30.601 --> 00:38:32.150
<v Speaker 5>did you just choke Barboza yes,</v>

1480
00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.111
<v Speaker 5>he dodged him,</v>

1481
00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:33.490
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1482
00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:34.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1483
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.651
<v Speaker 5>That was it.</v>

1484
00:38:34.651 --> 00:38:34.960
<v Speaker 5>Right here.</v>

1485
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm standing and I'm</v>

1486
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.120
<v Speaker 4>finished him off on the ground.</v>

1487
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:37.781
<v Speaker 4>It was perfect.</v>

1488
00:38:37.781 --> 00:38:38.021
<v Speaker 4>Tony.</v>

1489
00:38:38.021 --> 00:38:41.140
<v Speaker 4>Something special and that's why this fight is so interesting because hubby was</v>

1490
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:42.280
<v Speaker 4>obviously something special.</v>

1491
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 4>He's the only guy that's a contender that has been fighting the best guys in the</v>

1492
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:49.240
<v Speaker 4>world and is undefeated as he fights for the title.</v>

1493
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:50.260
<v Speaker 4>That's so unheard of.</v>

1494
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.240
<v Speaker 4>Everybody may get one or two.</v>

1495
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's got early in their career.</v>

1496
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 4>They've got a fight or two that they lost,</v>

1497
00:38:55.751 --> 00:39:00.751
<v Speaker 4>but he's one of the very few guys that has only shown one moment in his entire</v>

1498
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:04.930
<v Speaker 4>career inside the octagon where he really didn't look so good.</v>

1499
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.960
<v Speaker 4>And that was a brief moment where Michael Johnson hit him.</v>

1500
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.410
<v Speaker 4>Obviously he recovered from that and came back to that as much smashed him</v>

1501
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.340
<v Speaker 4>smushed down.</v>

1502
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.061
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

1503
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:14.500
<v Speaker 4>when he gets guys on the ground,</v>

1504
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:16.600
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like he's a different weight class than them.</v>

1505
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:17.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1506
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.400
<v Speaker 3>There's levels,</v>

1507
00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.950
<v Speaker 3>thousands of levels of being heavy and he's super heavy.</v>

1508
00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:24.890
<v Speaker 3>He sticks on.</v>

1509
00:39:24.891 --> 00:39:25.724
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>

1510
00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 3>I saw him in person at my fight.</v>

1511
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:32.330
<v Speaker 3>That fight the law was supposed to happen is passing a big his passing to from</v>

1512
00:39:32.331 --> 00:39:35.550
<v Speaker 3>full guard or to like open guard right into he forces a,</v>

1513
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.510
<v Speaker 3>a z guard or a quarter z.</v>

1514
00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:43.570
<v Speaker 3>Like right away there's movement to set up the half guard that he's going to try</v>

1515
00:39:43.701 --> 00:39:44.420
<v Speaker 3>to pass.</v>

1516
00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:44.991
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>

1517
00:39:44.991 --> 00:39:46.400
<v Speaker 3>His knee slash is brilliant.</v>

1518
00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1519
00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.500
<v Speaker 3>his mount is control.</v>

1520
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.850
<v Speaker 3>That crucifix move,</v>

1521
00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:50.511
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1522
00:39:50.511 --> 00:39:51.344
<v Speaker 3>He's a black.</v>

1523
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.000
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows it.</v>

1524
00:39:53.001 --> 00:39:53.990
<v Speaker 3>Very few people do it.</v>

1525
00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1526
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.800
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1527
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.090
<v Speaker 3>he's always looking for it.</v>

1528
00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.500
<v Speaker 3>And obviously he's,</v>

1529
00:39:57.501 --> 00:39:57.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1530
00:39:57.711 --> 00:39:58.940
<v Speaker 3>if you look at his earlier fights,</v>

1531
00:39:58.941 --> 00:40:00.230
<v Speaker 3>he's got triangle chokes.</v>

1532
00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:00.441
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1533
00:40:00.441 --> 00:40:01.820
<v Speaker 3>he could finish off your back too.</v>

1534
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:02.630
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1535
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.330
<v Speaker 3>so that's a tall order,</v>

1536
00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.870
<v Speaker 3>tall order for Tony.</v>

1537
00:40:05.871 --> 00:40:07.760
<v Speaker 3>But believe you me,</v>

1538
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Tony is looking pretty damn good to me right now on the ground.</v>

1539
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.870
<v Speaker 3>So it's going to be,</v>

1540
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:15.813
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1541
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.680
<v Speaker 3>crazy seeing how it all plays out.</v>

1542
00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1543
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm so excited for that dude.</v>

1544
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:21.411
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1545
00:40:21.411 --> 00:40:22.610
<v Speaker 3>my head's going to explode.</v>

1546
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:23.401
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1547
00:40:23.401 --> 00:40:24.450
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy fight and it's,</v>

1548
00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.300
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be even more crazy if you just got so much invested in it.</v>

1549
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.841
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1550
00:40:27.841 --> 00:40:30.780
<v Speaker 4>for me as a guy that gets to sit there and call that fight,</v>

1551
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated just because when you see a guy like Tony Ferguson,</v>

1552
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:35.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1553
00:40:35.311 --> 00:40:36.180
<v Speaker 4>he's a problem.</v>

1554
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.740
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you solve that problem?</v>

1555
00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Like what's the solution to that problem?</v>

1556
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.331
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1557
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:40.710
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1558
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the answer to that is.</v>

1559
00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:42.781
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1560
00:40:42.781 --> 00:40:47.010
<v Speaker 4>I would say a guy who can keep the fight standing up and tee off on them and</v>

1561
00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:48.150
<v Speaker 4>land good strikes,</v>

1562
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:51.430
<v Speaker 4>like maybe a guy who takes advantage of the aggressive style that number grew</v>

1563
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:52.264
<v Speaker 4>Madoff has.</v>

1564
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.053
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1565
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.170
<v Speaker 4>maybe Tony's that guy,</v>

1566
00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.090
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be interesting as as,</v>

1567
00:40:57.091 --> 00:40:57.924
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1568
00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:58.771
<v Speaker 4>Michael Johnson Shell,</v>

1569
00:40:58.771 --> 00:40:59.071
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

1570
00:40:59.071 --> 00:40:59.760
<v Speaker 4>you can't punch him,</v>

1571
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.260
<v Speaker 4>you can't hit him and we can land and get shot.</v>

1572
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.093
<v Speaker 4>You can rock him.</v>

1573
00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.290
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's going to be the main place to catch him.</v>

1574
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.640
<v Speaker 4>But if you can catch him,</v>

1575
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:09.900
<v Speaker 4>keep on the outside,</v>

1576
00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:11.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1577
00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.950
<v Speaker 4>you don't want a guy like that who fights of that way,</v>

1578
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.530
<v Speaker 4>that good at grappling and that could arresting and takedowns and constant</v>

1579
00:41:16.531 --> 00:41:18.060
<v Speaker 4>pressure in your face the whole time.</v>

1580
00:41:18.061 --> 00:41:18.960
<v Speaker 4>He got to keep them outside.</v>

1581
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:21.870
<v Speaker 4>And then I think Tony tell him up to do it because again,</v>

1582
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:25.560
<v Speaker 4>seeing how small could be was last weekend I was like,</v>

1583
00:41:25.561 --> 00:41:25.711
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1584
00:41:25.711 --> 00:41:26.700
<v Speaker 4>he's not that big of a guy.</v>

1585
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1586
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:28.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge fan of his,</v>

1587
00:41:28.651 --> 00:41:29.670
<v Speaker 4>I think he's fucking awesome.</v>

1588
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.500
<v Speaker 4>But he walks around big 75 maybe,</v>

1589
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.393
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

1590
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:34.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1591
00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:35.720
<v Speaker 1>he just didn't see he,</v>

1592
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 1>and you know how the Russians travel there always in groups of fucking a</v>

1593
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:39.020
<v Speaker 1>hundred.</v>

1594
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1595
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:40.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's always entertaining and they're,</v>

1596
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.200
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking hilarious.</v>

1597
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.090
<v Speaker 1>But he's just didn't seem that big at all.</v>

1598
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.421
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1599
00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:45.000
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1600
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.833
<v Speaker 1>huh.</v>

1601
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.761
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

1602
00:41:46.761 --> 00:41:49.000
<v Speaker 1>that was the only thing that shot him because he's so strong magnets.</v>

1603
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Everybody we saying something.</v>

1604
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh I'm hearing the,</v>

1605
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was you.</v>

1606
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1607
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.310
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the TVs up a little loud.</v>

1608
00:41:55.311 --> 00:41:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm confused.</v>

1609
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:56.783
<v Speaker 1>You would think like,</v>

1610
00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:57.190
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1611
00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:00.430
<v Speaker 1>he'd be built like he bow to ragdoll seem like the,</v>

1612
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I think the glaze and t bell thing only works without Usada.</v>

1613
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1614
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you know when Grayson got popped and they,</v>

1615
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.630
<v Speaker 1>they found like a punch of different shit in them.</v>

1616
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:08.991
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1617
00:42:08.991 --> 00:42:09.824
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1618
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean if anybody was going to get caught glazed and t bow looked like it was</v>

1619
00:42:14.301 --> 00:42:19.301
<v Speaker 1>300 pounds and it was fighting one 55 so fucking big.</v>

1620
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd never seen anybody that was remotely as big as glazing when Grayson was at</v>

1621
00:42:24.261 --> 00:42:25.000
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>

1622
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.430
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1623
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:26.540
<v Speaker 1>gets so massive.</v>

1624
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Like he was so big,</v>

1625
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 1>he was so big.</v>

1626
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.790
<v Speaker 1>He was Jack.</v>

1627
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:31.610
<v Speaker 1>He cutting from,</v>

1628
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.420
<v Speaker 1>from over 200 pounds and Sha readed like completely,</v>

1629
00:42:35.421 --> 00:42:36.410
<v Speaker 1>totally shredded.</v>

1630
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.711
<v Speaker 1>I was a,</v>

1631
00:42:37.711 --> 00:42:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I was touched sparring with um,</v>

1632
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.690
<v Speaker 1>with RDA the other day cause he's,</v>

1633
00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1634
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get Ruca now and,</v>

1635
00:42:43.801 --> 00:42:45.920
<v Speaker 1>and he's over there a little bit and I was like,</v>

1636
00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:46.071
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1637
00:42:46.071 --> 00:42:47.480
<v Speaker 1>you're not that much taller than me.</v>

1638
00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:48.880
<v Speaker 1>But he's probably 205 pounds.</v>

1639
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1640
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Fucking huge.</v>

1641
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:52.010
<v Speaker 1>And he's welterweight now.</v>

1642
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1643
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.140
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just trying to move him and trying to just,</v>

1644
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:55.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1645
00:42:55.351 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Speaker 1>are playing but trying to foot sweeps and I do the fun shit.</v>

1646
00:42:59.180 --> 00:42:59.931
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

1647
00:42:59.931 --> 00:43:00.950
<v Speaker 1>he's really heavy.</v>

1648
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1649
00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1650
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.330
<v Speaker 1>He's decided to go the way of Donald's Serone move on up.</v>

1651
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a bad idea.</v>

1652
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.293
<v Speaker 1>Not Mom.</v>

1653
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:10.813
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1654
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I keep going back to this,</v>

1655
00:43:12.081 --> 00:43:12.711
<v Speaker 1>but I'll say it again.</v>

1656
00:43:12.711 --> 00:43:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the worst thing in fighting his weight.</v>

1657
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Cutting.</v>

1658
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the worst thing.</v>

1659
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I think you're seeing guys that make the weight but they can't fight up to their</v>

1660
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:19.911
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>

1661
00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 1>their bodies compromised even though their mind is willing and they feel like</v>

1662
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.410
<v Speaker 1>pretty gangster about it all.</v>

1663
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:25.610
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1664
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 1>they dose don't fight the way they can.</v>

1665
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.650
<v Speaker 1>And when they move up you see him fight much better.</v>

1666
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:31.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1667
00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:32.054
<v Speaker 1>barring Donald,</v>

1668
00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:32.973
<v Speaker 1>his last fight,</v>

1669
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:34.221
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1670
00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1671
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I think Brendan Schaub had a really good point when he said it was just too</v>

1672
00:43:36.951 --> 00:43:39.500
<v Speaker 1>close to that fight that he had with Matt Brown.</v>

1673
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.670
<v Speaker 1>He got rocked in that fight.</v>

1674
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:44.210
<v Speaker 1>He got dropped in that fight and he just looked like he was vulnerable.</v>

1675
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.470
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

1676
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.470
<v Speaker 1>he's also fighting Jorge Mosbey Dahl,</v>

1677
00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:48.950
<v Speaker 1>who's a bad motherfucker.</v>

1678
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Jorge's a very interested,</v>

1679
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.750
<v Speaker 1>very talented guy and very diverse.</v>

1680
00:43:53.751 --> 00:43:57.080
<v Speaker 1>He can do everything and slick [inaudible] guys that's been under pressure so</v>

1681
00:43:57.081 --> 00:43:57.914
<v Speaker 1>many times,</v>

1682
00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:59.660
<v Speaker 1>not even in his fighting career.</v>

1683
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:03.590
<v Speaker 1>You see where the guy came up and all these crazy ass videos,</v>

1684
00:44:03.591 --> 00:44:08.090
<v Speaker 1>even fighting on the street and back yards that he is very calm under pressure.</v>

1685
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.840
<v Speaker 1>He is,</v>

1686
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.370
<v Speaker 1>and he is also,</v>

1687
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1688
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:11.840
<v Speaker 1>he's unpredictable.</v>

1689
00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1690
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Like he likes to mix things up.</v>

1691
00:44:13.221 --> 00:44:16.070
<v Speaker 1>He's real good at doing whatever the hell he wants.</v>

1692
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:16.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1693
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.750
<v Speaker 1>he's had fights where he got hurt.</v>

1694
00:44:17.751 --> 00:44:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Like Darin Cruickshank heard him and uh,</v>

1695
00:44:20.031 --> 00:44:20.301
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1696
00:44:20.301 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1697
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:21.140
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1698
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.430
<v Speaker 1>turn this into a wrestling match.</v>

1699
00:44:22.431 --> 00:44:23.960
<v Speaker 1>And he just wrestled him to the ground,</v>

1700
00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:24.794
<v Speaker 1>beat the shit out of him.</v>

1701
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:26.720
<v Speaker 1>He's a real versatile,</v>

1702
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:27.441
<v Speaker 1>he can do anything.</v>

1703
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:29.150
<v Speaker 1>And so Donald lost to him.</v>

1704
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a tough fight for Donald,</v>

1705
00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 1>even if Donald wasn't hurt.</v>

1706
00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:32.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1707
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:32.581
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1708
00:44:32.581 --> 00:44:33.570
<v Speaker 4>So take that out of the way.</v>

1709
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:35.940
<v Speaker 4>I think Donald at one seven he's look better than he's ever looked at.</v>

1710
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:37.170
<v Speaker 4>One 55 by far.</v>

1711
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:38.280
<v Speaker 4>And I just think that's,</v>

1712
00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1713
00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a function of this disintegration of your skills that comes with</v>

1714
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:44.431
<v Speaker 4>the losing the weight.</v>

1715
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like what's the point of diminishing returns?</v>

1716
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:49.770
<v Speaker 4>When do you get where the diminishing or the cutting of the weight,</v>

1717
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:50.451
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1718
00:44:50.451 --> 00:44:54.420
<v Speaker 4>the benefit that you get in the size is not enough to overcome the amount of</v>

1719
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:55.254
<v Speaker 4>weakening.</v>

1720
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1721
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:56.610
<v Speaker 4>That your body's done.</v>

1722
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:03.230
<v Speaker 4>Like Tony's a good size for 55 like Tony probably done get over one 75 like what</v>

1723
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:07.140
<v Speaker 4>does telling me walk around at very easy cuts.</v>

1724
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:07.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1725
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.460
<v Speaker 4>He don't fuck around.</v>

1726
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:08.701
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1727
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:10.170
<v Speaker 4>that's the right way or easy cut.</v>

1728
00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:11.170
<v Speaker 4>That's the right way.</v>

1729
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.870
<v Speaker 4>He's dude,</v>

1730
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:13.970
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget her leaving.</v>

1731
00:45:13.971 --> 00:45:14.580
<v Speaker 4>Cutting.</v>

1732
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.390
<v Speaker 4>Never Forget Travis Luder when Travis Luder fought Anderson Silva for the title</v>

1733
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:20.640
<v Speaker 4>and I've watched Travis shuffle to the,</v>

1734
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:24.210
<v Speaker 4>to the scale because he couldn't walk because he couldn't pick his legs up.</v>

1735
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:25.231
<v Speaker 4>He was shuffling,</v>

1736
00:45:25.231 --> 00:45:27.480
<v Speaker 4>his lips were all cracked and he was like,</v>

1737
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 4>there was blood coming out of his lips.</v>

1738
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.840
<v Speaker 4>Like you could see the skin,</v>

1739
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:31.391
<v Speaker 4>like the skin.</v>

1740
00:45:31.391 --> 00:45:32.224
<v Speaker 4>It was broken.</v>

1741
00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1742
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Like his body had no water in it,</v>

1743
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:35.760
<v Speaker 4>there was nothing left.</v>

1744
00:45:35.761 --> 00:45:37.160
<v Speaker 4>He was done and he did it.</v>

1745
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:41.430
<v Speaker 4>Still didn't make the weight and he took Anderson Silva down at will mounted</v>

1746
00:45:41.431 --> 00:45:41.641
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1747
00:45:41.641 --> 00:45:44.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean Travis Luder was a bad motherfucker.</v>

1748
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 4>He's one of those people that people forgot cause he was one of the best</v>

1749
00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:50.340
<v Speaker 4>American Brazilian Jujitsu black belt at the time.</v>

1750
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 4>Like super respected Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,</v>

1751
00:45:52.621 --> 00:45:53.454
<v Speaker 4>black belt.</v>

1752
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.680
<v Speaker 4>And does ea world any world titles?</v>

1753
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

1754
00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he's one as far as grappling Edie.</v>

1755
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:00.991
<v Speaker 4>Andy,</v>

1756
00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:01.824
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

1757
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:03.143
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1758
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1759
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.200
<v Speaker 4>But he was upset,</v>

1760
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.510
<v Speaker 4>was one of the best in his,</v>

1761
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.560
<v Speaker 4>in his time.</v>

1762
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.221
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1763
00:46:08.221 --> 00:46:09.031
<v Speaker 4>he was up there,</v>

1764
00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:12.750
<v Speaker 4>he was right up there with anybody as far as grappling goes.</v>

1765
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.180
<v Speaker 4>And you would see it when he was fighting guys,</v>

1766
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:16.620
<v Speaker 4>he would just pass their guard,</v>

1767
00:46:16.621 --> 00:46:19.100
<v Speaker 4>get the mount fucking spin for an arm bar and be like,</v>

1768
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:19.650
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1769
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:20.700
<v Speaker 4>that's how he's supposed to do it.</v>

1770
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.260
<v Speaker 4>And they're hyping this fight up.</v>

1771
00:46:22.261 --> 00:46:23.094
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1772
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I boob attorney focusing.</v>

1773
00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:27.270
<v Speaker 4>You see Josh Koscheck fight yesterday.</v>

1774
00:46:27.271 --> 00:46:28.160
<v Speaker 4>That was kind of sad.</v>

1775
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:30.300
<v Speaker 4>Koscheck got rocked.</v>

1776
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:33.450
<v Speaker 4>They got taken out and that Thompson got Josh.</v>

1777
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.261
<v Speaker 4>Josh got knocked out.</v>

1778
00:46:34.261 --> 00:46:34.560
<v Speaker 4>You right.</v>

1779
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:34.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1780
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:35.583
<v Speaker 4>Taken out too.</v>

1781
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.100
<v Speaker 4>I just think after a while,</v>

1782
00:46:38.101 --> 00:46:38.850
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1783
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:39.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1784
00:46:39.271 --> 00:46:40.104
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing,</v>

1785
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.840
<v Speaker 4>not that much durability left in the brain.</v>

1786
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Thompson got it looks like you've got headbutted first.</v>

1787
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.140
<v Speaker 4>And then he got clipped with a little bit of a left hand and then they read</v>

1788
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.650
<v Speaker 4>engaged and then he got caught with a big upper cut.</v>

1789
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.100
<v Speaker 4>He just slumped that.</v>

1790
00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.090
<v Speaker 4>That pit bull dude can punch though.</v>

1791
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1792
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:58.371
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>especially they're 170 pound division.</v>

1804
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.240
<v Speaker 4>Douglas Lema is a killer.</v>

1805
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.280
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking killer dude.</v>

1806
00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:18.780
<v Speaker 4>The way he took out Corish cloth and after Korskoff fucked up Benson Henderson.</v>

1807
00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:19.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1811
00:47:27.631 --> 00:47:29.920
<v Speaker 4>Roy MacDonald that they uh,</v>

1812
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.600
<v Speaker 1>who had Robert Down with fights,</v>

1813
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:33.310
<v Speaker 1>which one?</v>

1814
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:33.911
<v Speaker 1>He fights.</v>

1815
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:34.744
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1816
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.471
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1817
00:47:35.471 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 1>What do we just say?</v>

1818
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.020
<v Speaker 1>He fights a device.</v>

1819
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.230
<v Speaker 1>One of them in April.</v>

1820
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Paul Dale.</v>

1821
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.611
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1822
00:47:39.611 --> 00:47:40.444
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I say his name?</v>

1823
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.373
<v Speaker 1>He fights Paul Daley.</v>

1824
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:41.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1825
00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:41.971
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1826
00:47:41.971 --> 00:47:42.970
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's in May.</v>

1827
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.081
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be,</v>

1828
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:44.914
<v Speaker 1>if it's a big fight.</v>

1829
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1830
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a big fight because all I do has to do is just barely connected to your</v>

1831
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:49.570
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

1832
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:49.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1833
00:47:49.741 --> 00:47:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Roy has been having a problem for a long time with his nose,</v>

1834
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.780
<v Speaker 1>so he decided to take a full year off and let us know his heel.</v>

1835
00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:56.531
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1836
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:56.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1837
00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.380
<v Speaker 1>that was when he signed for belt or that was the understanding that he was going</v>

1838
00:47:59.381 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Speaker 1>to take all this time off and let us know as heel because every time you get</v>

1839
00:48:02.081 --> 00:48:04.570
<v Speaker 1>punched in the nose we just start bleeding bad and he wouldn't be able to</v>

1840
00:48:04.571 --> 00:48:05.181
<v Speaker 1>breathe out of it.</v>

1841
00:48:05.181 --> 00:48:06.350
<v Speaker 1>And you have to open your mouth up.</v>

1842
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1843
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's any surgery or anything to to fix it,</v>

1844
00:48:10.451 --> 00:48:14.290
<v Speaker 1>but he thinks he could fix it by taking time off maybe.</v>

1845
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:17.960
<v Speaker 1>And then that seems like something you have to have some sort of surgery done.</v>

1846
00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1847
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know what can figure everything.</v>

1848
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1849
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:21.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the damage was.</v>

1850
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 1>But after that Robbie Lawler fight,</v>

1851
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:23.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

1852
00:48:23.531 --> 00:48:24.011
<v Speaker 1>that knows.</v>

1853
00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Got smushed.</v>

1854
00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.860
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting fight.</v>

1855
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:27.631
<v Speaker 1>The last Theodore.</v>

1856
00:48:27.631 --> 00:48:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh versus say Zolpha hey ya</v>

1857
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:32.031
<v Speaker 1>say hey.</v>

1858
00:48:32.031 --> 00:48:35.020
<v Speaker 1>It was highly touted after he won the ultimate fighter in Brazil.</v>

1859
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I think I found on the same card as him a long time ago.</v>

1860
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 1>So big fella.</v>

1861
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1862
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:43.480
<v Speaker 1>So big fella to be making 185 pounds to two guys giant.</v>

1863
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:43.991
<v Speaker 1>What does he,</v>

1864
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:46.880
<v Speaker 1>is he the one that was like a protege to be Twitter?</v>

1865
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1866
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1867
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:47.860

1868
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.271

1870
00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:48.910

1935
00:50:15.471 --> 00:50:20.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference between guys on Shit and not on shit.</v>

1936

<v Speaker 1>Because of course they help.</v>

1942
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 1>They help in a giant way.</v>

1943
00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who tells you differently is just,</v>

1944
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 1>they're either lying to themselves or they're on fucking steroids too.</v>

1945
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Because here's the thing,</v>

1946
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:46.280
<v Speaker 1>there's guys that are mentally strong and durable and they're warriors and</v>

1947
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:47.120
<v Speaker 1>they're on steroids.</v>

1948
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that you can have either or,</v>

1949
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.730
<v Speaker 1>you know like either you have a guy who was tough or you have a cheater.</v>

1950
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:53.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1951
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:54.290
<v Speaker 1>you have tough cheaters.</v>

1952
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Like those are real,</v>

1953
00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.580
<v Speaker 1>there's really tough cheaters.</v>

1954
00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1955
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.790
<v Speaker 1>especially if they know that everybody else is cheating.</v>

1956
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1957
00:51:02.811 --> 00:51:03.680
<v Speaker 1>They'll cheat too.</v>

1958
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>

1959
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:06.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1960
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you see me,</v>

00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:08.541
<v Speaker 1>no disrespect,</v>

1962
00:51:08.541 --> 00:51:13.541

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.590
<v Speaker 1>cracking dudes beat the fuck out of Kim Mo.</v>

00:51:35.031 --> 00:51:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was King Moses.</v>

1974
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Serious fighter man.</v>

1975
00:51:38.691 --> 00:51:41.330
<v Speaker 1>He's a tough guy and he fucking crumpled him.</v>

1976
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:42.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1978
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:50.720
<v Speaker 1>and he's uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's just such a hard kicker to that.</v>

1980
00:51:52.341 --> 00:51:54.020
<v Speaker 1>If you just take one of those in the arms,</v>

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:15.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1994
00:52:15.741 --> 00:52:16.790
<v Speaker 1>These are coming in my face,</v>

1995
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:17.653
<v Speaker 1>but wait a second.</v>

1996
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:19.280
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you this,</v>

1997
00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Ian,</v>

1998
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.220
<v Speaker 1>now that you've gone through these five fights,</v>

1999
00:52:22.221 --> 00:52:23.054
<v Speaker 1>they did Ooh,</v>

2000
00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:25.490
<v Speaker 1>beautiful leg kick and returned.</v>

2001
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:27.463
<v Speaker 1>But people,</v>

2002
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.101
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting,</v>

2003
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:28.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2004
00:52:28.251 --> 00:52:31.640
<v Speaker 1>you talked to Maureen Thai guys and they'll tell you don't ever try to return a</v>

2005
00:52:31.641 --> 00:52:33.520
<v Speaker 1>leg kick after someone throws a light kick,</v>

2006
00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:36.470
<v Speaker 1>cause they're gonna know you're going to do it and they're gonna check you</v>

2007
00:52:36.471 --> 00:52:37.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's human instinct.</v>

2008
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2009
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.480
<v Speaker 1>But in MMA kind of works sometimes.</v>

2010
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:45.500
<v Speaker 1>What now you're dealing with five fights in a row.</v>

2011
00:52:45.501 --> 00:52:46.220
<v Speaker 1>That didn't,</v>

2012
00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:46.820
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen.</v>

2014
00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:49.190
<v Speaker 1>You starting to think like,</v>

2015
00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:50.024
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2016
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm not going to do this anymore.</v>

2017
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Of course you must be right.</v>

2018
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2019
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.310
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

2020
00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought about,</v>

2021
00:52:56.181 --> 00:53:00.140
<v Speaker 1>I thought about that before when I signed a fight,</v>

2022
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.240
<v Speaker 1>this most recent fight against Scoggins.</v>

2023
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2024
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I literally was like,</v>

2025
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I laughed as I was signing it and I was like,</v>

2026
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna my arm wasn't working.</v>

2027
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2028
00:53:09.501 --> 00:53:09.711
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

2029
00:53:09.711 --> 00:53:10.070
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2030
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2031
00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:10.431
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

2032
00:53:10.431 --> 00:53:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a fight.</v>

2033
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.931
<v Speaker 1>What arm wasn't working?</v>

2034
00:53:11.931 --> 00:53:13.400
<v Speaker 1>My right one after my surgeries.</v>

2035
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:15.390
<v Speaker 1>You shoulder serve after my shoulder surgery.</v>

2036
00:53:15.391 --> 00:53:17.030
<v Speaker 1>So if people don't know,</v>

2037
00:53:17.031 --> 00:53:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I've had three surgeries on my hand,</v>

2038
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I fractured dislocation on my elbow.</v>

2039
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Show your,</v>

2040
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.900
<v Speaker 1>show you the fist that you're capable of making.</v>

2041
00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:25.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's my,</v>

2042
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.913
<v Speaker 1>that's my fist.</v>

2043
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2044
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:28.680
<v Speaker 1>it expands to that and close to that.</v>

2045
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:29.850
<v Speaker 1>So I get to beat people up with this,</v>

2046
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.340
<v Speaker 1>which is real cool because when you spot have a good day of sparring,</v>

2047
00:53:32.341 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 1>it just nice and swollen.</v>

2048
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2049
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.233
<v Speaker 1>the joking,</v>

2050
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.030
<v Speaker 1>joking,</v>

2051
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.863
<v Speaker 1>joking,</v>

2052
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 1>the people only listen to us.</v>

2053
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Ian Can't totally close his hand and his index finger,</v>

2054
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 1>his index finger protrudes.</v>

2055
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 1>So like if you punch someone wrong,</v>

2056
00:53:45.241 --> 00:53:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably just re breaks.</v>

2057
00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:47.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2058
00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2059
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.111
<v Speaker 1>and you can't really,</v>

2060
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:49.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2061
00:53:49.381 --> 00:53:51.510
<v Speaker 1>can you actually punched them with your knuckle?</v>

2062
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:52.860
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2063
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.060
<v Speaker 1>How do they let you fight like that?</v>

2064
00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:54.351
<v Speaker 1>I ran,</v>

2065
00:53:54.351 --> 00:53:54.451
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2066
00:53:54.451 --> 00:53:55.320
<v Speaker 1>everything's corked.</v>

2067
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I just figured it out and a lot of elbows and I,</v>

2068
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:00.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

2069
00:54:00.581 --> 00:54:00.681
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2070
00:54:00.681 --> 00:54:02.400
<v Speaker 1>it's why I've been kicking for most of my,</v>

2071
00:54:02.401 --> 00:54:02.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2072
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:03.623
<v Speaker 1>for the last,</v>

2073
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:07.050
<v Speaker 1>how many years has been three years cause my hand and then I ended up having my,</v>

2074

2077
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:13.140
<v Speaker 1>and then there's that Jamie.</v>

2080
00:54:19.201 --> 00:54:20.034

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2159
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:05.071
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

2160
00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:05.580
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2161
00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:06.413
<v Speaker 1>It's not that bad.</v>

2162
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:07.441
<v Speaker 1>There's some lucky,</v>

2163
00:56:07.441 --> 00:56:08.274
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

2164
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Five is not a lot.</v>

2165
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I could barely handle my own weight.</v>

2166
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:12.510
<v Speaker 1>How much I may chat ops.</v>

2167
00:56:12.511 --> 00:56:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Can you do a when I'm in shape?</v>

2168
00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:15.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2169
00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 1>probably when I'm in shape.</v>

2170
00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:20.370
<v Speaker 1>1213,</v>

2171
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:22.140
<v Speaker 1>just straight strict.</v>

2172
00:56:22.141 --> 00:56:22.831
<v Speaker 1>All the way down.</v>

2173
00:56:22.831 --> 00:56:23.664
<v Speaker 1>All the back up.</v>

2174
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.570
<v Speaker 2>You're not locked out though.</v>

2175
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I can do 16 chin ups all the way down,</v>

2176
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 2>all the way back up,</v>

2177
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.251
<v Speaker 2>all the way down,</v>

2178
00:56:30.251 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 2>all the way back up,</v>

2179
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.620
<v Speaker 2>completely locked arms.</v>

2180
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.540
<v Speaker 2>And then all the way chin over the bar.</v>

2181
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I can do 16 I can do 24 if I just go like this.</v>

2182
00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.820
<v Speaker 2>You know that shit that people do when they say I do 24 Chin ups.</v>

2183
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh I can too if you do them that way.</v>

2184
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:46.840
<v Speaker 2>But if you go all the way down,</v>

2185
00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.870
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they'll wait a bat,</v>

2186
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.630
<v Speaker 2>but also want to do it that way.</v>

2187
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:51.461
<v Speaker 2>When I'm doing it,</v>

2188
00:56:51.461 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it to show how many chin ups I can do.</v>

2189
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 2>So when I do the negatives,</v>

2190
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:56.890
<v Speaker 2>my negatives are twice as long as my positives.</v>

2191
00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.840
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I fuck around and do real slow negatives for Hay is not really an</v>

2192
00:57:01.841 --> 00:57:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Armbar guy,</v>

2193
00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:03.760
<v Speaker 2>but he's got the back.</v>

2194
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was gonna slide over for it.</v>

2195
00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Now he's riding the guy,</v>

2196
00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:08.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2197
00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.033
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2198
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:09.873
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2199
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.460
<v Speaker 2>but he's got decent Jujitsu.</v>

2200
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I like how he's staying close to him.</v>

2201
00:57:14.411 --> 00:57:15.580
<v Speaker 2>He's squeezing the shit out of him.</v>

2202
00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2203
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:16.970
<v Speaker 2>lost it.</v>

2204
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Good defense.</v>

2205
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:18.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2206
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:19.960
<v Speaker 2>That's grease right there.</v>

2207
00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:22.283
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

2208
00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:22.921
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2209
00:57:22.921 --> 00:57:23.754
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>

2210
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:24.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2211
00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:26.470
<v Speaker 2>he gets ups right off that guy.</v>

2212
00:57:26.471 --> 00:57:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Go like this and then your slider.</v>

2213
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:31.870
<v Speaker 2>And there's no need to put Vaseline over their eyes cause they grapple and get</v>

2214
00:57:31.871 --> 00:57:32.500
<v Speaker 2>in the way.</v>

2215
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.333
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

2216
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:33.821
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2217
00:57:33.821 --> 00:57:35.350
<v Speaker 2>it definitely becomes a factor in a fight.</v>

2218
00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:36.400
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>

2219
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.851
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

2220
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Put the Vaseline on the eyes.</v>

2221
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2222
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:40.510
<v Speaker 2>That grease gets everywhere.</v>

2223
00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:41.540
<v Speaker 2>It fucks up the ground.</v>

2224
00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:42.880
<v Speaker 2>We'll get so slippery.</v>

2225
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:43.421
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2226
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:46.330
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things that they have to kind of do to stop bleeding though.</v>

2227
00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:47.590
<v Speaker 2>If there is a cut,</v>

2228
00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:48.340
<v Speaker 2>they have to do it.</v>

2229
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.900
<v Speaker 2>But they do it even when there's no cut.</v>

2230
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2231
00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:51.760
<v Speaker 2>They should eliminate that.</v>

2232
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.661
<v Speaker 2>They don't let the,</v>

2233
00:57:52.661 --> 00:57:53.041
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2234
00:57:53.041 --> 00:57:54.490
<v Speaker 2>the corner do it anymore.</v>

2235
00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a,</v>

2236
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:56.530
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be a come in.</v>

2237
00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:57.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2238
00:57:57.490 --> 00:58:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when Pat Miletich fought Carlos Newton and Jeremy Horn was in</v>

2239
00:58:04.301 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 2>the corner and he even jokes about like,</v>

2240
00:58:06.221 --> 00:58:07.540
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't even know why he did it.</v>

2241
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.020
<v Speaker 2>He was like putting Vaseline on Pat's neck.</v>

2242
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

2243
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2244
00:58:13.031 --> 00:58:13.750
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2245
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:14.110
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2246
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:15.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what the fuck I was doing.</v>

2247
00:58:15.471 --> 00:58:16.304
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2248
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:17.720
<v Speaker 2>I can just massaging of him.</v>

2249
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:18.350
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2250
00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:18.821
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2251
00:58:18.821 --> 00:58:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know why I was doing it.</v>

2252
00:58:19.961 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 2>And then anyway,</v>

2253
00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 2>it turned out to fuck him because Carlos Newton got him in that bull dog choker</v>

2254
00:58:24.911 --> 00:58:27.550
<v Speaker 2>and just whip slipped right under the chin.</v>

2255
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:28.270
<v Speaker 2>You remember that?</v>

2256
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2257
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Carlos got Pat Miletich and one of the first bulldog chokes we ever saw in the</v>

2258
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:33.154
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>

2259
00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:36.340
<v Speaker 2>It's only been like three bill dog chokes and the UFC is actually,</v>

2260
00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:37.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2261
00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:37.700
<v Speaker 2>at lunch.</v>

2262
00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:38.533
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2263
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Ashley Evan Smith got choked out by Raquel Pennington.</v>

2264
00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.700
<v Speaker 2>That was a fucking wild one.</v>

2265
00:58:42.701 --> 00:58:43.534
<v Speaker 2>Raquel Pennington.</v>

2266
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Raquel Pennington is one,</v>

2267
00:58:45.101 --> 00:58:48.670
<v Speaker 2>two UFC within one second where I was screaming so loud,</v>

2268
00:58:48.671 --> 00:58:49.301
<v Speaker 2>I was blown out.</v>

2269
00:58:49.301 --> 00:58:50.230
<v Speaker 2>People's ear drums like,</v>

2270
00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:51.243
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2271
00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to look like the one with Ashley.</v>

2272
00:58:52.751 --> 00:58:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Evan Smith though was crazy because there was blood everywhere and she gets her</v>

2273
00:58:55.631 --> 00:58:58.480
<v Speaker 2>in the bulldog choke and she's got her face down and then she,</v>

2274
00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:00.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like the end of the fight fucking thing.</v>

2275
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I let her off and she's out.</v>

2276
00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Colon is blood everywhere.</v>

2277
00:59:02.711 --> 00:59:03.544
<v Speaker 2>It was a chaos.</v>

2278
00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:04.780
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2279
00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.130
<v Speaker 2>the other one was Chris Lights out.</v>

2280
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Lidell against Dki.</v>

2281
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:10.900
<v Speaker 2>He got,</v>

2282
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.280
<v Speaker 2>he got to have a tight</v>

2283
00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.590
<v Speaker 2>that head out hair grease.</v>

2284
00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Now how much,</v>

2285
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:19.360
<v Speaker 2>how much grease can you get in those dreads?</v>

2286
00:59:19.361 --> 00:59:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2287
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:20.403
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

2288
00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2289
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2290
00:59:21.771 --> 00:59:22.100

2291
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.831
<v Speaker 4>and pound there.</v>

2292
00:59:22.831 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 4>Doro.</v>

2293
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 4>He's a tough guy.</v>

2294
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:25.011
<v Speaker 4>Lies.</v>

2295
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:25.844
<v Speaker 4>Theodora</v>

2296
00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:29.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2297
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.931
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2298
00:59:29.931 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 4>so that was the other bulldog choke.</v>

2299
00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.970
<v Speaker 4>There's been three that I could think of.</v>

2300
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.730
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's been another one that I forgot or maybe I didn't call the fight.</v>

2301
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:39.620
<v Speaker 4>That's a rare move though.</v>

2302
00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.720
<v Speaker 4>But it's one of those things,</v>

2303
00:59:41.721 --> 00:59:41.871
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2304
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:44.690
<v Speaker 4>if you're in front and you're sitting out and you've got it locked in,</v>

2305
00:59:44.691 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 4>you've got someone's neck trapped on your forum.</v>

2306
00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:47.031
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

2307
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:47.900
<v Speaker 4>that's a good chuck.</v>

2308
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.030
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard to,</v>

2309
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:53.180
<v Speaker 4>very hard to get out of that because you're a good move Eddie,</v>

2310
00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:54.014
<v Speaker 4>to get out of that.</v>

2311
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:57.620
<v Speaker 4>If someone's got it locked in and they're sitting out and they really got that</v>

2312
00:59:57.621 --> 01:00:00.500
<v Speaker 4>fucking head in there and you're back this way and like you're on your knees</v>

2313
01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.270
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of guys who seem to get it.</v>

2314
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:04.610
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck do you do to get out?</v>

2315
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously move forward and try to take the back.</v>

2316
01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:09.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2317
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.160
<v Speaker 3>well I'd have to get down on the mats and you'd have to show me exactly what a</v>

2318
01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:14.210
<v Speaker 3>hard show to get out of.</v>

2319
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:15.450
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to uh,</v>

2320
01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:18.070
<v Speaker 3>explain with words.</v>

2321
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.353
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

2322
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:21.860
<v Speaker 4>You know what I've been seeing guys do too,</v>

2323
01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:23.540
<v Speaker 4>I've been seeing guys get like,</v>

2324
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 4>get into like a guillotine position from the back and lean forward on a dude</v>

2325
01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.470
<v Speaker 4>like getting like a gay teen.</v>

2326
01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.120
<v Speaker 4>Like he'd do like this,</v>

2327
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:35.570
<v Speaker 4>but they've getting it from behind and leaning forward on a guy.</v>

2328
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:38.420
<v Speaker 4>I saw somebody do that recently where he didn't,</v>

2329
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.991
<v Speaker 4>he didn't,</v>

2330
01:00:38.991 --> 01:00:40.700
<v Speaker 4>it was like from a north south position.</v>

2331
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.070
<v Speaker 4>He didn't have hooks in.</v>

2332
01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.093
<v Speaker 4>He caught like,</v>

2333
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.480
<v Speaker 4>like a gay teen from behind and had his head trapped by his shoulder and lean</v>

2334
01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:47.811
<v Speaker 4>forward.</v>

2335
01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:50.360
<v Speaker 4>And I was like neck cranking him and choking him at the same time.</v>

2336
01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:51.770
<v Speaker 4>It looked fucking nasty.</v>

2337
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:54.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like you see a thousand fights and he'd say,</v>

2338
01:00:54.741 --> 01:00:55.011
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2339
01:00:55.011 --> 01:00:56.240
<v Speaker 4>I pretty much never see everything.</v>

2340
01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.370
<v Speaker 4>And then someone comes up your shit and you go,</v>

2341
01:00:58.371 --> 01:00:59.270
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2342
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:00.470
<v Speaker 4>let me see that again.</v>

2343
01:01:00.471 --> 01:01:01.304
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

2344
01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:02.210
<v Speaker 3>I got put in a,</v>

2345
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2346
01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.060
<v Speaker 3>just a regular school yard chuck wants and it,</v>

2347
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2348
01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.460
<v Speaker 3>it fucked me up,</v>

2349
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:08.230
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2350
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2351
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:09.140
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2352
01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.620
<v Speaker 3>I did little league baseball and I sucked.</v>

2353
01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I always led the league and strike outs.</v>

2354
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.273
<v Speaker 3>I was terrible.</v>

2355
01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:17.631
<v Speaker 3>I was terrible.</v>

2356
01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:18.120
<v Speaker 3>I was a,</v>

2357
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.240
<v Speaker 3>but I had my moments.</v>

2358
01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:24.890
<v Speaker 3>I remember like I connected once and it was fucking dead center and they caught</v>

2359
01:01:24.891 --> 01:01:25.011
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2360
01:01:25.011 --> 01:01:25.580
<v Speaker 3>And was it,</v>

2361
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.790
<v Speaker 3>that was my glory as I hit like a,</v>

2362
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:29.720
<v Speaker 3>a ball deep into center field.</v>

2363
01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:30.501
<v Speaker 3>It was caught though,</v>

2364
01:01:30.501 --> 01:01:31.520
<v Speaker 3>but at least I hit it.</v>

2365
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I would strike the fuck out.</v>

2366
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.150
<v Speaker 3>But I played catcher and um,</v>

2367
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.070
<v Speaker 3>so he didn't have to move.</v>

2368
01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:39.651
<v Speaker 3>I sucked.</v>

2369
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:42.260
<v Speaker 3>So it was like ages eight to 12.</v>

2370
01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:42.701
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2371
01:01:42.701 --> 01:01:44.600
<v Speaker 3>So there's eight year olds and then there's 12 year olds.</v>

2372
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.673
<v Speaker 3>I sucked.</v>

2373
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.300
<v Speaker 3>But I was born in,</v>

2374
01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:47.571
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

2375
01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 3>in a month where I made the costs.</v>

2376
01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:54.930
<v Speaker 3>I was an old dude now and I could still play little league and they go,</v>

2377
01:01:54.951 --> 01:01:56.210
<v Speaker 3>you want to play another year?</v>

2378
01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't,</v>

2379
01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.390
<v Speaker 3>I was tired of being humiliated,</v>

2380
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.100
<v Speaker 3>but I was older than most of the guys.</v>

2381
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:05.000
<v Speaker 3>So even though I shocked how was like two,</v>

2382
01:02:05.001 --> 01:02:07.220
<v Speaker 3>three years older than most of the guys on the team.</v>

2383
01:02:07.221 --> 01:02:08.350
<v Speaker 3>So they wanted me to be the,</v>

2384
01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.930
<v Speaker 3>like the captain and Oh man,</v>

2385
01:02:11.931 --> 01:02:12.860
<v Speaker 3>I was such,</v>

2386
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:14.240
<v Speaker 3>I so didn't want to do it.</v>

2387
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.660
<v Speaker 3>I was being a total debugged.</v>

2388
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:17.593
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>

2389
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.720
<v Speaker 3>everybody on the team and our right fielder had a plastic glove and I would make</v>

2390
01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:22.800
<v Speaker 3>fun of his plastic glove.</v>

2391
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 3>I was such an asshole.</v>

2392
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't make fun of his glove?</v>

2393
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:28.860
<v Speaker 3>I was just an asshole because I was an older,</v>

2394
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:29.600
<v Speaker 3>an old,</v>

2395
01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.470
<v Speaker 3>I was the older of this team.</v>

2396
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:31.981
<v Speaker 3>We are,</v>

2397
01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:32.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2398
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.031
<v Speaker 3>I'm hanging out,</v>

2399
01:02:33.031 --> 01:02:36.270
<v Speaker 3>forced to be hanging out with eight year olds and nine year olds and I'm 12,</v>

2400
01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2401
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:37.680
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to be here,</v>

2402
01:02:37.681 --> 01:02:40.650
<v Speaker 3>but the coaches want to be there because they thought I had leadership skills,</v>

2403
01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:41.640
<v Speaker 3>but I still sucked.</v>

2404
01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.260
<v Speaker 3>I still couldn't hit anything.</v>

2405
01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:43.980
<v Speaker 3>I still,</v>

2406
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.360
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't connect ever.</v>

2407
01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:46.680
<v Speaker 3>I was just always striking out.</v>

2408
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.113
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2409
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.013
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2410
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.050
<v Speaker 3>they had me pitching and shit just cause I was older than them.</v>

2411
01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.430
<v Speaker 3>I was a terrible picture.</v>

2412
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.480
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2413
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.313
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

2414
01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:57.870
<v Speaker 3>I was taught a Raphael who had the plastic glove.</v>

2415
01:02:57.871 --> 01:03:01.440
<v Speaker 3>We were all huddled together after practice and I was talking shit on him,</v>

2416
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:06.650
<v Speaker 3>on his plastic glove and he just got me in a headlock dude and just held me</v>

2417
01:03:06.721 --> 01:03:07.800
<v Speaker 3>there and I didn't know what to do.</v>

2418
01:03:07.801 --> 01:03:09.240
<v Speaker 3>And he fucking used all his,</v>

2419
01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:10.560
<v Speaker 3>his hate towards me.</v>

2420
01:03:10.561 --> 01:03:12.180
<v Speaker 3>He squeezed my motherfucking head.</v>

2421
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:16.440
<v Speaker 3>This guy hated the shit out of me and I couldn't do anything.</v>

2422
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:17.850
<v Speaker 3>I had no more.</v>

2423
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:21.330
<v Speaker 3>I was 12 years old and in front of the whole baseball team,</v>

2424
01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.890
<v Speaker 3>he finally was the one that snapped because I was a dick.</v>

2425
01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.930
<v Speaker 3>To everybody and I was just like the older kid and I,</v>

2426
01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:28.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2427
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.130
<v Speaker 3>my ego was exploding because I'm the older kid and I'm the captain of the team</v>

2428
01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 3>even though I suck.</v>

2429
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:34.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2430
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:35.303
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2431
01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:36.460
<v Speaker 3>I just was that,</v>

2432
01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.740
<v Speaker 3>I learned my lesson,</v>

2433
01:03:37.741 --> 01:03:38.160
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2434
01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I learned my lesson because he put,</v>

2435
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.870
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2436
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:40.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2437
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:44.190
<v Speaker 3>I stopped talking as much shit after that cause I quit the baseball team.</v>

2438
01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:45.150
<v Speaker 3>I just disappeared.</v>

2439
01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:45.331
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2440
01:03:45.331 --> 01:03:46.164
<v Speaker 3>I was gone.</v>

2441
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:48.360
<v Speaker 3>You embarrass me in front of everybody.</v>

2442
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:49.810
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2443
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.721
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine,</v>

2444
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:51.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2445
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.530
<v Speaker 3>was he,</v>

2446
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.420
<v Speaker 3>he was like nine or 10.</v>

2447
01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:55.643
<v Speaker 3>He was the,</v>

2448
01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.000
<v Speaker 3>it was an eight to 12.</v>

2449
01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Literally it was something like that.</v>

2450
01:03:58.351 --> 01:03:59.860
<v Speaker 3>He was a younger kid.</v>

2451
01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:00.750
<v Speaker 3>You need a tissue.</v>

2452
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:04.770
<v Speaker 3>But he grabbed my motherfucking head and embarrass the shit out of me.</v>

2453
01:04:04.771 --> 01:04:05.071
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2454
01:04:05.071 --> 01:04:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2455
01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.260
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I was going to die.</v>

2456
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.820
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea how to get out.</v>

2457
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:10.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2458
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.580
<v Speaker 4>Those,</v>

2459
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.560
<v Speaker 4>that's a real choke if you can get it right.</v>

2460
01:04:13.561 --> 01:04:13.711
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2461
01:04:13.711 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 4>you've got to figure if someone like Marcella Garcia who has an insane</v>

2462
01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:18.510
<v Speaker 4>guillotine,</v>

2463
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:20.640
<v Speaker 4>if he can get you in the oil school yard head chokes,</v>

2464
01:04:20.641 --> 01:04:21.870
<v Speaker 4>the squeeze is still there.</v>

2465
01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:23.340
<v Speaker 4>It's still very similar.</v>

2466
01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:27.090
<v Speaker 4>It's a very similar way of using your arms to choke someone's neck.</v>

2467
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.730
<v Speaker 4>We haven't seen it all,</v>

2468
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:30.120
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You remember that?</v>

2470
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:33.300
<v Speaker 4>There was one dude who had this crazy choke.</v>

2471
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 4>He was one of Tiger showman's guys.</v>

2472
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:37.050
<v Speaker 4>God Damn,</v>

2473
01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:38.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to remember his name.</v>

2474
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:39.100
<v Speaker 4>He was about that.</v>

2475
01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Who's the founder from Gary Goodridge.</v>

2482
01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:48.701
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2485
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.420
<v Speaker 3>brutal.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's nothing more brutal.</v>

2487
01:04:56.561 --> 01:04:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Gonzaga versus Cro.</v>

01:05:01.151 --> 01:05:04.220
<v Speaker 3>A crucifix was getting elbowed and his faces.</v>

2493
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:05.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm whining about blowing up,</v>

2508
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.960
<v Speaker 5>He was out cold and he probably got hit with like five the hard shot.</v>

2509
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.950
<v Speaker 5>Did you see that Jamie?</v>

2510
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:34.690
<v Speaker 5>While he was out cold?</v>

2511
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:35.770

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2513

<v Speaker 5>That was brutality.</v>

2514
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:40.450
<v Speaker 5>They didn't show a replay either when,</v>

2515
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.430
<v Speaker 5>when it was online there was no replay.</v>

2516
01:05:42.431 --> 01:05:46.280
<v Speaker 5>They never got to replay blam blam they never wanted to replay that.</v>

2517
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is crazy.</v>

2518
01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.220
<v Speaker 5>That is one of the craziest Kaos ever.</v>

2519
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:52.181
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember,</v>

2520
01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:54.790
<v Speaker 5>wasn't it Paul Herrera that fought in that?</v>

2521
01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:55.391
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember?</v>

2522
01:05:55.391 --> 01:05:58.060
<v Speaker 5>There was a show that they did when the,</v>

2523
01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:00.580
<v Speaker 5>when it was illegal to have MMA in California.</v>

2524
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:04.840
<v Speaker 5>So they had a show and they pretended that it was like pre scripted.</v>

2525
01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:05.501
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

2526
01:06:05.501 --> 01:06:05.771

2527
01:06:05.771 --> 01:06:07.000
<v Speaker 5>this is just a show.</v>

2528
01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.760
<v Speaker 5>But then they had MMA fights.</v>

2529
01:06:08.761 --> 01:06:09.594
<v Speaker 5>The one that was in la.</v>

2530
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.151
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2531
01:06:10.151 --> 01:06:13.690
<v Speaker 5>I remember that years ago they were trying to find a loophole and I feel like he</v>

2532
01:06:13.691 --> 01:06:17.440
<v Speaker 5>fought Joe Merera did he call her rarefied show Maria?</v>

2533
01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:18.041
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>

2534
01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:18.731
<v Speaker 5>and everybody was like,</v>

2535
01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:18.941
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2536
01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:19.990

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:21.220
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck is this?</v>

2538
01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:21.381
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2539
01:06:21.381 --> 01:06:22.211

2540
01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:23.044
<v Speaker 5>it was at the palladium.</v>

2541
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:24.263
<v Speaker 5>What fuck was it?</v>

2542
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.230
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it was somewhere in Orange County.</v>

2543
01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.880
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it says it forever.</v>

2544
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:28.671
<v Speaker 5>I can't even wear it.</v>

2545
01:06:28.671 --> 01:06:29.180
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

01:06:31.661 --> 01:06:33.040
<v Speaker 5>We got to go up the stairs.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So going through all my girlfriends fucking picture albums,</v>

2587
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.110
<v Speaker 5>having sex with her is like having sex in the time machine.</v>

2588
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:38.680
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2589
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.310
<v Speaker 5>I grew up,</v>

2590
01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:39.810
<v Speaker 5>she was,</v>

2591
01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:40.150
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>

2592
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:41.410
<v Speaker 5>I was raised in this fucking sport.</v>

2593
01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:44.050
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember going to King of the cage when I was 15.</v>

2594
01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:45.243
<v Speaker 5>She was there.</v>

2595
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:47.980
<v Speaker 5>I remember I was going through a fucking photo album and I was like,</v>

2596
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:49.361
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit.</v>

2597
01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:50.590
<v Speaker 5>And like you were at these fights,</v>

2598
01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.080
<v Speaker 5>the lion's den in nine in San Diego when I was like 15.</v>

2599
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.340
<v Speaker 5>And she's like,</v>

2600
01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 5>I put those fights on and I was like,</v>

2601
01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.113
<v Speaker 5>oh.</v>

2602
01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.530
<v Speaker 5>I remember looking across going,</v>

2603
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:00.903
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

2604
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>

2605
01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to one day I'm going to grow up and be a professional fighter.</v>

2606
01:08:05.111 --> 01:08:05.891
<v Speaker 5>Just like Ken shamrock.</v>

2607
01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:07.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to fuck chick just like that.</v>

2608
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.490
<v Speaker 5>17 years later.</v>

2609
01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:10.780
<v Speaker 5>Gotcha.</v>

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:19.730
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucking weird.</v>

2612
01:08:19.731 --> 01:08:21.140
<v Speaker 4>Growing up in this entire sport,</v>

2613
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:23.270
<v Speaker 4>we should've done more stuff back in those days.</v>

2614
01:08:23.271 --> 01:08:24.104
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I did film,</v>

2622
01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:37.590
<v Speaker 3>I filmed a lot and one thing that I found for sure it's two weeks before I went</v>

2623
01:08:37.591 --> 01:08:41.340
<v Speaker 3>to Abu Dhabi in 2003 I had my video camera with me the whole time.</v>

2624

<v Speaker 3>I want her to make a documentary about and you are in it a lot.</v>

2625
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.560

2626
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:49.170
<v Speaker 3>I kept this footage.</v>

2627
01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.150
<v Speaker 3>It's eight hours of two weeks,</v>

2628
01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.320
<v Speaker 3>my training camp.</v>

2629
01:08:52.321 --> 01:08:52.670
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2630
01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:55.440

2632
01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.530
<v Speaker 3>You're all up in it.</v>

2633
01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.030
<v Speaker 3>Going to Brazil,</v>

2634
01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:01.860
<v Speaker 3>coming back,</v>

2635
01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.930
<v Speaker 3>getting my black belt.</v>

2636
01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.030
<v Speaker 3>I videotaped the whole experience.</v>

2637
01:09:06.190 --> 01:09:07.920
<v Speaker 3>We never released it ever.</v>

2638
01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:09.203
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2639
01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.480
<v Speaker 3>whereas it eventually I still got it.</v>

2640
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:13.290
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

2641
01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:14.123
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2642
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:15.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2643
01:09:15.541 --> 01:09:18.930
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting when you realized how much time has passed.</v>

2644
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Gerald is in a lot.</v>

2645
01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.420
<v Speaker 3>He's a big star.</v>

2646
01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.200
<v Speaker 4>Get out of jail.</v>

2647
01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.033
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2648
01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Sometime this year.</v>

2649
01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:28.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2650
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:29.710
<v Speaker 4>That's isn't that weird.</v>

2651
01:09:29.711 --> 01:09:32.620
<v Speaker 4>Like you could kill people as long as everybody agrees.</v>

2652
01:09:32.621 --> 01:09:36.640
<v Speaker 4>Well I guess you should have killed him or he shouldn't have killed them that</v>

2653
01:09:36.641 --> 01:09:36.911
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

2654
01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:38.500
<v Speaker 4>So we're going to have to lock you up for a little while.</v>

2655
01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:42.610
<v Speaker 4>See and I remember Gerald from fucking biff from when I was at fucking teenager,</v>

2656
01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:43.444
<v Speaker 4>like a little kid.</v>

2657
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:45.283
<v Speaker 4>He was</v>

2658
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:47.650
<v Speaker 4>so weird.</v>

2659
01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:48.970
<v Speaker 4>That's how the whole story is so,</v>

2660
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.230
<v Speaker 4>so weird.</v>

2661
01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:51.520
<v Speaker 4>It's so sad.</v>

2662
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.421
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2663
01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:52.631
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2664
01:09:52.631 --> 01:09:53.280
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2665
01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:53.620
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2666
01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:58.530
<v Speaker 4>the plight of the American veteran that comes back with PTSD and the,</v>

2667
01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.360
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2668
01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.740
<v Speaker 4>the issues that they have to deal with mentally and trying to,</v>

2669
01:10:02.741 --> 01:10:07.741
<v Speaker 4>just from being in a fucking war zone and shooting people all the time to not</v>

2670
01:10:08.261 --> 01:10:09.520
<v Speaker 4>shooting people all the time.</v>

2671
01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:10.721
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2672
01:10:10.721 --> 01:10:11.590
<v Speaker 4>that is a,</v>

2673
01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.930
<v Speaker 4>that is asking people to make that adjustment is one of the craziest things they</v>

2674
01:10:16.931 --> 01:10:18.370
<v Speaker 4>ask if people in the military,</v>

2675
01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:22.180
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty not to make the adjustment from military to civilian life.</v>

2676
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.940
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievable.</v>

2677
01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:25.931
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2678
01:10:25.931 --> 01:10:26.980
<v Speaker 4>it's really a,</v>

2679
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.760
<v Speaker 4>and you think about the length of this war from 2002 right?</v>

2680
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:37.270
<v Speaker 4>2002 we've been in a perpetual state of war.</v>

2681
01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:39.400
<v Speaker 4>It's just so,</v>

2682
01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:42.520
<v Speaker 4>it's so crazy when you think of how many people have had to deal with that.</v>

2683
01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.500
<v Speaker 4>How many people have had a wrestled with that issue?</v>

2684
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:50.560
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't Obama hold the record for president the most conflict or whatever?</v>

2685
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.251
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2686
01:10:51.251 --> 01:10:51.880
<v Speaker 4>he had,</v>

2687
01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:55.310
<v Speaker 4>he was in a war through every single day of his presidency.</v>

2688
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:56.343
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

2689
01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:58.601
<v Speaker 4>That's not true though,</v>

2690
01:10:58.601 --> 01:10:58.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2691
01:10:58.930 --> 01:10:59.111
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2692
01:10:59.111 --> 01:11:00.250
<v Speaker 4>he inherited it.</v>

2693
01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:04.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean he came in in 2008 we were already at war.</v>

2694
01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:04.721
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2695
01:11:04.721 --> 01:11:04.991
<v Speaker 4>we have.</v>

2696
01:11:04.991 --> 01:11:05.660
<v Speaker 4>We haven't had any,</v>

2697
01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:05.990
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>

2698
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:08.190
<v Speaker 4>any piece since that since you said it doesn't too.</v>

2699
01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:08.530
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2700
01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.600
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much they can and can't do.</v>

2701
01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:11.523
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

2702
01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.850
<v Speaker 4>I just really wonder,</v>

2703
01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.030
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much power they have.</v>

2704
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:15.893
<v Speaker 4>How am I mean?</v>

2705
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:20.010
<v Speaker 4>What's what you're seeing now with Donald Trump is not the best indication of it</v>

2706
01:11:20.011 --> 01:11:20.520
<v Speaker 4>because he's,</v>

2707
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.720
<v Speaker 4>he seems to be like imploding the most recent press conferences,</v>

2708
01:11:24.721 --> 01:11:26.310
<v Speaker 4>just like I have buddies,</v>

2709
01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.890
<v Speaker 4>they're conservative that were calling me up and go,</v>

2710
01:11:28.891 --> 01:11:29.370
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2711
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:30.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking worried now or this,</v>

2712
01:11:30.710 --> 01:11:32.070
<v Speaker 4>this guy seems unstable.</v>

2713
01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.050
<v Speaker 4>Or there's the most recent press conference.</v>

2714
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:37.560
<v Speaker 4>He did that rambling press conference when he was talking about how,</v>

2715
01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:40.650
<v Speaker 4>what the wide margin that he won the electoral margin.</v>

2716
01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.910
<v Speaker 4>And then this reporter says,</v>

2717
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Mr President,</v>

2718
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.960
<v Speaker 4>you stated that you want it by the largest margin ever when in fact Barack</v>

2719
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:49.290
<v Speaker 4>Obama's margin was much larger.</v>

2720
01:11:49.291 --> 01:11:49.531
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

2721
01:11:49.531 --> 01:11:49.611
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2722
01:11:49.611 --> 01:11:50.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm meant a button.</v>

2723
01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:50.913
<v Speaker 4>Republican's goes,</v>

2724
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.150
<v Speaker 4>George Herbert Walker Bush was much larger than that.</v>

2725
01:11:54.151 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 4>And he starts saying,</v>

2726
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:54.721
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2727
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:55.110
<v Speaker 4>this is this,</v>

2728
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:56.580
<v Speaker 4>the information that I've been given I like,</v>

2729
01:11:56.581 --> 01:11:57.414
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

2730
01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:00.230
<v Speaker 4>and you're watching these crows sheds,</v>

2731
01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:00.911
<v Speaker 4>so every,</v>

2732
01:12:00.911 --> 01:12:02.160
<v Speaker 4>it's so bizarre.</v>

2733
01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.860
<v Speaker 4>It's like we've never had a person that's the president like this.</v>

2734
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:08.190
<v Speaker 4>We'd never had that kind of a president that you just see can't.</v>

2735
01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:09.210
<v Speaker 4>And then he goes,</v>

2736
01:12:09.210 --> 01:12:09.420
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2737
01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:13.320
<v Speaker 4>how is the American public's supposed to listen to you when you tell them that</v>

2738
01:12:13.321 --> 01:12:14.101
<v Speaker 4>the news is fake,</v>

2739
01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:16.350
<v Speaker 4>when the information that you're providing is not accurate?</v>

2740
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.611
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

2741
01:12:17.611 --> 01:12:17.940
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2742
01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.350
<v Speaker 4>I won by a large margin,</v>

2743
01:12:19.351 --> 01:12:19.860
<v Speaker 4>did I?</v>

2744
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:20.150
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2745
01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:21.060
<v Speaker 4>I am the president.</v>

2746
01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:22.231
<v Speaker 4>And the guy's like,</v>

2747
01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:23.064
<v Speaker 4>you're the president.</v>

2748
01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:23.933
<v Speaker 4>Sure you win.</v>

2749
01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:28.080
<v Speaker 4>It's just such a strange,</v>

2750
01:12:28.081 --> 01:12:32.370
<v Speaker 4>strange time for us as a country to have elected someone like that and to be</v>

2751
01:12:32.371 --> 01:12:33.780
<v Speaker 4>going through this process,</v>

2752
01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:37.800
<v Speaker 4>what we try to figure out what's bullshit and what's not and what's bullshit</v>

2753
01:12:37.801 --> 01:12:39.040
<v Speaker 4>about our political system.</v>

2754
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:42.690
<v Speaker 4>Argue with people about everything about your life.</v>

2755
01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 4>And none of it's ever nothing he says is ever right or even remotely factual</v>

2756
01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.860
<v Speaker 4>thing he ever says is right because it seems so stupid.</v>

2757
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.450
<v Speaker 4>He's always full of shit about something.</v>

2758
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:52.930
<v Speaker 4>He's full of shit about a lot.</v>

2759
01:12:52.931 --> 01:12:53.220
<v Speaker 4>Eddie.</v>

2760
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:53.641
<v Speaker 4>You're just like,</v>

2761
01:12:53.641 --> 01:12:55.070
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this guy even saying like,</v>

2762
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:57.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't what he's supposed to pay attention to.</v>

2763
01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.373
<v Speaker 4>Who's this homeboy?</v>

2764
01:12:58.890 --> 01:12:59.340
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2765
01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.210

01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:04.960

01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:05.871
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

2769
01:13:05.871 --> 01:13:08.060
<v Speaker 4>Derek Lewis as head coach Bob Perez.</v>

2770
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:10.670
<v Speaker 4>Where's the Derrick Lewis trade out of?</v>

2771
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:12.343
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2772
01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:13.670
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

2773
01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.050
<v Speaker 4>So this should be the next fight.</v>

2774
01:13:15.051 --> 01:13:16.220
<v Speaker 4>Should be Hector lumbar,</v>

2775
01:13:16.221 --> 01:13:17.330
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Hendrix,</v>

2776
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Hendrix.</v>

2777
01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.910
<v Speaker 4>No one mark.</v>

2778
01:13:18.911 --> 01:13:19.744
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2779
01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:20.653
<v Speaker 4>what's the next one?</v>

2780
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:23.270
<v Speaker 4>Sam Sicilian.</v>

2781
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:23.511
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2782

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:25.760
<v Speaker 4>Gavin Tucker.</v>

2784
01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.021
<v Speaker 4>Sam.</v>

2785
01:13:26.021 --> 01:13:27.200

2789
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:32.833
<v Speaker 4>Just too many fighters.</v>

2790
01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:33.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anybody anymore.</v>

2791
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.843
<v Speaker 4>I give up.</v>

2792
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:40.790
<v Speaker 4>There's so many fucking be brought to research on the guys before I watch them</v>

2793
01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:43.910
<v Speaker 4>and you know what for I watch from fight or I have to call their fights,</v>

2794
01:13:43.911 --> 01:13:44.510
<v Speaker 4>but Goddamn,</v>

2795
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:46.550
<v Speaker 4>it's too many people now and you have C's released.</v>

2796
01:13:46.551 --> 01:13:47.384
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them.</v>

2797
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:49.730
<v Speaker 4>Did they little release Lorenz Larkin.</v>

2798
01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.590
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

2799
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:52.400
<v Speaker 4>That's a mistake.</v>

2800
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't made engine anything.</v>

2801
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:54.980
<v Speaker 4>That guy is fucking good.</v>

2802
01:13:54.981 --> 01:13:55.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2803
01:13:55.191 --> 01:13:55.490
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2804
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:57.170
<v Speaker 4>he's so fucking good.</v>

2805
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.030
<v Speaker 4>He's one of those guys on to watch.</v>

2806
01:13:59.090 --> 01:14:00.260
<v Speaker 4>Real fun to watch.</v>

2807
01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.790
<v Speaker 4>He's one of those guys that could put it together and be the champ at one 70</v>

2808
01:14:03.791 --> 01:14:03.911
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2809
01:14:03.911 --> 01:14:04.671
<v Speaker 4>you really could.</v>

2810
01:14:04.671 --> 01:14:05.870
<v Speaker 4>He's got that potential.</v>

2811
01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:07.520
<v Speaker 4>His standup is so,</v>

2812
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:08.030
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2813
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:09.830
<v Speaker 4>so nasty and so on.</v>

2814
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.700
<v Speaker 4>Orthodox,</v>

2815
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:15.070
<v Speaker 4>that weird oblique kick that he does to the body that he used against Neil</v>

2816
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:15.903
<v Speaker 4>Magni.</v>

2817
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:17.260
<v Speaker 4>Did he throw in a way?</v>

2818
01:14:17.261 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Nobody else throws it.</v>

2819
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:21.460
<v Speaker 4>That's another new technique like we seen like a lot of Winkle,</v>

2820
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:22.570
<v Speaker 4>John's guys doing it to the,</v>

2821
01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.430
<v Speaker 4>to the legs and no one ever,</v>

2822
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:26.670
<v Speaker 4>no one ever throws it to that same side of the body.</v>

2823
01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.530
<v Speaker 4>Heal rens throws it to the body and fucking hard.</v>

2824
01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:30.490
<v Speaker 4>He sends you flying.</v>

2825
01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 4>I've been practicing that on the bag.</v>

2826
01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:33.050
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2827
01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:34.570
<v Speaker 4>it's a good kick man.</v>

2828
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a really good kick.</v>

2829
01:14:35.891 --> 01:14:40.891
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of power to it and I liked the impact a better then that's when he</v>

2830
01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:42.340
<v Speaker 4>fucked up Gonzaga.</v>

2831
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:47.830
<v Speaker 4>I like the impact better than a front kick to the body because the front kick,</v>

2832
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:50.410
<v Speaker 4>the thing about the front kick is even if you throw a front,</v>

2833
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.330
<v Speaker 4>like a snap kick karate style,</v>

2834
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:54.160
<v Speaker 4>your foot still gives a little,</v>

2835
01:14:54.161 --> 01:14:56.050
<v Speaker 4>your foot is kind of a flexible thing,</v>

2836
01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.560
<v Speaker 4>but when you throw it like that oblique style you're going,</v>

2837
01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.540
<v Speaker 4>he'll in and there's no give.</v>

2838
01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:02.620
<v Speaker 4>It's just wham.</v>

2839
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.491
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

2840
01:15:03.491 --> 01:15:05.440
<v Speaker 4>it's a really strong kick man.</v>

2841
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.740
<v Speaker 4>And it's a,</v>

2842
01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.290
<v Speaker 4>it's one that very few people,</v>

2843
01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:10.270
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of wing Chung ish and a lot of ways,</v>

2844
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:11.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2845
01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean wing Chung uses a very similar technique to that.</v>

2846
01:15:14.441 --> 01:15:15.280
<v Speaker 4>They use it to the legs.</v>

2847
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:16.123
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2848
01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I mean.</v>

2849
01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:18.601
<v Speaker 4>Where's the,</v>

2850
01:15:18.601 --> 01:15:20.980
<v Speaker 4>what's the origination of the oblique kick?</v>

2851
01:15:20.981 --> 01:15:22.030
<v Speaker 4>What's the origin of that?</v>

2852
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:22.421
<v Speaker 4>Eddie,</v>

2853
01:15:22.421 --> 01:15:23.360
<v Speaker 4>do you know any idea?</v>

2854
01:15:23.361 --> 01:15:24.720
<v Speaker 4>Some asshole that,</v>

2855
01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:28.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm trying to just some Kung Fu kick.</v>

2856
01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it isn't comfortable kick.</v>

2857
01:15:30.251 --> 01:15:30.701
<v Speaker 4>I mean I just,</v>

2858
01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:34.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to think of like a devotees in taekwondo because they didn't teach us</v>

2859
01:15:34.721 --> 01:15:35.554
<v Speaker 4>that in taekwondo.</v>

2860
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:37.263
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm,</v>

2861
01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.900
<v Speaker 4>the only thing that's similar to it was there was a,</v>

2862
01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:45.100
<v Speaker 4>you would do like a front kick in a different way sometimes where you would do a</v>

2863
01:15:45.101 --> 01:15:45.870
<v Speaker 4>stomp.</v>

2864
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:49.000
<v Speaker 4>Like I would do a front kick sometimes where I would throw it and I would throw</v>

2865
01:15:49.001 --> 01:15:49.631
<v Speaker 4>it with the heel.</v>

2866
01:15:49.631 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I put the money back now to the chest,</v>

2867
01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.590
<v Speaker 4>I throw it and I pull the foot way back and,</v>

2868
01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:56.170
<v Speaker 4>and land with the heel.</v>

2869
01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.470
<v Speaker 4>And you could get a lot of power off of that.</v>

2870
01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:02.020
<v Speaker 4>But I like this too,</v>

2871
01:16:02.021 --> 01:16:02.261
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2872
01:16:02.261 --> 01:16:03.670
<v Speaker 4>I think this might be even better,</v>

2873
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:06.160
<v Speaker 4>just like a little bit of a twist to the leg,</v>

2874
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.101
<v Speaker 4>the way,</v>

2875
01:16:07.101 --> 01:16:07.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2876
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:10.360
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing Lorens throw it.</v>

2877
01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.840
<v Speaker 4>But Lorens might have moved on to bell tour,</v>

2878
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:13.061
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2879
01:16:13.061 --> 01:16:13.894
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2880
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:14.920
<v Speaker 4>I haven't talked to him,</v>

2881
01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.170
<v Speaker 4>but I know that they were all negotiating.</v>

2882
01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:20.260
<v Speaker 4>And if Bella tour puts Lorenza in there too.</v>

2883
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.670
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2884
01:16:20.670 --> 01:16:21.010
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

2885
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.240
<v Speaker 4>That's who really good,</v>

2886
01:16:22.241 --> 01:16:23.074
<v Speaker 4>good way clash.</v>

2887
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking fuck.</v>

2888
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.520
<v Speaker 4>Almost commensurate with the UFC and the UFC has Damien Maia,</v>

2889
01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 4>cowboy Donald Serone.</v>

2890
01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:32.830
<v Speaker 4>Tell me you wouldn't want to see Donald Cerrone versus Lauren's Larkin.</v>

2891
01:16:32.831 --> 01:16:34.090
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

2892
01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.111
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2893
01:16:35.111 --> 01:16:36.360
<v Speaker 4>that would be holy shit.</v>

2894
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:38.890
<v Speaker 4>Or Lorens versus Mazda doll.</v>

2895
01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.240
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see that fight too.</v>

2896
01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.030
<v Speaker 4>I just want to see one of those people put again now that you brought that up</v>

2897
01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:43.960
<v Speaker 4>please.</v>

2898
01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.790
<v Speaker 4>That's a fucking Christmas present for about</v>

2899
01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.800
<v Speaker 4>one 70 might be the most talent rich division in the UFC right now.</v>

2900
01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:56.290
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that Connor might one day step up to try to fight whoever wins</v>

2901
01:16:56.291 --> 01:16:58.230
<v Speaker 4>Woodley versus Wonderboy.</v>

2902
01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:01.390
<v Speaker 4>That would have been the craziest move.</v>

2903
01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:02.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean it looks,</v>

2904
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.810
<v Speaker 4>lear really looks like he's going to fight Floyd Mayweather.</v>

2905
01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:06.160
<v Speaker 4>Connor.</v>

2906
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:06.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2907
01:17:06.461 --> 01:17:07.720
<v Speaker 4>It really looks like it's gonna happen.</v>

2908
01:17:07.721 --> 01:17:09.250
<v Speaker 4>It looks like there's too much money to stop.</v>

2909
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.081
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2910
01:17:10.081 --> 01:17:11.930
<v Speaker 4>So then I was thinking is that you have seen needs to,</v>

2911
01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.280
<v Speaker 4>they need to get a return on this.</v>

2912
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.510
<v Speaker 4>All the money they borrowed.</v>

2913
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 4>What the best way to make that money back,</v>

2914
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.633
<v Speaker 4>having that fight.</v>

2915
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:19.130
<v Speaker 4>But it's a weird fight.</v>

2916
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.030
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>

2917
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:21.560
<v Speaker 4>what do you do with that fight?</v>

2918
01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.410
<v Speaker 4>You got to make an it in boxing.</v>

2919
01:17:24.411 --> 01:17:25.700
<v Speaker 4>You can't make it in an MMA.</v>

2920
01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:26.960
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to be an MMA fight.</v>

2921
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:28.190
<v Speaker 4>Floyd is not going to agree to that.</v>

2922
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.570
<v Speaker 4>So it's gotta be a boxing fight.</v>

2923
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:30.950
<v Speaker 4>It'll be a and match.</v>

2924
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 4>So you don't have it in the UFC though.</v>

2925
01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:33.801
<v Speaker 4>So the UFC,</v>

2926
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:34.820
<v Speaker 4>what cope promotes,</v>

2927
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:35.750
<v Speaker 4>like what do they do?</v>

2928
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.901
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2929
01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:38.090
<v Speaker 4>all three of them get together as a promotional entity.</v>

2930
01:17:38.091 --> 01:17:39.740
<v Speaker 4>And what kind of precedent does that set,</v>

2931
01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.160
<v Speaker 4>you know exactly as far as control,</v>

2932
01:17:43.161 --> 01:17:43.730
<v Speaker 4>like no,</v>

2933
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:47.660
<v Speaker 4>no organization has ever had the kind of control that the UFC has,</v>

2934
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2935
01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:48.861
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's an,</v>

2936
01:17:48.861 --> 01:17:50.540
<v Speaker 4>it's an epic level of control.</v>

2937
01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:51.280
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2938
01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.113
<v Speaker 4>they can choose to,</v>

2939
01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:52.431
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2940
01:17:52.431 --> 01:17:53.750
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be for the interim title.</v>

2941
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:54.171
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2942
01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:54.921
<v Speaker 4>Tony Ferguson,</v>

2943
01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:55.760
<v Speaker 4>Habib Neuro off.</v>

2944
01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:56.773
<v Speaker 4>Congratulations.</v>

2945
01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:59.120
<v Speaker 4>I know Connor just won the title a couple of months ago,</v>

2946
01:17:59.121 --> 01:18:00.640
<v Speaker 4>but the way we see it,</v>

2947
01:18:00.730 --> 01:18:01.690
<v Speaker 4>I've got another guy here.</v>

2948
01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:02.780
<v Speaker 4>You guys can be the champ.</v>

2949
01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:06.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean we have two interim champs right now if that happens.</v>

2950
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

2951
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.780
<v Speaker 4>because Max Holloway's the interim champ.</v>

2952
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:11.210
<v Speaker 4>Max Holloway doesn't give a fuck about that title either.</v>

2953
01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:12.081
<v Speaker 4>I mean his,</v>

2954
01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:14.870
<v Speaker 4>he's just got his eyes on Jose Aldo when they gave him that belt.</v>

2955
01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean he literally was like this on the belt.</v>

2956
01:18:16.521 --> 01:18:17.030
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>

2957
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.480
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2958
01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.260
<v Speaker 4>I want the real one.</v>

2959
01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.160
<v Speaker 4>I want to fight all though.</v>

2960
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.690
<v Speaker 4>So that makes at least some more sense.</v>

2961
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.730
<v Speaker 4>Thank God they're doing another King Kong movie.</v>

2962
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:28.220
<v Speaker 4>Exactly what we need.</v>

2963
01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:32.090
<v Speaker 4>Life and an even bigger can come even bigger than ever.</v>

2964
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:32.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2965
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:33.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2966
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:34.221
<v Speaker 4>come on man.</v>

2967
01:18:34.221 --> 01:18:35.054
<v Speaker 4>How are they?</v>

2968
01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.330
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't hide the first little one who is like,</v>

2969
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:38.961
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

2970
01:18:38.961 --> 01:18:39.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2971
01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:40.370
<v Speaker 4>fucking seven feet tall.</v>

2972
01:18:40.371 --> 01:18:41.330
<v Speaker 4>We have Google earth now,</v>

2973
01:18:41.331 --> 01:18:41.720
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

2974
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:41.931
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2975
01:18:41.931 --> 01:18:43.850
<v Speaker 4>this thing's fucking 60 feet tall now.</v>

2976
01:18:43.851 --> 01:18:44.480
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to be high.</v>

2977
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.040
<v Speaker 4>The first one was 50 feet tall.</v>

2978
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.500
<v Speaker 4>This one's got Zillow was 500 feet tall,</v>

2979
01:18:48.501 --> 01:18:50.600
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the things that made Godzilla versus King Kong.</v>

2980
01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:51.620
<v Speaker 4>So fucking stupid.</v>

2981
01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.940
<v Speaker 4>Because when he went to Japan,</v>

2982
01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:55.070
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden King Kong was 500 feet tall too.</v>

2983
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.551
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2984
01:18:55.551 --> 01:18:55.661
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2985
01:18:55.661 --> 01:18:56.121
<v Speaker 4>what the hell,</v>

2986
01:18:56.121 --> 01:18:56.730
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

2987
01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:58.520
<v Speaker 4>Remember when he was climbing the empire state building?</v>

2988
01:18:58.521 --> 01:18:59.570
<v Speaker 4>He was not that big.</v>

2989
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.080
<v Speaker 4>He was about,</v>

2990
01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:00.913
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2991
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:02.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2992
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.110
<v Speaker 4>not much bigger than I am.</v>

2993
01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.130
<v Speaker 4>They just vary it.</v>

2994
01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:04.941
<v Speaker 4>I just love,</v>

2995
01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:05.331
<v Speaker 4>they keep,</v>

2996
01:19:05.331 --> 01:19:10.170
<v Speaker 4>they run out of ideas I guess so they just keep doing the same idea with Martha.</v>

2997
01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:11.690
<v Speaker 4>How about the turtle?</v>

2998
01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:16.070
<v Speaker 4>Remember Gamarra he was spin around rockets would shoot out all his holes and he</v>

2999
01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:17.240
<v Speaker 4>would spin around in a circle.</v>

3000
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:18.143
<v Speaker 4>Remember that shit?</v>

3001
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.920
<v Speaker 4>You don't remember gamma?</v>

3002
01:19:20.921 --> 01:19:21.580
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3003
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude.</v>

3004
01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 4>Camera was the stupidest fucking monster ever.</v>

3005
01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:27.870
<v Speaker 4>You Remember Camera?</v>

3006
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:29.270
<v Speaker 4>If he showed me,</v>

3007
01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:30.440
<v Speaker 4>I would remember Jamie.</v>

3008
01:19:30.441 --> 01:19:31.070
<v Speaker 4>We'll pull it up.</v>

3009
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.930
<v Speaker 4>He'll pull up gamma.</v>

3010
01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:33.560
<v Speaker 4>I remember Mothra.</v>

3011

3031
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.690
<v Speaker 2>I had to choose sides.</v>

01:20:09.730 --> 01:20:10.051
<v Speaker 2>It's there.</v>

3033
01:20:10.051 --> 01:20:10.561
<v Speaker 2>Those people,</v>

01:20:10.561 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 2>we're all so competitive with each other.</v>

3035
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:13.890
<v Speaker 2>All those people in those businesses.</v>

3036
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the same with MMA too,</v>

3037
01:20:15.601 --> 01:20:16.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3038
01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Like the UFC in Beltour super competitive with each other,</v>

3039
01:20:19.621 --> 01:20:20.454
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

3040

<v Speaker 2>I refuse.</v>

3041
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Does tap out still exist?</v>

3042
01:20:23.071 --> 01:20:23.680
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.331
<v Speaker 2>No they do,</v>

3044
01:20:24.331 --> 01:20:25.150
<v Speaker 2>but they don't look,</v>

3045
01:20:25.150 --> 01:20:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I just see it on the ground in India.</v>

3046
01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:27.181
<v Speaker 2>They do what?</v>

3047
01:20:27.181 --> 01:20:27.620
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

3048
01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.070
<v Speaker 2>They're are there in pro wrestling now,</v>

3049
01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.230
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

3050
01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:31.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3051
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

3052
01:20:32.190 --> 01:20:32.491
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3053
01:20:32.491 --> 01:20:36.260
<v Speaker 2>that's an example how wrestling pro wrestling is a thought with tap out now</v>

3054
01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.690

3055
01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.553
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

3056
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:44.220
<v Speaker 2>They have some sort of a deal with pro wrestling now we're tap out is a big part</v>

3057
01:20:44.221 --> 01:20:45.054
<v Speaker 2>of pro wrestling.</v>

3058
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:46.650
<v Speaker 2>They have to wear tap out shit.</v>

3059
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:48.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3060
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:51.511
<v Speaker 2>That was the best thing.</v>

3061
01:20:51.511 --> 01:20:53.610
<v Speaker 2>They could go get that crowd.</v>

3062
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3063
01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:54.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3064
01:20:54.451 --> 01:20:56.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they can get them the right,</v>

3065
01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they can get them.</v>

3066
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3067
01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I think they did and they got him.</v>

3068
01:20:59.280 --> 01:20:59.761
<v Speaker 2>But did we,</v>

3069
01:20:59.761 --> 01:21:00.481
<v Speaker 2>do they have on though?</v>

3070
01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Do you see like people wearing tap out anymore?</v>

3071
01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd have tap out shirts with pro wrestling on it if I fucking hope mask</v>

3072
01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:06.950
<v Speaker 2>was a lot.</v>

3073
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:07.411
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

3074
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:07.911
<v Speaker 2>Tap Out,</v>

3076
01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:08.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3077
01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:09.001
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>

3078
01:21:09.001 --> 01:21:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Looked at new logo.</v>

3079
01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3080
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Still Bulky.</v>

3081
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:14.693
<v Speaker 2>Who's that guy?</v>

3082
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:15.893
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

3083
01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

3084
01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:17.610
<v Speaker 2>They ticket to death.</v>

3085
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.670
<v Speaker 2>They took it to his class.</v>

3086
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:21.350
<v Speaker 2>He's got a totally different look.</v>

3087
01:21:21.370 --> 01:21:22.141
<v Speaker 2>The new logo,</v>

3088
01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:23.890
<v Speaker 2>the t above the old good move.</v>

3089
01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Fast move.</v>

3090
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Still.</v>

3091
01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:27.900
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those brands.</v>

3092
01:21:27.901 --> 01:21:29.760
<v Speaker 2>It's just the genes there.</v>

3093
01:21:29.761 --> 01:21:30.594
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

3094
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.060
<v Speaker 2>It just got so beaten down.</v>

3095
01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:35.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of those things that just can brands,</v>

3096
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.800
<v Speaker 2>no brands make it not an MMA,</v>

3097
01:21:37.801 --> 01:21:38.130
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3098
01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:39.990
<v Speaker 2>No brands make it Reebok's.</v>

3099
01:21:39.991 --> 01:21:40.824
<v Speaker 2>Gonna make it though,</v>

3100
01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:41.670
<v Speaker 2>do you think?</v>

3101
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:42.421
<v Speaker 2>No other bands.</v>

3102
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:44.670
<v Speaker 2>So Reebok is a brand outside of MMA.</v>

3103
01:21:44.671 --> 01:21:46.890
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's going to make it an MMA sort of,</v>

3104
01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:50.070
<v Speaker 2>but the only reason why it's making it an MMA because of the UFC deal.</v>

3105
01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3106
01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:50.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3107
01:21:50.971 --> 01:21:51.490
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

3108
01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:52.320
<v Speaker 2>It's forced.</v>

3109
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I kind of pants now.</v>

3110
01:21:54.511 --> 01:21:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I wear them all the time.</v>

3111
01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I rock him right now.</v>

3112
01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:57.413
<v Speaker 2>Look and see that.</v>

3113
01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.313
<v Speaker 2>What are you saying Jamie,</v>

3114
01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:58.930
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>

3115
01:21:58.930 --> 01:21:59.763
<v Speaker 2>Just a few years ago,</v>

3116
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:02.100
<v Speaker 2>tap out did no Reebok.</v>

3117
01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3118
01:22:02.490 --> 01:22:03.323
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3119
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:04.890
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

3120
01:22:04.890 --> 01:22:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3121
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Their stuff is comfortable.</v>

3122
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:07.930
<v Speaker 2>I'd like it's gotten better.</v>

3123
01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.680
<v Speaker 2>The first I was critical like most,</v>

3124
01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:12.300
<v Speaker 2>but I actually like wearing them.</v>

3125
01:22:12.301 --> 01:22:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I wear them all the time.</v>

3126
01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:14.220
<v Speaker 2>They make good stuff.</v>

3127
01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:15.090
<v Speaker 2>That's not the problem.</v>

3128
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:18.840
<v Speaker 2>The problem is what happened with the deal to MMA fighters had had sponsorships</v>

3129
01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:21.840
<v Speaker 2>before the Reebok deal came around and how much money they lost.</v>

3130
01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3131
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.160
<v Speaker 2>That's the real problem.</v>

3132
01:22:23.161 --> 01:22:23.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

3133
01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.530
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing to do with the quality of their items,</v>

3134
01:22:25.531 --> 01:22:27.450
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of fucked for the company.</v>

3135
01:22:27.451 --> 01:22:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3136
01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Can we think about all the negative energy,</v>

3137
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.840
<v Speaker 2>the negative press that they've gotten from MMA fans that are mad at the deal?</v>

3138
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:38.070
<v Speaker 2>I was making very good money from sponsors and they like eight grand a month</v>

3139
01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.090
<v Speaker 2>when I first got in UFC</v>

3140
01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.150
<v Speaker 2>just from sponsors or sponsors.</v>

3141
01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:43.650
<v Speaker 2>And how much have you made from top out?</v>

3142
01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3143
01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:44.480
<v Speaker 2>tad.</v>

3144
01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.450
<v Speaker 2>That paid me so much that that would never thought.</v>

3145
01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.210
<v Speaker 2>How much did you made for me buck?</v>

3146
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3147
01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll make five.</v>

3148
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:55.223
<v Speaker 2>Five per fight.</v>

3149
01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3150
01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.720
<v Speaker 2>And there's no other sponsors involved anymore?</v>

3151
01:22:57.721 --> 01:22:58.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3152
01:22:58.380 --> 01:22:58.711
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

3153
01:22:58.711 --> 01:22:58.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3154
01:22:58.861 --> 01:22:59.694
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

3155
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.331
<v Speaker 2>everything I had,</v>

3156
01:23:00.331 --> 01:23:04.050
<v Speaker 2>everything I ever wears aisle is all from companies that would sponsor me if I,</v>

3157
01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 2>if I like Ruca or like this company</v>

3158
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.053
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>

3159
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>they would sponsor me if it was a fucking point to it.</v>

3160
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:09.611
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3161
01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:10.600
<v Speaker 1>how's your podcast doing?</v>

3162
01:23:10.601 --> 01:23:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I know you're doing a podcast now,</v>

3163
01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Eric Apple is that my podcast,</v>

3164
01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 1>which is story time with uncle creepy.</v>

3165
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:20.800
<v Speaker 1>That's just me kind of getting more in depth than just ripping you off.</v>

3166
01:23:20.801 --> 01:23:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Basically talking to my friends that are interested in me off I'd run out of the</v>

3167
01:23:23.831 --> 01:23:24.730
<v Speaker 1>people for me.</v>

3168
01:23:24.731 --> 01:23:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's everybody's ripping everybody off in this genre.</v>

3169
01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3170
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:28.241
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3171
01:23:28.241 --> 01:23:30.610
<v Speaker 1>and then the other one is there's two American animals.</v>

3172
01:23:30.970 --> 01:23:32.470
<v Speaker 1>It's me and my cohost Eric Apple,</v>

01:25:51.161 --> 01:25:54.190
<v Speaker 1>shit about everything and have people on how people get blasted with them.</v>

3302
01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3303
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Get incoherent.</v>

3304
01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Forget what they're talking about.</v>

3305
01:25:57.130 --> 01:26:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Just blasted radio blasted radio slash two oh nine with nick and Diaz lasted to,</v>

3306
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:08.270
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck could they not have an episode two oh nine in Stockton.</v>

3307
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:11.120
<v Speaker 1>They have UFC 209 is coming up and it's not in Stockton.</v>

3308
01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:11.690
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

3309
01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:13.190
<v Speaker 1>That shit is unconscionable.</v>

3310
01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:17.060
<v Speaker 1>They had one opportunity ever in the history of the UFC and then do,</v>

3311
01:26:17.150 --> 01:26:18.260
<v Speaker 1>they should have planned it.</v>

3312
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Like I planned episode nine 11 to be Alex Jones.</v>

3313
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:26.950
<v Speaker 1>He should've planned episode two oh nine to be in fucking Stockton with Nick and</v>

3314
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz.</v>

3315
01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you that shit would have gotten 2 million paper view bys for sure.</v>

3316
01:26:32.650 --> 01:26:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Well they said if it just bomb UFC two oh nine and then just that else.</v>

3317
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And then city of study,</v>

3318
01:26:39.951 --> 01:26:42.650
<v Speaker 1>they find that they fight whoever you know,</v>

3319
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:44.000
<v Speaker 1>you could get them fights.</v>

3320
01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Look GSPs back GSPs back GSP versus Nick Diaz is the perfect fight to make.</v>

3321
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:52.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the perfect fight to make.</v>

3322
01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Cause neither guys fought in a long time,</v>

3323
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.890
<v Speaker 1>neither guys in title contention and it's a super fight.</v>

3324
01:26:57.930 --> 01:26:59.630
<v Speaker 1>This a super fight right out of the gate.</v>

3325
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Very true.</v>

3326
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

3327
01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.770
<v Speaker 1>So Tucker,</v>

3328
01:27:03.771 --> 01:27:04.940
<v Speaker 1>watching him warm up,</v>

3329
01:27:04.941 --> 01:27:05.301
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3330
01:27:05.301 --> 01:27:10.301
<v Speaker 1>his striking looks really crisp to be interesting to see and really well yeah.</v>

3331
01:27:10.521 --> 01:27:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Interesting to see him versus Sam.</v>

3332
01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.800
<v Speaker 1>But you can tell Sam's just trying to line up a shot.</v>

3333
01:27:15.801 --> 01:27:18.380
<v Speaker 1>So Santa throw some hay makers.</v>

3334
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3335
01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:19.881
<v Speaker 1>The dude throws,</v>

3336
01:27:19.881 --> 01:27:20.840
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3337
01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:27.210
<v Speaker 1>but he's at least keeping his hands up for the most part.</v>

3338
01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:28.560
<v Speaker 1>They're starting to drop again.</v>

3339
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:29.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a Cilia.</v>

3340
01:27:29.610 --> 01:27:34.530
<v Speaker 1>He's like famous for putting his hands right about waistband level and just</v>

3341
01:27:34.770 --> 01:27:37.050
<v Speaker 1>launch and bricks your way.</v>

3342
01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:39.870
<v Speaker 1>He actually has a fist underneath that beard.</v>

3343
01:27:40.290 --> 01:27:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I really think that that is the fight.</v>

3344
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I really think that Nick Diaz versus GSP is the fight because it's a super</v>

3345
01:27:47.251 --> 01:27:48.084
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

3346
01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Both guys haven't fought in forever.</v>

3347
01:27:50.401 --> 01:27:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Both guys are not ranked and it's a fight you could sell.</v>

3348
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3349
01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Like right out of the gate,</v>

3350
01:27:55.290 --> 01:27:56.550
<v Speaker 1>there's no repercussions.</v>

3351
01:27:56.670 --> 01:27:58.590
<v Speaker 1>But there's all show a lot of money we made,</v>

3352
01:27:58.770 --> 01:28:01.680
<v Speaker 1>and I'm hearing rumors about Eddie Alvarez Fight Nate Diaz,</v>

3353
01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.660
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

3354
01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:04.590
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

3355
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:07.410
<v Speaker 1>the reality of the rumors is I'm only hearing them online.</v>

3356
01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.540
<v Speaker 1>So I mean they might be total bullshit.</v>

3357
01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Like I could probably ask,</v>

3358
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:16.183
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to read online.</v>

3359
01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:16.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3360
01:28:16.441 --> 01:28:18.630
<v Speaker 1>I have a direct line to the UFC,</v>

3361
01:28:18.631 --> 01:28:20.430
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile I'm reading Instagram posts.</v>

3362
01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:20.611
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3363
01:28:20.611 --> 01:28:21.444
<v Speaker 1>for real.</v>

3364
01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Is this real?</v>

3365
01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

3366
01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was for real,</v>

3367
01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but I love that fight to Eddie Alvarez versus Nate Diaz.</v>

3368
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:31.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a good fucking fight.</v>

3369
01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:33.243
<v Speaker 7>Awesome.</v>

3370
01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of good fights that could be made right now,</v>

3371
01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:40.780
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like the transition between [inaudible] and this new company,</v>

3372
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3373
01:28:42.461 --> 01:28:45.070
<v Speaker 1>between WME and the old guard,</v>

3374
01:28:45.370 --> 01:28:46.091
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's,</v>

3375
01:28:46.091 --> 01:28:51.091
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely been a transitionary period where some things are as well as</v>

3376
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.233
<v Speaker 1>you think you do it.</v>

3377
01:28:53.770 --> 01:28:53.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3378
01:28:53.951 --> 01:28:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Like that Brooklyn card was a hard sell.</v>

3379
01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:58.480
<v Speaker 1>It turned out to be like a really good fight card.</v>

3380
01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.670
<v Speaker 1>But the f the main event,</v>

3381
01:29:00.671 --> 01:29:03.630
<v Speaker 1>the featherweight about kind of a hard sell for a lot of people</v>

3382
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:08.870
<v Speaker 1>and we all know that that title is just a place.</v>

3383
01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:10.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just a placeholder for Chris.</v>

3384
01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.570
<v Speaker 1>What people are mad that Chris is getting a test,</v>

3385
01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:13.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3386
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:14.070
<v Speaker 1>not testosterone,</v>

3387
01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.780
<v Speaker 1>a therapeutic use exemption.</v>

3388
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:18.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are pretty pissed online.</v>

3389
01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:21.420
<v Speaker 1>And you're saying that you saw it was manipulated,</v>

3390
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:23.610
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that's true.</v>

3391
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that they've found that whatever she's taking was the right thing to</v>

3392
01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:30.900
<v Speaker 1>take for whatever issue she's got.</v>

3393
01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:31.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3394
01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:32.761
<v Speaker 1>They know everything.</v>

3395
01:29:32.761 --> 01:29:35.040
<v Speaker 1>They test you and they can see everything in your system.</v>

3396
01:29:35.050 --> 01:29:35.520
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

3397
01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.353
<v Speaker 1>They're not stupid.</v>

3398
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be very interesting to see what happens when Duran,</v>

3399
01:29:42.141 --> 01:29:42.271
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

3400
01:29:42.271 --> 01:29:46.800
<v Speaker 1>he comes back if she's going to fight Holly Holm for rematch or if they're going</v>

3401
01:29:46.801 --> 01:29:48.000
<v Speaker 1>to go straight to Cyborg,</v>

3402
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:52.200
<v Speaker 1>but what the UFC is going to decide cause cyborgs where the money's at.</v>

3403
01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:53.123
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

3404
01:29:54.090 --> 01:29:55.030
<v Speaker 1>you know me.</v>

3405
01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

3406
01:29:57.210 --> 01:29:59.400
<v Speaker 1>irregular folks don't know who Cyborg is.</v>

3407
01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:00.900
<v Speaker 1>She is scary,</v>

3408
01:30:01.050 --> 01:30:01.980
<v Speaker 1>but they'll know.</v>

3409
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.390
<v Speaker 1>They'll know after that fight.</v>

3410
01:30:04.890 --> 01:30:05.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3411
01:30:05.071 --> 01:30:05.850
<v Speaker 1>she's the,</v>

3412
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:06.683
<v Speaker 1>she's this.</v>

3413
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:08.910
<v Speaker 1>She's such a bad ass.</v>

3414
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:09.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3415
01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:10.201
<v Speaker 1>I see you're at the gym.</v>

3416
01:30:10.201 --> 01:30:12.570
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking so tough and so hardworking.</v>

3417
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:13.680
<v Speaker 1>She's at Ruca too,</v>

3418
01:30:13.681 --> 01:30:13.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3419
01:30:13.981 --> 01:30:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Isn't she training with Jason,</v>

3420
01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:16.733
<v Speaker 1>Jason Parillo.</v>

3421
01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:17.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3422
01:30:17.221 --> 01:30:17.560
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

3423
01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:18.393
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

3424
01:30:18.630 --> 01:30:20.100
<v Speaker 1>that woman works so fucking hard.</v>

3425
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.880
<v Speaker 1>She's always doing something like running a marathon,</v>

3426
01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:23.701
<v Speaker 1>doing this and that.</v>

3427
01:30:23.701 --> 01:30:24.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3428
01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Jeez,</v>

3429
01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:25.673
<v Speaker 1>runs marathons.</v>

3430
01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.870
<v Speaker 1>She just did a half marathon and then a couple weeks ago.</v>

3431
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:30.083
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

3432

3435
01:30:36.791 --> 01:30:39.760
<v Speaker 8>It's one of the funniest sketches of all time.</v>

3436
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:43.360
<v Speaker 8>And I though is playing rocky on the beach.</v>

3437

3441
01:30:47.651 --> 01:30:47.981
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3442
01:30:47.981 --> 01:30:50.950
<v Speaker 8>it's like really emotional and Cyborg plays.</v>

3443
01:30:50.951 --> 01:30:51.550
<v Speaker 8>Adrian.</v>

3444
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:52.660
<v Speaker 8>It's hysteric.</v>

3445
01:30:52.661 --> 01:30:54.230
<v Speaker 8>How funny is it there sand</v>

3446
01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:55.173
<v Speaker 1>this day?</v>

3447
01:30:55.630 --> 01:30:56.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like that he,</v>

3448
01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:01.480
<v Speaker 1>that character that had not [inaudible] character is inexorable.</v>

3449
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3450
01:31:01.721 --> 01:31:02.260
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

3451
01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:03.430
<v Speaker 1>he's connected to that.</v>

3452
01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:04.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3453
01:31:04.031 --> 01:31:04.864
<v Speaker 1>that is him.</v>

3454
01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.130
<v Speaker 1>That was always a goof,</v>

3455
01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:07.810
<v Speaker 1>like hanging around the gym.</v>

3456
01:31:07.811 --> 01:31:09.160
<v Speaker 1>It was always like fun.</v>

3457
01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:10.061
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

3458
01:31:10.061 --> 01:31:13.990
<v Speaker 1>people think that I got in an argument with a Brazilian jujitsu black belt about</v>

3459
01:31:13.991 --> 01:31:15.640
<v Speaker 1>weed did.</v>

3460
01:31:15.641 --> 01:31:18.720
<v Speaker 1>He really did come up to me and was giving me a hard time about wheat.</v>

3461
01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:20.350
<v Speaker 8>I had a meeting with him yesterday.</v>

3462
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.841
<v Speaker 8>We're,</v>

3463
01:31:20.841 --> 01:31:21.674
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3464
01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:25.300
<v Speaker 8>we're thinking about doing an enter the dragon parody with,</v>

3465
01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:25.841
<v Speaker 8>I call it,</v>

3466
01:31:25.841 --> 01:31:26.980
<v Speaker 8>enter the death knuckle.</v>

3467
01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:29.373
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

3468
01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:33.340
<v Speaker 8>what we will probably do it.</v>

3469
01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:34.420
<v Speaker 8>What we'll same</v>

3470
01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:37.810
<v Speaker 1>is he still doing that little talk show that he was doing though when he would</v>

3471
01:31:37.811 --> 01:31:38.710
<v Speaker 1>sit down with people?</v>

3472
01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:39.500
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

3473
01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:39.920
<v Speaker 8>Kenny from,</v>

3474
01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.990
<v Speaker 8>that was funny.</v>

3475
01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:41.961
<v Speaker 8>That was part of it,</v>

3476
01:31:41.961 --> 01:31:42.741
<v Speaker 8>that rocky sketch,</v>

3477
01:31:42.741 --> 01:31:44.330
<v Speaker 8>because every show is a talk show,</v>

3478
01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:47.470
<v Speaker 8>but he'd have a sketch that start at each show on them.</v>

3479
01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:50.300
<v Speaker 8>The first one was the Robert Dinero sitting with,</v>

3480
01:31:50.301 --> 01:31:50.930
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3481
01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:53.150
<v Speaker 8>Al Pachino in heat.</v>

3482
01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:54.740
<v Speaker 8>He did a scene where,</v>

3483
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:58.430
<v Speaker 8>and Kenny Florian plays Al Pachino and,</v>

3484
01:31:58.440 --> 01:31:59.273
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3485
01:32:00.330 --> 01:32:00.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3486
01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.650
<v Speaker 5>Hannah auto plays Robert Deniro.</v>

3487
01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.610
<v Speaker 5>That's a great sketch,</v>

3488
01:32:03.611 --> 01:32:04.510
<v Speaker 5>one of the greatest sketches.</v>

3489
01:32:04.511 --> 01:32:05.830
<v Speaker 5>Then he does a Josh Barnett one,</v>

3490
01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:06.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3491
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:11.310
<v Speaker 5>broke back mountain parody with her natto and Josh Barnett in the woods,</v>

3492
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.550
<v Speaker 5>one of the greatest of all time.</v>

3493
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:13.623
<v Speaker 5>And then he does,</v>

3494
01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 5>he really does the intro.</v>

3495
01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:15.461
<v Speaker 5>Another one,</v>

3496
01:32:15.461 --> 01:32:18.130
<v Speaker 5>he redoes the intro to the incredible hulk show.</v>

3497
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:21.820
<v Speaker 5>It's incredible because it had not those David Banner.</v>

3498
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:22.900
<v Speaker 5>And when he sees,</v>

3499
01:32:23.190 --> 01:32:23.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3500
01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.870
<v Speaker 5>when he gets child support notices,</v>

3501
01:32:26.110 --> 01:32:26.943
<v Speaker 5>it</v>

3502
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:28.743
<v Speaker 5>infuriates</v>

3503
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:31.223
<v Speaker 5>it's</v>

3504
01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:33.551
<v Speaker 5>dude the hand,</v>

3505
01:32:33.551 --> 01:32:34.690
<v Speaker 5>not the La Ronda Shell.</v>

3506
01:32:34.691 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 5>Are you kidding me?</v>

3507
01:32:35.861 --> 01:32:36.461
<v Speaker 5>He's funny,</v>

3508
01:32:36.461 --> 01:32:36.681
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3509
01:32:36.681 --> 01:32:37.450
<v Speaker 5>Are you kidding me?</v>

3510
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:39.640
<v Speaker 5>What's interesting is MMA gets bigger.</v>

3511
01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 5>Like that character is like more and more viable.</v>

3512
01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:43.391
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3513
01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:44.770
<v Speaker 5>that's a really good character.</v>

3514
01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:45.491
<v Speaker 5>He does.</v>

3515
01:32:45.491 --> 01:32:45.790
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3516
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:46.240
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3517
01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:46.630
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3518
01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:49.270
<v Speaker 5>he's just a total d bag.</v>

3519
01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.500
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3520
01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:52.473
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3521
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.823
<v Speaker 5>person</v>

3522
01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:59.040
<v Speaker 5>round to Gavin Tucker.</v>

3523
01:32:59.041 --> 01:32:59.980
<v Speaker 5>Sam Cecillia.</v>

3524
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:02.020
<v Speaker 5>Every race has d bags.</v>

3525
01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:02.920
<v Speaker 5>Every race.</v>

3526
01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:03.721
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3527
01:33:03.721 --> 01:33:04.470
<v Speaker 5>you got him here.</v>

3528
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:05.170
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3529
01:33:05.170 --> 01:33:06.260
<v Speaker 5>what's the ratio of the lease?</v>

3530
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:07.840
<v Speaker 5>Dieback I would say Canada.</v>

3531
01:33:07.841 --> 01:33:08.980
<v Speaker 5>If Canada was a race</v>

3532
01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:11.853
<v Speaker 5>race.</v>

3533
01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:12.191
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3534
01:33:12.191 --> 01:33:13.024
<v Speaker 5>I don't know many,</v>

3535
01:33:13.090 --> 01:33:14.260
<v Speaker 5>many dieback Canadians.</v>

3536
01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.770
<v Speaker 5>I would say they have the less assholes as far as countries.</v>

3537
01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.160
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the nicest country.</v>

3538
01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:22.293
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

3539
01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.350
<v Speaker 5>I would agree.</v>

3540
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:25.840
<v Speaker 5>I would say Iceland never been.</v>

3541
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:26.530
<v Speaker 5>Have you been?</v>

3542
01:33:26.530 --> 01:33:26.801
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3543
01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:27.634
<v Speaker 5>I'm just guessing.</v>

3544
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.201
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3545
01:33:29.201 --> 01:33:30.070
<v Speaker 5>there's so big.</v>

3546
01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.940
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like number one with like strong men.</v>

3547
01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:36.430
<v Speaker 5>They're like the most amount of those strong men.</v>

3548
01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:39.370
<v Speaker 5>There'd be kinky central banks out or something like that.</v>

3549
01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:41.261
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>

3550
01:33:41.261 --> 01:33:42.280
<v Speaker 5>Iceland kicked him out.</v>

3551
01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:42.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3552
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:43.000
<v Speaker 5>didn't they?</v>

3553
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.210
<v Speaker 5>They arrested like a lot of bankers.</v>

3554
01:33:45.211 --> 01:33:46.060
<v Speaker 5>I decided to just say,</v>

3555
01:33:46.061 --> 01:33:46.894
<v Speaker 5>fuck yeah.</v>

3556
01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:47.290
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3557
01:33:47.290 --> 01:33:52.090
<v Speaker 5>the revolution do that when there's 50 people and yet frozen it on a glacier.</v>

3558
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:56.470
<v Speaker 5>You're burning whale bones to stay warm.</v>

3559
01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:57.453
<v Speaker 5>That's racist.</v>

3560
01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.193
<v Speaker 5>That's racist.</v>

3561
01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:00.641
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it is.</v>

3562
01:34:00.641 --> 01:34:01.030
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3563
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:02.800
<v Speaker 5>You're allowed to make fun of white people all day.</v>

3564
01:34:02.801 --> 01:34:05.820
<v Speaker 5>Nobody gives a fuck oil show.</v>

3565
01:34:06.170 --> 01:34:06.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3566
01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:07.500
<v Speaker 5>come on through the body.</v>

3567
01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.040
<v Speaker 5>Think about Mo,</v>

3568
01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:10.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm generalizing,</v>

3569
01:34:10.391 --> 01:34:15.391
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of black comedians start off with the jokes like why people do this</v>

3570
01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.230
<v Speaker 5>and this is how white people do it.</v>

3571
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:18.640
<v Speaker 5>And then a white man would be like,</v>

3572
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.480
<v Speaker 5>but can you imagine if white comedians did that?</v>

3573
01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:23.830
<v Speaker 5>Said this is how black people are.</v>

3574
01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:25.360
<v Speaker 5>Like any joke like that,</v>

3575
01:34:25.361 --> 01:34:26.530
<v Speaker 5>they couldn't even do one of them.</v>

3576
01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:27.733
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3577
01:34:28.450 --> 01:34:31.510
<v Speaker 5>you can use a black voice every now and then in your,</v>

3578
01:34:31.690 --> 01:34:32.471
<v Speaker 5>in your routine.</v>

3579
01:34:32.471 --> 01:34:34.660
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe you have but not like in a,</v>

3580
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.550
<v Speaker 5>it's gotta be fairly positive.</v>

3581
01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:39.940
<v Speaker 5>Well one of the weirdest notions of people throwing around today is that white</v>

3582
01:34:39.941 --> 01:34:42.340
<v Speaker 5>people are the only people that can be racist.</v>

3583
01:34:42.341 --> 01:34:45.220
<v Speaker 5>Then black people can't be racist towards white people because they don't have</v>

3584
01:34:45.221 --> 01:34:46.270
<v Speaker 5>power over whites.</v>

3585
01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.990
<v Speaker 5>It is one of the most ridiculous interpretations of the Word Racist.</v>

3586
01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:51.730
<v Speaker 5>It's so fucking stupid.</v>

3587
01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:52.600
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3588
01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.460
<v Speaker 5>but it's something that people are embracing.</v>

3589
01:34:54.461 --> 01:34:56.080
<v Speaker 5>Like you look at it online and they're like,</v>

3590
01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:56.471
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3591
01:34:56.471 --> 01:34:57.710
<v Speaker 5>tell him stay woke.</v>

3592
01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:58.310
<v Speaker 5>Let</v>

3593
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:02.150
<v Speaker 2>people as they look really believing that you can't be racist and be black.</v>

3594
01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're racist towards white people,</v>

3595
01:35:03.471 --> 01:35:04.191
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't count like,</v>

3596
01:35:04.191 --> 01:35:04.371
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3597
01:35:04.371 --> 01:35:05.204
<v Speaker 2>what is it then?</v>

3598
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:07.520
<v Speaker 2>If you just don't like all white people,</v>

3599
01:35:08.010 --> 01:35:08.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3600
01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:09.440
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be racist.</v>

3601
01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:09.691
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3602
01:35:09.691 --> 01:35:09.901
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3603
01:35:09.901 --> 01:35:10.011
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3604
01:35:10.011 --> 01:35:10.281
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3605
01:35:10.281 --> 01:35:11.010
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing.</v>

3606
01:35:11.010 --> 01:35:11.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3607
01:35:11.530 --> 01:35:12.140
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3608
01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a free three stab at it.</v>

3609
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember Dave Chappelle would play the white newscaster,</v>

3610
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:22.050
<v Speaker 2>remember when men see is stolen?</v>

3611
01:35:23.190 --> 01:35:24.730
<v Speaker 2>See it literally does the same care.</v>

3612
01:35:24.970 --> 01:35:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3613
01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:25.510
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

3614
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:26.300
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

3615
01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3616
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Dave Chappelle was fucking furious.</v>

3617
01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:31.100
<v Speaker 2>She did the same character,</v>

3618
01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.830
<v Speaker 2>like literally stole the character,</v>

3619
01:35:33.831 --> 01:35:35.270
<v Speaker 2>put the wig on everything.</v>

3620
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:37.340
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that the best one,</v>

3621
01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:42.400
<v Speaker 2>the best Chappelle sketch was when Chappelle did the racist KKK guy didn't know</v>

3622
01:35:42.951 --> 01:35:44.360
<v Speaker 2>he was black because he was blind</v>

3623
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:50.510
<v Speaker 2>and KKK member who was blind,</v>

3624
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.120
<v Speaker 2>and then when it's fucking robe came off,</v>

3625
01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.720
<v Speaker 2>the guy in the audience's head exploded.</v>

3626
01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Neil.</v>

3627
01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Neil.</v>

3628
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:57.103
<v Speaker 2>Neil.</v>

3629
01:35:59.420 --> 01:35:59.721
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3630
01:35:59.721 --> 01:36:01.520
<v Speaker 2>that was the best get show of all time.</v>

3631
01:36:02.210 --> 01:36:03.043
<v Speaker 2>That's the best.</v>

3632
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3633
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:05.060
<v Speaker 2>it was the shortest running.</v>

3634
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.990
<v Speaker 2>He's only two years,</v>

3635
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:10.760
<v Speaker 2>but I think Chappelle show's the post fucking up and as a comedian man,</v>

3636
01:36:10.761 --> 01:36:14.570
<v Speaker 2>he can do sketch comedy and his comedy is fucking among the basket.</v>

3637
01:36:14.630 --> 01:36:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Some of his shit.</v>

3638
01:36:15.471 --> 01:36:17.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't get any better than that.</v>

3639
01:36:17.031 --> 01:36:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

3640
01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:18.950
<v Speaker 2>He's got so many of those bits.</v>

3641
01:36:18.951 --> 01:36:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3642
01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Classic Bitch Shit you could do right there.</v>

3643
01:36:23.151 --> 01:36:23.984
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

3644
01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:29.050
<v Speaker 2>He crushes Dave Chappelle crushes lies year after year.</v>

3645
01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.050
<v Speaker 2>He crushes.</v>

3646
01:36:30.570 --> 01:36:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Then we were watching a good fight and he walked away from everything from from</v>

3647
01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:36.133
<v Speaker 2>50 million.</v>

3648
01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you know why he too much pressure?</v>

3649
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.801
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3650
01:36:39.801 --> 01:36:40.011
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3651
01:36:40.011 --> 01:36:40.221
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3652
01:36:40.221 --> 01:36:40.581
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

3653
01:36:40.581 --> 01:36:41.930
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to change his act.</v>

3654
01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:44.270
<v Speaker 2>What was happening was he was well,</v>

3655
01:36:44.271 --> 01:36:45.460
<v Speaker 2>look at the inside of Sam's like,</v>

3656
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.920
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

3657
01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3658
01:36:46.290 --> 01:36:47.123
<v Speaker 2>it's nasty.</v>

01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:48.103
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3660
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:53.110
<v Speaker 2>what was happening was they had a DVD deal back when DVDs were real thing.</v>

3661
01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:53.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3662
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.050
<v Speaker 2>this is when you can make money selling DVDs and this,</v>

3663
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:58.423
<v Speaker 2>this deal.</v>

3664
01:36:58.430 --> 01:37:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Part of it was they wanted to change the kind of sketches.</v>

3665
01:37:02.001 --> 01:37:04.070
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want him using the word nigger anymore.</v>

3666
01:37:04.071 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 2>They wanted him to stop doing certain sketches.</v>

3667
01:37:06.381 --> 01:37:07.730
<v Speaker 2>May just clean it up a little bit.</v>

3668
01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3670
01:37:08.211 --> 01:37:09.170
<v Speaker 2>you could have it just as funny,</v>

3671
01:37:09.171 --> 01:37:12.530
<v Speaker 2>but cleaning up a little bit and Dave just recognize what was happening and he</v>

3672
01:37:12.531 --> 01:37:13.790
<v Speaker 2>recognized the compromise.</v>

3673
01:37:13.791 --> 01:37:15.740
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't want all these people telling them what to do.</v>

3674
01:37:15.741 --> 01:37:16.310

3681
01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:24.800
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

3687
01:37:34.971 --> 01:37:36.110
<v Speaker 2>show up and do gigs.</v>

3688
01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:41.380
<v Speaker 2>He would bring a portable speaker and set up in a park in Seattle and people</v>

3689
01:37:41.961 --> 01:37:43.130
<v Speaker 2>would just gather round.</v>

3690
01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:44.720
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't even let them know he was there.</v>

3691
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:47.330
<v Speaker 2>He didn't use social media who just show up and he,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Tate</v>

3850
01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:18.080

3866
01:41:40.670 --> 01:41:44.630
<v Speaker 4>It'd be real interesting to see if he incorporates a leg lock game and it's also</v>

3867
01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:47.390
<v Speaker 4>going to be real interesting to see with all the,</v>

01:41:53.901 --> 01:41:54.621
<v Speaker 4>And grappling,</v>

3873
01:41:54.621 --> 01:41:54.920
<v Speaker 4>Aria,</v>

3874
01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.390
<v Speaker 4>Eddie greasing and having an effect on leg lock games or anything like that.</v>

3875
01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:01.513
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

3876
01:42:01.610 --> 01:42:02.330
<v Speaker 8>who knows,</v>

3877
01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:03.740
<v Speaker 8>maybe who knows.</v>

3878
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:08.830
<v Speaker 8>People are complain about it or I'll know in Ebi there's a rash guard rule.</v>

3879
01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:10.140
<v Speaker 8>I don't have a title.</v>

3880
01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:11.150
<v Speaker 8>You could wear anything you want,</v>

3881
01:42:11.151 --> 01:42:11.451
<v Speaker 8>shorts,</v>

3882
01:42:11.451 --> 01:42:11.811
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

3883
01:42:11.811 --> 01:42:15.950
<v Speaker 8>But I think ultimately everyone's going to have to wear tights and rash guards</v>

3884
01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:16.551
<v Speaker 8>no matter what.</v>

3885
01:42:16.551 --> 01:42:17.690
<v Speaker 8>Just so that there is no,</v>

3886
01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:18.740
<v Speaker 8>what's the rule now?</v>

3887
01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:19.820
<v Speaker 8>Like what can you wear now?</v>

3888
01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:20.953
<v Speaker 8>You wear shorts,</v>

3889
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:22.150
<v Speaker 8>you can wear shorts anyway,</v>

3890
01:42:22.250 --> 01:42:22.970
<v Speaker 8>anything you want,</v>

3891
01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:23.690
<v Speaker 8>shorts.</v>

3892
01:42:23.690 --> 01:42:24.950
<v Speaker 8>But you know,</v>

3893
01:42:24.951 --> 01:42:29.951
<v Speaker 8>just to eliminate any possibility of gracing.</v>

3894
01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:34.370
<v Speaker 8>Now there's a lot of dangerous leg lockers out there and there's a lot of people</v>

3895
01:42:34.371 --> 01:42:35.810
<v Speaker 8>that are really concerned about them.</v>

3896
01:42:36.110 --> 01:42:36.950
<v Speaker 8>And you know,</v>

3897
01:42:36.951 --> 01:42:40.070
<v Speaker 8>I'm not saying this guy grease their legs or that guy.</v>

3898
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.821
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

3899
01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:41.720
<v Speaker 8>I'm just saying it's,</v>

3900
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:43.190
<v Speaker 8>it's really easy to do.</v>

3901
01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:44.150
<v Speaker 8>We're not checking,</v>

3902
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:44.661
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3903
01:42:44.661 --> 01:42:49.460
<v Speaker 8>so instead of coming up with this crazy ass tasks,</v>

3904
01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:51.050
<v Speaker 8>let's just make it more spazz.</v>

3905
01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:52.340
<v Speaker 8>Most people to have no problem,</v>

3906
01:42:52.341 --> 01:42:55.160
<v Speaker 8>learn spats were spats and then board shorts over it.</v>

3907
01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:56.091
<v Speaker 8>No big deal.</v>

3908
01:42:56.091 --> 01:42:57.140
<v Speaker 8>People do that all the time.</v>

3909
01:42:57.450 --> 01:42:59.540
<v Speaker 4>I just found it interesting that in Nogi those Donaher,</v>

3910
01:42:59.550 --> 01:43:00.630
<v Speaker 4>her guys weren't wearing them.</v>

3911
01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:01.111
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3912
01:43:01.111 --> 01:43:04.440
<v Speaker 4>that's really interesting cause they're all leg lock guys like Eddie Cummings,</v>

3913
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.780
<v Speaker 4>Gary,</v>

3914
01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:05.590
<v Speaker 4>Tony Choice</v>

3915
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:06.190
<v Speaker 8>you have to make,</v>

3916
01:43:06.190 --> 01:43:06.610
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3917
01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:06.820
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3918
01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:08.020
<v Speaker 8>if you're going leg locks,</v>

3919
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:10.150
<v Speaker 8>a lot of people don't.</v>

3920
01:43:10.210 --> 01:43:14.050
<v Speaker 8>They like the greasy leg war because it increases their defense,</v>

3921
01:43:14.051 --> 01:43:15.760
<v Speaker 8>their ability to pull out a leg locks.</v>

3922
01:43:15.761 --> 01:43:17.800
<v Speaker 8>If they're going to go into a leg lock paddles,</v>

3923
01:43:17.801 --> 01:43:18.121
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>

3924
01:43:18.121 --> 01:43:18.954
<v Speaker 8>they'd locked battles.</v>

3925
01:43:19.090 --> 01:43:21.510
<v Speaker 8>One little zig when you should have zagged and you know,</v>

3926
01:43:21.511 --> 01:43:23.530
<v Speaker 8>you think you're on his heel and he's got you.</v>

3927
01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:24.070
<v Speaker 8>There's,</v>

3928
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:27.940
<v Speaker 8>it's so mother crazy.</v>

3929
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:29.470
<v Speaker 8>The modern day leg lock game.</v>

3930
01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:34.120
<v Speaker 8>It's endless on its own with so endless,</v>

3931
01:43:34.121 --> 01:43:36.610
<v Speaker 8>everyone's got different styles and different paths.</v>

3932
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.530
<v Speaker 8>It's insane.</v>

3933
01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.000
<v Speaker 8>How elaborate it.</v>

3934
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Do you see a that g match between uh,</v>

3935
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Gary Tona in Aaj?</v>

3936
01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:46.141
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3937
01:43:46.141 --> 01:43:50.380
<v Speaker 8>I didn't see that carry tone and got him in this horrific leg lock and age.</v>

3938
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:51.223
<v Speaker 8>I didn't</v>

3939
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:52.311
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3940
01:43:52.311 --> 01:43:52.761
<v Speaker 1>you see it?</v>

3941
01:43:52.761 --> 01:43:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3942
01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:53.913
<v Speaker 1>Is his legs.</v>

3943
01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:59.120
<v Speaker 1>He got him in like a knee bar sideways and he had his leg bent sideways.</v>

3944
01:43:59.121 --> 01:43:59.380
<v Speaker 1>It looked,</v>

3945
01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:00.620
<v Speaker 1>it looked awful.</v>

3946
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:02.390
<v Speaker 1>See if he could find that general.</v>

3947
01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:04.013
<v Speaker 1>He didn't tab,</v>

3948
01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:04.911
<v Speaker 1>he didn't tap.</v>

3949
01:44:04.911 --> 01:44:05.760
<v Speaker 1>But John Danner,</v>

3950
01:44:05.770 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I made a whole point about how we should have tapped,</v>

3951
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3952
01:44:08.721 --> 01:44:13.721
<v Speaker 1>and he went on about how Gary tone and tapped with that flying triangle to a</v>

3953
01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:14.693
<v Speaker 1>shoe face.</v>

3954
01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:18.170
<v Speaker 1>You know when the Carl's Jr on Sug?</v>

3955
01:44:18.690 --> 01:44:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3956
01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:19.850
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

3957
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:20.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3958
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:21.981
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>

3959
01:44:21.981 --> 01:44:22.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3960
01:44:22.341 --> 01:44:23.100
<v Speaker 1>he dumped on her,</v>

3961
01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:27.470
<v Speaker 1>made this big Instagram post about how the importance of tapping and you know,</v>

3962
01:44:27.471 --> 01:44:32.270
<v Speaker 1>you see Aja not tamping while this horrific leg lock has put on them.</v>

3963
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And then Gary Tone and made a post on Instagram about how we severely injured</v>

3964
01:44:37.161 --> 01:44:37.780
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3965
01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:38.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3966
01:44:38.001 --> 01:44:40.580
<v Speaker 1>even though he won the bout and didn't get the tap,</v>

3967
01:44:40.581 --> 01:44:41.660
<v Speaker 1>he severely injured him.</v>

3968
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:44.090
<v Speaker 1>But just tap people.</v>

3969
01:44:44.110 --> 01:44:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3970
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Jesus Christ.</v>

3971
01:44:46.131 --> 01:44:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Don't let your shake get ripped apart.</v>

3972
01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:51.183
<v Speaker 1>It's up to them.</v>

3973
01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:51.711
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3974
01:44:51.711 --> 01:44:53.600
<v Speaker 1>but I mean doesn't that bother you like your,</v>

3975
01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:55.820
<v Speaker 1>your match with a boiler when you're ripping his knee apart?</v>

3976
01:44:57.230 --> 01:44:58.063
<v Speaker 1>It didn't bother me.</v>

3977
01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear it cracking and habit repin who were talking about it?</v>

3978
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3979
01:45:09.210 --> 01:45:10.370
<v Speaker 1>what did he say?</v>

3980
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:12.351
<v Speaker 1>I told him.</v>

3981
01:45:12.351 --> 01:45:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear that?</v>

3982
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:16.800
<v Speaker 1>You pull out his knee and it's,</v>

3983
01:45:16.801 --> 01:45:18.130
<v Speaker 1>it's going crack crack.</v>

3984
01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:19.273
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

3985
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:20.121
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine.</v>

3986
01:45:20.121 --> 01:45:20.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3987
01:45:20.391 --> 01:45:20.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine.</v>

3988
01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:21.561
<v Speaker 3>And then another one,</v>

3989
01:45:21.561 --> 01:45:22.394
<v Speaker 3>pop pop,</v>

3990
01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:23.233
<v Speaker 3>but what about that?</v>

3991
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:23.751
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

3992
01:45:23.751 --> 01:45:24.351
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine,</v>

3993
01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:25.184
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine.</v>

3994
01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:25.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3995
01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:26.510
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3996
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:27.343
<v Speaker 3>let's go.</v>

3997
01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Hell yeah man.</v>

3998
01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:31.483
<v Speaker 3>He didn't give a fuck</v>

3999
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:34.123
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4000
01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Apparently he never taps the leg locks,</v>

4001
01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:37.190
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

4002
01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:38.780
<v Speaker 3>So everybody that knows him,</v>

4003
01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:40.340
<v Speaker 3>they knew he wouldn't tap.</v>

4004
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:42.710
<v Speaker 3>What do you think the inside of his leg looks like now though?</v>

4005
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:48.430
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes your leg can pop and it's just like your knuckle cracking,</v>

4006
01:45:49.190 --> 01:45:50.023
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4007
01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:52.430
<v Speaker 3>because he was,</v>

4008
01:45:52.730 --> 01:45:54.020
<v Speaker 3>I think he was walking,</v>

4009
01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:55.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4010
01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.210
<v Speaker 3>after the match,</v>

4011
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:57.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4012
01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:57.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4013
01:45:57.591 --> 01:46:02.480
<v Speaker 3>he didn't seem to limp anywhere and I think he was surfing a couple of days</v>

4014
01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.313
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>

4015
01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4016
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:05.630
<v Speaker 3>so maybe it was just like,</v>

4017
01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:07.970
<v Speaker 3>it was just popping like a knuckle crack,</v>

4018
01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:09.040
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4019
01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.110
<v Speaker 1>or maybe he's just got chewed up meniscus in there.</v>

4020
01:46:11.111 --> 01:46:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Anyone.</v>

4021
01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:13.210
<v Speaker 1>It's cracker hunching around.</v>

4022
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a lot of people like that.</v>

4023
01:46:15.131 --> 01:46:16.000
<v Speaker 1>They just get used to it.</v>

4024
01:46:16.001 --> 01:46:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Like Bas Rutten is bone on bone on his knees.</v>

4025
01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.270
<v Speaker 1>He just walks around.</v>

4026
01:46:19.450 --> 01:46:19.931
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4027
01:46:19.931 --> 01:46:20.764
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>

4028
01:46:21.170 --> 01:46:21.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4029
01:46:21.731 --> 01:46:22.690
<v Speaker 1>his knees are fucked.</v>

4030
01:46:23.530 --> 01:46:24.880
<v Speaker 1>He told me it's all bone on bone.</v>

4031
01:46:24.881 --> 01:46:25.780
<v Speaker 1>He's got no cartilage.</v>

4032
01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:27.670
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4033
01:46:27.670 --> 01:46:28.570
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be so much fun.</v>

4034
01:46:28.571 --> 01:46:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Waking up every morning.</v>

4035
01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:30.453
<v Speaker 1>He can't train,</v>

4036
01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:31.533
<v Speaker 1>can do anything.</v>

4037
01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean boss Rutan,</v>

4038
01:46:33.431 --> 01:46:36.040
<v Speaker 1>former UFC heavyweight champion of the world still looks like a stud.</v>

4039
01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4040
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Can't train.</v>

4041
01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:38.433
<v Speaker 1>I can't do anything.</v>

4042
01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:42.370
<v Speaker 1>He's got one arm is one arm is all fucked up because of his impingements in his</v>

4043
01:46:42.371 --> 01:46:45.070
<v Speaker 1>neck caused severe atrophy on his right arm.</v>

4044
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:47.980
<v Speaker 1>His right arm shrunk literally to half the size of his left arm.</v>

4045
01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:49.500
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4046
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:50.610
<v Speaker 1>he can't even lift weights with it.</v>

4047
01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's up to like 10 pounds a curls.</v>

4048
01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:53.490
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of crazy.</v>

4049
01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:54.630
<v Speaker 1>You tell me.</v>

4050
01:46:54.630 --> 01:46:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Can't hold up a jug of milk,</v>

4051
01:46:56.190 --> 01:46:57.330
<v Speaker 1>like a jug of milk like that.</v>

4052
01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.380
<v Speaker 1>His arm would just fall.</v>

4053
01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Does the Interesting Fina Tyron Woodley Wonderboy too?</v>

4054
01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:06.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4055
01:47:06.981 --> 01:47:07.551
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

4056
01:47:07.551 --> 01:47:08.384
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4057
01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to see probably the same thing we did in the first one,</v>

4058
01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:12.440
<v Speaker 1>just to kind of a stalemate.</v>

4059
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that man.</v>

4060
01:47:13.971 --> 01:47:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if Woodley decides to take him down like he did in the first round,</v>

4061
01:47:17.210 --> 01:47:18.410
<v Speaker 1>it changes the whole fight.</v>

4062
01:47:18.411 --> 01:47:18.621
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

4063
01:47:18.621 --> 01:47:19.790
<v Speaker 1>but is he actually going to do that?</v>

4064
01:47:19.970 --> 01:47:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4065
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:23.390
<v Speaker 1>he just decided not to in the second fight or in the,</v>

4066
01:47:23.391 --> 01:47:24.410
<v Speaker 1>in the second round,</v>

4067
01:47:24.730 --> 01:47:26.660
<v Speaker 1>he just decided not to for whatever reason,</v>

4068
01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:31.640
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't like it wasn't available to them as it was really weird.</v>

4069
01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:32.650
<v Speaker 1>And I asked him about it.</v>

4070
01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:33.000
<v Speaker 1>He'd say,</v>

4071
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

4072
01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I've no idea why I didn't take them down</v>

4073
01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:38.433
<v Speaker 6>Kevin Tucker.</v>

4074
01:47:40.510 --> 01:47:42.550
<v Speaker 1>It just seems to me that this guy,</v>

4075
01:47:42.970 --> 01:47:44.560
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

4076
01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:46.390
<v Speaker 1>what happened in that fight?</v>

4077
01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.590
<v Speaker 1>But when,</v>

4078
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:49.570
<v Speaker 1>when Woodley took them down the first round,</v>

4079
01:47:49.571 --> 01:47:50.890
<v Speaker 1>he dominated them on the ground.</v>

4080
01:47:50.891 --> 01:47:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Just beat him up and it didn't look like wonder boy had an answer.</v>

4081
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:55.330
<v Speaker 1>It looked like he was going to get smashed.</v>

4082
01:47:55.331 --> 01:47:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4083
01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:58.870
<v Speaker 1>And then the fight change from the second round on it became a kickboxing fight</v>

4084
01:47:58.871 --> 01:48:00.010
<v Speaker 1>and Woodley's still hurt him,</v>

4085
01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:00.851
<v Speaker 1>hurt him bad.</v>

4086
01:48:00.851 --> 01:48:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And the fourth.</v>

4087
01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:03.220
<v Speaker 1>But one thing that he took away,</v>

4088
01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:07.780
<v Speaker 1>it took away a big part of the kicking game of Wonderboy cause Wonderboy didn't</v>

4089
01:48:07.781 --> 01:48:09.670
<v Speaker 1>want to kick and be ticking down by him,</v>

4090
01:48:09.671 --> 01:48:11.350
<v Speaker 1>be smashed on the ground like that again.</v>

4091
01:48:11.650 --> 01:48:16.120
<v Speaker 1>So he kept it standing and kept moving back.</v>

4092
01:48:16.121 --> 01:48:20.410
<v Speaker 1>And forth for the waste and just sorta like kinda point fighting with his hands,</v>

4093
01:48:20.411 --> 01:48:20.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4094
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:21.520
<v Speaker 1>that's what it seemed like.</v>

4095
01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:24.190
<v Speaker 1>It was more of that way that that's how he's going to win that fight.</v>

4096
01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4097
01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:25.750
<v Speaker 1>That's how everybody's going to,</v>

4098
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.370
<v Speaker 1>he has to keep my distance,</v>

4099
01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:27.940
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4100
01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:28.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

4101
01:48:28.231 --> 01:48:28.451
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

4102
01:48:28.451 --> 01:48:29.680
<v Speaker 1>his inside game isn't bad,</v>

4103
01:48:29.681 --> 01:48:31.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's the thread of the takedown.</v>

4104
01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:31.431
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4105
01:48:31.431 --> 01:48:32.470
<v Speaker 1>he's got no chance.</v>

4106
01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:33.730
<v Speaker 1>The timing of the inside.</v>

4107
01:48:34.330 --> 01:48:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4108
01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:36.010
<v Speaker 1>And the power exchange too.</v>

4109
01:48:36.011 --> 01:48:36.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean you'd think,</v>

4110
01:48:36.521 --> 01:48:37.354
<v Speaker 1>oh how,</v>

4111
01:48:37.450 --> 01:48:38.230
<v Speaker 1>how much power,</v>

4112
01:48:38.230 --> 01:48:38.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4113
01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:39.313
<v Speaker 1>tyrants got,</v>

4114
01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:39.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4115
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy could knock you out.</v>

4116
01:48:41.170 --> 01:48:42.460
<v Speaker 1>He can knock you out with Tyron,</v>

4117
01:48:42.461 --> 01:48:43.780
<v Speaker 1>could knock you out with one shot.</v>

4118
01:48:43.810 --> 01:48:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4119
01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.960
<v Speaker 1>And Wonderboy most of the time it's a bunch of shots.</v>

4120
01:48:46.961 --> 01:48:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean he can knock you out clean if he catches you.</v>

4121
01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Especially with kicks.</v>

4122
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just an interesting fight to see who makes the right adjustment.</v>

4123
01:48:56.410 --> 01:48:57.243
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

4124
01:48:57.670 --> 01:48:59.210
<v Speaker 1>That's yeah,</v>

4125
01:48:59.211 --> 01:49:00.250
<v Speaker 1>cause then they're going to go,</v>

4126
01:49:01.670 --> 01:49:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe do decision,</v>

4127
01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I would think just cause just kind of the,</v>

4128
01:49:04.781 --> 01:49:08.710
<v Speaker 1>how the style matchup is there two guys that seem like they'll end up there but</v>

4129
01:49:08.711 --> 01:49:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't see a problem with that and I think we're going to see a lot like who's</v>

4130
01:49:11.381 --> 01:49:11.980
<v Speaker 1>ever game camp,</v>

4131
01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:13.390
<v Speaker 1>game plan can really work this time.</v>

4132
01:49:14.230 --> 01:49:14.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4133
01:49:14.441 --> 01:49:15.490
<v Speaker 1>just one of the massive do it.</v>

4134
01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:16.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4135
01:49:17.630 --> 01:49:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4136
01:49:17.890 --> 01:49:19.180
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy fucking sport.</v>

4137
01:49:19.330 --> 01:49:20.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

4138
01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:21.250
<v Speaker 1>there's so many variables,</v>

4139
01:49:21.251 --> 01:49:24.340
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different ways to win and it's what makes it so exciting.</v>

4140
01:49:24.341 --> 01:49:26.470
<v Speaker 1>But it also makes it so difficult to call.</v>

4141
01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you watching certain fights like a boxing match.</v>

4142
01:49:29.621 --> 01:49:31.530
<v Speaker 1>We're watching certain boxing matches and you,</v>

4143
01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:32.870
<v Speaker 1>you know how one guy fights?</v>

4144
01:49:32.890 --> 01:49:33.101
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4145
01:49:33.101 --> 01:49:36.220
<v Speaker 1>under the guy fights so you can kind of figure out what's going to happen and</v>

4146
01:49:36.221 --> 01:49:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you'd be with reasonable certainty.</v>

4147
01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:42.460
<v Speaker 1>But with MMA half the time you don't know what the fuck's going to happen.</v>

4148
01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Like half the time the best strategy for Woodley be just to continue taking them</v>

4149
01:49:47.951 --> 01:49:48.550
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

4150
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:49.383
<v Speaker 1>Like relentless.</v>

4151
01:49:49.670 --> 01:49:50.590
<v Speaker 1>That right.</v>

4152
01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I would say shot.</v>

4153
01:49:51.490 --> 01:49:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4154
01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4155
01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

4156
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.190
<v Speaker 1>well he can knock you out too.</v>

4157
01:49:54.191 --> 01:49:56.290
<v Speaker 1>That's thing about Woodley is he can do both.</v>

4158
01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy can't do both.</v>

4159
01:49:57.671 --> 01:49:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Wonder boy can't take Tyron Woodley down.</v>

4160
01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:01.090
<v Speaker 1>He's just not going to,</v>

4161
01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:01.953
<v Speaker 1>I mean he could,</v>

4162
01:50:02.110 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 1>he could wind up on top if you know,</v>

4163
01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:08.110
<v Speaker 1>like in the first fight with we went for the guillotine was choking the shit out</v>

4164
01:50:08.111 --> 01:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>of them and somehow or another Wonderboy you got through it and it wound up that</v>

4165
01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:14.110
<v Speaker 1>w Wonderboy was on top.</v>

4166
01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:15.370
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>

4167
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4168
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.170
<v Speaker 1>But like shooting for a power double and taken down Tyron Woodley like not gonna</v>

4169
01:50:20.171 --> 01:50:20.381
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

4170
01:50:20.381 --> 01:50:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

4171
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it can happen but it doesn't seem likely.</v>

4172
01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:29.470
<v Speaker 1>What's really likely though is Woodley can take him down and what's also really</v>

4173
01:50:29.471 --> 01:50:31.920
<v Speaker 1>likely is Willie can knock him out but wonderful.</v>

4174
01:50:31.930 --> 01:50:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I can knock them out too.</v>

4175
01:50:33.010 --> 01:50:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4176
01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:33.491
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>

4177
01:50:33.491 --> 01:50:34.450
<v Speaker 1>What can knock people out?</v>

4178
01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:34.811
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

4179
01:50:34.811 --> 01:50:35.644
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

4180
01:50:35.650 --> 01:50:38.440
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have the same amount of horsepower that Woodley does.</v>

4181
01:50:39.090 --> 01:50:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Enact accuracy.</v>

4182
01:50:40.061 --> 01:50:40.930
<v Speaker 1>It's Pitts place.</v>

4183
01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Perfectly perfect time and hit you with a couple of them.</v>

4184
01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:45.610
<v Speaker 1>His striking is so dynamic.</v>

4185
01:50:45.611 --> 01:50:46.900
<v Speaker 1>He can do so many different things,</v>

4186
01:50:46.901 --> 01:50:48.220
<v Speaker 1>especially off the front leg.</v>

4187
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.120
<v Speaker 1>But Woodley's got that one punch smash power.</v>

4188
01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Like there's that,</v>

4189
01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:57.040
<v Speaker 1>that video of the fourth round or would the connects with a left hook to the</v>

4190
01:50:57.041 --> 01:51:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Chin and you see wonder boy's eyes robot back in his head and he managed to</v>

4191
01:51:01.211 --> 01:51:01.840
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>

4192
01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:03.760
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing we learned about Woodley from that far.</v>

4193
01:51:03.761 --> 01:51:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy from that fight,</v>

4194
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:06.580
<v Speaker 1>that fucking dude's got heart man.</v>

4195
01:51:06.850 --> 01:51:07.720
<v Speaker 1>He can take it.</v>

4196
01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:11.100
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he didn't tap in that gay teen like Woo.</v>

4197
01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:13.060
<v Speaker 1>That was horrific.</v>

4198
01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4199
01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:13.610
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4200
01:51:13.610 --> 01:51:14.041
<v Speaker 1>he was in it.</v>

4201
01:51:14.041 --> 01:51:16.060
<v Speaker 1>He was in a couple of real bad positions in that fight.</v>

4202
01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And you saw how tough he really is.</v>

4203
01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:18.730
<v Speaker 1>He's tough.</v>

4204
01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:19.690
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about that.</v>

4205
01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to be a matter of whether or not he can avoid the takedown and</v>

4206
01:51:24.101 --> 01:51:27.130
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he can be effective standing up and avoid the bombs.</v>

4207
01:51:27.150 --> 01:51:27.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4208
01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:30.940
<v Speaker 1>But I was impressed with Woodley's ability to fight five rounds too,</v>

4209
01:51:30.941 --> 01:51:33.190
<v Speaker 1>cause that was always the knock on him that he's so big,</v>

4210
01:51:33.191 --> 01:51:35.560
<v Speaker 1>he's so muscular that he's not going to have the endurance.</v>

4211
01:51:35.561 --> 01:51:37.650
<v Speaker 1>But he heard him in the fourth you know,</v>

4212
01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:38.001
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

4213
01:51:38.001 --> 01:51:38.351
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

4214
01:51:38.351 --> 01:51:39.184
<v Speaker 1>What's so funny?</v>

4215
01:51:40.650 --> 01:51:41.483
<v Speaker 1>He laughed.</v>

4216
01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:42.973
<v Speaker 1>We laughed.</v>

4217
01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:44.980
<v Speaker 1>The whole muscular.</v>

4219
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:47.590
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

4220
01:51:47.590 --> 01:51:48.423
<v Speaker 1>Why is it funny?</v>

4223
01:51:56.110 --> 01:51:57.310
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like it when you say that.</v>

4224
01:51:57.370 --> 01:51:57.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:31.190
<v Speaker 1>everything is like,</v>

4301
01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:33.020
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't eat now.</v>

4302
01:53:33.021 --> 01:53:36.650
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have like full range of motion with a lot of his uh,</v>

4303
01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:37.610
<v Speaker 1>exercises,</v>

4304
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.270
<v Speaker 6>former world champion and one of them,</v>

4305
01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:49.660
<v Speaker 1>he's a freak when he knocked out Nate Marquardt.</v>

4306
01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4307
01:53:50.410 --> 01:53:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

4308
01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:52.820
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

4309
01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:53.340
<v Speaker 1>That mountain.</v>

4310
01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:54.041
<v Speaker 1>There it is right there.</v>

4311
01:53:54.041 --> 01:53:56.080
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that Mark Ward is still in there swinging.</v>

4312
01:53:58.590 --> 01:53:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4313
01:53:59.080 --> 01:53:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Paul Harris.</v>

4314
01:53:59.710 --> 01:54:01.160
<v Speaker 1>He beat the shit out of Paul Harris.</v>

4315
01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.190
<v Speaker 1>That was at one 72.</v>

4316
01:54:03.191 --> 01:54:04.024
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4317
01:54:05.710 --> 01:54:07.390
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking scary man.</v>

4318
01:54:08.110 --> 01:54:09.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just so strange.</v>

4319
01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:13.510
<v Speaker 1>This sport you get to see inside of a few year period,</v>

4320
01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:18.040
<v Speaker 1>the guys rise and then complete falling apart.</v>

4321
01:54:18.170 --> 01:54:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4322
01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:19.840
<v Speaker 1>You just get to see</v>

4323
01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:26.730
<v Speaker 1>them at the peak looking their best and then you get to see them just really</v>

4324
01:54:28.931 --> 01:54:32.830
<v Speaker 1>when you just hoping and praying that they stopped doing it and it all happens</v>

4325
01:54:32.831 --> 01:54:33.760
<v Speaker 1>inside of two years.</v>

4326
01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:35.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like the music business.</v>

4327
01:54:36.190 --> 01:54:38.110
<v Speaker 1>It's worse though because they're getting beaten up.</v>

4328
01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:38.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4329
01:54:38.351 --> 01:54:38.780
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

4330
01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:39.613
<v Speaker 1>They're</v>

4331
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:41.380
<v Speaker 1>getting abused.</v>

4332
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:43.570
<v Speaker 1>That is like the music business in a way though,</v>

4333
01:54:43.571 --> 01:54:43.781
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4334
01:54:43.781 --> 01:54:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Like think of a big music act from like three years ago that you can see at the</v>

4335
01:54:48.370 --> 01:54:49.203
<v Speaker 1>Candy Club tomorrow night.</v>

4336
01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Out of all the bands get signed,</v>

4337
01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:56.650
<v Speaker 1>95% of them get dropped within by the third album.</v>

4338
01:54:56.810 --> 01:54:57.643
<v Speaker 1>They don't make it.</v>

4339
01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:58.451
<v Speaker 1>They don't make it.</v>

4340
01:54:58.451 --> 01:54:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Most bands don't make it.</v>

4341
01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Only the very,</v>

4342
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:01.420
<v Speaker 1>very few Megan,</v>

4343
01:55:01.421 --> 01:55:02.254
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

4344
01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:03.490
<v Speaker 1>it's just like MMA.</v>

4345
01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Someone was telling me about chance the rapper is that the dude's name that</v>

4346
01:55:06.701 --> 01:55:07.150
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have,</v>

4347
01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:11.230
<v Speaker 1>he's not signed to anybody is selling out gigantic arenas.</v>

4348
01:55:11.231 --> 01:55:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Technically,</v>

4349
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:12.340
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

4350
01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Technically.</v>

4351
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:13.700
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

4352
01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:14.310
<v Speaker 1>And he's got,</v>

4353
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:17.380
<v Speaker 1>he's said he's technically quote unquote at independent rapper.</v>

4354
01:55:17.530 --> 01:55:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4355
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:19.870
<v Speaker 1>So he's not technically on a record label,</v>

4356
01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:22.840
<v Speaker 1>but he's got great friends all over the,</v>

4357
01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.040
<v Speaker 1>all over the map.</v>

4358
01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Has agent is the biggest agent in the music industry or was Kara Lewis one of</v>

4359
01:55:28.631 --> 01:55:29.440
<v Speaker 1>the biggest,</v>

4360
01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.273
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

4361
01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:31.780
<v Speaker 1>he's got all the help that everyone would need.</v>

4362
01:55:31.781 --> 01:55:33.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't need the backing of a record label,</v>

4363
01:55:33.251 --> 01:55:36.610
<v Speaker 1>which was like lawyers and promotions and all that.</v>

4364
01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:37.510
<v Speaker 1>You can do it all himself.</v>

4365
01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:38.553
<v Speaker 1>So the lawyer,</v>

4366
01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:39.191
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

4367
01:55:39.191 --> 01:55:39.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4368
01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:41.710
<v Speaker 1>the record label thing is kind of useless nowadays,</v>

4369
01:55:41.711 --> 01:55:42.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4370
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4371
01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4372
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:43.663
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

4373
01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.140
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't</v>

4374
01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:44.970
<v Speaker 5>help you anymore.</v>

4375
01:55:44.970 --> 01:55:45.803
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4376
01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:46.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4377
01:55:46.810 --> 01:55:50.580
<v Speaker 5>Just so amazing change in the world with digital.</v>

4378
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:51.271
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>

4379
01:55:51.271 --> 01:55:52.240
<v Speaker 5>What happened with the,</v>

4380
01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:56.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean it started out Lars or which all rich that I say his name,</v>

4381
01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:58.500
<v Speaker 5>he saw the writing on the wall with a,</v>

4382
01:55:59.390 --> 01:56:00.450
<v Speaker 5>that Napster shit.</v>

4383
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:05.750
<v Speaker 5>He saw what was happening and he called it first and then now you're seeing like</v>

4384
01:56:06.601 --> 01:56:10.950
<v Speaker 5>the business is almost a completely different business than it was 20 years ago.</v>

4385
01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:13.500
<v Speaker 5>It's all based on live a live performing.</v>

4386
01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:14.753
<v Speaker 5>There's no money in it.</v>

4387
01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:15.001
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4388
01:56:15.001 --> 01:56:17.140
<v Speaker 5>what does a person make from record sales is nothing.</v>

4389
01:56:17.630 --> 01:56:18.463
<v Speaker 5>It's point.</v>

4390
01:56:21.330 --> 01:56:23.160
<v Speaker 5>You stars still make it.</v>

4391
01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:26.040
<v Speaker 5>They'll still make money off of albums like this.</v>

4392
01:56:26.041 --> 01:56:28.880
<v Speaker 5>Kanye West just don't fuck how much you think you makes.</v>

4393
01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:30.330
<v Speaker 5>They're filthy rich.</v>

4394
01:56:30.810 --> 01:56:31.410
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

4395
01:56:31.410 --> 01:56:32.490
<v Speaker 5>Of course it's filthy rich.</v>

4396
01:56:32.491 --> 01:56:33.990
<v Speaker 5>But is he making money?</v>

4397
01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:34.831
<v Speaker 5>You're filthy rich.</v>

4398
01:56:34.831 --> 01:56:35.664
<v Speaker 5>So that's how I'm saying.</v>

4399
01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:37.260
<v Speaker 5>Is he making money from record sales?</v>

4400
01:56:37.290 --> 01:56:39.450
<v Speaker 5>Obviously it's filthy rich because he's selling out arenas,</v>

4401
01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:41.640
<v Speaker 5>but is he making money from record sales still?</v>

4402
01:56:43.050 --> 01:56:43.883
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>

4403
01:56:45.330 --> 01:56:46.163
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense?</v>

4404
01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:46.921
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

4405
01:56:46.921 --> 01:56:48.000
<v Speaker 5>this is a boring conversation.</v>

4406
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:51.450
<v Speaker 5>I saw an article just the other day was trying to find it right now to pull it</v>

4407
01:56:51.451 --> 01:56:51.601

4408
01:56:51.601 --> 01:56:54.840
<v Speaker 5>but up it's just now saying how a lot of pop music or uh,</v>

4410
01:57:00.271 --> 01:57:01.104
<v Speaker 5>their money back.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm sure that's,</v>

4414
01:57:04.410 --> 01:57:05.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean you got to do something.</v>

4443
01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:51.270
<v Speaker 5>They're all getting back together again.</v>

4444
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:52.261
<v Speaker 5>I make money,</v>

4445
01:57:52.261 --> 01:57:52.441
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4446
01:57:52.441 --> 01:57:56.040
<v Speaker 5>Even I hear smashing pumpkins might be getting back to the original [inaudible].</v>

4447
01:57:56.050 --> 01:57:56.883
<v Speaker 5>Gotta go see that.</v>

4448
01:57:57.780 --> 01:57:58.640
<v Speaker 5>Jamesy Hahn,</v>

4449
01:57:58.770 --> 01:57:59.603
<v Speaker 5>Darcy</v>

4450
01:58:01.230 --> 01:58:04.500
<v Speaker 5>smashing pumpkins never really broke up and it's always been Billy Corrigan with</v>

4451
01:58:04.501 --> 01:58:05.370
<v Speaker 5>a different band.</v>

4452
01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:06.373
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4453
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:07.530
<v Speaker 5>So it's going to be him again.</v>

4454
01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:08.940
<v Speaker 5>So it's going to be the whole band again.</v>

4455
01:58:08.941 --> 01:58:09.561
<v Speaker 5>The original band,</v>

4456
01:58:09.561 --> 01:58:11.010
<v Speaker 5>that blue Corgan was going crazy.</v>

4457
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:12.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't know my reading propaganda.</v>

4458
01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:17.933
<v Speaker 5>He's not,</v>

4459
01:58:18.630 --> 01:58:19.051
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4460
01:58:19.051 --> 01:58:20.100
<v Speaker 5>I haven't heard that anyone can.</v>

4461
01:58:20.101 --> 01:58:21.210
<v Speaker 5>Conspiracy theorists now,</v>

4462
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:24.060
<v Speaker 5>original smashing pumpkins lineup.</v>

4463
01:58:24.090 --> 01:58:24.960
<v Speaker 5>They're all fucking nuts.</v>

4464
01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:27.720
<v Speaker 5>Guy From Blink one eight two is that you're talking about,</v>

4465
01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:28.261
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4466
01:58:28.261 --> 01:58:29.090
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm talking about,</v>

4467
01:58:29.090 --> 01:58:29.460
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4468
01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:30.480
<v Speaker 5>He's down with aliens,</v>

4469
01:58:30.481 --> 01:58:30.661
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4470
01:58:30.661 --> 01:58:31.870
<v Speaker 5>He thinks that feelings are,</v>

4471
01:58:32.210 --> 01:58:32.920
<v Speaker 5>what did he write?</v>

4472
01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:33.241
<v Speaker 5>Which one is,</v>

4473
01:58:33.241 --> 01:58:34.310
<v Speaker 5>this is Tom Delong.</v>

4474
01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.153
<v Speaker 5>He wrote a book.</v>

4475
01:58:35.450 --> 01:58:35.821
<v Speaker 5>What are you?</v>

4476
01:58:35.821 --> 01:58:36.121
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4477
01:58:36.121 --> 01:58:37.490
<v Speaker 5>He thinks that they're visiting us.</v>

4478
01:58:37.491 --> 01:58:38.730
<v Speaker 5>It's got the doc daily basis.</v>

4479
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:39.211
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4480
01:58:39.211 --> 01:58:41.290
<v Speaker 5>how about that fucking basketball player?</v>

4481
01:58:41.650 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 5>He was a</v>

4482
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.850
<v Speaker 1>basketball player,</v>

4483
01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.470
<v Speaker 1>but things to world is flat.</v>

4484
01:58:44.471 --> 01:58:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaurs aren't real.</v>

4485
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:47.350
<v Speaker 1>The unfortunate thing too is he went to Duke.</v>

4486
01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:49.780
<v Speaker 1>He went to Duke Boyfriend.</v>

4487
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.821
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

4488
01:58:51.821 --> 01:58:56.821
<v Speaker 1>Johny Hendricks barely made one 85 105.5 Lombard one 82 interesting.</v>

4489
01:58:58.270 --> 01:59:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he's thinking about going down to one 78 lumbar.</v>

4490
01:59:01.210 --> 01:59:02.770
<v Speaker 1>It looks way more fresh.</v>

4491
01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:03.611
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4492
01:59:03.611 --> 01:59:04.251
<v Speaker 1>Look in the bachelor.</v>

4493
01:59:04.251 --> 01:59:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

4494
01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:05.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to touch gloves.</v>

4495
01:59:05.741 --> 01:59:06.574
<v Speaker 1>Here they go.</v>

4496
01:59:06.610 --> 01:59:07.443
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

4497
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:09.183
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4498
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Joe Martinez instead of a w.</v>

4499
01:59:12.130 --> 01:59:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what's going on.</v>

4500
01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Buffers almost always at these events.</v>

4501
01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why buffers not there</v>

4502
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:23.390
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't seem the same.</v>

4503
01:59:23.391 --> 01:59:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I like Martinez,</v>

4504
01:59:24.321 --> 01:59:25.154
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

4505
01:59:25.610 --> 01:59:26.490
<v Speaker 1>but unless you hear</v>

4506
01:59:29.210 --> 01:59:32.970
<v Speaker 1>and you see him beat red screaming,</v>

4507
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:34.220
<v Speaker 1>nobody gets to be public buffer,</v>

4508
01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:35.480
<v Speaker 1>some shiny ass suit.</v>

4509
01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:36.433
<v Speaker 1>He gets crazy.</v>

4510
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.100
<v Speaker 1>They get to like hand tailored suits made for specific events.</v>

4511
01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Like he had one made for the UFC in New York.</v>

4512
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Like it,</v>

4513
01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:45.470
<v Speaker 1>what was it two,</v>

4514
01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:46.303
<v Speaker 1>was it two?</v>

4515
01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Was it two o to o?</v>

4516
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4517
01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:52.580
<v Speaker 1>UFC 202 and it has the date and side of it all embroidered and shit.</v>

4518
01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:54.063
<v Speaker 8>I played,</v>

4519
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:55.030
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

4520
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:57.280
<v Speaker 8>announcer like Bruce buffer slash,</v>

4521
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:59.590
<v Speaker 8>Dj and an underground fight.</v>

4522
01:59:59.790 --> 01:59:59.951
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

4523
01:59:59.951 --> 02:00:00.340
<v Speaker 8>it was,</v>

4524
02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:02.860
<v Speaker 8>it was never back down to straight to DVD.</v>

4525
02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:03.580
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

4526
02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:05.110
<v Speaker 8>but I played the ring announcer,</v>

4527
02:00:05.111 --> 02:00:07.510
<v Speaker 8>so I'm talking as the fights are going on,</v>

4528
02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:10.030
<v Speaker 8>I'm kind of a ring announcer slash commentator.</v>

4529
02:00:10.031 --> 02:00:12.490
<v Speaker 8>Slash Dj and man,</v>

4530
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.980
<v Speaker 8>it was,</v>

4531
02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:13.840
<v Speaker 8>I was horrible.</v>

4532
02:00:13.841 --> 02:00:15.010
<v Speaker 8>I was so bad in it,</v>

4533
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:19.030
<v Speaker 8>but I did just try to do what Bruce buffer would do.</v>

4534
02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:20.013
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

4535
02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:21.220
<v Speaker 8>I was like Bruce Buffer,</v>

4536
02:00:21.221 --> 02:00:24.700
<v Speaker 8>say this name and I was just basically doing terrible Bruce buffer</v>

4537
02:00:24.701 --> 02:00:27.190
<v Speaker 8>impersonations and it's so cringe.</v>

4538
02:00:28.170 --> 02:00:29.003
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

4539
02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:31.613
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

4540
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Hector Lombard,</v>

4541
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:34.231
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Hendricks,</v>

4542
02:00:34.231 --> 02:00:39.231
<v Speaker 1>four 50 54544503452 of the first round if you want to sync it up.</v>

4543
02:00:43.530 --> 02:00:44.251
<v Speaker 1>This is huge,</v>

4544
02:00:44.251 --> 02:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4545
02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Acts are just so fucking explosive.</v>

4546
02:00:46.771 --> 02:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>When you watched him,</v>

4547
02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're watching it gone about to go off.</v>

4548
02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like a championship fight and the distance that he that he can,</v>

4549
02:00:52.710 --> 02:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>he can close his insane.</v>

4550
02:00:55.050 --> 02:00:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Well the question is like how motivated as Johnny,</v>

4551
02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>like how much did he prepare?</v>

4552
02:00:59.430 --> 02:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Is He,</v>

4553
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>is he back to training?</v>

4554
02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Like real hard all the time and how much better does he feel at one of the five?</v>

4555
02:01:06.091 --> 02:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe he's just back to old Johnny Hendricks again.</v>

4556
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean he doesn't look good physically.</v>

4557
02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:14.071
<v Speaker 1>Physically doesn't look,</v>

4558
02:01:14.071 --> 02:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>it looks fat and unshaven glad you said that.</v>

4559
02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Good inside leg kick.</v>

4560
02:01:19.950 --> 02:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that and I don't mean to be an asshole.</v>

4561
02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I just want to point out not the body chamber amongst us.</v>

4562
02:01:25.201 --> 02:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4563
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I think if he shaved the hair off his GSI,</v>

4564
02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:28.933
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be saying,</v>

4565
02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4566
02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>big knee by Hendricks.</v>

4567
02:01:30.690 --> 02:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>He clipped him with that knee.</v>

4568
02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>He clipped him with that knee.</v>

4569
02:01:33.341 --> 02:01:34.174
<v Speaker 1>That was a good knee.</v>

4570
02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:36.721
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

4571
02:01:36.721 --> 02:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Johny Hendricks still in the mix here.</v>

4572
02:01:39.890 --> 02:01:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

4573
02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>

4574
02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:46.230
<v Speaker 2>You gotta remember Johnny Hendricks is a fucking hell of a wrestler and he hits</v>

4575
02:01:46.250 --> 02:01:46.940
<v Speaker 2>real hard.</v>

4576
02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Well he was at one 70 knocking people dead for a while.</v>

4577
02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:52.610
<v Speaker 2>But you haven't seen any evidence of that lately,</v>

4578
02:01:52.611 --> 02:01:53.780
<v Speaker 2>which is really interesting.</v>

4579
02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Who moved away from that left hand though?</v>

4580
02:01:55.581 --> 02:01:56.414
<v Speaker 2>He looked good there.</v>

4581
02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:57.111
<v Speaker 2>Look good there.</v>

4582
02:01:57.111 --> 02:01:58.490
<v Speaker 2>And moving away from that left hand.</v>

4583
02:01:59.130 --> 02:02:00.170
<v Speaker 2>But what Lombard?</v>

4584
02:02:00.171 --> 02:02:01.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like one fuck up.</v>

4585
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Just one fuck up.</v>

4586
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:05.330
<v Speaker 2>And you go night night</v>

4587
02:02:09.170 --> 02:02:10.670
<v Speaker 2>and he's so hard to take down.</v>

4588
02:02:10.690 --> 02:02:11.523
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4589
02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4590
02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.530
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] world champion right now.</v>

4591
02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:14.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4592
02:02:14.031 --> 02:02:15.020
<v Speaker 2>He's Judah World Champ.</v>

4593
02:02:15.410 --> 02:02:17.990
<v Speaker 2>I believe he was a silver medalist in the Olympics.</v>

4594
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:20.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4595
02:02:20.150 --> 02:02:20.960
<v Speaker 2>that's um,</v>

4596
02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Yoel Romero.</v>

4597
02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:22.551
<v Speaker 2>What did,</v>

4598
02:02:22.551 --> 02:02:22.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4599
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:24.650
<v Speaker 2>did Lombard compete in the Olympics?</v>

4600
02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:25.843
<v Speaker 2>I think he did.</v>

4601
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:27.710
<v Speaker 2>I do not think he medaled in the Olympics.</v>

4602
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:31.190
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe either way be connected.</v>

4603
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:31.791
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4604
02:02:31.791 --> 02:02:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

4605
02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Lombard is connected.</v>

4606
02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:34.760
<v Speaker 2>A big right hand over the top.</v>

4607
02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:38.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure.</v>

4608
02:02:38.650 --> 02:02:41.240
<v Speaker 2>I know Yoel Romero was a silver medal at the Olympics.</v>

4609
02:02:42.770 --> 02:02:43.340
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

4610
02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:46.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of people that believe that you'll over married through the</v>

4611
02:02:46.071 --> 02:02:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Olympics for money</v>

4612
02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.730
<v Speaker 2>lent to the huge crazy conspiracy theories.</v>

4613
02:02:51.930 --> 02:02:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4614
02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:53.473
<v Speaker 2>It's not mine.</v>

4615
02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:54.523
<v Speaker 2>CNN.</v>

4616
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:55.663
<v Speaker 2>I could be,</v>

4617
02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:56.810
<v Speaker 2>it could be the library.</v>

4618
02:02:58.010 --> 02:03:00.170
<v Speaker 2>I have to hear all these funny,</v>

4619
02:03:00.171 --> 02:03:00.441
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>

4620
02:03:00.441 --> 02:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>funny stories about is my,</v>

4621
02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>my wrestling coach.</v>

4622
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:04.480
<v Speaker 2>There are Christians was on the,</v>

4623
02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:08.570
<v Speaker 2>on the Olympic team in the World Team with Joe Warren and all those people.</v>

4624
02:03:09.050 --> 02:03:09.531
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>

4625
02:03:09.531 --> 02:03:11.180
<v Speaker 2>the like the funny shit I hear about wrestling,</v>

4626
02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:12.740
<v Speaker 2>it's just for other animals,</v>

4627
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:13.790
<v Speaker 2>the animals,</v>

4628
02:03:13.791 --> 02:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

4629
02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:15.680
<v Speaker 2>animals and savages,</v>

4630
02:03:15.710 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 2>they are savages.</v>

4631
02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:18.260
<v Speaker 2>They're the cornerstone of MMA.</v>

4632
02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:19.533
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4633
02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:24.680
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why it's like y'all Romero is so interesting is</v>

4634
02:03:24.801 --> 02:03:28.880
<v Speaker 2>because if you talk to real wrestlers about Yoel Romero and he'll tell you he's</v>

4635
02:03:28.881 --> 02:03:29.840
<v Speaker 2>just a freak.</v>

4636
02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:34.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just such an incredible athlete and we're getting him while he's still,</v>

4637
02:03:34.610 --> 02:03:36.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean he might be 39 years old,</v>

4638
02:03:36.231 --> 02:03:41.231
<v Speaker 2>but he's still able to put on shows and move like a freak freak athlete.</v>

4639
02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:42.261
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4640
02:03:42.261 --> 02:03:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Johnny with the left hand over the top there.</v>

4641
02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean that fight with Chris Weidman,</v>

4642
02:03:46.251 --> 02:03:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

4643
02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:49.490
<v Speaker 2>That flying knee.</v>

4644
02:03:49.491 --> 02:03:50.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4645
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:50.501
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

4646
02:03:50.501 --> 02:03:52.000
<v Speaker 2>he does it like nobody.</v>

4647
02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:52.421
<v Speaker 2>Like who,</v>

4648
02:03:52.421 --> 02:03:53.254
<v Speaker 2>who else?</v>

4649
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Who else fights like Kim,</v>

4650
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:56.900
<v Speaker 2>who else explodes like that?</v>

4651
02:03:56.930 --> 02:03:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Take off half your head.</v>

4652
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:59.750
<v Speaker 2>He's so scary.</v>

4653
02:04:00.230 --> 02:04:03.460
<v Speaker 2>He's so scary and just abuse.</v>

4654
02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:05.350
<v Speaker 2>So stretched stronger than Johnny Hendricks.</v>

4655
02:04:05.351 --> 02:04:06.184
<v Speaker 2>Right back up.</v>

4656
02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Good defense by Hendricks.</v>

4657
02:04:07.791 --> 02:04:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Avoiding that left hand hits him with an elbow.</v>

4658
02:04:10.190 --> 02:04:15.190
<v Speaker 2>This could be interesting if Lombard did not expect Hendricks to last and this</v>

4659
02:04:16.371 --> 02:04:20.420
<v Speaker 2>fight goes into the second and third and and Lombard starts to slow down a bit</v>

4660
02:04:21.890 --> 02:04:25.830
<v Speaker 2>and you also got to think Lombard is coming off of a devastating knockout loss.</v>

4661
02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:26.900
<v Speaker 2>You got to remember that.</v>

4662
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you,</v>

4663
02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:28.041
<v Speaker 2>who do you fight last?</v>

4664
02:04:28.041 --> 02:04:28.874
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson.</v>

4665
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4666
02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:31.280
<v Speaker 2>remember he got hit with that back elbow.</v>

4667
02:04:31.330 --> 02:04:32.360
<v Speaker 2>He got an elbow guy.</v>

4668
02:04:32.361 --> 02:04:34.820
<v Speaker 2>He got fucking hammered when he was on the ground too.</v>

4669
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:35.683
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

4670
02:04:36.170 --> 02:04:37.220
<v Speaker 2>that was a crazy,</v>

4671
02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 2>he didn't</v>

4672
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:39.000
<v Speaker 4>move for a while.</v>

4673
02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:41.720
<v Speaker 4>But then clenching with them.</v>

4674
02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:42.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4675
02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:43.710
<v Speaker 4>it is interesting.</v>

4676
02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:44.581
<v Speaker 4>It is interesting.</v>

4677
02:04:44.581 --> 02:04:46.380
<v Speaker 4>And this is like Johnny Hendricks is game.</v>

4678
02:04:46.381 --> 02:04:48.000
<v Speaker 4>Johny Hendricks is a hell of a wrestler,</v>

4679
02:04:48.670 --> 02:04:50.640
<v Speaker 4>was really good at manipulating bodies.</v>

4680
02:04:50.641 --> 02:04:52.110
<v Speaker 4>You want to play clinch with him.</v>

4681
02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:53.280
<v Speaker 4>If Johnny's healthy.</v>

4682
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:56.760
<v Speaker 4>You remember when he fought George Saint Pierre and George's could not do</v>

4683
02:04:56.761 --> 02:04:57.570
<v Speaker 4>anything with him.</v>

4684
02:04:57.570 --> 02:04:58.370
<v Speaker 4>It was just picking door,</v>

4685
02:04:58.370 --> 02:04:59.190
<v Speaker 4>Jap,</v>

4686
02:04:59.190 --> 02:05:00.000
<v Speaker 4>throwing them around.</v>

4687
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:00.151
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4688
02:05:00.151 --> 02:05:02.640
<v Speaker 4>when George was trying to hold onto a single and Johnny was like,</v>

4689
02:05:02.641 --> 02:05:02.771
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4690
02:05:02.771 --> 02:05:02.971
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4691
02:05:02.971 --> 02:05:03.804
<v Speaker 4>good luck with that.</v>

4692
02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Good luck with that leg,</v>

4693
02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:05.530
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4694
02:05:05.530 --> 02:05:07.470
<v Speaker 4>You're taking me down and was like,</v>

4695
02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to elite wrestler.</v>

4696
02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:12.240
<v Speaker 4>Like his level of wrestling when he was in his prime,</v>

4697
02:05:12.241 --> 02:05:13.260
<v Speaker 4>his level wrestling.</v>

4698
02:05:13.261 --> 02:05:16.770
<v Speaker 4>This is as good as America has to offer at many points in times like that</v>

4699
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:21.060
<v Speaker 4>beautiful trip attempt by Lombard and Johnny Hendricks makes it through.</v>

4700
02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:22.471
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

4701
02:05:22.471 --> 02:05:23.250
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

4702
02:05:23.250 --> 02:05:24.083
<v Speaker 4>Here's the other thing.</v>

4703
02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:26.130
<v Speaker 4>Hendricks looks kind of fresh here.</v>

4704
02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.260
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't look like he's tired.</v>

4705
02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:31.200
<v Speaker 4>He might've gotten in real good shape for this look.</v>

4706
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:32.430
<v Speaker 4>End of the fifth round.</v>

4707
02:05:32.431 --> 02:05:35.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean for me to know because you saw some bad fights from him,</v>

4708
02:05:35.341 --> 02:05:35.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4709
02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:39.090
<v Speaker 4>He saw some fights where he self admitted that he only train four days a week.</v>

4710
02:05:39.190 --> 02:05:39.871
<v Speaker 4>The last fight,</v>

4711
02:05:39.871 --> 02:05:40.950
<v Speaker 4>he didn't look that good either.</v>

4712
02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:41.780
<v Speaker 4>It didn't look that good.</v>

4713
02:05:41.780 --> 02:05:42.350
<v Speaker 4>Magnified.</v>

4714
02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4715
02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:43.920
<v Speaker 4>It was a real close fight.</v>

4716
02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:44.813
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4717
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:46.110
<v Speaker 4>That was a real close fight.</v>

4718
02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:47.131
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4719
02:05:47.131 --> 02:05:47.650
<v Speaker 4>that was a,</v>

4720
02:05:47.650 --> 02:05:49.200
<v Speaker 4>and he didn't make weight for that fight too,</v>

4721
02:05:49.201 --> 02:05:49.660
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4722
02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:50.260
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

4723
02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:52.140
<v Speaker 4>And that's why he's up at one 85 now.</v>

4724
02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:53.273
<v Speaker 4>Tell you what though.</v>

4725
02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:54.510
<v Speaker 4>You go back to the one,</v>

4726
02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:55.770
<v Speaker 4>the um,</v>

4727
02:05:55.770 --> 02:05:57.840
<v Speaker 4>the Johnny Hendricks at knocked out John Fitch,</v>

4728
02:05:57.870 --> 02:06:00.330
<v Speaker 4>the Johnny Hendricks at mark knocked out Marvin Kampman.</v>

4729
02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:00.631
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4730
02:06:00.631 --> 02:06:02.430
<v Speaker 4>And he was just throwing bombs,</v>

4731
02:06:02.431 --> 02:06:02.940
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4732
02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:03.271
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

4733
02:06:03.271 --> 02:06:05.580
<v Speaker 4>he like a death touch hit guys.</v>

4734
02:06:05.581 --> 02:06:08.340
<v Speaker 4>They would go flying it slide back on their heels.</v>

4735
02:06:08.370 --> 02:06:09.330
<v Speaker 4>It was weird.</v>

4736
02:06:09.390 --> 02:06:10.980
<v Speaker 4>There was a couple of knockouts that he had,</v>

4737
02:06:10.981 --> 02:06:13.720
<v Speaker 4>particularly Fitch and Kamin whereas looked like he,</v>

4738
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:15.520
<v Speaker 4>he had some super power.</v>

4739
02:06:15.810 --> 02:06:20.790
<v Speaker 4>Like he had some crazy over handling just video game shit.</v>

4740
02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:21.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4741
02:06:21.190 --> 02:06:22.830
<v Speaker 4>snap someone life from him.</v>

4742
02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:27.270
<v Speaker 4>But that's one of those things,</v>

4743
02:06:27.271 --> 02:06:31.590
<v Speaker 4>it's like I was super excited to see fade or this weekend super excited to see</v>

4744
02:06:31.591 --> 02:06:31.941
<v Speaker 4>Faye dark.</v>

4745
02:06:31.941 --> 02:06:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Cause I'm always wondering like when does a guy like that?</v>

4746
02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:37.440
<v Speaker 4>Like how much does he still have?</v>

4747
02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:38.460
<v Speaker 4>Like how much is that the,</v>

4748
02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:41.220
<v Speaker 4>how much he takes all this time off he comes back,</v>

4749
02:06:41.221 --> 02:06:42.054
<v Speaker 4>it's going to come back.</v>

4750
02:06:42.210 --> 02:06:45.090
<v Speaker 4>Just like super pumped up to fight like his fate,</v>

4751
02:06:45.091 --> 02:06:47.190
<v Speaker 4>Oregon to come back as this,</v>

4752
02:06:47.250 --> 02:06:47.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4753
02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:51.000
<v Speaker 4>this version of who he used to be or are we going to see the fade or versus</v>

4754
02:06:51.001 --> 02:06:52.890
<v Speaker 4>Maldonado that didn't look so good.</v>

4755
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.250
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

4756
02:06:53.250 --> 02:06:53.920
<v Speaker 4>he this,</v>

4757
02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:55.260
<v Speaker 4>the pictures of him with his shirt off and stuff.</v>

4758
02:06:55.261 --> 02:06:56.910
<v Speaker 4>He didn't look all that fit well,</v>

4759
02:06:56.970 --> 02:06:58.790
<v Speaker 4>he never looked all that fit but blab,</v>

4760
02:06:58.830 --> 02:06:59.220
<v Speaker 4>same,</v>

4761
02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:00.053
<v Speaker 4>worse than usual.</v>

4762
02:07:00.090 --> 02:07:02.970
<v Speaker 4>Well one thing that I saw when I saw the picture of the way,</v>

4763
02:07:02.971 --> 02:07:06.420
<v Speaker 4>and I noticed that as it looked to me like a shoulders are pretty full to</v>

4764
02:07:06.421 --> 02:07:06.691
<v Speaker 4>sounds.</v>

4765
02:07:06.691 --> 02:07:07.524
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4766
02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:10.590
<v Speaker 4>I should probably stop saying he looked strong to me is what I was getting to.</v>

4767
02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:12.300
<v Speaker 4>I you always fatal.</v>

4768
02:07:12.301 --> 02:07:13.830
<v Speaker 4>We're always carried a certain amount of body fat.</v>

4769
02:07:13.831 --> 02:07:14.640
<v Speaker 4>Never heard him,</v>

4770
02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:14.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4771
02:07:14.911 --> 02:07:17.940
<v Speaker 4>he's never ripped and he was the scariest guy alive for a while.</v>

4772
02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:22.170
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he's the greatest heavyweight of all time?</v>

4773
02:07:24.570 --> 02:07:24.871
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4774
02:07:24.871 --> 02:07:28.080
<v Speaker 4>I kind of feel like you almost have to give it to them for that era because it</v>

4775
02:07:28.081 --> 02:07:30.210
<v Speaker 4>was as someone that,</v>

4776
02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:33.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean literally I've watched the sport my entire life.</v>

4777
02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:33.821
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4778
02:07:33.821 --> 02:07:34.050
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

4779
02:07:34.050 --> 02:07:35.350
<v Speaker 4>this is the one thing I've looked to.</v>

4780
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:35.651
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

4781
02:07:35.651 --> 02:07:35.741
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4782
02:07:35.741 --> 02:07:35.900
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

4783
02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:37.870
<v Speaker 4>he was at that time.</v>

4784
02:07:37.871 --> 02:07:38.560
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

4785
02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:41.560
<v Speaker 4>since then there hasn't been a heavyweight that struck fear in and the people</v>

4786
02:07:41.561 --> 02:07:42.220
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4787
02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:43.600
<v Speaker 4>like we did maybe,</v>

4788
02:07:43.601 --> 02:07:45.070
<v Speaker 4>maybe Cain Velasquez a little bit,</v>

4789
02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:47.800
<v Speaker 4>but no one really cared for some reason,</v>

4790
02:07:47.801 --> 02:07:50.380
<v Speaker 4>even the changes kept getting injured on fortunately,</v>

4791
02:07:50.381 --> 02:07:51.700
<v Speaker 4>but when he was at his best,</v>

4792
02:07:51.701 --> 02:07:52.720
<v Speaker 4>he was as horrific,</v>

4793
02:07:52.730 --> 02:07:53.563
<v Speaker 4>so scared.</v>

4794
02:07:53.890 --> 02:07:57.940
<v Speaker 4>But I just feel like it's disrespectful to Fabrizio over doom.</v>

4795
02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.590
<v Speaker 4>Like realistically,</v>

4796
02:07:59.830 --> 02:08:00.550
<v Speaker 4>if we're looking at,</v>

4797
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:01.750
<v Speaker 4>in terms of accomplishments,</v>

4798
02:08:01.751 --> 02:08:02.830
<v Speaker 4>you have to really consider,</v>

4799
02:08:02.831 --> 02:08:04.740
<v Speaker 4>like when did Verdomme Ketchum?</v>

4800
02:08:04.990 --> 02:08:05.381
<v Speaker 4>I'll go.</v>

4801
02:08:05.381 --> 02:08:09.750
<v Speaker 4>We completely disregarding how good fade or was up until the time Verdomme</v>

4802
02:08:09.850 --> 02:08:10.610
<v Speaker 4>caught them.</v>

4803
02:08:10.610 --> 02:08:11.590
<v Speaker 4>Are we not giving,</v>

4804
02:08:11.670 --> 02:08:16.670
<v Speaker 4>doing the credit he deserves because v for receiver doom has tapped out three of</v>

4805
02:08:16.811 --> 02:08:18.010
<v Speaker 4>the greatest of all time.</v>

4806
02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:21.160
<v Speaker 4>Tapped out Nogueira tapped out fader and tapped out Kane.</v>

4807
02:08:21.730 --> 02:08:23.050
<v Speaker 4>So it's hard.</v>

4808
02:08:23.170 --> 02:08:24.790
<v Speaker 4>But then he loses the Steve Bay,</v>

4809
02:08:24.791 --> 02:08:25.900
<v Speaker 4>he gets knocked out by Steve Bay.</v>

4810
02:08:25.901 --> 02:08:30.370
<v Speaker 4>So then you want to like reestablish or reevaluate and now he's fighting a</v>

4811
02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:31.340
<v Speaker 4>desanto sign.</v>

4812
02:08:31.380 --> 02:08:31.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4813
02:08:31.810 --> 02:08:33.580
<v Speaker 4>Dos Anjos he's going to fight those Angelos.</v>

4814
02:08:34.030 --> 02:08:34.863
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4815
02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:35.860
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

4816
02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:36.070
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4817
02:08:36.070 --> 02:08:36.670
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

4818
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:37.503
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

4819
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.280
<v Speaker 4>he's beat all the best people.</v>

4820
02:08:39.281 --> 02:08:42.550
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know from presales now finding dos Anjos steep pay is finding</v>

4821
02:08:42.590 --> 02:08:46.240
<v Speaker 4>Dosantos dos Santos Santos Dosantos.</v>

4822
02:08:47.650 --> 02:08:48.483
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4823
02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:49.880
<v Speaker 4>No junior tuning.</v>

4824
02:08:49.881 --> 02:08:50.561
<v Speaker 4>Dosantos yes.</v>

4825
02:08:50.561 --> 02:08:51.130
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

4826
02:08:51.130 --> 02:08:51.963
<v Speaker 4>He's fighting.</v>

4827
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:52.541
<v Speaker 4>He's fighting.</v>

4828
02:08:52.541 --> 02:08:53.374
<v Speaker 4>Steepbank okay.</v>

4829
02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:54.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4830
02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:55.173
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

4831
02:08:56.290 --> 02:08:57.670
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be another good fight.</v>

4832
02:08:57.671 --> 02:08:58.540
<v Speaker 4>Remember that first fight?</v>

4833
02:08:58.541 --> 02:08:59.830
<v Speaker 4>The first fight was super close,</v>

4834
02:08:59.831 --> 02:09:01.090
<v Speaker 4>but it was a crazy war.</v>

4835
02:09:01.110 --> 02:09:02.020
<v Speaker 4>Who the hell out of each other?</v>

4836
02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:02.231
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4837
02:09:02.231 --> 02:09:03.064
<v Speaker 4>it was awful.</v>

4838
02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:03.640
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4839
02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:04.473
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

4840
02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:09.190
<v Speaker 4>See Johnny Hendricks looks to me way better here at one 85 then he looked at one</v>

4841
02:09:09.191 --> 02:09:10.300
<v Speaker 4>70 his last two fights.</v>

4842
02:09:10.330 --> 02:09:10.421
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4843
02:09:10.421 --> 02:09:12.250
<v Speaker 4>we just clipped him with the luck or right hand.</v>

4844
02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Pretty slick for a fat boy too.</v>

4845
02:09:15.431 --> 02:09:16.264
<v Speaker 4>And he looks good.</v>

4846
02:09:16.330 --> 02:09:17.110
<v Speaker 4>He looks good.</v>

4847
02:09:17.110 --> 02:09:17.860
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

4848
02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:19.060
<v Speaker 4>He looks down his feet.</v>

4849
02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:20.080
<v Speaker 4>He's lying to his feet.</v>

4850
02:09:20.081 --> 02:09:20.830
<v Speaker 4>He looks fit.</v>

4851
02:09:20.830 --> 02:09:21.820
<v Speaker 4>He looks durable.</v>

4852
02:09:23.470 --> 02:09:24.580
<v Speaker 4>He just looks healthier.</v>

4853
02:09:24.610 --> 02:09:24.851
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4854
02:09:24.851 --> 02:09:26.350
<v Speaker 4>he may be not look ripped,</v>

4855
02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:29.020
<v Speaker 4>but the ways performing looks better.</v>

4856
02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Like he's able to take it.</v>

4857
02:09:31.630 --> 02:09:32.190
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

4858
02:09:32.190 --> 02:09:32.590
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

4859
02:09:32.590 --> 02:09:33.790
<v Speaker 4>he's still throwing bombs,</v>

4860
02:09:33.791 --> 02:09:34.624
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4861
02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:35.920
<v Speaker 4>His reaction time looks better.</v>

4862
02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:36.720
<v Speaker 4>It looks better.</v>

4863
02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:38.370
<v Speaker 4>It looks better at 85 to [inaudible].</v>

4864
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:40.000
<v Speaker 4>Same thing I say about Calvin.</v>

4865
02:09:40.150 --> 02:09:42.280
<v Speaker 4>You look at the Calvin that fought Tyron Woodley,</v>

4866
02:09:42.670 --> 02:09:43.311
<v Speaker 4>that Calvin,</v>

4867
02:09:43.311 --> 02:09:45.940
<v Speaker 4>it didn't make weight and Calvin look tired.</v>

4868
02:09:45.941 --> 02:09:47.170
<v Speaker 4>He just doesn't look the same.</v>

4869
02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:49.240
<v Speaker 4>Then you'll get the Calvin and fought Tim.</v>

4870
02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:53.380
<v Speaker 4>The one fought Tim Kennedy was a fucking world beater man.</v>

4871
02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:57.100
<v Speaker 4>Calvin gassed alum at one 85 is a god damn world beater.</v>

4872
02:09:57.610 --> 02:09:58.780
<v Speaker 4>He looks amazing.</v>

4873
02:09:58.900 --> 02:09:59.591
<v Speaker 4>I mean his,</v>

4874
02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:01.630
<v Speaker 4>his grappling defense was incredible.</v>

4875
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:04.930
<v Speaker 4>And then he was light on his feet and his hands were flowing.</v>

4876
02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:05.891
<v Speaker 4>His Chin,</v>

4877
02:10:05.891 --> 02:10:06.724
<v Speaker 4>his iron.</v>

4878
02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:09.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean at one 85 that guy's fucking healthy.</v>

4879
02:10:09.551 --> 02:10:10.331
<v Speaker 4>And when he's healthy,</v>

4880
02:10:10.331 --> 02:10:11.920
<v Speaker 4>you get to see the real guy.</v>

4881
02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:14.380
<v Speaker 4>The real guy is super talented,</v>

4882
02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:18.880
<v Speaker 4>but we've been seeing the real guy that smothered by weight cuts,</v>

4883
02:10:18.940 --> 02:10:22.900
<v Speaker 4>like real hard weight cuts and they just take too much out of his body.</v>

4884
02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:26.110
<v Speaker 4>And I think you're seeing the same goddamn thing here right now.</v>

4885
02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:26.591
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4886
02:10:26.591 --> 02:10:27.970
<v Speaker 4>he might still lose this fight.</v>

4887
02:10:27.971 --> 02:10:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Hector Lombard still a fucking beast,</v>

4888
02:10:29.741 --> 02:10:30.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4889
02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 4>But this is to me like the best Hendricks we've seen in a couple of years.</v>

4890
02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:40.181
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4891
02:10:40.181 --> 02:10:41.920
<v Speaker 4>and this is like a competitive fight.</v>

4892
02:10:41.921 --> 02:10:42.041
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4893
02:10:42.041 --> 02:10:42.640
<v Speaker 4>he looks good.</v>

4894
02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:44.200
<v Speaker 4>Good left hand over the top.</v>

4895
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:46.360
<v Speaker 4>It's actually when his head,</v>

4896
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:48.150
<v Speaker 4>he's he and he's also a,</v>

4897
02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:52.840
<v Speaker 4>I think he's banking on the slow down cause the slow down with Lombard,</v>

4898
02:10:53.050 --> 02:10:56.050
<v Speaker 4>especially if he thinks he's got you hurt is a real deal.</v>

4899
02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:57.190
<v Speaker 4>Like with Neil Magni,</v>

4900
02:10:57.370 --> 02:11:00.370
<v Speaker 4>Neil Magni managed to survive a helacious dorm.</v>

4901
02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:01.211
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that?</v>

4902
02:11:01.211 --> 02:11:01.450
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

4903
02:11:01.450 --> 02:11:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Helacious he survived.</v>

4904
02:11:03.941 --> 02:11:04.601
<v Speaker 4>And then Neil,</v>

4905
02:11:04.601 --> 02:11:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Maggie eventually one by Tko he got on top of him.</v>

4906
02:11:07.091 --> 02:11:10.210
<v Speaker 4>He was beaten him down and Lumbar just didn't have anything left to defend</v>

4907
02:11:10.211 --> 02:11:11.044
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>

4908
02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:13.870
<v Speaker 4>So that was the second round wasn't it?</v>

4909
02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:18.700
<v Speaker 4>He almost finish him at the end of one of one of the rounds.</v>

4910
02:11:18.730 --> 02:11:19.071
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4911
02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:20.500
<v Speaker 4>And then he ended up finishing him after that.</v>

4912
02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:20.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4913
02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:21.371
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

4914
02:11:21.371 --> 02:11:25.390
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the third round that he finished him and it was just a crazy war.</v>

4915
02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:31.320
<v Speaker 4>What's going on and breaking them up morning grabbing the fence.</v>

4916
02:11:34.030 --> 02:11:36.340
<v Speaker 4>So we're in the second round.</v>

4917
02:11:36.370 --> 02:11:37.061
<v Speaker 4>Second round.</v>

4918
02:11:37.061 --> 02:11:37.841
<v Speaker 4>What's the time?</v>

4919
02:11:37.841 --> 02:11:38.980
<v Speaker 4>Did they have the time backup?</v>

4920
02:11:38.981 --> 02:11:42.760
<v Speaker 4>What do got a minute left and Lombard slowing down for sure.</v>

4921
02:11:47.470 --> 02:11:51.820
<v Speaker 4>It just seems like some of those guys that have cardio problems,</v>

4922
02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:56.050
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is related to the actual style that they fight into.</v>

4923
02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:56.590
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

4924
02:11:56.590 --> 02:11:58.030
<v Speaker 4>Ni and punch</v>

4925
02:11:59.650 --> 02:12:00.900
<v Speaker 4>the style of Lombard.</v>

4926
02:12:00.901 --> 02:12:05.170
<v Speaker 4>He's like so sprint oriented and when he has to adjust that style and then</v>

4927
02:12:05.171 --> 02:12:07.480
<v Speaker 4>become like a technical oriented fighter,</v>

4928
02:12:07.930 --> 02:12:09.100
<v Speaker 4>it's just not the same thing.</v>

4929
02:12:09.101 --> 02:12:12.510
<v Speaker 4>Like you're always on your heels in that first round and you first round,</v>

4930
02:12:12.511 --> 02:12:16.940
<v Speaker 4>you're always getting away from this just super athlete common Achoo this</v>

4931
02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:17.740
<v Speaker 4>swinging,</v>

4932
02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:18.700
<v Speaker 4>throwing lead.</v>

4933
02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:19.450
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4934
02:12:19.450 --> 02:12:22.990
<v Speaker 4>But then in the second round you get a regular fighter.</v>

4935
02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:23.853
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4936
02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:24.850
<v Speaker 4>And this is what you're seeing now.</v>

4937
02:12:24.851 --> 02:12:26.440
<v Speaker 4>You're seeing Lombard skills,</v>

4938
02:12:26.441 --> 02:12:27.850
<v Speaker 4>which are still substantial,</v>

4939
02:12:28.150 --> 02:12:31.240
<v Speaker 4>but you're not seeing any evidence of that freak athleticism anymore.</v>

4940
02:12:31.241 --> 02:12:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Now he's fallen into a rhythm.</v>

4941
02:12:33.110 --> 02:12:33.943
<v Speaker 4>So you like that.</v>

4942
02:12:34.090 --> 02:12:34.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4943
02:12:34.610 --> 02:12:34.810
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4944
02:12:34.810 --> 02:12:35.220
<v Speaker 4>but see I,</v>

4945
02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:35.981
<v Speaker 4>he's throwing that kick,</v>

4946
02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:36.470
<v Speaker 4>like that's,</v>

4947
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:38.470
<v Speaker 4>that's kicks landing and he's throwing it,</v>

4948
02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:40.420
<v Speaker 4>but he's not trying to murder you at that kick,</v>

4949
02:12:40.450 --> 02:12:41.190
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4950
02:12:41.190 --> 02:12:42.023
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4951
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:43.180
<v Speaker 4>Same with death punch.</v>

4952
02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:43.811
<v Speaker 4>It changes.</v>

4953
02:12:43.811 --> 02:12:45.640
<v Speaker 4>It all changes in that second round,</v>

4954
02:12:46.450 --> 02:12:48.100
<v Speaker 4>which is really interesting.</v>

4955
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:50.410
<v Speaker 4>Hendrick's keeps coming in with that knee.</v>

4956
02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:52.870
<v Speaker 4>It's getting close to this dude.</v>

4957
02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Lombard is going back to his corner and he looks very tired and Hendricks looks</v>

4958
02:12:56.051 --> 02:12:56.884
<v Speaker 4>pumped up.</v>

4959
02:12:56.900 --> 02:12:57.733
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating.</v>

4960
02:12:58.090 --> 02:12:59.890
<v Speaker 4>I had thought coming into this fight.</v>

4961
02:12:59.970 --> 02:13:00.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4962
02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:05.300
<v Speaker 4>this would be a fight where you know Johnny Hendricks is in a a scary match with</v>

4963
02:13:06.191 --> 02:13:10.330
<v Speaker 4>one of the most fearsome Kao Artists in the sport.</v>

4964
02:13:10.630 --> 02:13:10.871
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4965
02:13:10.871 --> 02:13:11.231
<v Speaker 4>you look at,</v>

4966
02:13:11.231 --> 02:13:13.290
<v Speaker 4>especially his Bella tour highlight reels,</v>

4967
02:13:13.291 --> 02:13:13.911
<v Speaker 4>so get that knee.</v>

4968
02:13:13.911 --> 02:13:15.500
<v Speaker 4>That was a beautiful knee by Hendrix.</v>

4969
02:13:16.570 --> 02:13:19.450
<v Speaker 4>You look at his Bella tour highlight reel back when he was marking people over</v>

4970
02:13:19.451 --> 02:13:19.990
<v Speaker 4>there like,</v>

4971
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:21.160
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

4972
02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:22.090
<v Speaker 4>everyone was afraid of him.</v>

4973
02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:22.953
<v Speaker 4>Oh my goodness.</v>

4974
02:13:23.770 --> 02:13:24.603
<v Speaker 4>He was huge.</v>

4975
02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:25.533
<v Speaker 4>He was huge.</v>

4976
02:13:25.870 --> 02:13:26.890
<v Speaker 4>And he came over here,</v>

4977
02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:28.420
<v Speaker 4>struggled a little bit at first.</v>

4978
02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:29.890
<v Speaker 4>Lost Tim Boetsch.</v>

4979
02:13:30.850 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 4>Remember that fight in a boring,</v>

4980
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:32.491
<v Speaker 2>boring,</v>

4981
02:13:32.491 --> 02:13:32.701
<v Speaker 2>boring.</v>

4982
02:13:32.701 --> 02:13:33.800
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a good fight for him.</v>

4983
02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Just didn't open up.</v>

4984
02:13:38.250 --> 02:13:39.180
<v Speaker 2>But the Henderson one,</v>

4985
02:13:39.181 --> 02:13:44.181
<v Speaker 2>the last one was the scariest lost cause he got rocked by Henderson the first</v>

4986
02:13:44.371 --> 02:13:45.540
<v Speaker 2>and Henderson rocked him,</v>

4987
02:13:45.810 --> 02:13:47.070
<v Speaker 2>took him down and held him down,</v>

4988
02:13:47.071 --> 02:13:50.760
<v Speaker 2>was beaten them up on the ground and then they had that crazy exchange or</v>

4989
02:13:50.761 --> 02:13:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Henderson caught him with an elbow to the head and dropped him off a single aid.</v>

4990
02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4991
02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:55.591
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

4992
02:13:55.591 --> 02:13:56.251
<v Speaker 2>And you remember what he,</v>

4993
02:13:56.251 --> 02:13:59.100
<v Speaker 2>his Instagram post hit American flag wrapped around him.</v>

4994
02:13:59.101 --> 02:13:59.341
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

4995
02:13:59.341 --> 02:14:00.390
<v Speaker 2>I smoked that Cuban.</v>

4996
02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:03.570
<v Speaker 2>That's so rude.</v>

4997
02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:08.010
<v Speaker 2>But it's acceptable because it's Dan had Dan Henderson,</v>

4998
02:14:08.011 --> 02:14:08.420
<v Speaker 2>he can get away.</v>

4999
02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

5000
02:14:09.050 --> 02:14:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

5001
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:10.940
<v Speaker 2>He clipped him with that right over the hopper.</v>

5002
02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

5003
02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Hendrix takes it look.</v>

5004
02:14:13.590 --> 02:14:14.423
<v Speaker 2>Looks good.</v>

5005
02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Still light on his feet.</v>

5006
02:14:17.190 --> 02:14:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Still moving and not Lombard.</v>

5007
02:14:19.711 --> 02:14:20.071
<v Speaker 2>Lombard.</v>

5008
02:14:20.071 --> 02:14:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Totally flat footed.</v>

5009
02:14:21.330 --> 02:14:25.080
<v Speaker 2>And the more Hendricks does this to them and feints him and gets him to react</v>

5010
02:14:25.081 --> 02:14:25.860
<v Speaker 2>and move,</v>

5011
02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:28.020
<v Speaker 2>the more it keeps Lombard from recovering.</v>

5012
02:14:28.050 --> 02:14:29.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's around a piece,</v>

5013
02:14:29.041 --> 02:14:29.874
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5014
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

5015
02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:30.540
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

5016
02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a good score.</v>

5017
02:14:34.650 --> 02:14:35.281
<v Speaker 2>Two rounds.</v>

5018
02:14:35.281 --> 02:14:36.810
<v Speaker 2>The first one I'd say around a piece.</v>

5019
02:14:36.811 --> 02:14:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5020
02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:40.920
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Johnny's looking better right now than he did last time.</v>

5021
02:14:40.921 --> 02:14:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Could you give the last round to Lombard?</v>

5022
02:14:43.190 --> 02:14:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible not that you were given the last round of Hendrix?</v>

5023
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:46.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5024
02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:47.191
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking.</v>

5025
02:14:47.191 --> 02:14:48.024
<v Speaker 2>Could you,</v>

5026
02:14:48.570 --> 02:14:49.410
<v Speaker 2>is it possible?</v>

5027
02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:50.303
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

5028
02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:51.660
<v Speaker 2>So the last one,</v>

5029
02:14:51.661 --> 02:14:53.160
<v Speaker 2>you feel pretty clearly went to Hendricks?</v>

5030
02:14:53.161 --> 02:14:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5031
02:14:53.670 --> 02:14:55.110
<v Speaker 2>The first round you said went to Lombard?</v>

5032
02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:56.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5033
02:14:58.020 --> 02:14:58.853
<v Speaker 2>not by much.</v>

5034
02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I've been mostly talking shit.</v>

5035
02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:02.473
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5036
02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:06.513
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

5037
02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Lombard throws what you would call short kicks cause it's shortly.</v>

5038
02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5039
02:15:15.410 --> 02:15:18.290
<v Speaker 2>But some guys that have short legs can extend.</v>

5040
02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:19.970
<v Speaker 2>He throws the same way.</v>

5041
02:15:19.971 --> 02:15:21.110
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about how he,</v>

5042
02:15:21.111 --> 02:15:22.670
<v Speaker 2>like when he does his weightlifting,</v>

5043
02:15:22.730 --> 02:15:25.100
<v Speaker 2>he has like short extensions just like,</v>

5044
02:15:25.101 --> 02:15:25.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5045
02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:26.091
<v Speaker 2>Do you think he does that?</v>

5046
02:15:26.091 --> 02:15:29.300
<v Speaker 2>So we can be powerful and like little short punches in short bursts.</v>

5047
02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:31.010
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

5048
02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if there's like a theory to that,</v>

5049
02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:33.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5050
02:15:33.570 --> 02:15:34.430
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate fighter,</v>

5051
02:15:34.431 --> 02:15:35.750
<v Speaker 2>how they have two rounds into the,</v>

5052
02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:38.240
<v Speaker 2>if it's too high.</v>

5053
02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5054
02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:39.470
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

5055
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:40.330
<v Speaker 2>Lumbar Turret.</v>

5056
02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5057
02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:42.660
<v Speaker 2>What do you guys feel about that?</v>

5058
02:15:42.970 --> 02:15:43.803
<v Speaker 2>Which one?</v>

5059
02:15:44.190 --> 02:15:45.410
<v Speaker 2>A tie after a third.</v>

5060
02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:46.500
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

5061
02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Just like the ultimate fighter.</v>

5062
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5063
02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Saw bad idea.</v>

5064
02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Would it push the fighters more?</v>

5065
02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:52.093
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5066
02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:53.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5067
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that it would a little bit.</v>

5068
02:15:55.210 --> 02:15:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5069
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.821
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

5070
02:15:55.821 --> 02:15:56.654
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5071
02:15:57.520 --> 02:15:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Give me more time.</v>

5072
02:15:58.260 --> 02:16:03.260
<v Speaker 2>And he would also like maybe reserve a little in the tank and be Johnny keeps</v>

5073
02:16:03.381 --> 02:16:04.700
<v Speaker 2>hitting him with that left knee man.</v>

5074
02:16:04.710 --> 02:16:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5075
02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.440
<v Speaker 2>he's hurting with that left knee.</v>

5076
02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:08.720
<v Speaker 2>He sees an opening every time lumbar,</v>

5077
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:09.201
<v Speaker 2>lumbar,</v>

5078
02:16:09.201 --> 02:16:12.260
<v Speaker 2>it's closing in and now Lombard is very flat footed.</v>

5079
02:16:12.590 --> 02:16:15.050
<v Speaker 2>You really need to win that first round,</v>

5080
02:16:15.051 --> 02:16:15.680
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5081
02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:16.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5082
02:16:16.540 --> 02:16:18.500
<v Speaker 2>At first round becomes very important.</v>

5083
02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:19.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5084
02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:20.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5085
02:16:20.781 --> 02:16:21.980
<v Speaker 2>When it's too round fight,</v>

5086
02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:23.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5087
02:16:23.811 --> 02:16:28.640
<v Speaker 2>they always used to do that in k one and in glory they do it to like in that</v>

5088
02:16:28.641 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy one</v>

5089
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:32.550
<v Speaker 1>night we're Joe Schilling the same way.</v>

5090
02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:33.493
<v Speaker 1>That pattern,</v>

5091
02:16:33.550 --> 02:16:37.360
<v Speaker 1>how do I get one night Joe Schilling at three fights in one night and glory last</v>

5092
02:16:37.361 --> 02:16:38.170
<v Speaker 1>man standing.</v>

5093
02:16:38.170 --> 02:16:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking crazy.</v>

5094
02:16:40.210 --> 02:16:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It was so much fun to watch.</v>

5095
02:16:41.410 --> 02:16:44.180
<v Speaker 1>It was so crazy in front row,</v>

5096
02:16:44.181 --> 02:16:45.740
<v Speaker 1>like Ah,</v>

5097
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:51.150
<v Speaker 1>and he got dropped in like the first or second round of his first fight and then</v>

5098
02:16:51.311 --> 02:16:56.311
<v Speaker 1>he comes back and knock Simon Marcus out cold in the fourth after they had gone</v>

5099
02:16:56.381 --> 02:16:58.870
<v Speaker 1>to war for three rounds and made them fight another round.</v>

5100
02:16:58.871 --> 02:17:00.130
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

5101
02:17:00.690 --> 02:17:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was,</v>

5102
02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:06.420
<v Speaker 1>and then he fought again and then he fought again on the same night.</v>

5103
02:17:08.170 --> 02:17:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean how the fuck is that legal</v>

5104
02:17:12.570 --> 02:17:14.810
<v Speaker 1>hell sanction that it was fucking,</v>

5105
02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:15.160
<v Speaker 1>cause he,</v>

5106
02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:17.590
<v Speaker 1>he had how many rounds of that and yeah,</v>

5107
02:17:17.591 --> 02:17:17.981
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

5108
02:17:17.981 --> 02:17:20.260
<v Speaker 1>he got dropped in like the very first round or something like that.</v>

5109
02:17:20.261 --> 02:17:20.441
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

5110
02:17:20.441 --> 02:17:21.070
<v Speaker 1>if he was in,</v>

5111
02:17:21.070 --> 02:17:21.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5112
02:17:21.311 --> 02:17:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I think he fought 10 rounds.</v>

5113
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:24.260
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

5114
02:17:24.430 --> 02:17:25.670
<v Speaker 1>he fought 10 rounds in a night.</v>

5115
02:17:25.671 --> 02:17:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Was kickboxing heavy,</v>

5116
02:17:26.981 --> 02:17:27.880
<v Speaker 1>heavy shit right there.</v>

5117
02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

5118
02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:29.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5119
02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.310
<v Speaker 1>they were all three round fights,</v>

5120
02:17:30.311 --> 02:17:30.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5121
02:17:30.710 --> 02:17:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Or anything.</v>

5122
02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Item 11 where they thrive.</v>

5123
02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:34.630
<v Speaker 1>They weren't too round pilots.</v>

5124
02:17:34.650 --> 02:17:36.640
<v Speaker 1>They didn't make them two round fights in the semis.</v>

5125
02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:37.150
<v Speaker 1>They were three.</v>

5126
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:39.220
<v Speaker 1>There were three rounds and he fought one,</v>

5127
02:17:39.221 --> 02:17:39.790
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

5128
02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:43.300
<v Speaker 1>So one four because they went three with Simon Marcus.</v>

5129
02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:45.580
<v Speaker 1>You had the final with Artem,</v>

5130
02:17:45.730 --> 02:17:46.131
<v Speaker 1>but then you,</v>

5131
02:17:46.131 --> 02:17:46.631
<v Speaker 1>he fought like,</v>

5132
02:17:46.631 --> 02:17:47.830
<v Speaker 1>who did you fight in between Gan,</v>

5133
02:17:47.831 --> 02:17:49.750
<v Speaker 1>that knee that Hendrix caught him with that.</v>

5134
02:17:50.140 --> 02:17:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Look at that his head and let another one.</v>

5135
02:17:51.460 --> 02:17:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5136
02:17:52.311 --> 02:17:53.230
<v Speaker 1>he got tripped.</v>

5137
02:17:53.770 --> 02:17:54.700
<v Speaker 1>You got tripped.</v>

5138
02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how quick he can get up.</v>

5139
02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:56.291
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5140
02:17:56.291 --> 02:17:57.124
<v Speaker 1>he's just getting up.</v>

5141
02:17:57.160 --> 02:17:58.870
<v Speaker 1>He just got right the fuck up.</v>

5142
02:17:59.080 --> 02:17:59.711
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5143
02:17:59.711 --> 02:18:00.700
<v Speaker 1>He just got up.</v>

5144
02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.170
<v Speaker 1>He gave up his back.</v>

5145
02:18:02.171 --> 02:18:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Everything he knew.</v>

5146
02:18:03.341 --> 02:18:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Lombard was tired.</v>

5147
02:18:04.261 --> 02:18:05.230
<v Speaker 1>It slipped right off.</v>

5148
02:18:05.231 --> 02:18:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Slipped right off.</v>

5149
02:18:07.710 --> 02:18:08.470
<v Speaker 1>There's your argument,</v>

5150
02:18:08.470 --> 02:18:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Eddie right there.</v>

5151
02:18:11.170 --> 02:18:12.190
<v Speaker 1>It totally makes sense.</v>

5152
02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:15.940
<v Speaker 1>You want to promote offense on the ground?</v>

5153
02:18:15.941 --> 02:18:16.774
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion.</v>

5154
02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:17.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a cheap,</v>

5155
02:18:17.530 --> 02:18:19.180
<v Speaker 1>that would be the smart business.</v>

5156
02:18:19.181 --> 02:18:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Move Lombard's till closing in.</v>

5157
02:18:26.290 --> 02:18:27.123
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

5158
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Johnny's finally tired.</v>

5159
02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:30.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5160
02:18:30.441 --> 02:18:31.730
<v Speaker 1>they're both tired right now,</v>

5161
02:18:31.731 --> 02:18:32.201
<v Speaker 1>but lumbar,</v>

5162
02:18:32.201 --> 02:18:33.440
<v Speaker 1>it seems like he's a little fresher.</v>

5163
02:18:33.441 --> 02:18:34.250
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden.</v>

5164
02:18:34.250 --> 02:18:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I think he smells blood.</v>

5165
02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:35.391
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

5166
02:18:35.391 --> 02:18:37.130
<v Speaker 1>That front kick to the body and again.</v>

5167
02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:38.853
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

5168
02:18:40.450 --> 02:18:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

5169
02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:42.220
<v Speaker 1>That kick to the body.</v>

5170
02:18:42.670 --> 02:18:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

5171
02:18:43.450 --> 02:18:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Lombard looks much better now.</v>

5172
02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

5173
02:18:46.810 --> 02:18:47.201
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5174
02:18:47.201 --> 02:18:48.460
<v Speaker 1>nice leg kick by Johnny.</v>

5175
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.760
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

5176
02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:51.593
<v Speaker 1>10 seconds.</v>

5177
02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:52.411
<v Speaker 1>10 seconds.</v>

5178
02:18:52.411 --> 02:18:53.400
<v Speaker 1>What happens now?</v>

5179
02:18:56.130 --> 02:18:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5180
02:18:57.600 --> 02:18:58.433
<v Speaker 1>He hurt his hand.</v>

5181
02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:03.291
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5182
02:19:03.291 --> 02:19:04.130
<v Speaker 1>He broke his hand.</v>

5183
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:07.730
<v Speaker 1>He might've broke his hand with that one punchy through or just sprained his</v>

5184
02:19:07.731 --> 02:19:08.564
<v Speaker 1>wrist.</v>

5185
02:19:10.610 --> 02:19:11.550
<v Speaker 1>He's had carpal tunnel.</v>

5186
02:19:11.730 --> 02:19:12.563
<v Speaker 1>You ever done?</v>

5187
02:19:14.450 --> 02:19:15.480
<v Speaker 1>It is possible.</v>

5188
02:19:15.930 --> 02:19:16.763
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

5189
02:19:17.420 --> 02:19:18.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5190
02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:20.820
<v Speaker 1>That's going to sway the judges decision.</v>

5191
02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5192
02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:22.080
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

5193
02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean what did he really do mean?</v>

5194
02:19:24.031 --> 02:19:25.950
<v Speaker 1>He hit him with a couple of good body kicks,</v>

5195
02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 1>but then the hand,</v>

5196
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the hand getting broken.</v>

5197
02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:30.291
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

5198
02:19:30.291 --> 02:19:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's nothing you can do about that.</v>

5199
02:19:31.850 --> 02:19:31.971
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5200
02:19:31.971 --> 02:19:32.271
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

5201
02:19:32.271 --> 02:19:35.930
<v Speaker 2>but still like in around he has,</v>

5202
02:19:36.140 --> 02:19:37.520
<v Speaker 2>he broke his rest.</v>

5203
02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:39.740
<v Speaker 2>He got hurt at the end.</v>

5204
02:19:40.130 --> 02:19:40.963
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5205
02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:42.680
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of like,</v>

5206
02:19:42.890 --> 02:19:43.161
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5207
02:19:43.161 --> 02:19:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that would mess with you.</v>

5208
02:19:44.470 --> 02:19:44.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5209
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:45.170
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5210
02:19:45.170 --> 02:19:47.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to have anything to do with the judging the end of that fight the</v>

5211
02:19:47.481 --> 02:19:48.070
<v Speaker 2>way it looks.</v>

5212
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.340
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5213
02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5214
02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I think if we were really going to judge it,</v>

5215
02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:53.660
<v Speaker 2>oh you mean him running around at the very end?</v>

5216
02:19:53.810 --> 02:19:55.040
<v Speaker 2>We would have to push it,</v>

5217
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.480
<v Speaker 2>push it,</v>

5218
02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:56.780
<v Speaker 2>push it one way or the other.</v>

5219
02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:00.050
<v Speaker 2>You know that ending ending with the wrist.</v>

5220
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:01.101
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

5221
02:20:01.101 --> 02:20:02.570
<v Speaker 2>You really remember the first round,</v>

5222
02:20:02.571 --> 02:20:03.404
<v Speaker 2>clearly.</v>

5223
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:05.360
<v Speaker 2>I remember moments in a second.</v>

5224
02:20:05.361 --> 02:20:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I think you're taking down once that method that you,</v>

5225
02:20:08.421 --> 02:20:12.110
<v Speaker 2>you were doing when you were doing it for the UFC where you were the unofficial</v>

5226
02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Harold Letterman for the UFC.</v>

5227
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.863
<v Speaker 2>That was great.</v>

5228
02:20:15.020 --> 02:20:15.853
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>

5229
02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:18.070
<v Speaker 2>And you had a really good point to it and you,</v>

5230
02:20:18.071 --> 02:20:20.900
<v Speaker 2>it helped me because you would like quantify it.</v>

5231
02:20:20.901 --> 02:20:21.261
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

5232
02:20:21.261 --> 02:20:22.400
<v Speaker 2>why did you give it to that guy?</v>

5233
02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:23.031
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

5234
02:20:23.031 --> 02:20:26.630
<v Speaker 2>well he got the two takedowns but he hurt him with the leg kicks and hit him</v>

5235
02:20:26.631 --> 02:20:27.021
<v Speaker 2>with a punch.</v>

5236
02:20:27.021 --> 02:20:27.380
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

5237
02:20:27.380 --> 02:20:27.561
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5238
02:20:27.561 --> 02:20:27.801
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5239
02:20:27.801 --> 02:20:28.440
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

5240
02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I just felt like that matter more.</v>

5241
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Got to take notes.</v>

5242
02:20:31.310 --> 02:20:32.180
<v Speaker 2>You've got a whole system.</v>

5243
02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:34.690
<v Speaker 2>If you're going on air to give your</v>

5244
02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:38.990
<v Speaker 2>analysis of the fight,</v>

5245
02:20:38.991 --> 02:20:39.860
<v Speaker 2>you gotta know your Shit.</v>

5246
02:20:39.861 --> 02:20:40.700
<v Speaker 2>So it was really good.</v>

5247
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:42.110
<v Speaker 2>You should do that again man.</v>

5248
02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:42.891
<v Speaker 2>If they had like,</v>

5249
02:20:42.891 --> 02:20:44.630
<v Speaker 2>you know when the HBO boxing going to be,</v>

5250
02:20:44.660 --> 02:20:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5251
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:48.380
<v Speaker 2>you know Eddie Bravo is breakdown and blah blah blah and have all your little</v>

5252
02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:49.310
<v Speaker 2>number at,</v>

5253
02:20:49.430 --> 02:20:50.570
<v Speaker 2>you'll have a fucking little chart,</v>

5254
02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:51.890
<v Speaker 2>but the way you wrote it down,</v>

5255
02:20:51.891 --> 02:20:53.720
<v Speaker 2>was he the way he did it was really good.</v>

5256
02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:54.400
<v Speaker 2>The hologram,</v>

5257
02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:55.490
<v Speaker 2>a good system.</v>

5258
02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:59.140
<v Speaker 2>I feel like Johnny Hendricks might have this barely paid attention.</v>

5259
02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.983
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

5260
02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:02.173
<v Speaker 2>I'm just over here.</v>

5261
02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:08.080
<v Speaker 2>My unofficial take on the official take big rig I where I see,</v>

5262
02:21:08.931 --> 02:21:09.351
<v Speaker 2>I told you,</v>

5263
02:21:09.351 --> 02:21:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I know motherfuckers doubt me.</v>

5264
02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how it's going.</v>

5265
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:17.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any idea,</v>

5266
02:21:17.001 --> 02:21:19.190
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like Hendrix look better in this fight.</v>

5267
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Then he has an a long time and even really know after the fight he looks way</v>

5268
02:21:22.971 --> 02:21:23.804
<v Speaker 2>fresher.</v>

5269
02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Fuck weight cutting man.</v>

5270
02:21:26.330 --> 02:21:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Is One 35 a possibility for you if,</v>

5271
02:21:28.970 --> 02:21:32.000
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah dude.</v>

5272
02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:32.631
<v Speaker 2>I mean for real,</v>

5273
02:21:32.631 --> 02:21:36.560
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the solution because you imagine someone's going to Photoshop your</v>

5274
02:21:36.561 --> 02:21:37.580
<v Speaker 2>face on a guy like</v>

5275
02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:40.160
<v Speaker 2>hurting from weight,</v>

5276
02:21:40.161 --> 02:21:41.650
<v Speaker 2>cutting the fuck wait,</v>

5277
02:21:41.651 --> 02:21:42.770
<v Speaker 2>cutting Photoshop,</v>

5278
02:21:42.771 --> 02:21:43.101
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

5279
02:21:43.101 --> 02:21:43.490
<v Speaker 2>get on it.</v>

5280
02:21:43.490 --> 02:21:44.031
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

5281
02:21:44.031 --> 02:21:46.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard for me to make one 25 right.</v>

5282
02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:47.960
<v Speaker 2>But I know he shuts down.</v>

5283
02:21:48.860 --> 02:21:49.850
<v Speaker 2>You can actually do it,</v>

5284
02:21:49.851 --> 02:21:53.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's obviously vastly healthier to not do it.</v>

5285
02:21:53.750 --> 02:21:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5286
02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Because when you don't do it,</v>

5287
02:21:55.131 --> 02:21:56.000
<v Speaker 2>you don't have these issues.</v>

5288
02:21:56.001 --> 02:21:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5289
02:21:56.660 --> 02:22:00.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't ever get like up to a point where you can't swallow food or any of</v>

5290
02:22:00.111 --> 02:22:00.231
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

5291
02:22:00.231 --> 02:22:01.220
<v Speaker 2>This is all I used to.</v>

5292
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:03.740
<v Speaker 2>But then after I got sick in Ireland,</v>

5293
02:22:03.741 --> 02:22:04.574
<v Speaker 2>that went away.</v>

5294
02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:06.910
<v Speaker 2>But I still gotta I gotta get that in a minute.</v>

5295
02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Getting sick in Ireland cured it.</v>

5296
02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:10.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5297
02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:10.621
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5298
02:22:10.621 --> 02:22:11.390
<v Speaker 2>He went away.</v>

5299
02:22:11.390 --> 02:22:12.021
<v Speaker 2>It just stopped.</v>

5300
02:22:12.021 --> 02:22:13.010
<v Speaker 2>It just stopped happening.</v>

5301
02:22:13.011 --> 02:22:13.840
<v Speaker 2>As bad as it was,</v>

5302
02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:18.840
<v Speaker 2>because for whatever reason I'd have that seizing up my esophagus and I would</v>

5303
02:22:19.220 --> 02:22:23.030
<v Speaker 2>either pass out and throw up or I would just feel like I'm going to pass out and</v>

5304
02:22:23.031 --> 02:22:26.100
<v Speaker 2>then my throwing up would last like an hour to</v>

5305
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:26.880
<v Speaker 1>a couple of days.</v>

5306
02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:27.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

5307
02:22:27.601 --> 02:22:27.931
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

5308
02:22:27.931 --> 02:22:28.171
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

5309
02:22:28.171 --> 02:22:28.741
<v Speaker 1>that's horrible.</v>

5310
02:22:28.741 --> 02:22:29.700
<v Speaker 1>They had no idea.</v>

5311
02:22:29.701 --> 02:22:29.911
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

5312
02:22:29.911 --> 02:22:30.091
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5313
02:22:30.091 --> 02:22:30.391
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

5314
02:22:30.391 --> 02:22:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking under the good shape.</v>

5315
02:22:31.441 --> 02:22:31.951
<v Speaker 1>I need to fight,</v>

5316
02:22:31.951 --> 02:22:32.970
<v Speaker 1>so let's do it.</v>

5317
02:22:33.690 --> 02:22:34.520
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

5318
02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I bet she's fucking a long time.</v>

5319
02:22:36.390 --> 02:22:37.223
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

5320
02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:38.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5321
02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:42.030
<v Speaker 1>I need to just feel better eventually cause this isn't working out.</v>

5322
02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking killing me.</v>

5323
02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:45.870
<v Speaker 1>How many times have you competed at band point?</v>

5324
02:22:46.530 --> 02:22:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5325
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.640
<v Speaker 1>a bunch.</v>

5326
02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:48.330
<v Speaker 1>A bunch.</v>

5327
02:22:48.330 --> 02:22:49.020
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

5328
02:22:49.020 --> 02:22:51.250
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel different in flyweight bantamweight?</v>

5329
02:22:51.650 --> 02:22:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5330
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:53.160
<v Speaker 1>no means are just bigger than me.</v>

5331
02:22:53.161 --> 02:22:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the big of a frame,</v>

5332
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:55.890
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

5333
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:57.463
<v Speaker 1>I just want to fight.</v>

5334
02:22:57.540 --> 02:23:00.330
<v Speaker 1>But how did you feel like physically while you're competing?</v>

5335
02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:00.981
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5336
02:23:00.981 --> 02:23:01.960
<v Speaker 1>did you feel different?</v>

5337
02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:02.371
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5338
02:23:02.371 --> 02:23:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I felt fine.</v>

5339
02:23:02.850 --> 02:23:04.860
<v Speaker 1>So at one 25 you were feeling fine as well,</v>

5340
02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:07.590
<v Speaker 1>like when you've made weight and been able to find them been healthy?</v>

5341
02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5342
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's potentially that as you get older you've just done it too many</v>

5343
02:23:11.281 --> 02:23:11.820
<v Speaker 1>times?</v>

5344
02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Just cut way too many times.</v>

5345
02:23:13.291 --> 02:23:14.340
<v Speaker 1>You're body's starting to reject it.</v>

5346
02:23:14.370 --> 02:23:15.330
<v Speaker 1>That could be it too.</v>

5347
02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5348
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing this my fucking whole life.</v>

5349
02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:19.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5350
02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:20.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5351
02:23:20.061 --> 02:23:20.400
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>

5352
02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I've finally got it figured out where it's easy,</v>

5353
02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:25.920
<v Speaker 1>where I spent the last half of my life doing it in a really negative,</v>

5354
02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:27.150
<v Speaker 1>harmful way to my body.</v>

5355
02:23:27.151 --> 02:23:27.511
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>

5356
02:23:27.511 --> 02:23:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it also is to,</v>

5357
02:23:28.651 --> 02:23:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I think you're probably tougher and you get,</v>

5358
02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:35.850
<v Speaker 1>as you get older and you get like more accepting of pain,</v>

5359
02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:36.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5360
02:23:36.481 --> 02:23:37.500
<v Speaker 1>you find that a lot.</v>

5361
02:23:37.501 --> 02:23:39.510
<v Speaker 1>And like older fighters in particular,</v>

5362
02:23:39.511 --> 02:23:40.800
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of them are like,</v>

5363
02:23:40.801 --> 02:23:42.930
<v Speaker 1>like Randy coture like late in his age,</v>

5364
02:23:43.320 --> 02:23:47.550
<v Speaker 1>he was just so tough because he had experienced so much shit had been through so</v>

5365
02:23:47.551 --> 02:23:50.730
<v Speaker 1>much shit he had been through and his mind was so fucking strong.</v>

5366
02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:51.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5367
02:23:51.491 --> 02:23:53.250
<v Speaker 1>like Randy coture dude,</v>

5368
02:23:53.251 --> 02:23:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he beat Tim Silvia and nobody gave him a God damn chance.</v>

5369
02:23:56.431 --> 02:23:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gave him a chance.</v>

5370
02:23:57.511 --> 02:23:59.730
<v Speaker 1>He was fighting the heavyweight champ who was a giant.</v>

5371
02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:00.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5372
02:24:00.361 --> 02:24:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Tim Sylvia is a huge man and Randy [inaudible] seven,</v>

5373
02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:04.201
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

5374
02:24:04.201 --> 02:24:04.680
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

5375
02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:05.251
<v Speaker 1>some shit like that.</v>

5376
02:24:05.251 --> 02:24:05.680
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>

5377
02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:06.513
<v Speaker 1>he's almost,</v>

5378
02:24:06.690 --> 02:24:06.991
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5379
02:24:06.991 --> 02:24:08.310
<v Speaker 1>he's gotta be in that range.</v>

5380
02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:09.061
<v Speaker 1>I said giant.</v>

5381
02:24:09.061 --> 02:24:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Tim was huge.</v>

5382
02:24:10.410 --> 02:24:15.410
<v Speaker 1>And Randy hops in with an inside leg kick fake to an overhand bomb and just</v>

5383
02:24:16.891 --> 02:24:19.410
<v Speaker 1>drops the hammer on Tim Silvia knocks them down.</v>

5384
02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

5385
02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5386
02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Which Eddie,</v>

5387
02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:25.440
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about older fighters that are just tough guys like hen,</v>

5388
02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:30.500
<v Speaker 1>like Dan Henderson is some older dudes that are just so fucking tough that I'm</v>

5389
02:24:31.771 --> 02:24:33.210
<v Speaker 1>wondering if like,</v>

5390
02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:37.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe your weight cut is easier just because your mind is different now.</v>

5391
02:24:37.770 --> 02:24:38.551
<v Speaker 1>You know that you're just,</v>

5392
02:24:38.551 --> 02:24:42.090
<v Speaker 1>you're just more accustomed to all the pain from the surgeries and all the</v>

5393
02:24:42.091 --> 02:24:45.510
<v Speaker 1>different things you've gone through that you just can eat it better.</v>

5394
02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:47.820
<v Speaker 1>There's Woodley again,</v>

5395
02:24:47.850 --> 02:24:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

5396
02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:49.030
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

5397
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:51.000
<v Speaker 1>that could be a definite thing.</v>

5398
02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I've been through a lot of painful things.</v>

5399
02:24:52.861 --> 02:24:53.311
<v Speaker 1>That's my cup.</v>

5400
02:24:53.311 --> 02:24:54.144
<v Speaker 1>My old coach said,</v>

5401
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:55.543
<v Speaker 1>Collin Oyama,</v>

02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:57.421

5405
02:24:57.421 --> 02:24:58.770
<v Speaker 1>you just have a different threshold.</v>

5406
02:24:58.880 --> 02:24:59.221
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

5407
02:24:59.221 --> 02:25:00.030

5414
02:25:07.290 --> 02:25:07.831
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it's,</v>

5415
02:25:07.831 --> 02:25:08.700
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

5416
02:25:08.701 --> 02:25:09.710
<v Speaker 1>They come across to lever,</v>

5422
02:25:16.170 --> 02:25:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Matt Brown,</v>

5423
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:18.030
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Court,</v>

5424
02:25:18.031 --> 02:25:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Mcgee rather court Mckinnon's a comic.</v>

5425
02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:20.910
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have that at all.</v>

5426
02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:21.800
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy.</v>

5427
02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:22.021
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

5428
02:25:22.021 --> 02:25:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Shane Miguel a senior.</v>

5429
02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:23.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5430
02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:23.920
<v Speaker 1>it was a good guy.</v>

5431
02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

5432
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.300
<v Speaker 4>can't even imagine him being in a fight,</v>

5433
02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:28.750
<v Speaker 4>but court McGee has got that unbreakable spirit.</v>

5434
02:25:28.810 --> 02:25:29.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5435
02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:33.100
<v Speaker 4>for whatever is his body holds up as much as his body's can hold up.</v>

5436
02:25:33.220 --> 02:25:35.110
<v Speaker 4>His mind's gonna just push his body to its limits.</v>

5437
02:25:35.111 --> 02:25:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5438
02:25:35.530 --> 02:25:37.330
<v Speaker 4>Like when you seeing him in fights,</v>

5439
02:25:37.350 --> 02:25:38.950
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of his fights,</v>

5440
02:25:39.310 --> 02:25:41.740
<v Speaker 4>particularly our earlier in his career,</v>

5441
02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:43.150
<v Speaker 4>he's had some tough fights lately,</v>

5442
02:25:43.570 --> 02:25:44.403
<v Speaker 4>but he's,</v>

5443

02:26:59.090 --> 02:27:00.560
<v Speaker 8>not fight anymore.</v>

5495

5520
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:36.620
<v Speaker 8>maybe it's better to be broken alive.</v>

5521
02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:37.933
<v Speaker 8>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 8>Everybody.</v>

5532
02:27:50.901 --> 02:27:52.880
<v Speaker 8>Anybody in the fight game,</v>

02:27:54.020 --> 02:27:56.590
<v Speaker 8>unless you have some kind of job that,</v>

5534
02:27:56.591 --> 02:27:57.380

5537
02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:02.713
<v Speaker 8>shit,</v>

<v Speaker 8>why not open a gym?</v>

5539
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.940
<v Speaker 8>I teach me about a fight.</v>

5540
02:28:04.941 --> 02:28:05.481
<v Speaker 8>That's what you do.</v>

5541
02:28:05.481 --> 02:28:09.530
<v Speaker 8>You're a professional fighter and make people want to learn how to find teaching</v>

5542
02:28:09.531 --> 02:28:10.364
<v Speaker 8>people much.</v>

5543
02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:10.950
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5544
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:11.360
<v Speaker 8>I think,</v>

5545
02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:11.601
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

5546
02:28:11.601 --> 02:28:14.480
<v Speaker 8>it's better than fighting when you have esophagus problems.</v>

5547
02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:16.063
<v Speaker 8>You know what I mean?</v>

5548
02:28:16.190 --> 02:28:16.910
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5549
02:28:16.910 --> 02:28:17.900
<v Speaker 8>But what do you do?</v>

5550
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:18.930
<v Speaker 8>Talking logic over there?</v>

5551
02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:20.520
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

5552
02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 8>you got to one fight.</v>

5553
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:23.060
<v Speaker 2>It's Esophagus.</v>

5554
02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:25.130
<v Speaker 2>The next fights gallbladder.</v>

5555
02:28:25.150 --> 02:28:26.390
<v Speaker 2>It can't even make a fist.</v>

5556
02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:27.860
<v Speaker 2>You should open up a gym,</v>

5557
02:28:27.861 --> 02:28:28.390
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5558
02:28:28.390 --> 02:28:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you got to do it eventually?</v>

5559
02:28:29.391 --> 02:28:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I can still beat motherfuckers up.</v>

5560
02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:32.420
<v Speaker 2>But do you want to open up a gym?</v>

5561
02:28:32.421 --> 02:28:32.750
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5562
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:33.291
<v Speaker 2>Then you should know,</v>

5563
02:28:33.291 --> 02:28:35.000
<v Speaker 2>but it was not talking about staying alive.</v>

5564
02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:36.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about staying alive though.</v>

5565
02:28:37.010 --> 02:28:38.000
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to talk me into things.</v>

5566
02:28:38.001 --> 02:28:38.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>

5567
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:40.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about staying alive,</v>

5568
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.903
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5569
02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Don't do a gym.</v>

5570
02:28:42.171 --> 02:28:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Then I start to,</v>

5571
02:28:43.620 --> 02:28:47.760
<v Speaker 2>I have a rash guard and I've got the podcasts and stuff and we're going to up</v>

5572
02:28:47.761 --> 02:28:48.594
<v Speaker 2>much and other stuff.</v>

5573
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5574
02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:49.671
<v Speaker 2>I've got,</v>

5575
02:28:49.671 --> 02:28:51.040
<v Speaker 2>I've got many irons,</v>

5576
02:28:51.090 --> 02:28:53.480
<v Speaker 2>a million different ways to make a living in this world.</v>

5577
02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I think the most important thing for everyone is to try it.</v>

5578
02:28:57.311 --> 02:29:00.590
<v Speaker 2>At least tried to make a live and doing that thing that you really enjoyed</v>

5579
02:29:00.591 --> 02:29:00.890
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

5580
02:29:00.890 --> 02:29:02.480
<v Speaker 2>You love teaching Jujitsu.</v>

5581
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:04.670
<v Speaker 2>You've always loved teaching Jiu Jitsu for you.</v>

5582
02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:07.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally natural thing,</v>

5583
02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:09.950
<v Speaker 2>but there are some people that just don't like training other people,</v>

5584
02:29:09.951 --> 02:29:10.550
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5585
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:11.690
<v Speaker 2>They just don't enjoy it.</v>

5586
02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

5587
02:29:12.650 --> 02:29:13.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5588
02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:13.933
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's,</v>

5589
02:29:14.090 --> 02:29:15.920
<v Speaker 2>it takes every kind of people you know,</v>

5590
02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:20.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's okay if you really want to make it as a podcast or you could do it.</v>

5591
02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:21.681
<v Speaker 2>You could do that too.</v>

5592
02:29:21.681 --> 02:29:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

5593
02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:23.113
<v Speaker 2>You're funny.</v>

5594
02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Eric's funny.</v>

5595
02:29:24.020 --> 02:29:25.120
<v Speaker 2>You guys are interesting together.</v>

5596
02:29:26.090 --> 02:29:26.923
<v Speaker 2>It's a good idea.</v>

5597
02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:27.471
<v Speaker 2>I've got two,</v>

5598
02:29:27.471 --> 02:29:28.141
<v Speaker 2>I've got two shows,</v>

5599
02:29:28.141 --> 02:29:30.020
<v Speaker 2>so hopefully they'll work out what I'm going to work out.</v>

5600
02:29:30.021 --> 02:29:30.350
<v Speaker 2>At least.</v>

5601
02:29:30.350 --> 02:29:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the thing with those things is just trying your best and being</v>

5602
02:29:33.291 --> 02:29:36.680
<v Speaker 2>consistent and trying to improve and you're going to have stumbles and you'll be</v>

5603
02:29:36.681 --> 02:29:37.670
<v Speaker 2>better in other shows.</v>

5604
02:29:37.671 --> 02:29:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Then you were in certain shows,</v>

5605
02:29:39.470 --> 02:29:41.360
<v Speaker 2>but just keep doing it and you,</v>

5606
02:29:41.570 --> 02:29:43.910
<v Speaker 2>you know a fuck load about fighting dude,</v>

5607
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:48.410
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like the big brown breakdown that [inaudible] does is one of his most</v>

5608
02:29:48.411 --> 02:29:51.410
<v Speaker 2>important podcast and he's getting millions of downloads now for that.</v>

5609
02:29:51.690 --> 02:29:54.830
<v Speaker 2>It's big cab because he's inexperienced former UFC fighters.</v>

5610
02:29:54.831 --> 02:29:55.670
<v Speaker 2>A smart dude,</v>

5611
02:29:55.940 --> 02:29:56.990
<v Speaker 2>he understands fighting.</v>

5612
02:29:56.991 --> 02:29:57.231
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

5613
02:29:57.231 --> 02:29:58.320
<v Speaker 2>he's controversial,</v>

5614
02:29:58.330 --> 02:30:00.800
<v Speaker 2>is not afraid to call things like he sees them.</v>

5615
02:30:00.801 --> 02:30:02.180
<v Speaker 2>He's not attached to anybody.</v>

5616
02:30:02.181 --> 02:30:03.770
<v Speaker 2>No one could tell him what the fuck to say.</v>

5617
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:05.150
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

5618
02:30:05.151 --> 02:30:07.640
<v Speaker 2>his podcast is getting millions of downloads,</v>

5619
02:30:09.290 --> 02:30:09.800
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5620
02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Also another option is if you don't like teaching,</v>

5621
02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:14.300
<v Speaker 2>you could be the owner.</v>

5622
02:30:14.301 --> 02:30:15.380
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do any of the teeth.</v>

5623
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Don't listen to this dude.</v>

5624
02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:18.770
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing with the MMA business.</v>

5625
02:30:18.771 --> 02:30:21.140
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to draw us all in together for some pyramid scheme.</v>

5626
02:30:21.700 --> 02:30:21.970

5650
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:55.371
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

5651
02:30:55.371 --> 02:30:55.581
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

02:30:55.581 --> 02:30:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5653
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might be,</v>

5654
02:30:56.760 --> 02:31:00.200
<v Speaker 2>it might be the nicest guys ever lived the old line down,</v>

5655
02:31:00.201 --> 02:31:01.280
<v Speaker 2>the interactions I had with him,</v>

5656
02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:03.510
<v Speaker 2>he's the nicest phonies and</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's a super nice guy,</v>

5663
02:31:11.871 --> 02:31:12.230
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5664
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5665
02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Marcel is one of the Nice Skype they would live to between Marcello and Kelvin</v>

5666
02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:17.600

5667
02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:18.530

02:31:18.620 --> 02:31:19.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

02:31:19.890 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 2>there's</v>

5670
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:21.690
<v Speaker 4>a lot of Nice guys like a teddy bear.</v>

5671
02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:25.290
<v Speaker 4>I still believe in Travis Brown,</v>

5672
02:31:25.291 --> 02:31:25.501
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5673
02:31:25.501 --> 02:31:26.071
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

5674
02:31:26.071 --> 02:31:29.730
<v Speaker 4>If Travis Brown could get back to that footwork and movement that he had with</v>

5675
02:31:29.731 --> 02:31:30.171
<v Speaker 4>Stephan's.</v>

5676
02:31:30.171 --> 02:31:30.510
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>

5677
02:31:30.510 --> 02:31:31.343
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

5678
02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:32.183
<v Speaker 4>You know the,</v>

5679
02:31:32.210 --> 02:31:32.541
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5680
02:31:32.541 --> 02:31:32.781
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5681
02:31:32.781 --> 02:31:35.100
<v Speaker 4>the will to come back that he had with Alster.</v>

5682
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:40.140
<v Speaker 4>I still think that Travis Browne physically looked at tools that he possesses.</v>

5683
02:31:40.141 --> 02:31:43.800
<v Speaker 4>If he could put it all together and be like super motivated and then have his</v>

5684
02:31:43.801 --> 02:31:46.050
<v Speaker 4>mind strong and just believe in himself.</v>

5685
02:31:46.470 --> 02:31:51.470
<v Speaker 4>He still got some of the best school best tools in the heavyweight division now</v>

5686
02:31:52.171 --> 02:31:52.960
<v Speaker 4>as his athleticism,</v>

5687
02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:55.710
<v Speaker 4>his song so long in his movement.</v>

5688
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:58.290
<v Speaker 4>Remember when he used to move almost like a giant Dominick Cruz,</v>

5689
02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:01.560
<v Speaker 4>he would see him popping around and move and as a big heavyweight,</v>

5690
02:32:01.561 --> 02:32:03.360
<v Speaker 4>like this is a super unusual,</v>

5691
02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:06.060
<v Speaker 4>I see a guy that big that can move that well,</v>

5692
02:32:07.100 --> 02:32:07.441
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

5693
02:32:07.441 --> 02:32:07.891
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

5694
02:32:07.891 --> 02:32:10.050
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's had some knee knee issues or something.</v>

5695
02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:10.913
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5696
02:32:13.850 --> 02:32:14.611
<v Speaker 4>you really don't know.</v>

5697
02:32:14.611 --> 02:32:14.791
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5698
02:32:14.791 --> 02:32:16.510
<v Speaker 4>he did have that hamstring blowout.</v>

5699
02:32:16.540 --> 02:32:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Remember when he fought big foot on his legs just gave out,</v>

5700
02:32:19.981 --> 02:32:20.061
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5701
02:32:20.061 --> 02:32:20.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5702
02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:25.460
<v Speaker 4>His hamstring just blew out in the middle of the round and he went down.</v>

5703
02:32:25.471 --> 02:32:26.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what it,</v>

5704
02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:27.190
<v Speaker 4>what it was that he tore.</v>

5705
02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:28.920
<v Speaker 4>So leave it was a hamstring.</v>

5706
02:32:29.250 --> 02:32:33.030
<v Speaker 4>And I wonder if his leg got fucked up in that going.</v>

5707
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:34.290
<v Speaker 4>Is this a conspiracy theory?</v>

5708
02:32:34.291 --> 02:32:39.210
<v Speaker 4>Eti my making it more conspiracy theory about Travis Browne's lack of movement.</v>

5709
02:32:39.630 --> 02:32:40.560
<v Speaker 4>Did his leg explode?</v>

5710
02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:41.580
<v Speaker 4>That's fake news.</v>

5711
02:32:43.470 --> 02:32:45.990
<v Speaker 4>I know it definitely gave out on him and the big foot fight,</v>

5712
02:32:45.991 --> 02:32:47.180
<v Speaker 4>but I wonder if that was a,</v>

5713
02:32:47.181 --> 02:32:49.470
<v Speaker 4>an injury that continue to be significant.</v>

5714
02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:52.410
<v Speaker 4>Did someone put a banana peel or was it a rollerskate?</v>

5715
02:32:53.310 --> 02:32:56.240
<v Speaker 4>How many times have you been injured and look,</v>

5716
02:32:56.250 --> 02:32:57.001
<v Speaker 4>whatever the injury is,</v>

5717
02:32:57.001 --> 02:32:58.800
<v Speaker 4>you came back to the point where you could fight again.</v>

5718
02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:00.600
<v Speaker 4>But that feeling was always there.</v>

5719
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Like it's always been compromised.</v>

5720
02:33:02.260 --> 02:33:03.300
<v Speaker 4>How many times that happened to you?</v>

5721
02:33:03.630 --> 02:33:03.890
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5722
02:33:03.890 --> 02:33:06.540
<v Speaker 4>once this whole thing,</v>

5723
02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:08.280
<v Speaker 4>the whole arm thing.</v>

5724
02:33:08.580 --> 02:33:13.580
<v Speaker 4>Both parts of your arm is this Brown said it might have been the very first kick</v>

5725
02:33:14.041 --> 02:33:15.840
<v Speaker 4>he through his left hamstring pop.</v>

5726
02:33:15.841 --> 02:33:17.490
<v Speaker 4>The extent of the injury isn't known.</v>

5727
02:33:18.340 --> 02:33:19.230
<v Speaker 4>It soon became clear.</v>

5728
02:33:19.231 --> 02:33:21.210
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't working with a stable foundation.</v>

5729
02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:21.511
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5730
02:33:21.511 --> 02:33:22.344
<v Speaker 4>So his,</v>

5731
02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:23.811
<v Speaker 4>see when,</v>

5732
02:33:23.811 --> 02:33:26.070
<v Speaker 4>when you're in your hamstring pops like that.</v>

5733
02:33:26.100 --> 02:33:31.100
<v Speaker 4>The thing that I would think another issue cross would be the knee because of</v>

5734
02:33:31.231 --> 02:33:33.000
<v Speaker 4>your hamstring is not connected anymore.</v>

5735
02:33:33.001 --> 02:33:36.390
<v Speaker 4>Your knee is going to be all mushy and shit and you're probably not going to</v>

5736
02:33:36.391 --> 02:33:39.150
<v Speaker 4>have the ability to keep yourself from a twisting it.</v>

5737
02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:41.490
<v Speaker 4>You can wind up fucking your knee up.</v>

5738
02:33:41.491 --> 02:33:43.810
<v Speaker 4>It's at least it's possible that you could wind up fucking up.</v>

5739
02:33:47.980 --> 02:33:49.840
<v Speaker 4>I just think that like when he was younger,</v>

5740
02:33:49.841 --> 02:33:50.051
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

5741
02:33:50.051 --> 02:33:51.310
<v Speaker 4>he was so mobile.</v>

5742
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Now that's when he was training down in San Diego.</v>

5743
02:33:54.340 --> 02:33:55.173
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5744
02:33:55.270 --> 02:33:56.170
<v Speaker 4>that's true too.</v>

5745
02:33:56.171 --> 02:33:56.531
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5746
02:33:56.531 --> 02:33:58.330
<v Speaker 4>He was training with Dominick Cruz.</v>

5747
02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:03.330
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if maybe they decide after a while that that takes too much energy for</v>

5748
02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:04.193
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight.</v>

5749
02:34:04.450 --> 02:34:05.430
<v Speaker 4>Is that possible?</v>

5750
02:34:05.450 --> 02:34:06.410
<v Speaker 4>We'll put that there.</v>

5751
02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:09.400
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he chose to change it that way,</v>

5752
02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:11.530
<v Speaker 4>that when you went to Tain,</v>

5753
02:34:11.531 --> 02:34:11.890
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5754
02:34:11.890 --> 02:34:12.723
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5755
02:34:14.390 --> 02:34:14.481
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5756
02:34:14.481 --> 02:34:14.681
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

5757
02:34:14.681 --> 02:34:14.841
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5758
02:34:14.841 --> 02:34:16.100
<v Speaker 4>the human body can only take so much,</v>

5759
02:34:16.101 --> 02:34:16.640
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

5760
02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:19.090
<v Speaker 4>So don't know how much I'm supposed to talk about this,</v>

5761
02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:21.130
<v Speaker 4>so I probably shouldn't talk about it too much.</v>

5762
02:34:21.131 --> 02:34:23.950
<v Speaker 4>But I was talking to DC about cane,</v>

5763
02:34:24.370 --> 02:34:24.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5764
02:34:24.611 --> 02:34:24.970
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

5765
02:34:24.970 --> 02:34:25.803
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5766
02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:26.221
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

5767
02:34:26.221 --> 02:34:26.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5768
02:34:26.470 --> 02:34:27.460
<v Speaker 4>him coming back,</v>

5769
02:34:28.090 --> 02:34:28.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5770
02:34:28.421 --> 02:34:31.090
<v Speaker 4>and apparently he's back to a training again.</v>

5771
02:34:31.091 --> 02:34:32.110
<v Speaker 4>He had back surgery.</v>

5772
02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:32.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5773
02:34:32.590 --> 02:34:33.200
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

5774
02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:33.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5775
02:34:33.401 --> 02:34:34.000
<v Speaker 4>like some,</v>

5776
02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:34.780
<v Speaker 4>some things,</v>

5777
02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:36.070
<v Speaker 4>but when you start,</v>

5778
02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:36.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5779
02:34:36.460 --> 02:34:38.890
<v Speaker 4>apparently the doctor said he's good to go.</v>

5780
02:34:39.010 --> 02:34:39.331
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

5781
02:34:39.331 --> 02:34:43.210
<v Speaker 4>he's ready to fight again and he's trained in light and getting,</v>

5782
02:34:43.211 --> 02:34:44.170
<v Speaker 4>getting back to the group.</v>

5783
02:34:44.171 --> 02:34:49.171
<v Speaker 4>But when you see a guy like that that has that kind of crazy indomitable will,</v>

5784
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:51.400
<v Speaker 4>and then his body just starts to break it.</v>

5785
02:34:52.430 --> 02:34:54.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like just red line and everything.</v>

5786
02:34:54.811 --> 02:34:55.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5787
02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.630
<v Speaker 6>Eh,</v>

5788
02:34:56.750 --> 02:34:57.250
<v Speaker 4>Bang.</v>

5789
02:34:57.250 --> 02:34:57.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5790
02:34:57.730 --> 02:34:59.350
<v Speaker 4>Now when one of those things happens,</v>

5791
02:34:59.650 --> 02:35:01.630
<v Speaker 4>how often are you ever 100% again.</v>

5792
02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:03.501
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5793
02:35:03.501 --> 02:35:04.334
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

5794
02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:06.250
<v Speaker 4>100% was a long time ago.</v>

5795
02:35:06.910 --> 02:35:07.743
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5796
02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:09.310
<v Speaker 4>How do you think that's the same thing?</v>

5797
02:35:09.430 --> 02:35:10.540
<v Speaker 4>Just as off the record,</v>

5798
02:35:10.541 --> 02:35:11.710
<v Speaker 4>but for a guy like Cain,</v>

5799
02:35:12.100 --> 02:35:12.851
<v Speaker 4>it's not off the record.</v>

5800
02:35:12.851 --> 02:35:13.684
<v Speaker 4>People are listening,</v>

5801
02:35:13.930 --> 02:35:14.760
<v Speaker 4>what's the word?</v>

5802
02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:15.593
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5803
02:35:15.810 --> 02:35:16.643
<v Speaker 4>unofficially.</v>

5804
02:35:16.660 --> 02:35:16.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5805
02:35:16.930 --> 02:35:17.150
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5806
02:35:17.150 --> 02:35:17.501
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

5807
02:35:17.501 --> 02:35:17.731
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

5808
02:35:17.731 --> 02:35:17.911
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

5809
02:35:17.911 --> 02:35:19.840
<v Speaker 4>you never get back to 100% but you,</v>

5810
02:35:19.841 --> 02:35:21.910
<v Speaker 4>you know that's just right.</v>

5811
02:35:22.030 --> 02:35:22.863
<v Speaker 4>That's life.</v>

5812
02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:25.000
<v Speaker 4>Like significant injuries,</v>

5813
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:26.583
<v Speaker 4>very diff.</v>

5814
02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:27.401
<v Speaker 4>Tito Ortiz,</v>

5815
02:35:27.401 --> 02:35:28.390

<v Speaker 4>He's got fake discs.</v>

5824
02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:40.060
<v Speaker 4>He's got his neck fused.</v>

5825
02:35:40.061 --> 02:35:41.260
<v Speaker 4>You ever see them working on his neck?</v>

5826

5829

<v Speaker 4>they have to hammer it in place.</v>

5859
02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:31.050
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to watch,</v>

5860
02:36:31.051 --> 02:36:31.380
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

5861
02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:33.150
<v Speaker 4>It is so fucking hard to watch.</v>

5862
02:36:33.151 --> 02:36:33.984
<v Speaker 4>I'm squirming.</v>

5863
02:36:34.430 --> 02:36:34.530
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

5864
02:36:34.530 --> 02:36:37.360
<v Speaker 8>there's no way they could have put mine on video because they went through the</v>

5865
02:36:37.361 --> 02:36:37.780
<v Speaker 8>front.</v>

5866
02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:40.330
<v Speaker 8>They had to pull out my or pull my organs to the side.</v>

5867
02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:41.230
<v Speaker 8>Oh Dude.</v>

5868
02:36:41.290 --> 02:36:41.431
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5869
02:36:41.431 --> 02:36:41.640
<v Speaker 8>There,</v>

5870
02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:43.810
<v Speaker 8>there's a special doctor I guess.</v>

5871
02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:45.320
<v Speaker 8>I guess a cardiologist.</v>

5872
02:36:45.321 --> 02:36:45.870
<v Speaker 8>They,</v>

5873
02:36:45.870 --> 02:36:50.870
<v Speaker 8>that splits all the Oregons and opens everything up so the doctor can go in</v>

5874
02:36:52.451 --> 02:36:53.710
<v Speaker 8>there and do some screw.</v>

02:36:53.711 --> 02:36:57.670
<v Speaker 8>And did they did the main and then look as it takes my butthole pucker up.</v>

5876
02:36:57.790 --> 02:37:00.310
<v Speaker 8>I don't know how many hours I forget,</v>

5877
02:37:00.460 --> 02:37:04.960
<v Speaker 8>but they put me out and I woke up and I was laying there and this guy's just a</v>

5878
02:37:04.961 --> 02:37:05.794
<v Speaker 8>wizard at it.</v>

5879
02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:08.140
<v Speaker 8>Apparently I got a really good doctor.</v>

5880
02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:08.920
<v Speaker 8>I was,</v>

5881
02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:10.900
<v Speaker 8>and they put a fake disc in there.</v>

5882
02:37:10.930 --> 02:37:12.820
<v Speaker 8>And how long has the fake disc good for?</v>

5883
02:37:13.390 --> 02:37:14.223
<v Speaker 8>50 years.</v>

5884
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:15.620
<v Speaker 8>50 something like that.</v>

5885
02:37:16.290 --> 02:37:17.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5886
02:37:17.050 --> 02:37:17.491
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

5887
02:37:17.491 --> 02:37:19.130
<v Speaker 1>What if you're still alive?</v>

5888
02:37:19.870 --> 02:37:20.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:25.440
<v Speaker 1>get your shit fixed again.</v>

5892
02:37:29.161 --> 02:37:29.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5893
02:37:29.390 --> 02:37:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Disc operation at 95 might just jump off a building.</v>

5894
02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:32.933
<v Speaker 1>I don't know</v>

5895
02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:36.210
<v Speaker 1>how to fly shit.</v>

5896
02:37:36.740 --> 02:37:37.573
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

5897
02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I think what if one of the screws gets loose or something?</v>

5898
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

5899
02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:43.301
<v Speaker 1>How about this?</v>

5900
02:37:43.301 --> 02:37:44.940
<v Speaker 1>By however they did it,</v>

5901
02:37:44.941 --> 02:37:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how they did it.</v>

5902
02:37:46.350 --> 02:37:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there was some kind of screwing involved.</v>

5903
02:37:48.300 --> 02:37:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5904
02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5905
02:37:49.140 --> 02:37:49.973
<v Speaker 1>They didn't use glue.</v>

5906
02:37:50.130 --> 02:37:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Some kind of jailing.</v>

5907
02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:52.561
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5908
02:37:52.561 --> 02:37:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5909
02:37:52.830 --> 02:37:54.690
<v Speaker 1>I've got screws in both my knees and uh,</v>

5910
02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:56.610
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I think about that.</v>

5911
02:37:56.790 --> 02:37:57.750
<v Speaker 1>They stay in you.</v>

5912
02:37:58.650 --> 02:38:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Your body absorbs some of them.</v>

5913
02:38:00.421 --> 02:38:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Like on one knee,</v>

5914
02:38:01.710 --> 02:38:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you can't even tell like the screw marked,</v>

5915
02:38:04.060 --> 02:38:09.060
<v Speaker 1>like the body absorbs whatever the screws made out of Ou Derrick Lewis coming</v>

5916
02:38:09.451 --> 02:38:10.260
<v Speaker 1>out swinging.</v>

5917
02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:10.951
<v Speaker 1>But on my other one,</v>

5918
02:38:10.951 --> 02:38:11.521
<v Speaker 1>it's still in there.</v>

5919
02:38:11.521 --> 02:38:12.354
<v Speaker 1>There's still metal.</v>

5920
02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:15.390
<v Speaker 1>The two big boys.</v>

5921
02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:16.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5922
02:38:16.770 --> 02:38:18.000
<v Speaker 1>This is dangerous fight.</v>

5923
02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Very dangerous fight for both guys.</v>

5924
02:38:20.370 --> 02:38:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Anything can happen in this fight.</v>

5925
02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:24.151
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

5926
02:38:24.151 --> 02:38:25.140
<v Speaker 1>nice leg kick.</v>

5927
02:38:26.370 --> 02:38:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Travis Brown light on his feet on the outside.</v>

5928
02:38:30.450 --> 02:38:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I just still think this dude has some extreme physical gifts and his ex in,</v>

5929
02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:37.553
<v Speaker 1>in moments,</v>

5930
02:38:37.650 --> 02:38:38.850
<v Speaker 1>he's been extraordinary.</v>

5931
02:38:39.390 --> 02:38:39.781
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5932
02:38:39.781 --> 02:38:42.810
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at like that superman punch to Stephan Struve,</v>

5933
02:38:42.930 --> 02:38:44.570
<v Speaker 1>you looked at when he knocked out Allister,</v>

5934
02:38:44.610 --> 02:38:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at when he knocked out Schaub he's had moments where he's</v>

5935
02:38:47.791 --> 02:38:48.511
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary.</v>

5936
02:38:48.511 --> 02:38:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5937
02:38:49.050 --> 02:38:50.190
<v Speaker 1>And he's not done.</v>

5938
02:38:50.820 --> 02:38:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Look a look at his frame of how long has it laser and he's a heavyweight.</v>

5939
02:38:53.340 --> 02:38:54.173
<v Speaker 1>He's not done.</v>

5940
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:55.060
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

5941
02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:55.620
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>

5942
02:38:55.620 --> 02:38:56.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean easy.</v>

5943
02:38:56.650 --> 02:38:57.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just gifted.</v>

5944
02:38:57.511 --> 02:38:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Did that frame yeah.</v>

5945
02:38:58.650 --> 02:38:59.850
<v Speaker 1>He's also a savage.</v>

5946
02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5947
02:39:00.390 --> 02:39:01.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like I just,</v>

5948
02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:02.251
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

5949
02:39:02.251 --> 02:39:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I still believe in Travis Brown.</v>

5950
02:39:03.841 --> 02:39:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I think Travis Brown just made some changes,</v>

5951
02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:07.740
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

5952
02:39:07.740 --> 02:39:10.560

5953
02:39:10.561 --> 02:39:11.730
<v Speaker 1>be real beneficial for them.</v>

5954
02:39:12.390 --> 02:39:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Probably needs more big guys to work with.</v>

5955
02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:16.290

02:40:55.650 --> 02:40:56.371
<v Speaker 2>Very nice.</v>

6021
02:40:56.371 --> 02:40:56.631
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>

6022
02:40:56.631 --> 02:40:57.240
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

6023
02:40:57.240 --> 02:40:57.511
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

6024
02:40:57.511 --> 02:40:58.690
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what he was hoping.</v>

6025
02:40:58.691 --> 02:40:59.524
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't going to.</v>

6026
02:40:59.850 --> 02:41:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

6027
02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:00.651
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6028
02:41:00.651 --> 02:41:01.860
<v Speaker 2>he threw the front kick again.</v>

6029
02:41:01.890 --> 02:41:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Derek Lewis with bombs.</v>

6030
02:41:04.530 --> 02:41:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Derrick Lewis improved his.</v>

6031
02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:06.573
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6032
02:41:07.290 --> 02:41:08.123
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

6033
02:41:08.340 --> 02:41:09.173
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

6034
02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:10.073
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6035
02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:10.801
<v Speaker 2>Finish him.</v>

6036
02:41:10.801 --> 02:41:11.101
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

6037
02:41:11.101 --> 02:41:11.934
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>

6038
02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:13.021
<v Speaker 2>God Damn,</v>

6039
02:41:13.021 --> 02:41:13.560
<v Speaker 2>he's Tad.</v>

6040
02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:15.120
<v Speaker 2>Damn Derrick Lewis can take it.</v>

6041
02:41:15.390 --> 02:41:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

6042
02:41:16.890 --> 02:41:17.581
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

6043
02:41:17.581 --> 02:41:18.414
<v Speaker 2>He's tough.</v>

6044
02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:21.960
<v Speaker 2>That will lie time minute 40 minute,</v>

6045
02:41:21.961 --> 02:41:22.794
<v Speaker 2>40.</v>

6046
02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6047
02:41:23.700 --> 02:41:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Can you recover from those during the fight?</v>

6048
02:41:26.401 --> 02:41:26.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6049
02:41:26.551 --> 02:41:27.301
<v Speaker 2>you can recover,</v>

6050
02:41:27.301 --> 02:41:28.860
<v Speaker 2>but it might not totally recover.</v>

6051
02:41:28.861 --> 02:41:29.694
<v Speaker 2>You still hurt.</v>

6052
02:41:30.110 --> 02:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6053
02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:31.000
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

6054
02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.310
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely more susceptible to body shots so bad too.</v>

6055
02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:35.941
<v Speaker 2>So she,</v>

6056
02:41:35.941 --> 02:41:37.050
<v Speaker 2>that sternum shot there?</v>

6057
02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:37.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6058
02:41:37.831 --> 02:41:38.610
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6059
02:41:38.610 --> 02:41:39.270
<v Speaker 2>That uh,</v>

6060
02:41:39.270 --> 02:41:41.910
<v Speaker 2>solar plexus shot the way he just landed that knee.</v>

6061
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:42.833
<v Speaker 2>Oof.</v>

6062
02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6063
02:41:44.460 --> 02:41:45.780
<v Speaker 2>and if you've ever been liver hint,</v>

6064
02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:47.220
<v Speaker 2>as anybody ever hit you in the liver,</v>

6065
02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:50.160
<v Speaker 2>in the stomach where you lose your breath,</v>

6066
02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:51.360
<v Speaker 2>you know when you can't breathe.</v>

6067
02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Is that the liver?</v>

6068
02:41:52.290 --> 02:41:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Now liver is weird dude,</v>

6069
02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:57.780
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes people can hit you in the same spot and nothing happens.</v>

6070
02:41:58.530 --> 02:41:58.921
<v Speaker 2>They get hit.</v>

6071
02:41:58.921 --> 02:41:59.730
<v Speaker 2>You right there,</v>

6072
02:41:59.730 --> 02:42:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Pam.</v>

6073
02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:01.050
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happens.</v>

6074
02:42:01.170 --> 02:42:02.190
<v Speaker 2>But other times,</v>

6075
02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:04.530
<v Speaker 2>just for whatever reason,</v>

6076
02:42:04.531 --> 02:42:06.240
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't have to be the biggest shot either,</v>

6077
02:42:06.241 --> 02:42:10.530
<v Speaker 2>it's just a perfectly placed shot to the liver and your whole body just goes,</v>

6078
02:42:13.810 --> 02:42:16.440
<v Speaker 2>just locks up and you can kind of like,</v>

6079
02:42:16.740 --> 02:42:17.820
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of fake it.</v>

6080
02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:19.410
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of move around a little bit.</v>

6081
02:42:19.460 --> 02:42:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's hard.</v>

6082
02:42:20.690 --> 02:42:21.070
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

6083
02:42:21.070 --> 02:42:21.900
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>

6084
02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:22.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6085
02:42:22.071 --> 02:42:24.360
<v Speaker 2>everyone talks about the head trauma and fighting,</v>

6086
02:42:24.361 --> 02:42:25.710
<v Speaker 2>but what about the body trauma,</v>

6087
02:42:25.820 --> 02:42:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Oregon Trauma?</v>

6088
02:42:27.690 --> 02:42:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Is there trauma there too?</v>

6089
02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:30.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point.</v>

6090
02:42:30.330 --> 02:42:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's damage,</v>

6091
02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:33.190
<v Speaker 2>like permanent damage damage done there too.</v>

6092
02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Of course there is in the chest and the ribs and stomach.</v>

6093
02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Imagine Travis Browne,</v>

6094
02:42:39.481 --> 02:42:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Nino in the chest,</v>

6095
02:42:40.410 --> 02:42:42.120
<v Speaker 2>a little kick to the ribs.</v>

6096
02:42:42.330 --> 02:42:44.100
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck does that not permanently damage you?</v>

6097
02:42:44.101 --> 02:42:44.851
<v Speaker 2>Of course it does.</v>

6098
02:42:44.851 --> 02:42:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Does some this,</v>

6099
02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:47.700
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be some bleeding in there.</v>

6100
02:42:47.940 --> 02:42:48.391
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6101
02:42:48.391 --> 02:42:49.440
<v Speaker 2>Now if there's some bleeding there,</v>

6102
02:42:49.441 --> 02:42:50.430
<v Speaker 2>there's some tearing.</v>

6103
02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:54.240
<v Speaker 2>There's tearing is some scar tissue ripping and tearing and some important</v>

6104
02:42:54.241 --> 02:42:55.830
<v Speaker 2>organs that are getting squashed.</v>

6105
02:42:56.990 --> 02:42:57.823
<v Speaker 2>The wheel kick.</v>

6106
02:42:58.110 --> 02:42:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6107
02:42:58.650 --> 02:42:59.900
<v Speaker 2>it's your liver man.</v>

6108
02:42:59.910 --> 02:43:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Your liver is a big part of what gets hurt,</v>

6109
02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:04.710
<v Speaker 2>but you get caught with a turning sidekick to the guts.</v>

6110
02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:06.053
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6111
02:43:06.690 --> 02:43:08.880
<v Speaker 2>that's horrific for everything,</v>

6112
02:43:09.690 --> 02:43:12.250
<v Speaker 2>especially the way you throw him in</v>

6113
02:43:12.250 --> 02:43:12.520
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

6114
02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:13.353
<v Speaker 5>Who could survive.</v>

6115
02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:16.950
<v Speaker 5>The only time guys survive it is if you catch them wrong,</v>

6116
02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:19.870
<v Speaker 5>you catch them with your toes and you don't catch them with the heel.</v>

6117
02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:21.370
<v Speaker 5>But when they get hit with a heel,</v>

6118
02:43:21.371 --> 02:43:23.170
<v Speaker 5>if you're extending as they get hit,</v>

6119
02:43:23.171 --> 02:43:24.670
<v Speaker 5>it's there so much force.</v>

6120
02:43:25.210 --> 02:43:26.680
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the worst things in the world.</v>

6121
02:43:26.681 --> 02:43:29.950
<v Speaker 5>Kevin Ross survived one in his last Bellator fight.</v>

6122
02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:33.100
<v Speaker 5>He got nailed like early seconds of the fight.</v>

6123
02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:36.640
<v Speaker 5>He got nailed with a right to the liver and he said it was one of the most</v>

6124
02:43:36.641 --> 02:43:38.920
<v Speaker 5>painful things he's ever experienced in his life.</v>

6125
02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:41.290
<v Speaker 5>You didn't see a god damn thing and his face,</v>

6126
02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:45.490
<v Speaker 5>he just tucked his arm down and kept moving and kept fighting and about 20</v>

6127
02:43:45.491 --> 02:43:47.230
<v Speaker 5>seconds later he was 100% recovered.</v>

6128
02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:49.030
<v Speaker 5>How do you see the evolution of the sport he's,</v>

6129
02:43:49.090 --> 02:43:51.540
<v Speaker 5>you've seen how much it's evolved over the last what,</v>

6130
02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:52.570
<v Speaker 5>20 years or whatever.</v>

6131
02:43:52.930 --> 02:43:53.331
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

6132
02:43:53.331 --> 02:43:54.164
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>

6133
02:43:54.220 --> 02:43:55.780
<v Speaker 5>Maybe what does the future hold?</v>

6134
02:43:55.870 --> 02:44:00.870
<v Speaker 5>It should keep evolving and maybe one day instead of two or three guys in the</v>

6135
02:44:01.031 --> 02:44:03.010
<v Speaker 5>UFC with the,</v>

6136
02:44:03.270 --> 02:44:03.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6137
02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:05.490
<v Speaker 5>the power of that turn inside kick in their arsenal.</v>

6138
02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:07.180
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's just like everyone,</v>

6139
02:44:07.220 --> 02:44:08.140
<v Speaker 5>it will be standard.</v>

6140
02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:11.980
<v Speaker 5>I think 20 years is the front leg side kick and the turning side kick should be</v>

6141
02:44:11.981 --> 02:44:12.551
<v Speaker 5>standard.</v>

6142
02:44:12.551 --> 02:44:13.810
<v Speaker 5>Just like the front kick is.</v>

6143
02:44:13.811 --> 02:44:15.830
<v Speaker 5>They should be standard eventually everything.</v>

6144
02:44:15.831 --> 02:44:16.041
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6145
02:44:16.041 --> 02:44:18.160
<v Speaker 5>year Rodrigues those will be standard.</v>

6146
02:44:18.210 --> 02:44:20.080
<v Speaker 5>Oh you have to do is learn how to do it.</v>

6147
02:44:20.110 --> 02:44:22.540
<v Speaker 5>Everybody that knows how to throw a good right hand.</v>

6148
02:44:22.541 --> 02:44:24.040
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows how to throw a left hook.</v>

6149
02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:25.810
<v Speaker 5>Everybody then knows how to throw a leg kick.</v>

6150
02:44:26.140 --> 02:44:29.950
<v Speaker 5>You could learn how to throw a perfectly timed sidekick a perfectly time</v>

6151
02:44:29.951 --> 02:44:30.910
<v Speaker 5>spinning back kick.</v>

6152
02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:32.560
<v Speaker 5>Will you have any legal force?</v>

6153
02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:34.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm not special.</v>

6154
02:44:34.060 --> 02:44:36.070
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing special about me that I can do it.</v>

6155
02:44:36.071 --> 02:44:37.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm a 49 year old comedian.</v>

6156
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.890
<v Speaker 5>If I can do it.</v>

6157
02:44:38.891 --> 02:44:40.000
<v Speaker 5>You're telling me you can't do it.</v>

6158
02:44:40.030 --> 02:44:41.620
<v Speaker 5>You could totally do it the way I do it.</v>

6159
02:44:41.770 --> 02:44:45.610
<v Speaker 5>All you'd have to do is learn from the type of instructor that I learned from</v>

6160
02:44:45.700 --> 02:44:49.750
<v Speaker 5>that teaches you perfect technique and they emphasize that you never fuck with</v>

6161
02:44:49.751 --> 02:44:50.321
<v Speaker 5>that technique.</v>

6162
02:44:50.321 --> 02:44:51.550
<v Speaker 5>You always do it the right way.</v>

6163
02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:52.940
<v Speaker 5>Anybody and these guys can learn.</v>

6164
02:44:52.941 --> 02:44:53.980
<v Speaker 5>10 years ago,</v>

6165
02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:55.990
<v Speaker 5>if some UFC fighter told,</v>

6166
02:44:56.200 --> 02:44:57.600
<v Speaker 5>told you that he's got it,</v>

6167
02:44:57.601 --> 02:45:00.940
<v Speaker 5>he signed for a fight and he's going to start training on a taekwondo school to</v>

6168
02:45:00.941 --> 02:45:01.810
<v Speaker 5>get ready for his fight.</v>

6169
02:45:02.020 --> 02:45:04.720
<v Speaker 5>You would think he was crazy using his mind right?</v>

6170
02:45:04.930 --> 02:45:05.471
<v Speaker 5>10 years ago,</v>

6171
02:45:05.471 --> 02:45:06.420
<v Speaker 5>but now,</v>

6172
02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.000
<v Speaker 5>now it's not a bad idea to go to your local taekwondo school and get your spin</v>

6173
02:45:12.461 --> 02:45:13.320
<v Speaker 5>on right.</v>

6174
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:15.310
<v Speaker 5>Get Your Kung Fu on.</v>

6175
02:45:15.311 --> 02:45:16.144
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6176
02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:19.480
<v Speaker 5>Them spinning kicks just to get those spinning kicks down.</v>

6177
02:45:20.050 --> 02:45:21.320
<v Speaker 5>Oh look it</v>

6178

02:45:24.911 --> 02:45:26.080
<v Speaker 5>Travis is in trouble,</v>

6180
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.591
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>

6181
02:45:26.591 --> 02:45:27.730
<v Speaker 5>he's got a lot of heart though.</v>

6182
02:45:28.730 --> 02:45:29.830
<v Speaker 5>He's hanging in there,</v>

6183
02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:30.460
<v Speaker 5>hanging in there,</v>

6184
02:45:30.460 --> 02:45:31.340
<v Speaker 5>but he's got,</v>

6185
02:45:31.420 --> 02:45:32.290
<v Speaker 5>his legs are going.</v>

02:45:36.590 --> 02:45:37.600
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to move.</v>

6190
02:45:37.601 --> 02:45:38.201
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to move.</v>

6191
02:45:38.201 --> 02:45:39.280
<v Speaker 5>He's hanging on there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Three too many right there.</v>

6286
02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:40.430
<v Speaker 2>That's a big win for Derrick Lewis though.</v>

6287
02:47:40.431 --> 02:47:41.241
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

6310
02:48:19.310 --> 02:48:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

6311
02:48:20.420 --> 02:48:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Let's see that again.</v>

6312
02:48:21.770 --> 02:48:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Do Travis Brown tried to tried to hang in there,</v>

6313
02:48:24.261 --> 02:48:24.561
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

6314
02:48:24.561 --> 02:48:25.394
<v Speaker 2>but look at this,</v>

6315
02:48:28.260 --> 02:48:28.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6316
02:48:28.970 --> 02:48:29.481
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

6317
02:48:29.481 --> 02:48:30.620
<v Speaker 2>He catches him with that name.</v>

6318
02:48:30.860 --> 02:48:31.131
<v Speaker 2>Paulo.</v>

6319
02:48:31.131 --> 02:48:31.791
<v Speaker 2>There's the left.</v>

6320
02:48:31.791 --> 02:48:32.870
<v Speaker 2>The left really hurt him,</v>

6321
02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:33.801
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

6322
02:48:33.801 --> 02:48:34.880
<v Speaker 2>He's just winging them.</v>

6323
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.751
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6324
02:48:35.751 --> 02:48:36.584
<v Speaker 2>look at that right hand.</v>

6325
02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:37.693
<v Speaker 2>That's Oh,</v>

6326
02:48:37.830 --> 02:48:38.690
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

6327
02:48:39.050 --> 02:48:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

6328
02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Like going around the guard.</v>

6329
02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Good placement of his punches.</v>

6330
02:48:43.390 --> 02:48:44.223
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

6331
02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

6332
02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Right elbow.</v>

6333
02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:47.930
<v Speaker 2>That was an elbow right there.</v>

6334
02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:49.701
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

6335
02:48:49.701 --> 02:48:50.181
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

6336
02:48:50.181 --> 02:48:51.014
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

6337
02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:51.800
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

6338
02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:52.281
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

6339
02:48:52.281 --> 02:48:53.114
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

6340
02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:54.133
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

6341
02:48:54.140 --> 02:48:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Like right there he could have stopped.</v>

6342
02:48:55.821 --> 02:48:58.340
<v Speaker 2>That fight is totally unnecessary.</v>

6343
02:48:58.341 --> 02:48:59.540
<v Speaker 2>The last few shots,</v>

6344
02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:02.090
<v Speaker 2>let's see if they even show the last few shots.</v>

6345
02:49:02.140 --> 02:49:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Like boom,</v>

6346
02:49:03.201 --> 02:49:04.010
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

6347
02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:05.240
<v Speaker 2>That fight is over.</v>

6348
02:49:05.450 --> 02:49:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Like doubt.</v>

6349
02:49:06.050 --> 02:49:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Those are two completely unnecessary</v>

6350
02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:09.293
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>

6351
02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:11.250
<v Speaker 1>That referee should have jumped in earlier.</v>

6352
02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:12.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6353
02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:13.500
<v Speaker 1>that's unnecessary.</v>

6354
02:49:13.550 --> 02:49:14.580
<v Speaker 1>It's unnecessary.</v>

6355
02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:16.740
<v Speaker 1>But Travis is known for coming back.</v>

6356
02:49:16.770 --> 02:49:17.980
<v Speaker 1>It's true brain,</v>

6357
02:49:18.090 --> 02:49:18.841
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't,</v>

6358
02:49:18.841 --> 02:49:19.920
<v Speaker 1>there was no break anymore.</v>

6359
02:49:19.921 --> 02:49:20.754
<v Speaker 1>He was done.</v>

6360
02:49:20.970 --> 02:49:21.803
<v Speaker 1>He was gone.</v>

6361
02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:24.600
<v Speaker 1>He was unconscious when he took those last two shots.</v>

6362
02:49:25.290 --> 02:49:26.850
<v Speaker 1>But Fuck Derrick Lewis.</v>

6363
02:49:27.330 --> 02:49:27.751
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

6364
02:49:27.751 --> 02:49:29.040
<v Speaker 1>he's good to,</v>

6365
02:49:29.041 --> 02:49:30.420
<v Speaker 1>who's tougher than that guy?</v>

6366
02:49:30.421 --> 02:49:31.254
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

6367
02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:32.011
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

6368
02:49:32.011 --> 02:49:32.844
<v Speaker 1>That was awesome.</v>

6369
02:49:32.910 --> 02:49:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Each those shots,</v>

6370
02:49:33.811 --> 02:49:35.700
<v Speaker 1>the body survives,</v>

6371
02:49:35.790 --> 02:49:37.590
<v Speaker 1>comes back and knocks him out in the next round.</v>

6372
02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:39.353
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

6373
02:49:40.890 --> 02:49:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I was super impressed with him in the Roy Nelson fight because I felt like in</v>

6374
02:49:44.161 --> 02:49:45.180
<v Speaker 1>the Roy Nelson fight,</v>

6375
02:49:45.181 --> 02:49:47.400
<v Speaker 1>like Roy throws big bombs.</v>

6376
02:49:47.401 --> 02:49:48.900
<v Speaker 1>He's a strong guy.</v>

6377
02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:49.381
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

6378
02:49:49.381 --> 02:49:50.370
<v Speaker 1>this could be an interesting fight.</v>

6379
02:49:50.371 --> 02:49:53.010
<v Speaker 1>He'd get tested like Derrick Lewis get tested,</v>

6380
02:49:53.130 --> 02:49:56.970
<v Speaker 1>but instead he just overwhelmed Roy and he was throwing nasty combinations in</v>

6381
02:49:56.971 --> 02:50:01.740
<v Speaker 1>his conditioning was so apparent and there was a big change in his conditioning</v>

6382
02:50:02.310 --> 02:50:03.021
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

6383
02:50:03.021 --> 02:50:03.930
<v Speaker 1>he even addressed it.</v>

6384
02:50:03.931 --> 02:50:04.661
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about it.</v>

6385
02:50:04.661 --> 02:50:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

6386
02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:08.700
<v Speaker 1>he realized at a certain point in time that if he wants to compete at the upper</v>

6387
02:50:08.701 --> 02:50:09.300
<v Speaker 1>levels,</v>

6388
02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:10.590
<v Speaker 1>he's got to have the gas tank.</v>

6389
02:50:10.980 --> 02:50:12.120
<v Speaker 1>So you see it now with him,</v>

6390
02:50:12.121 --> 02:50:12.954
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6391
02:50:13.170 --> 02:50:13.471
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

6392
02:50:13.471 --> 02:50:14.310
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>

6393
02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:17.213
<v Speaker 7>Perfect.</v>

6394
02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:19.030
<v Speaker 1>What a nutty division man.</v>

6395
02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:24.040
<v Speaker 1>The heavyweight division is just so different than any other division because</v>

6396
02:50:24.041 --> 02:50:28.600
<v Speaker 1>there are so fucking big and they hit so hard and even though they're big and</v>

6397
02:50:28.601 --> 02:50:29.680
<v Speaker 1>they can take more,</v>

6398
02:50:29.830 --> 02:50:33.370
<v Speaker 1>you just know in the heavyweight division one crazy punch and everything's all</v>

6399
02:50:33.371 --> 02:50:34.204
<v Speaker 1>fucked up,</v>

6400
02:50:34.330 --> 02:50:37.150
<v Speaker 1>you know one way or the other like that was,</v>

6401
02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:39.370
<v Speaker 1>that was a fight that could have gone either way.</v>

6402
02:50:39.430 --> 02:50:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6403
02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean that flight was going back and forth,</v>

6404
02:50:44.170 --> 02:50:46.180
<v Speaker 1>body and the head crazy.</v>

6405
02:50:47.650 --> 02:50:48.483
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

6406
02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:50.293
<v Speaker 7>the overview.</v>

6407
02:50:51.570 --> 02:50:52.403
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

6408
02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:55.460
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that the heavyweight division right now,</v>

6409
02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:56.870
<v Speaker 1>there's not like,</v>

6410
02:50:57.200 --> 02:51:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the big fight between steeping junior dos Santos,</v>

6411
02:51:00.231 --> 02:51:03.560
<v Speaker 1>which is probably going to be some crazy war judge them by their first fight,</v>

6412
02:51:03.950 --> 02:51:06.050
<v Speaker 1>but there's not like clear fights after that.</v>

6413
02:51:06.260 --> 02:51:11.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not like one 85 you got Yo Romero who's waiting right behind him,</v>

6414
02:51:11.181 --> 02:51:12.380
<v Speaker 1>shock array waiting.</v>

6415
02:51:12.410 --> 02:51:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Either one of those guys could be fighting for the title right now and it would</v>

6416
02:51:14.661 --> 02:51:15.500
<v Speaker 1>make a good argument,</v>

6417
02:51:15.530 --> 02:51:16.040
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

6418
02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6419
02:51:16.640 --> 02:51:19.460
<v Speaker 1>All of the other divisions are stacked us as hell.</v>

6420
02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:22.250
<v Speaker 1>The heavyweight division looks better than ever,</v>

6421
02:51:22.760 --> 02:51:27.760
<v Speaker 1>but it still doesn't compare it to like 55 70 and even 85.</v>

6422
02:51:28.010 --> 02:51:29.510
<v Speaker 1>There's so many fights,</v>

6423
02:51:29.511 --> 02:51:30.710
<v Speaker 1>so many awesome fights.</v>

6424
02:51:31.070 --> 02:51:32.330
<v Speaker 1>You know what I think though,</v>

6425
02:51:32.390 --> 02:51:34.100
<v Speaker 1>if there's one guy that stands out,</v>

6426
02:51:34.130 --> 02:51:35.390
<v Speaker 1>it's Francis and Ghana,</v>

6427
02:51:35.840 --> 02:51:38.060
<v Speaker 1>that guy stands out as like one of the scariest.</v>

6428
02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:38.571
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

6429
02:51:38.571 --> 02:51:39.830
<v Speaker 1>he seems scary to me.</v>

6430
02:51:40.250 --> 02:51:41.083
<v Speaker 1>Like I would,</v>

6431
02:51:41.140 --> 02:51:43.430
<v Speaker 1>and I would wonder if they would make this fight,</v>

6432
02:51:43.880 --> 02:51:46.910
<v Speaker 1>but I would love to see if Cain gets super healthy.</v>

6433
02:51:47.630 --> 02:51:47.891
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6434
02:51:47.891 --> 02:51:51.680
<v Speaker 1>if Cain is surgery successful and he feels good when he comes back,</v>

6435
02:51:51.681 --> 02:51:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see Cain vs in Ghana.</v>

6436
02:51:53.930 --> 02:51:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I want to see,</v>

6437
02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:56.720
<v Speaker 1>is the Brazilian in Ghana?</v>

6438
02:51:56.750 --> 02:51:57.111
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6439
02:51:57.111 --> 02:51:57.291
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6440
02:51:57.291 --> 02:51:58.124
<v Speaker 1>He's African.</v>

6441
02:51:58.320 --> 02:51:59.510
<v Speaker 1>He was a big French guy.</v>

6442
02:51:59.570 --> 02:51:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6443
02:51:59.880 --> 02:52:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Where is he lives in Paris.</v>

6444
02:52:01.551 --> 02:52:04.040
<v Speaker 1>But we said the wrong country last time.</v>

6445
02:52:04.041 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I think we said Kim Nigeria and he's from Cameroon.</v>

6446
02:52:06.011 --> 02:52:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

6447
02:52:06.710 --> 02:52:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6448
02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

6449
02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:08.500
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking beast.</v>

6450
02:52:08.710 --> 02:52:09.543
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

6451
02:52:09.610 --> 02:52:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

6452
02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:10.281
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>

6453
02:52:10.281 --> 02:52:11.380

<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see that in slow Mo.</v>

6489
02:53:03.610 --> 02:53:07.640
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like he just caught him in the solar plexus or something or caught</v>

6490
02:53:07.641 --> 02:53:08.650
<v Speaker 1>them like under the rib.</v>

6491

<v Speaker 1>Really interesting man.</v>

6492
02:53:12.340 --> 02:53:13.173
<v Speaker 1>The division,</v>

6493
02:53:13.470 --> 02:53:14.100
<v Speaker 1>what'd he say?</v>

6494
02:53:14.100 --> 02:53:14.500
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

6495
02:53:14.500 --> 02:53:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Most knockouts in UFC heavyweight history.</v>

6496
02:53:16.991 --> 02:53:21.991
<v Speaker 1>He's already third crazy as that loungers number nine history.</v>

6497
02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:24.070
<v Speaker 1>That's is crazy.</v>

6498
02:53:25.300 --> 02:53:25.940
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

6499
02:53:25.940 --> 02:53:27.430
<v Speaker 1>he's only a couple away from the record.</v>

6500
02:53:28.960 --> 02:53:31.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a that there's a lot of fights for him,</v>

6501
02:53:31.800 --> 02:53:33.460
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fights for him at heavyweight now,</v>

6502
02:53:34.270 --> 02:53:35.470
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like I'm</v>

6503
02:53:37.270 --> 02:53:40.240
<v Speaker 1>in Ghana and Cain Velasquez is some shit that I'd like.</v>

6504
02:53:40.270 --> 02:53:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to find out what's going on and I think fighting or who was,</v>

6505
02:53:43.780 --> 02:53:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd heard that it was a potential fight.</v>

6506
02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Rumble Johnson has heard that online,</v>

6507
02:53:48.691 --> 02:53:49.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6508
02:53:49.490 --> 02:53:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6509
02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:50.440
<v Speaker 1>he could do it though.</v>

6510
02:53:50.950 --> 02:53:52.570
<v Speaker 1>He could do it when we're talking about it.</v>

6511
02:53:52.710 --> 02:53:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6512
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:56.650
<v Speaker 1>he fought heavyweight outside the UFC did knock 'em out.</v>

6513
02:53:57.160 --> 02:53:57.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6514
02:53:57.430 --> 02:53:58.270
<v Speaker 1>he wanted decision.</v>

6515
02:53:58.320 --> 02:54:00.730
<v Speaker 1>My Gpa dropped them in the first round of broke his jaw though.</v>

6516
02:54:00.731 --> 02:54:03.610
<v Speaker 1>So horrifically that his jaw was like literally one of these things,</v>

6517
02:54:03.850 --> 02:54:05.350
<v Speaker 1>whether your teeth up.</v>

6518
02:54:05.410 --> 02:54:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen it?</v>

6519
02:54:06.230 --> 02:54:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I remember it happening.</v>

6520
02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:08.890
<v Speaker 1>It was so nasty.</v>

6521
02:54:09.310 --> 02:54:10.121
<v Speaker 1>The pictures of it,</v>

6522
02:54:10.121 --> 02:54:12.370
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he,</v>

6523
02:54:12.730 --> 02:54:16.900
<v Speaker 1>he did it and he did in the first round and then they want fighting,</v>

6524
02:54:17.170 --> 02:54:19.810
<v Speaker 1>fighting the rest of the fight like that now.</v>

6525
02:54:20.290 --> 02:54:20.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6526
02:54:20.411 --> 02:54:25.330
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy to get your job broken then punched again after it's broken half</v>

6527
02:54:25.590 --> 02:54:26.710
<v Speaker 1>like it's maybe like,</v>

6528
02:54:26.711 --> 02:54:27.550
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hurt as bad,</v>

6529
02:54:28.660 --> 02:54:29.493
<v Speaker 1>just go numb.</v>

6530
02:54:29.500 --> 02:54:31.630
<v Speaker 1>You just got to split splitting up a whole,</v>

6531
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:32.620
<v Speaker 1>can I hit with a bat?</v>

6532
02:54:32.621 --> 02:54:33.200
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

6533
02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Because people have fought like that before.</v>

6534
02:54:35.050 --> 02:54:35.883
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6535
02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Kim coture did that and she split her job.</v>

6536
02:54:39.400 --> 02:54:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6537
02:54:39.940 --> 02:54:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Broken.</v>

6538
02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:42.640
<v Speaker 1>That's where it breaks on some people right in the middle.</v>

6539
02:54:43.450 --> 02:54:44.830
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

6540
02:54:44.870 --> 02:54:48.790
<v Speaker 1>She finished force that you have to have to break your jaw and people still</v>

6541
02:54:48.791 --> 02:54:49.421
<v Speaker 1>fight like that.</v>

6542
02:54:49.421 --> 02:54:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And her split to like,</v>

6543
02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:51.880
<v Speaker 1>he was bleeding.</v>

6544
02:54:51.970 --> 02:54:52.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6545
02:54:52.211 --> 02:54:52.990
<v Speaker 1>One up.</v>

6546
02:54:52.990 --> 02:54:53.823
<v Speaker 1>One down.</v>

6547
02:54:54.010 --> 02:54:54.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6548
02:54:54.251 --> 02:54:55.270
<v Speaker 1>It was horrific.</v>

6549
02:54:55.390 --> 02:54:56.141
<v Speaker 1>It that Vegas,</v>

6550
02:54:56.141 --> 02:54:56.974
<v Speaker 1>I think it was she.</v>

6551
02:54:57.280 --> 02:54:57.701
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

6552
02:54:57.701 --> 02:54:58.750
<v Speaker 1>that's got to hurt so bad.</v>

6553
02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:00.473
<v Speaker 1>That's your face.</v>

6554
02:55:02.350 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 1>So this is it,</v>

6555
02:55:04.041 --> 02:55:04.910
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

6556
02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6557
02:55:05.780 --> 02:55:09.980
<v Speaker 1>This should probably be the end of this broadcast is probably one of our most</v>

6558
02:55:09.981 --> 02:55:11.570
<v Speaker 1>boring fight companions ever.</v>

6559
02:55:11.690 --> 02:55:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why we just mellow.</v>

6560
02:55:14.721 --> 02:55:16.340
<v Speaker 1>There was controversy.</v>

6561
02:55:16.370 --> 02:55:17.203
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

6562
02:55:18.020 --> 02:55:18.800
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

6563
02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:19.633
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

6564
02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:22.130
<v Speaker 1>And very little marijuana until deep in.</v>

6565
02:55:22.430 --> 02:55:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6566
02:55:23.090 --> 02:55:23.960
<v Speaker 1>But Derrick Lewis,</v>

6567
02:55:23.961 --> 02:55:24.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6568
02:55:24.171 --> 02:55:24.981
<v Speaker 1>he's gotta be like,</v>

6569
02:55:24.981 --> 02:55:25.461
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

6570
02:55:25.461 --> 02:55:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Like top three contenders now,</v>

6571
02:55:27.501 --> 02:55:27.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6572
02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6573
02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6574
02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:29.690
<v Speaker 1>you got it for doom.</v>

6575
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Dosantos um,</v>

6576
02:55:33.350 --> 02:55:34.340
<v Speaker 1>who else?</v>

6577
02:55:34.700 --> 02:55:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Frances and gone.</v>

6578
02:55:35.541 --> 02:55:36.620
<v Speaker 1>It was like top 10 now,</v>

6579
02:55:36.621 --> 02:55:36.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6580
02:55:36.861 --> 02:55:38.480
<v Speaker 1>He's like six or seven or something like that.</v>

6581
02:55:38.481 --> 02:55:39.980
<v Speaker 1>He's got to be like number three or four.</v>

6582
02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6583
02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

6584
02:55:41.300 --> 02:55:42.133
<v Speaker 1>Derrick Lewis.</v>

6585
02:55:42.260 --> 02:55:43.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a big wind farm man.</v>

6586
02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:44.993
<v Speaker 1>Just do it like that.</v>

6587
02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:45.400
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

6588
02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:46.233
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

6589
02:55:47.010 --> 02:55:47.843
<v Speaker 1>You got to go back to,</v>

6590
02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:48.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6591
02:55:48.141 --> 02:55:51.560
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing when early in his career he got heel kicked in the head.</v>

6592
02:55:51.830 --> 02:55:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Remember he got hooked kicked by Sean Doors.</v>

6593
02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Sean Jordan Hook kicked him.</v>

6594
02:55:56.900 --> 02:55:57.441
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

6595
02:55:57.441 --> 02:55:58.970
<v Speaker 1>The way he did it to mitre owned,</v>

6596
02:55:58.971 --> 02:55:59.630
<v Speaker 1>starched him.</v>

6597
02:55:59.630 --> 02:56:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Remember I sent that,</v>

6598
02:56:00.921 --> 02:56:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I sent him a picture of,</v>

6599
02:56:02.301 --> 02:56:02.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6600
02:56:02.540 --> 02:56:03.230
<v Speaker 1>remember that ad,</v>

6601
02:56:03.230 --> 02:56:04.910
<v Speaker 1>the hippo enhancing hippo.</v>

6602
02:56:04.990 --> 02:56:05.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6603
02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:06.830
<v Speaker 1>After he hit that he'll kick.</v>

6604
02:56:06.831 --> 02:56:09.830
<v Speaker 1>I said in that picture that like good job did well,</v>

6605
02:56:09.831 --> 02:56:12.320
<v Speaker 1>he's a crazy athlete for like as big as he is.</v>

6606
02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Sean Jordan could do back flips and he's 260 pounds round.</v>

6607
02:56:15.770 --> 02:56:16.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6608
02:56:16.041 --> 02:56:17.810
<v Speaker 1>He said he's a fic motherfucker,</v>

6609
02:56:18.350 --> 02:56:19.340
<v Speaker 1>but he uh,</v>

6610
02:56:19.550 --> 02:56:21.800
<v Speaker 1>he stopped Derrick Lewis with a hook kick to the face.</v>

6611
02:56:21.810 --> 02:56:25.550
<v Speaker 1>One of the only hook kick Kaos we didn't Koom with the hook kick,</v>

6612
02:56:25.551 --> 02:56:28.070
<v Speaker 1>but put him on Queer Street and then he put them away afterwards.</v>

6613
02:56:29.090 --> 02:56:33.200
<v Speaker 1>But that's such a weird technique for a giant dude to throw,</v>

6614
02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:33.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6615
02:56:33.610 --> 02:56:34.310
<v Speaker 1>it was like his,</v>

6616
02:56:34.310 --> 02:56:34.850
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

6617
02:56:34.850 --> 02:56:37.250
<v Speaker 1>his head was lower than his ass.</v>

6618
02:56:37.940 --> 02:56:38.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6619
02:56:38.780 --> 02:56:39.613
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

6620
02:56:40.190 --> 02:56:40.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6621
02:56:40.461 --> 02:56:42.380
<v Speaker 1>And he just sort of swung his leg out there,</v>

6622
02:56:42.381 --> 02:56:43.910
<v Speaker 1>but it landed perfect.</v>

6623
02:56:44.030 --> 02:56:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Was,</v>

6624
02:56:44.450 --> 02:56:46.640
<v Speaker 1>and then mitre owned stopped him again.</v>

6625
02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:50.030
<v Speaker 1>I was so bummed out about yesterday about the fate or fight not happening.</v>

6626
02:56:50.750 --> 02:56:52.160
<v Speaker 1>That was such a bummer man.</v>

6627
02:56:52.700 --> 02:56:55.430
<v Speaker 1>They pulled mitre on the day of the fight with a kidney stone.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6630
02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:05.630
<v Speaker 1>And apparently they offered it to check Congo and he said he would do it fade or</v>

6631
02:57:05.631 --> 02:57:09.890
<v Speaker 1>said no and they offered it to the other guy that check Congo FOBT and fit.</v>

6632
02:57:09.891 --> 02:57:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

6657
02:57:40.611 --> 02:57:43.090
<v Speaker 1>back and win by four Roche's knock out.</v>

02:59:42.770 --> 02:59:45.020
<v Speaker 8>well it's only because of your back.</v>

6744
02:59:45.320 --> 02:59:45.950
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

6745
02:59:45.950 --> 02:59:46.251
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

6746
02:59:46.251 --> 02:59:50.630
<v Speaker 8>I had back surgery eight months ago and it's still tender,</v>

6747
02:59:50.690 --> 02:59:51.200
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

6748
02:59:51.200 --> 02:59:51.921
<v Speaker 8>it's still,</v>

6749
02:59:51.921 --> 02:59:53.210
<v Speaker 8>it's not healed all the way.</v>

6750
02:59:53.211 --> 02:59:55.040
<v Speaker 8>And I came back and I did Jujitsu.</v>

6751
02:59:55.280 --> 02:59:56.540
<v Speaker 8>I came back a little too early.</v>

6752
02:59:57.110 --> 02:59:57.261
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

6753
02:59:57.261 --> 03:00:00.620
<v Speaker 8>went hard for like a week and then a man,</v>

6754
03:00:00.621 --> 03:00:01.490
<v Speaker 8>I was in the shower to go,</v>

6755
03:00:01.491 --> 03:00:04.820
<v Speaker 8>my back is sore is how I know what the hell am I doing.</v>

6756
03:00:04.821 --> 03:00:09.170
<v Speaker 8>I just had back surgery so I just how many months was that before you started</v>

6757
03:00:09.171 --> 03:00:10.700
<v Speaker 8>going and started rolling hard again?</v>

6758
03:00:10.700 --> 03:00:12.020
<v Speaker 8>Like at five months.</v>

6759
03:00:12.200 --> 03:00:13.550
<v Speaker 8>What did the doctor say about that?</v>

6760
03:00:13.970 --> 03:00:14.803
<v Speaker 8>I didn't tell him</v>

6761
03:00:16.370 --> 03:00:18.050
<v Speaker 8>but of course know but,</v>

6762
03:00:18.620 --> 03:00:23.620
<v Speaker 8>but the good news is I don't think I did any permanent damage cause I haven't,</v>

6763
03:00:25.230 --> 03:00:27.200
<v Speaker 8>haven't lifted weights and I haven't done,</v>

6764
03:00:27.470 --> 03:00:29.590
<v Speaker 8>I haven't sparked you just I do teach Jujitsu.</v>

6765
03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:34.600
<v Speaker 8>I can teach quite easily up 90% of the positions.</v>

6766
03:00:35.470 --> 03:00:36.020
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

6767
03:00:36.020 --> 03:00:37.040
<v Speaker 8>but it's the pressure.</v>

6768
03:00:37.041 --> 03:00:41.510
<v Speaker 8>Any time someone puts pressure on me and I got to start twisting 100% to get out</v>

6769
03:00:41.511 --> 03:00:43.820
<v Speaker 8>of something or if I have to to it just,</v>

6770
03:00:44.510 --> 03:00:45.910
<v Speaker 8>it just too soon to just,</v>

6771
03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:46.761
<v Speaker 8>I came back too soon.</v>

6772
03:00:46.761 --> 03:00:48.830
<v Speaker 8>So I decided that to,</v>

6773
03:00:48.890 --> 03:00:49.161
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

6774
03:00:49.161 --> 03:00:50.540
<v Speaker 8>I've been wanting to do yoga.</v>

6775
03:00:50.541 --> 03:00:51.980
<v Speaker 8>I know how important yoga is.</v>

6776
03:00:51.981 --> 03:00:53.840
<v Speaker 8>I've been for the last 20 years.</v>

6777
03:00:53.841 --> 03:00:55.010
<v Speaker 8>I'm like I got a deal,</v>

6778
03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:55.873
<v Speaker 8>I got to do yoga.</v>

6779
03:00:55.970 --> 03:01:00.280
<v Speaker 8>You want to be that 75 80 year old guy that could walk on his eventually I've</v>

6780
03:01:00.281 --> 03:01:02.110
<v Speaker 8>always known it but I just been procrastinating.</v>

6781
03:01:02.110 --> 03:01:03.280
<v Speaker 8>I've just been so busy.</v>

6782
03:01:03.430 --> 03:01:04.690
<v Speaker 8>Everyone's doing yoga,</v>

6783
03:01:04.691 --> 03:01:05.800
<v Speaker 8>Danny's doing yoga,</v>

6784
03:01:05.801 --> 03:01:06.730
<v Speaker 8>Joe's doing yoga.</v>

6785
03:01:06.731 --> 03:01:07.740
<v Speaker 8>Everyone's like fuck youngest,</v>

6786
03:01:07.741 --> 03:01:08.574
<v Speaker 8>his shit.</v>

6787
03:01:08.830 --> 03:01:09.760
<v Speaker 8>And they get obsessed with it.</v>

6788
03:01:09.761 --> 03:01:12.110
<v Speaker 8>And I know I had to do it but um,</v>

6789
03:01:12.250 --> 03:01:13.780
<v Speaker 8>this forced me into it finally.</v>

6790
03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:16.690
<v Speaker 8>So it was a blessing in disguise that I came back to where like,</v>

6791
03:01:16.691 --> 03:01:20.500
<v Speaker 8>cause now I'm forced into yoga and um,</v>

6792
03:01:22.330 --> 03:01:24.040
<v Speaker 8>I'm just going to give yoga a chance.</v>

6793
03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:27.130
<v Speaker 8>It's tough cause I do the hottest class and it's hard man.</v>

6794
03:01:27.131 --> 03:01:28.600
<v Speaker 8>I'm like a total wipe out man.</v>

6795
03:01:28.601 --> 03:01:29.680
<v Speaker 8>I'm just like falling apart.</v>

6796
03:01:29.681 --> 03:01:32.320
<v Speaker 8>And there was so hot and so it's the hardest one,</v>

6797
03:01:32.321 --> 03:01:35.230
<v Speaker 8>but it's that the best time I love 10 30 in the morning.</v>

6798
03:01:35.231 --> 03:01:36.700
<v Speaker 8>I wake up 10 15.</v>

6799
03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:38.890
<v Speaker 8>I just get in my car and I just jammed down the street.</v>

6800
03:01:38.891 --> 03:01:40.730
<v Speaker 8>I get in the right when I literally,</v>

6801
03:01:40.731 --> 03:01:42.700
<v Speaker 8>I get out of bed and go to yoga.</v>

6802
03:01:42.700 --> 03:01:43.630
<v Speaker 8>It's perfect timing.</v>

6803
03:01:43.900 --> 03:01:44.980
<v Speaker 8>It's perfect for my life,</v>

6804
03:01:44.981 --> 03:01:47.080
<v Speaker 8>but it just so happens it's the hottest one,</v>

6805
03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:48.250
<v Speaker 8>the hardest one.</v>

6806
03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:48.941
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>

6807
03:01:48.941 --> 03:01:49.181
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

6808
03:01:49.181 --> 03:01:49.481
<v Speaker 8>and I,</v>

6809
03:01:49.481 --> 03:01:52.000
<v Speaker 8>and I conk out halfway through 30 minutes that I'm dead.</v>

6810
03:01:52.001 --> 03:01:52.511
<v Speaker 8>I'm just lying.</v>

6811
03:01:52.511 --> 03:01:53.890
<v Speaker 8>They're just completely drenched in sweat,</v>

6812
03:01:53.891 --> 03:01:54.724
<v Speaker 8>just dead.</v>

6813
03:01:54.730 --> 03:01:55.330
<v Speaker 8>And um,</v>

6814
03:01:55.330 --> 03:01:57.670
<v Speaker 8>but I've only done it for like a month.</v>

6815
03:01:57.671 --> 03:01:58.270
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

6816
03:01:58.270 --> 03:01:58.571
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

6817
03:01:58.571 --> 03:02:00.430
<v Speaker 8>I'm proud that I could go 30 minutes,</v>

6818
03:02:00.431 --> 03:02:00.970
<v Speaker 8>you know what I mean?</v>

6819
03:02:00.970 --> 03:02:01.151
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>

6820
03:02:01.151 --> 03:02:02.110
<v Speaker 8>I'm not hard on myself.</v>

6821
03:02:02.111 --> 03:02:02.321
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

6822
03:02:02.321 --> 03:02:03.010
<v Speaker 8>shit,</v>

6823
03:02:03.010 --> 03:02:06.820
<v Speaker 8>it's hard to breathe in this motherfucker and to hold those poses in pictures.</v>

6824
03:02:06.910 --> 03:02:08.560
<v Speaker 8>Yoga looks so easy.</v>

6825
03:02:08.561 --> 03:02:10.570
<v Speaker 8>It's like they're doing this big deal,</v>

6826
03:02:10.571 --> 03:02:14.410
<v Speaker 8>but to hold your hands up like 90% of the time for an hour,</v>

6827
03:02:14.620 --> 03:02:15.650
<v Speaker 8>you're always holding your head,</v>

6828
03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:16.241
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>

6829
03:02:16.241 --> 03:02:17.590
<v Speaker 8>that kills your shoulders and you're like,</v>

6830
03:02:17.740 --> 03:02:18.460
<v Speaker 8>I can't even,</v>

6831
03:02:18.460 --> 03:02:20.320
<v Speaker 8>I can't even hold my hands off anymore.</v>

6832
03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:21.660
<v Speaker 8>It's so hard to explain.</v>

6833
03:02:21.710 --> 03:02:22.500
<v Speaker 8>We go with it.</v>

6834
03:02:22.500 --> 03:02:22.651
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

6835
03:02:22.651 --> 03:02:24.660
<v Speaker 5>there's certain poses that you do like this one,</v>

6836
03:02:24.661 --> 03:02:25.381
<v Speaker 5>like the beginning,</v>

6837
03:02:25.381 --> 03:02:28.860
<v Speaker 5>one of the beginning poses where you have your hands together like this and you</v>

6838
03:02:28.920 --> 03:02:30.450
<v Speaker 5>keep your palms touch.</v>

6839
03:02:30.570 --> 03:02:32.210
<v Speaker 5>You have to keep your palms touching it,</v>

6840
03:02:32.211 --> 03:02:33.120
<v Speaker 5>pressing against.</v>

6841
03:02:33.270 --> 03:02:36.090
<v Speaker 5>You could have facet and have your hands separate,</v>

6842
03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:37.110
<v Speaker 5>your elbows bent,</v>

6843
03:02:37.350 --> 03:02:41.460
<v Speaker 5>but when you're fully extended and you're keeping your palms touching,</v>

6844
03:02:41.490 --> 03:02:42.720
<v Speaker 5>it's very difficult.</v>

6845
03:02:42.780 --> 03:02:45.930
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult to maintain struggle.</v>

6846
03:02:46.470 --> 03:02:46.981
<v Speaker 5>It's hard,</v>

6847
03:02:46.981 --> 03:02:47.340
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

6848
03:02:47.340 --> 03:02:48.173
<v Speaker 5>That's hard.</v>

6849
03:02:48.500 --> 03:02:52.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm that beginner guy that's just running out of every class I have to run out</v>

6850
03:02:52.881 --> 03:02:57.270
<v Speaker 5>and take a break at the 30 35% they don't let you leave at my place.</v>

6851
03:02:57.720 --> 03:02:58.800
<v Speaker 5>She goes out and says,</v>

6852
03:02:58.801 --> 03:03:01.590
<v Speaker 5>does anybody need to leave a?</v>

6853
03:03:01.770 --> 03:03:05.700
<v Speaker 5>You have to clear that with me and please let's not walk in and out.</v>

6854
03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:06.660
<v Speaker 5>Just try.</v>

6855
03:03:06.660 --> 03:03:08.580
<v Speaker 5>Just if just lay there,</v>

6856
03:03:08.581 --> 03:03:09.391
<v Speaker 5>don't do nothing,</v>

6857
03:03:09.391 --> 03:03:10.224
<v Speaker 5>don't lead.</v>

6858
03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:11.011
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>

6859
03:03:11.011 --> 03:03:11.844
<v Speaker 5>I leave.</v>

6860
03:03:14.190 --> 03:03:16.980
<v Speaker 5>I've only left the class because I had to throw up.</v>

6861
03:03:17.070 --> 03:03:18.930
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was going to throw a highly in the room.</v>

6862
03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:20.140
<v Speaker 5>I came in,</v>

6863
03:03:20.140 --> 03:03:21.960
<v Speaker 5>I was a little bit sick and,</v>

6864
03:03:21.961 --> 03:03:22.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6865
03:03:22.170 --> 03:03:25.350
<v Speaker 5>I pushed a little too hard and then somewhere around an hour in,</v>

6866
03:03:25.351 --> 03:03:25.770
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

6867
03:03:25.770 --> 03:03:27.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna fucking throw up.</v>

6868
03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:28.400
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

6869
03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:29.233
<v Speaker 5>that's me every day.</v>

6870
03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:31.860
<v Speaker 5>So I had to stop and lay down and I was like,</v>

6871
03:03:31.861 --> 03:03:33.990
<v Speaker 5>maybe I can calm myself down and get back to it.</v>

6872
03:03:34.020 --> 03:03:35.700
<v Speaker 5>And then when I get back up I was,</v>

6873
03:03:35.701 --> 03:03:36.390
<v Speaker 5>it was worse.</v>

6874
03:03:36.390 --> 03:03:36.751
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

6875
03:03:36.751 --> 03:03:37.680
<v Speaker 5>I've got to get outside.</v>

6876
03:03:38.310 --> 03:03:39.660
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that was the toughest.</v>

6877
03:03:39.661 --> 03:03:42.480
<v Speaker 5>I thought that was a normal yoga class and I was a super was.</v>

6878
03:03:42.630 --> 03:03:44.460
<v Speaker 5>So I just went and it was the perfect timing.</v>

6879
03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:45.001
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

6880
03:03:45.001 --> 03:03:45.331
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

6881
03:03:45.331 --> 03:03:45.661
<v Speaker 5>this is like,</v>

6882
03:03:45.661 --> 03:03:46.890
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was a normal class.</v>

6883
03:03:46.891 --> 03:03:47.611
<v Speaker 5>They turn up the heat,</v>

6884
03:03:47.611 --> 03:03:49.350
<v Speaker 5>you hear about hot yoga and um,</v>

6885
03:03:50.270 --> 03:03:50.670
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

6886
03:03:50.670 --> 03:03:51.870
<v Speaker 5>I can't even breathe.</v>

6887
03:03:52.110 --> 03:03:52.470
<v Speaker 5>And when they,</v>

6888
03:03:52.470 --> 03:03:56.820
<v Speaker 5>when she opens up the door at the 30 minute mark to let some fresh air in,</v>

6889
03:03:57.170 --> 03:03:58.130
<v Speaker 5>that's like some</v>

6890
03:03:58.130 --> 03:04:00.980
<v Speaker 3>kind of wind of God and eternal life,</v>

6891
03:04:01.160 --> 03:04:02.250
<v Speaker 3>like just flushes.</v>

6892
03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:03.710
<v Speaker 3>You feel that when and you're like,</v>

6893
03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:04.940
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

6894
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:06.730
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're drinking what?</v>

6895
03:04:06.740 --> 03:04:10.280
<v Speaker 3>You know you're dying of thirst in the desert and you've got a giant bottle of</v>

6896
03:04:10.281 --> 03:04:11.114
<v Speaker 3>cold water.</v>

6897
03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:13.540
<v Speaker 3>That's what it feels like that when rue,</v>

6898
03:04:13.580 --> 03:04:14.413
<v Speaker 3>I need that win.</v>

6899
03:04:14.690 --> 03:04:15.860
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't realize,</v>

6900
03:04:15.861 --> 03:04:17.210
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was a normal class.</v>

6901
03:04:17.630 --> 03:04:18.470
<v Speaker 3>And I went up to the,</v>

6902
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:20.000
<v Speaker 3>to the front desk and I said,</v>

6903
03:04:20.290 --> 03:04:20.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

6904
03:04:20.660 --> 03:04:22.060
<v Speaker 3>are all classes this hot?</v>

6905
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:22.320
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

6906
03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:22.821
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6907
03:04:22.821 --> 03:04:23.800
<v Speaker 3>this is the hottest one.</v>

6908
03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:25.760
<v Speaker 3>There's classes without any heat at all.</v>

6909
03:04:25.761 --> 03:04:28.070
<v Speaker 3>There's different levels and you're at the hardest one.</v>

6910
03:04:28.071 --> 03:04:28.311
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

6911
03:04:28.311 --> 03:04:29.144
<v Speaker 3>no shit,</v>

6912
03:04:29.390 --> 03:04:30.810
<v Speaker 3>no wonder I fall apart in that.</v>

6913
03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:33.950
<v Speaker 3>But the last day I went Friday,</v>

6914
03:04:34.190 --> 03:04:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I made it through the whole class,</v>

6915
03:04:37.430 --> 03:04:38.120
<v Speaker 3>but I had,</v>

6916
03:04:38.120 --> 03:04:40.310
<v Speaker 3>I set up my towel right by the door smart.</v>

6917
03:04:40.370 --> 03:04:41.390
<v Speaker 3>So when she opens it up,</v>

6918
03:04:41.391 --> 03:04:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I get that rush.</v>

6919
03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:43.161
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to leave.</v>

6920
03:04:43.161 --> 03:04:44.210
<v Speaker 3>David can right there.</v>

6921
03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:46.550
<v Speaker 3>My problem was going to the other side of the room.</v>

6922
03:04:46.970 --> 03:04:48.140
<v Speaker 3>I was too deep.</v>

6923
03:04:48.470 --> 03:04:49.370
<v Speaker 3>I was too deep.</v>

6924
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:54.440
<v Speaker 3>So the is just line up right next to that door mat right there.</v>

6925
03:04:54.441 --> 03:04:55.274
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

6926
03:04:55.580 --> 03:04:57.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm there five minutes early and shit.</v>

6927
03:04:58.000 --> 03:04:58.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6928
03:04:58.750 --> 03:04:59.571
<v Speaker 3>and when I first went,</v>

6929
03:04:59.571 --> 03:05:00.400
<v Speaker 3>I first went in,</v>

6930
03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:02.450
<v Speaker 3>I felt I didn't want to be that total wipe out.</v>

6931
03:05:02.451 --> 03:05:03.410
<v Speaker 3>So everyone's stretching out.</v>

6932
03:05:03.411 --> 03:05:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's wrong every once in like a different poems and stretching.</v>

6933
03:05:06.110 --> 03:05:09.320
<v Speaker 3>So all I can do is I can get into full lotus on like in Lotus.</v>

6934
03:05:09.321 --> 03:05:09.681
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

6935
03:05:09.681 --> 03:05:09.981
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6936
03:05:09.981 --> 03:05:10.814
<v Speaker 3>like now what?</v>

6937
03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:12.140
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just sitting there,</v>

6938
03:05:12.320 --> 03:05:12.980
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

6939
03:05:12.980 --> 03:05:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Cause I can't stretch any other way.</v>

6940
03:05:14.391 --> 03:05:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I have zero flexibility.</v>

6941
03:05:17.180 --> 03:05:18.740
<v Speaker 3>This motherfucker's or guru.</v>

6942
03:05:18.770 --> 03:05:19.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6943
03:05:19.460 --> 03:05:19.761
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

6944
03:05:19.761 --> 03:05:20.720
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was thinking.</v>

6945
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:22.340
<v Speaker 3>But they never got to know full load.</v>

6946
03:05:22.341 --> 03:05:22.461
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

6947
03:05:22.461 --> 03:05:23.290
<v Speaker 3>you never do that.</v>

6948
03:05:23.290 --> 03:05:24.740
<v Speaker 3>And the routines,</v>

6949
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:27.100
<v Speaker 3>we were doing all this shit I can't do like when,</v>

6950
03:05:27.140 --> 03:05:28.430
<v Speaker 3>when we get into Lotus,</v>

6951
03:05:30.880 --> 03:05:32.410
<v Speaker 3>I've never done Lotus and agent.</v>

6952
03:05:32.420 --> 03:05:33.310
<v Speaker 3>That yoga class,</v>

6953
03:05:33.320 --> 03:05:34.310
<v Speaker 3>that pigeon one though.</v>

6954
03:05:34.311 --> 03:05:35.480
<v Speaker 3>You do a single notice.</v>

6955
03:05:36.650 --> 03:05:41.650
<v Speaker 3>That's basically you're getting the same stretch the toe stand when you have it</v>

6956
03:05:42.350 --> 03:05:43.640
<v Speaker 3>up like pigeon one yes.</v>

6957
03:05:43.920 --> 03:05:44.753
<v Speaker 3>Your face down.</v>

6958
03:05:45.260 --> 03:05:45.381
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6959
03:05:45.381 --> 03:05:45.500
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

6960
03:05:45.500 --> 03:05:45.591
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

6961
03:05:45.591 --> 03:05:46.251
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about that,</v>

6962
03:05:46.251 --> 03:05:46.860
<v Speaker 3>that one too,</v>

6963
03:05:46.860 --> 03:05:48.080
<v Speaker 3>that was like tree,</v>

6964
03:05:48.081 --> 03:05:49.300
<v Speaker 3>some tree.</v>

6965
03:05:49.460 --> 03:05:51.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm still confused with the terminology.</v>

6966
03:05:51.171 --> 03:05:51.471
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

6967
03:05:51.471 --> 03:05:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

6968
03:05:52.130 --> 03:05:53.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm like one of those dudes that comes at 10th Plan.</v>

6969
03:05:53.801 --> 03:05:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

6970
03:05:54.320 --> 03:05:55.580
<v Speaker 3>crack had what?</v>

6971
03:05:56.650 --> 03:06:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Like I've been doing it for two years and I barely pay attention to what the</v>

6972
03:06:00.081 --> 03:06:00.914
<v Speaker 3>names of things are.</v>

6973
03:06:01.940 --> 03:06:02.773
<v Speaker 3>Slowly.</v>

6974
03:06:02.910 --> 03:06:03.743
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6975
03:06:04.020 --> 03:06:04.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6976
03:06:04.490 --> 03:06:08.090
<v Speaker 3>you know what inspired me is Joey Diaz doing Jujitsu and he's always telling me</v>

6977
03:06:08.091 --> 03:06:09.140
<v Speaker 3>the stories of those first,</v>

6978
03:06:09.170 --> 03:06:11.870
<v Speaker 3>the first day that he w he walked away,</v>

6979
03:06:11.871 --> 03:06:12.810
<v Speaker 3>he showed up and then like,</v>

6980
03:06:13.070 --> 03:06:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I forget how the story goes exactly.</v>

6981
03:06:15.020 --> 03:06:17.540
<v Speaker 3>But he had a real horrible time in Jujitsu,</v>

6982
03:06:17.541 --> 03:06:18.470
<v Speaker 3>but he kept going.</v>

6983
03:06:18.471 --> 03:06:20.030
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't even shrimp across the room.</v>

6984
03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:21.500
<v Speaker 3>He said he couldn't even shrimp.</v>

6985
03:06:21.680 --> 03:06:22.700
<v Speaker 3>He would just be dead.</v>

6986
03:06:22.701 --> 03:06:23.481
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't breathe.</v>

6987
03:06:23.481 --> 03:06:24.314
<v Speaker 3>He had leave.</v>

6988
03:06:24.350 --> 03:06:27.320
<v Speaker 3>You had to go outside and get some oxygen.</v>

6989
03:06:27.830 --> 03:06:29.120
<v Speaker 3>And I thought about that.</v>

6990
03:06:29.270 --> 03:06:29.590
<v Speaker 3>I might,</v>

6991
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:32.540
<v Speaker 3>Joey stuck it out and I have no choice.</v>

6992
03:06:32.720 --> 03:06:33.261
<v Speaker 3>I have no choice.</v>

6993
03:06:33.261 --> 03:06:35.030
<v Speaker 3>I know I cannot quit yoga.</v>

6994
03:06:35.031 --> 03:06:36.320
<v Speaker 3>So from this point on,</v>

6995
03:06:36.980 --> 03:06:37.251
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

6996
03:06:37.251 --> 03:06:37.970
<v Speaker 3>I want to flake,</v>

6997
03:06:37.970 --> 03:06:38.900
<v Speaker 3>but I know I can't.</v>

6998
03:06:39.280 --> 03:06:40.640
<v Speaker 3>It's going to help you or do you just,</v>

6999
03:06:40.641 --> 03:06:41.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

7000
03:06:41.400 --> 03:06:42.080
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

7001
03:06:42.080 --> 03:06:45.860
<v Speaker 3>And I'm going to give it some time and we'll see how I feel in six months on my</v>

7002
03:06:45.861 --> 03:06:46.694
<v Speaker 3>back fields.</v>

7003
03:06:47.390 --> 03:06:50.630
<v Speaker 3>It's feeling pretty good now,</v>

7004
03:06:50.631 --> 03:06:52.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's still tender and in some places,</v>

7005
03:06:52.761 --> 03:06:54.350
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't done any Jiu Jitsu,</v>

7006
03:06:54.351 --> 03:06:56.040
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know if be doing Jujitsu right now.</v>

7007
03:06:56.310 --> 03:06:57.720
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it'd be sore as hell again.</v>

7008
03:06:57.721 --> 03:06:59.430
<v Speaker 5>So it's really hard to tell.</v>

7009
03:06:59.710 --> 03:07:00.360
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

7010

7013
03:07:04.891 --> 03:07:09.891
<v Speaker 5>just to see if maybe yoga will work as therapy is therapy to fix my head.</v>

7014
03:07:13.370 --> 03:07:14.510

03:07:30.390 --> 03:07:30.921
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

7025
03:07:30.921 --> 03:07:31.754
<v Speaker 5>So I'm thinking it's,</v>

7026
03:07:31.800 --> 03:07:32.940
<v Speaker 5>it's his style of yoga,</v>

7027
03:07:32.941 --> 03:07:33.810
<v Speaker 5>but it's still yoga.</v>

7028
03:07:34.260 --> 03:07:35.011
<v Speaker 5>It's still younger.</v>

7029
03:07:35.011 --> 03:07:35.401
<v Speaker 5>What he's doing,</v>

7030
03:07:35.401 --> 03:07:35.851
<v Speaker 5>it's his style.</v>

7031
03:07:35.851 --> 03:07:36.750
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's got their style.</v>

7032
03:07:37.080 --> 03:07:38.370
<v Speaker 5>So I'm thinking,</v>

7033
03:07:38.371 --> 03:07:38.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

7034
03:07:38.910 --> 03:07:39.330
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

7035
03:07:39.330 --> 03:07:40.690
<v Speaker 5>I under I,</v>

7036
03:07:41.070 --> 03:07:43.320
<v Speaker 5>it's just hard for me to breathe in there and eventually I'll,</v>

7037
03:07:43.321 --> 03:07:43.591
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

7038
03:07:43.591 --> 03:07:44.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be really into it.</v>

7039
03:07:44.641 --> 03:07:46.740
<v Speaker 5>You got to do before you go,</v>

7040
03:07:46.741 --> 03:07:47.200
<v Speaker 5>there you go.</v>

7041
03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:47.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't drink that.</v>

7042
03:07:47.760 --> 03:07:50.790
<v Speaker 5>Drink a lot of water within an hour or so before you go,</v>

7043
03:07:50.791 --> 03:07:51.241
<v Speaker 5>that's hard.</v>

7044
03:07:51.241 --> 03:07:52.440
<v Speaker 5>Cause I woke up and just go.</v>

7045
03:07:52.500 --> 03:07:53.333
<v Speaker 5>I understand.</v>

7046
03:07:53.360 --> 03:07:55.350
<v Speaker 5>But that's part of why you're having a hard time.</v>

7047
03:07:55.351 --> 03:07:56.640
<v Speaker 5>It's a very grueling,</v>

7048
03:07:56.641 --> 03:07:58.060
<v Speaker 5>rigorous physical workout.</v>

7049
03:07:58.350 --> 03:08:01.590
<v Speaker 5>You want to have some food in you hearing them squats,</v>

7050
03:08:01.620 --> 03:08:01.801
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7051
03:08:01.801 --> 03:08:03.990
<v Speaker 5>But you're not on any kind of key to genic diet or anything,</v>

7052
03:08:03.991 --> 03:08:04.320
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7053
03:08:04.320 --> 03:08:04.800
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

7054
03:08:04.800 --> 03:08:05.041
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

7055
03:08:05.041 --> 03:08:07.350
<v Speaker 5>So that means your body is burning off blue glucose.</v>

7056
03:08:07.530 --> 03:08:09.240
<v Speaker 5>So you're burning off carbs.</v>

7057
03:08:09.270 --> 03:08:10.200
<v Speaker 5>So if that's the case,</v>

7058
03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:12.090
<v Speaker 5>you need eat something before you go there.</v>

7059
03:08:12.280 --> 03:08:14.730
<v Speaker 5>Like you're not going to have any fucking energy just like you wouldn't do</v>

7060
03:08:14.731 --> 03:08:15.690
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu that way.</v>

7061
03:08:15.690 --> 03:08:17.160
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't do yoga that way either.</v>

7062
03:08:17.640 --> 03:08:19.140
<v Speaker 5>I know you've done Jujitsu hungry before.</v>

7063
03:08:19.141 --> 03:08:19.974
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible.</v>

7064
03:08:20.100 --> 03:08:23.370
<v Speaker 5>So worst feeling in the world when you're hungry and you go to Jujitsu and you</v>

7065
03:08:23.380 --> 03:08:26.180
<v Speaker 5>your your fucking gassed out because you're feeling weak.</v>

7066
03:08:26.340 --> 03:08:27.690
<v Speaker 5>But if you didn't even have a Clif bar,</v>

7067
03:08:28.140 --> 03:08:30.900
<v Speaker 5>you had nothing like you've ever lift weights when you're hungry,</v>

7068
03:08:31.230 --> 03:08:31.881
<v Speaker 5>it's terrible,</v>

7069
03:08:31.881 --> 03:08:32.340
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7070
03:08:32.340 --> 03:08:33.360
<v Speaker 5>You feel so weak.</v>

7071
03:08:33.361 --> 03:08:34.180
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>

7072
03:08:34.180 --> 03:08:34.590
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

7073
03:08:34.590 --> 03:08:35.251
<v Speaker 5>that's my problem.</v>

7074
03:08:35.251 --> 03:08:36.390
<v Speaker 5>I got to eat gummy.</v>

7075
03:08:36.930 --> 03:08:37.920
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man,</v>

7076
03:08:37.921 --> 03:08:39.520
<v Speaker 5>I gotta wake up 15 minutes earlier.</v>

7077
03:08:39.580 --> 03:08:40.470
<v Speaker 5>No more than that.</v>

7078
03:08:40.471 --> 03:08:40.921
<v Speaker 5>More than that.</v>

7079
03:08:40.921 --> 03:08:41.970
<v Speaker 5>I wake up an hour earlier.</v>

7080
03:08:43.170 --> 03:08:44.370
<v Speaker 5>You want it to digest,</v>

7081
03:08:44.460 --> 03:08:45.293
<v Speaker 5>wake up,</v>

7082
03:08:45.540 --> 03:08:46.081
<v Speaker 5>eat your food.</v>

7083
03:08:46.081 --> 03:08:47.380
<v Speaker 5>There's some beating exercises and then go.</v>

7084
03:08:48.580 --> 03:08:49.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

7085
03:08:49.020 --> 03:08:50.220
<v Speaker 5>but if you were going to go running,</v>

7086
03:08:50.250 --> 03:08:52.050
<v Speaker 5>what kind of shit would you do before you went running?</v>

7087
03:08:52.410 --> 03:08:53.243
<v Speaker 5>What would you eat?</v>

7088
03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:54.690
<v Speaker 5>Who Runs?</v>

7089
03:08:54.690 --> 03:08:55.523
<v Speaker 5>If you were gonna die,</v>

7090
03:08:56.540 --> 03:08:58.060
<v Speaker 5>ask asking rates.</v>

7091
03:08:58.170 --> 03:08:59.003
<v Speaker 5>Sprints in the pool.</v>

7092
03:08:59.370 --> 03:09:00.840
<v Speaker 5>They'll sprints in the pool that you were doing.</v>

7093
03:09:00.990 --> 03:09:02.760
<v Speaker 5>If you had to do that and you knew you're going to do that,</v>

7094
03:09:02.761 --> 03:09:05.280
<v Speaker 5>and how long would you want to eat beforehand?</v>

7095
03:09:07.980 --> 03:09:08.850
<v Speaker 5>Probably like two hours,</v>

7096
03:09:08.851 --> 03:09:09.450
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7097
03:09:09.450 --> 03:09:11.460
<v Speaker 5>Maybe even more or something like that.</v>

7098
03:09:11.490 --> 03:09:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I would like maybe even three hours before I empty stomach Clif bar.</v>

7099
03:09:16.201 --> 03:09:17.820
<v Speaker 5>Get right to it and you're fine.</v>

7100
03:09:17.850 --> 03:09:18.600
<v Speaker 5>Clif bar,</v>

7101
03:09:18.600 --> 03:09:20.790
<v Speaker 5>it's like perfect Ms. Sugar gazing.</v>

7102
03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:22.080
<v Speaker 5>You don't get right into it.</v>

7103
03:09:22.220 --> 03:09:23.610
<v Speaker 5>We're going to have to ease into shit.</v>

7104
03:09:23.710 --> 03:09:24.930
<v Speaker 5>It's really light.</v>

7105
03:09:25.290 --> 03:09:29.660
<v Speaker 5>Just enough to get you going to power through the round before.</v>

7106
03:09:29.670 --> 03:09:31.530
<v Speaker 5>Before I do seminars,</v>

7107
03:09:31.531 --> 03:09:33.480
<v Speaker 5>that's my ritual is a Clif bar.</v>

7108
03:09:33.570 --> 03:09:36.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to go to breakfast and have French toast or some bullshit like</v>

7109
03:09:36.721 --> 03:09:37.260
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

7110
03:09:37.260 --> 03:09:39.120
<v Speaker 5>I just want a Clif bar and let's go.</v>

7111
03:09:39.180 --> 03:09:39.331
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

7112
03:09:39.331 --> 03:09:39.751
<v Speaker 5>that's good.</v>

7113
03:09:39.751 --> 03:09:41.130
<v Speaker 5>Foreign rock star fucking love French,</v>

7114
03:09:41.131 --> 03:09:41.560
<v Speaker 5>so that's,</v>

7115
03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:42.061
<v Speaker 5>that's good.</v>

7116
03:09:42.061 --> 03:09:45.040
<v Speaker 5>That's a long as you have something where you need something similar to that to</v>

7117
03:09:45.070 --> 03:09:45.770
<v Speaker 5>a young discipline.</v>

7118
03:09:45.770 --> 03:09:49.680
<v Speaker 5>Maybe a little more because I think yoga is more akin to those pools.</v>

7119
03:09:49.681 --> 03:09:52.980
<v Speaker 5>Sprints than it is the teaching a seminar yogas.</v>

7120
03:09:53.020 --> 03:09:54.010
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking really</v>

7121
03:09:54.010 --> 03:09:55.500
<v Speaker 3>hard because everything you're doing,</v>

7122
03:09:55.540 --> 03:09:57.610
<v Speaker 3>you're doing 100% if you're doing it right,</v>

7123
03:09:57.850 --> 03:09:58.690
<v Speaker 3>you're balancing,</v>

7124
03:09:58.691 --> 03:10:00.000
<v Speaker 3>you're holding these positions,</v>

7125
03:10:00.540 --> 03:10:04.690
<v Speaker 3>you're flexing your stomach and you're tightening up your back and you're</v>

7126
03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:09.960
<v Speaker 3>extending your legs and you're minding your body that these are all the</v>

7127
03:10:10.181 --> 03:10:12.040
<v Speaker 3>movements I still need.</v>

7128
03:10:12.041 --> 03:10:12.671
<v Speaker 3>I still want,</v>

7129
03:10:12.671 --> 03:10:13.780
<v Speaker 3>cause you're not there for very long.</v>

7130
03:10:13.781 --> 03:10:17.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like long routines and you go throw up your some positions just once,</v>

7131
03:10:17.471 --> 03:10:18.760
<v Speaker 3>maybe twice you go back to it.</v>

7132
03:10:18.910 --> 03:10:19.331
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

7133
03:10:19.331 --> 03:10:22.540
<v Speaker 3>There's so many other ways you can twist and bend your body.</v>

7134
03:10:22.541 --> 03:10:24.500
<v Speaker 3>It's basically just reminding everybody,</v>

7135
03:10:24.580 --> 03:10:26.710
<v Speaker 3>don't shut this down.</v>

7136
03:10:26.711 --> 03:10:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Don't shut that down.</v>

7137
03:10:28.510 --> 03:10:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Don't shut this down.</v>

7138
03:10:30.041 --> 03:10:31.050
<v Speaker 3>I need this working.</v>

7139
03:10:31.350 --> 03:10:33.400
<v Speaker 3>It just every day it's reminding of body,</v>

7140
03:10:33.940 --> 03:10:36.760
<v Speaker 3>don't shut this shit down because if you don't remind your body,</v>

7141
03:10:36.910 --> 03:10:39.910
<v Speaker 3>you will get shut down and you'll be that 75 year old guy that can barely walk</v>

7142
03:10:39.911 --> 03:10:40.720
<v Speaker 3>to the TV,</v>

7143
03:10:40.720 --> 03:10:41.553
<v Speaker 3>turn it on and go,</v>

7144
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:42.170
<v Speaker 3>go to the bathroom,</v>

7145
03:10:42.170 --> 03:10:42.870
<v Speaker 3>take a Piss,</v>

7146
03:10:42.870 --> 03:10:46.690
<v Speaker 3>walked to his car to go to the market can barely move and you're 75 you're just</v>

7147
03:10:46.691 --> 03:10:47.524
<v Speaker 3>like ready to go.</v>

7148
03:10:48.190 --> 03:10:49.810
<v Speaker 3>You taught your body to be like that.</v>

7149
03:10:49.990 --> 03:10:51.520
<v Speaker 3>There's enough old dude's,</v>

7150
03:10:51.521 --> 03:10:52.630
<v Speaker 3>it looks Helio Gracie,</v>

7151
03:10:52.631 --> 03:10:57.520
<v Speaker 3>he was in his nineties and he was still out and about doing armbars on people.</v>

7152
03:10:57.730 --> 03:10:58.563
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

7153
03:10:59.470 --> 03:11:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Yoga is the best way cause it goes through everything.</v>

7154
03:11:02.681 --> 03:11:03.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

7155
03:11:03.220 --> 03:11:04.330
<v Speaker 3>it's like all organized.</v>

7156
03:11:04.331 --> 03:11:04.511
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

7157
03:11:04.511 --> 03:11:05.080
<v Speaker 3>We got,</v>

7158
03:11:05.080 --> 03:11:08.530
<v Speaker 3>we mapped out all the twists and the bends and all the holds and all the ways</v>

7159
03:11:08.531 --> 03:11:12.430
<v Speaker 3>you could use your own body wave instead of external weights.</v>

7160
03:11:12.431 --> 03:11:15.640
<v Speaker 3>You're using your body and all these different ways and hitting all your</v>

7161
03:11:15.641 --> 03:11:16.120
<v Speaker 3>muscles.</v>

7162
03:11:16.120 --> 03:11:17.410
<v Speaker 3>At first I thought that was no,</v>

7163
03:11:18.010 --> 03:11:18.940
<v Speaker 3>I thought the whole was,</v>

7164
03:11:18.941 --> 03:11:22.720
<v Speaker 3>that was no clinching and in Yoga,</v>

7165
03:11:22.721 --> 03:11:23.111
<v Speaker 3>but there is,</v>

7166
03:11:23.111 --> 03:11:24.570
<v Speaker 3>you clinch your legs all the Goddamn time.</v>

7167
03:11:24.580 --> 03:11:25.540
<v Speaker 3>There's all these positions.</v>

7168
03:11:25.541 --> 03:11:27.370
<v Speaker 3>We had clenching and you're squeezing too.</v>

7169
03:11:27.760 --> 03:11:30.120
<v Speaker 3>So really there's Yogas,</v>

7170
03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:30.790
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

7171
03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:31.623
<v Speaker 3>That's all you,</v>

7172
03:11:31.630 --> 03:11:32.380
<v Speaker 3>it seems.</v>

7173
03:11:32.380 --> 03:11:34.870
<v Speaker 3>DDP was always tell him he gave me a yoga lesson.</v>

7174
03:11:35.050 --> 03:11:37.120
<v Speaker 3>We went to 25 and finished and he showed me what his DB,</v>

7175
03:11:37.180 --> 03:11:38.620
<v Speaker 3>DDP Yoga was all about.</v>

7176
03:11:38.950 --> 03:11:41.470
<v Speaker 3>And at that point I wasn't ready to stop lifting weights.</v>

7177
03:11:41.770 --> 03:11:42.041
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

7178
03:11:42.041 --> 03:11:44.200
<v Speaker 3>I just want to like if I stopped lifting weights,</v>

7179
03:11:44.500 --> 03:11:44.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7180
03:11:44.771 --> 03:11:46.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to lose all my strength and I,</v>

7181
03:11:46.060 --> 03:11:46.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7182
03:11:46.360 --> 03:11:47.020
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

7183
03:11:47.020 --> 03:11:47.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7184
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

7185
03:11:47.920 --> 03:11:49.000
<v Speaker 3>paranoid about that shit.</v>

7186
03:11:49.210 --> 03:11:50.590
<v Speaker 3>But now I have no choice.</v>

7187
03:11:50.710 --> 03:11:54.190
<v Speaker 3>I gotta stop the wades focus on yoga and um,</v>

7188
03:11:55.120 --> 03:11:55.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7189
03:11:55.600 --> 03:11:58.030
<v Speaker 3>once I master all the Shit and get my balance together,</v>

7190
03:11:58.060 --> 03:12:02.770
<v Speaker 3>I see how you can turn up the strength and really gets him,</v>

7191
03:12:03.460 --> 03:12:03.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7192
03:12:03.850 --> 03:12:07.660
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to get all the strength you need from yoga if done properly.</v>

7193
03:12:07.690 --> 03:12:08.980
<v Speaker 3>I am hoping,</v>

7194
03:12:09.100 --> 03:12:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping it's not going to have the same amount of ability to pull things,</v>

7195
03:12:13.540 --> 03:12:14.620
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>

7196
03:12:14.621 --> 03:12:16.480
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to stop lifting weights.</v>

7197
03:12:16.870 --> 03:12:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no reason to stop just because you're doing that.</v>

7198
03:12:19.840 --> 03:12:22.720
<v Speaker 3>I think it might have totally different way of lifting weights now,</v>

7199
03:12:23.140 --> 03:12:23.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7200
03:12:23.561 --> 03:12:26.680
<v Speaker 3>and the first person I had heard about this from was actually Felicia.</v>

7201
03:12:26.710 --> 03:12:26.931
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

7202
03:12:26.931 --> 03:12:27.641
<v Speaker 3>you know Felicia?</v>

7203
03:12:27.641 --> 03:12:27.791
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

7204
03:12:27.791 --> 03:12:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Teaches people that he'd do kettlebells.</v>

7205
03:12:30.160 --> 03:12:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Kettlebells.</v>

7206
03:12:30.610 --> 03:12:31.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7207
03:12:31.090 --> 03:12:35.200
<v Speaker 3>She was telling me a long time ago about not going to failure a long time ago.</v>

7208
03:12:35.201 --> 03:12:35.591
<v Speaker 3>She was saying,</v>

7209
03:12:35.591 --> 03:12:38.890
<v Speaker 3>she's like always leave something in a tank and they just do it more often.</v>

7210
03:12:39.140 --> 03:12:39.551
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

7211
03:12:39.551 --> 03:12:40.960
<v Speaker 3>don't do it to failure.</v>

7212
03:12:41.350 --> 03:12:41.801
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

7213
03:12:41.801 --> 03:12:42.101
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

7214
03:12:42.101 --> 03:12:42.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's interesting.</v>

7215
03:12:42.941 --> 03:12:43.870
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't look into it.</v>

7216
03:12:43.871 --> 03:12:46.870
<v Speaker 3>And then I heard Pavel Tatsu Alene talk about it years later.</v>

7217
03:12:46.871 --> 03:12:48.040
<v Speaker 3>It's good news by the way.</v>

7218
03:12:49.300 --> 03:12:52.070
<v Speaker 3>So what I do now is I don't weights to the point</v>

7219
03:12:52.070 --> 03:12:53.660
<v Speaker 4>where like I like last set,</v>

7220
03:12:54.830 --> 03:12:55.663
<v Speaker 4>I don't do that.</v>

7221
03:12:56.180 --> 03:12:57.260
<v Speaker 4>I do less sets,</v>

7222
03:12:57.920 --> 03:12:59.000
<v Speaker 4>I do less reps,</v>

7223
03:12:59.420 --> 03:13:00.440
<v Speaker 4>I just do it more often.</v>

7224
03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:02.000
<v Speaker 4>I'll do it like two or three times a week.</v>

7225
03:13:02.001 --> 03:13:04.310
<v Speaker 4>So I'm never super sore so I'll get out of it.</v>

7226
03:13:04.311 --> 03:13:05.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm never exhausted.</v>

7227
03:13:05.540 --> 03:13:07.880
<v Speaker 4>And the difference between this kind of strength work and the other kind of</v>

7228
03:13:07.881 --> 03:13:09.680
<v Speaker 4>strength worth cause the other strength worth,</v>

7229
03:13:09.710 --> 03:13:10.370
<v Speaker 4>I would do it,</v>

7230
03:13:10.370 --> 03:13:13.940
<v Speaker 4>I would blow my shit out and then I was done for like a day,</v>

7231
03:13:13.941 --> 03:13:15.500
<v Speaker 4>two days and just super sore,</v>

7232
03:13:15.501 --> 03:13:16.310
<v Speaker 4>couldn't do anything.</v>

7233
03:13:16.310 --> 03:13:17.480
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm never like that.</v>

7234
03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:18.301
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

7235
03:13:18.301 --> 03:13:20.270
<v Speaker 4>the idea that we always had of like,</v>

7236
03:13:20.271 --> 03:13:21.180
<v Speaker 4>you gotta go to fail,</v>

7237
03:13:21.181 --> 03:13:23.470
<v Speaker 4>you've got to break everything down to build it back up to a week.</v>

7238
03:13:23.540 --> 03:13:25.370
<v Speaker 4>The body part policy says bullshit.</v>

7239
03:13:25.730 --> 03:13:26.061
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

7240
03:13:26.061 --> 03:13:26.181
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

7241
03:13:26.181 --> 03:13:27.680
<v Speaker 4>you just do it less often.</v>

7242
03:13:27.710 --> 03:13:31.940
<v Speaker 4>Take bigger breaks in between the sets and do it more often during the week.</v>

7243
03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:32.930
<v Speaker 4>That's a fantastic,</v>

7244
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.621
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

7245
03:13:33.621 --> 03:13:38.621
<v Speaker 4>I think these motherfuckers out there in a lazy cause it's still takes time and</v>

7246
03:13:38.841 --> 03:13:40.110
<v Speaker 4>you still do it with a lot of effort,</v>

7247
03:13:40.150 --> 03:13:42.950
<v Speaker 4>but he's like anything more than five reps is bodybuilding.</v>

7248
03:13:42.980 --> 03:13:43.281
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

7249
03:13:43.281 --> 03:13:44.780
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to do more than five reps.</v>

7250
03:13:44.781 --> 03:13:45.650
<v Speaker 4>You want to do short,</v>

7251
03:13:45.830 --> 03:13:46.640
<v Speaker 4>shorter,</v>

7252
03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:47.300
<v Speaker 4>shorter sets.</v>

7253
03:13:47.300 --> 03:13:48.660
<v Speaker 4>Where'd you find this out at?</v>

03:14:11.061 --> 03:14:11.481
<v Speaker 4>did you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>when you did your Max every like once a day,</v>

7271
03:14:14.570 --> 03:14:15.110
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>

7272
03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.651
<v Speaker 4>Once a day,</v>

7273
03:14:15.651 --> 03:14:16.311
<v Speaker 4>did he or Max,</v>

7274
03:14:16.311 --> 03:14:18.530
<v Speaker 4>he think he's talking about that kind of stuff.</v>

7275
03:14:19.070 --> 03:14:22.190
<v Speaker 4>If you had a pull up bar at your house and every day,</v>

7276
03:14:22.191 --> 03:14:26.180
<v Speaker 4>every day you did like a 10 in the morning and then 10 at night,</v>

7277
03:14:26.330 --> 03:14:27.860
<v Speaker 4>which is not to failure.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

7280
03:14:32.120 --> 03:14:36.140
<v Speaker 4>if you can do seven chin ups with a 50 pound kettlebell hanging from your waist</v>

7281
03:14:36.141 --> 03:14:37.130
<v Speaker 4>instead of doing seven,</v>

7282
03:14:37.131 --> 03:14:37.611
<v Speaker 4>that's too much.</v>

7283
03:14:37.611 --> 03:14:38.444
<v Speaker 4>One to three.</v>

7284
03:14:38.900 --> 03:14:41.930
<v Speaker 4>If you can do 15 chin-ups straight,</v>

7285
03:14:42.560 --> 03:14:47.040
<v Speaker 4>do seven just do five to seven do it often.</v>

7286
03:14:47.570 --> 03:14:49.010
<v Speaker 4>That's a different way of getting strong.</v>

7287
03:14:49.040 --> 03:14:49.700
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

7288

<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

7290
03:14:51.390 --> 03:14:52.223
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

7291
03:14:52.290 --> 03:14:53.750
<v Speaker 4>It actually gets stronger quicker.</v>

7292
03:14:53.900 --> 03:14:54.650
<v Speaker 4>My wife's strong.</v>

7293
03:14:54.650 --> 03:14:57.010
<v Speaker 4>Appropriate because you don't get beat up a pill up,</v>

7294
03:14:57.011 --> 03:14:57.380
<v Speaker 4>pull up,</v>

7295
03:14:57.380 --> 03:14:58.520
<v Speaker 4>pull up bars are amazing.</v>

7296
03:14:58.880 --> 03:15:00.110
<v Speaker 4>They're great for your shoulders,</v>

7297
03:15:00.111 --> 03:15:01.640
<v Speaker 4>hang from him all the time.</v>

7298
03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:03.590
<v Speaker 4>If you get those goddamn gravity boots,</v>

7299
03:15:03.680 --> 03:15:05.000
<v Speaker 4>you split those into those.</v>

7300
03:15:05.090 --> 03:15:06.560
<v Speaker 4>You can hang from your ankles.</v>

7301
03:15:06.590 --> 03:15:08.300
<v Speaker 4>You can sort of loosen your backup from there.</v>

7302
03:15:08.301 --> 03:15:10.520
<v Speaker 4>You can do those setups from your ankles.</v>

7303
03:15:10.600 --> 03:15:10.930
<v Speaker 4>Hang.</v>

7304
03:15:10.930 --> 03:15:15.230
<v Speaker 4>Are you doing a little l with your legs when you're hanging on my bar have to,</v>

7305
03:15:15.260 --> 03:15:17.070
<v Speaker 4>I have to lift my legs up and my bar.</v>

7306
03:15:17.071 --> 03:15:17.841
<v Speaker 4>I have to buzz that.</v>

7307
03:15:17.841 --> 03:15:18.320
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

7308
03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:19.190
<v Speaker 4>I like system.</v>

7309
03:15:19.310 --> 03:15:19.761
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

7310
03:15:19.761 --> 03:15:22.460
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't give you the same benefits or your lower back cause you're</v>

7311
03:15:22.461 --> 03:15:23.294
<v Speaker 4>tightened up.</v>

7312
03:15:23.450 --> 03:15:24.970
<v Speaker 4>I like to do it in a hang.</v>

7313
03:15:25.010 --> 03:15:25.821
<v Speaker 4>I'm unfortunately,</v>

7314
03:15:25.821 --> 03:15:27.530
<v Speaker 4>my bar at home is not tall enough.</v>

7315
03:15:27.531 --> 03:15:28.520
<v Speaker 4>I should get one that's taller.</v>

7316
03:15:28.880 --> 03:15:32.150
<v Speaker 4>I like to hang where my feet aren't touching the ground so I could relax my</v>

7317
03:15:32.151 --> 03:15:32.601
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

7318
03:15:32.601 --> 03:15:36.110
<v Speaker 4>Totally let my gyms go to gyms on the road.</v>

7319
03:15:36.140 --> 03:15:37.670
<v Speaker 4>A lot of gyms on the road we'll have like a,</v>

7320
03:15:38.030 --> 03:15:38.601
<v Speaker 4>you know a bar.</v>

7321
03:15:38.601 --> 03:15:39.070
<v Speaker 4>That's what,</v>

7322
03:15:39.070 --> 03:15:41.780
<v Speaker 4>whatever the height is that where your arms are fully extended?</v>

7323
03:15:41.781 --> 03:15:43.180
<v Speaker 4>Probably more for other people.</v>

7324
03:15:43.181 --> 03:15:43.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

7325
03:15:43.430 --> 03:15:44.031
<v Speaker 4>I'm only five,</v>

7326
03:15:44.031 --> 03:15:47.540
<v Speaker 4>eight but I can hold onto that bar and if my toes aren't touching the ground</v>

7327
03:15:47.541 --> 03:15:49.190
<v Speaker 4>then I can relax my back.</v>

7328
03:15:49.490 --> 03:15:50.310
<v Speaker 4>And when I'm relaxed</v>

7329
03:15:50.310 --> 03:15:50.821
<v Speaker 5>my back,</v>

7330
03:15:50.821 --> 03:15:54.210
<v Speaker 5>I could feel it like extending and just sort of loosening up.</v>

7331
03:15:54.420 --> 03:15:56.400
<v Speaker 5>But between that and yoga exercises,</v>

7332
03:15:56.401 --> 03:16:00.120
<v Speaker 5>like the one where your reach behind your calves and you grab your heel and your</v>

7333
03:16:00.140 --> 03:16:00.630
<v Speaker 5>stent,</v>

7334
03:16:00.630 --> 03:16:02.700
<v Speaker 5>that is pop in my back like crazy.</v>

7335
03:16:02.940 --> 03:16:04.200
<v Speaker 5>Like I feel my back.</v>

7336
03:16:04.201 --> 03:16:05.130
<v Speaker 5>Every time I do it,</v>

7337
03:16:05.131 --> 03:16:06.330
<v Speaker 5>I feel a little pup pup.</v>

7338
03:16:06.540 --> 03:16:11.070
<v Speaker 5>I could feel my back stretching and the amount of tension that I carry in my</v>

7339
03:16:11.071 --> 03:16:11.940
<v Speaker 5>back and like,</v>

7340
03:16:11.941 --> 03:16:12.870
<v Speaker 5>like during the day,</v>

7341
03:16:12.871 --> 03:16:14.150
<v Speaker 5>like being sitting in a chair,</v>

7342
03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:15.000
<v Speaker 5>sitting in my car,</v>

7343
03:16:15.270 --> 03:16:16.590
<v Speaker 5>it's almost nonexistent now.</v>

7344
03:16:16.710 --> 03:16:18.030
<v Speaker 5>It's just from doing yoga a lot.</v>

7345
03:16:19.580 --> 03:16:21.480
<v Speaker 5>I think it strengthens the whole spinal column.</v>

7346
03:16:21.481 --> 03:16:22.410
<v Speaker 5>That's huge for it.</v>

7347
03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:22.651
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

7348
03:16:22.651 --> 03:16:23.040
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

7349
03:16:23.040 --> 03:16:24.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've gained so much from Yoga.</v>

7350
03:16:24.661 --> 03:16:25.110
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

7351
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:28.320
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing it for probably four years now.</v>

7352
03:16:28.390 --> 03:16:29.223
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

7353
03:16:31.500 --> 03:16:32.333
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

7354
03:16:33.270 --> 03:16:33.930
<v Speaker 5>not enough.</v>

7355
03:16:33.930 --> 03:16:35.940
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel like it helps your kicks a week?</v>

7356
03:16:36.370 --> 03:16:36.750
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

7357
03:16:36.750 --> 03:16:37.231
<v Speaker 5>maybe.</v>

7358
03:16:37.231 --> 03:16:39.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean there was times where I was doing it three days a week,</v>

7359
03:16:39.091 --> 03:16:40.710
<v Speaker 5>but then there were times I didn't do it for a few months,</v>

7360
03:16:40.711 --> 03:16:41.260
<v Speaker 5>so it's just,</v>

7361
03:16:41.260 --> 03:16:46.020
<v Speaker 5>just always I have a yearly subscription or a yearly pass to the place at my</v>

7362
03:16:46.021 --> 03:16:47.340
<v Speaker 5>house three times a week.</v>

7363
03:16:47.341 --> 03:16:50.400
<v Speaker 5>If I'm in town on the weekend two times a week when I go out of town,</v>

7364
03:16:50.520 --> 03:16:51.420
<v Speaker 5>just for right now,</v>

7365
03:16:51.570 --> 03:16:52.020
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

7366
03:16:52.020 --> 03:16:55.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to hang through the whole class and trying to get my belts</v>

7367
03:16:55.891 --> 03:16:56.220
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

7368
03:16:56.220 --> 03:16:57.001
<v Speaker 5>Like all those poses,</v>

7369
03:16:57.001 --> 03:16:58.500
<v Speaker 5>like the standing splits and all that.</v>

7370
03:16:58.930 --> 03:16:59.763
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

7371
03:17:01.250 --> 03:17:02.970
<v Speaker 5>I've been able to do that.</v>

7372
03:17:02.971 --> 03:17:03.510
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

7373
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:05.100
<v Speaker 5>There's so much shit like that.</v>

7374
03:17:05.101 --> 03:17:05.791
<v Speaker 5>Just the side,</v>

7375
03:17:05.791 --> 03:17:06.061
<v Speaker 5>Ben,</v>

7376
03:17:06.061 --> 03:17:09.210
<v Speaker 5>when you do the side bend and I go down right here,</v>

7377
03:17:09.480 --> 03:17:10.410
<v Speaker 5>this is what I do,</v>

7378
03:17:10.880 --> 03:17:12.900
<v Speaker 5>and then there's that back surgery.</v>

7379
03:17:13.140 --> 03:17:15.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's like where it really bends.</v>

7380
03:17:15.030 --> 03:17:16.980
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about the lowest link.</v>

7381
03:17:20.300 --> 03:17:21.133
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

7382
03:17:21.570 --> 03:17:23.020
<v Speaker 5>there's this one lady in my class.</v>

7383
03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:23.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

7384
03:17:23.370 --> 03:17:25.770
<v Speaker 5>there's One lady in my class at the waist.</v>

7385
03:17:25.771 --> 03:17:27.480
<v Speaker 5>She can just literally take a right turn.</v>

7386
03:17:27.600 --> 03:17:29.010
<v Speaker 5>It's the freakiest thing ever.</v>

7387
03:17:29.011 --> 03:17:32.200
<v Speaker 5>Like what is going on with your rib cage is doing that.</v>

7388
03:17:33.200 --> 03:17:34.033
<v Speaker 5>Is it that um,</v>

7389
03:17:34.530 --> 03:17:39.530
<v Speaker 5>her bones are lined up in a special way or that that's a possibility?</v>

7390
03:17:40.260 --> 03:17:41.160
<v Speaker 5>Anybody could do that.</v>

7391
03:17:41.161 --> 03:17:42.660
<v Speaker 5>If they stretched properly,</v>

7392
03:17:42.690 --> 03:17:44.100
<v Speaker 5>anybody would be able to do that sheet.</v>

7393
03:17:44.101 --> 03:17:45.510
<v Speaker 5>This one day in my class,</v>

7394
03:17:45.511 --> 03:17:46.440
<v Speaker 5>she goes so far.</v>

7395
03:17:46.441 --> 03:17:46.771
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

7396
03:17:46.771 --> 03:17:49.650
<v Speaker 5>I just can't imagine that my body has ever been able to do that.</v>

7397
03:17:50.170 --> 03:17:50.910
<v Speaker 5>Not as much,</v>

7398
03:17:50.910 --> 03:17:55.650
<v Speaker 5>but is there a way to take a regular guy like me or you have no side Ben,</v>

7399
03:17:56.010 --> 03:18:00.060
<v Speaker 5>and it's just like tendons and muscles that have to be stretched,</v>

7400
03:18:00.061 --> 03:18:00.390
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7401
03:18:00.390 --> 03:18:00.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7402
03:18:00.610 --> 03:18:02.190
<v Speaker 5>It was actually have a pretty good side,</v>

7403
03:18:02.191 --> 03:18:04.200
<v Speaker 5>but my side bends actually pretty good.</v>

7404
03:18:04.230 --> 03:18:04.711
<v Speaker 5>But what?</v>

7405
03:18:04.711 --> 03:18:06.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm fast can you get really good?</v>

7406
03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:08.250
<v Speaker 5>Can anybody get really good at that?</v>

7407
03:18:08.370 --> 03:18:10.770
<v Speaker 5>I think anybody think you can get real good at it,</v>

7408
03:18:10.771 --> 03:18:12.600
<v Speaker 5>but I'm never going to get as good as that lady.</v>

7409
03:18:13.070 --> 03:18:13.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7410
03:18:13.530 --> 03:18:14.520
<v Speaker 5>Her body just goes,</v>

7411
03:18:14.521 --> 03:18:14.820
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

7412
03:18:14.820 --> 03:18:15.690
<v Speaker 5>this lady in my class,</v>

7413
03:18:15.691 --> 03:18:17.130
<v Speaker 5>her body just goes over the,</v>

7414
03:18:17.190 --> 03:18:18.570
<v Speaker 5>we could get good at basketball,</v>

7415
03:18:18.571 --> 03:18:20.010
<v Speaker 5>but doesn't mean you're going to be Michael Jackson.</v>

7416
03:18:22.590 --> 03:18:23.423
<v Speaker 5>What am I saying,</v>

7417
03:18:23.500 --> 03:18:24.333

03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:27.300
<v Speaker 5>I do that all the time.</v>

7420
03:18:27.740 --> 03:18:30.540
<v Speaker 5>Michael Jordan is the Michael Jackson of basketball.</v>

7421
03:18:30.570 --> 03:18:31.403
<v Speaker 5>Good point.</v>

03:18:35.460 --> 03:18:36.370
<v Speaker 5>back beans.</v>

03:18:36.390 --> 03:18:37.250
<v Speaker 5>What about backbends?</v>

7425
03:18:37.260 --> 03:18:38.250
<v Speaker 5>How far can you go back?</v>

7436
03:18:51.970 --> 03:18:52.761
<v Speaker 2>I think you know,</v>

7437
03:18:52.761 --> 03:18:53.620
<v Speaker 2>it's like Jujitsu.</v>

7438
03:18:54.060 --> 03:18:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm done trying to,</v>

7440
03:18:57.641 --> 03:18:59.470
<v Speaker 2>right now it's really embarrassing.</v>

7441
03:18:59.500 --> 03:19:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Everyone looks over at me and they're like,</v>

7442
03:19:01.090 --> 03:19:01.691
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

7444
03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I can definitely show you Abbott and Costello episode.</v>

7445
03:19:08.860 --> 03:19:10.060
<v Speaker 2>You have them doing yoga.</v>

7446
03:19:10.061 --> 03:19:10.810
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

7447
03:19:10.810 --> 03:19:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible.</v>

7448
03:19:12.130 --> 03:19:12.701
<v Speaker 2>You'll get better,</v>

7449
03:19:12.701 --> 03:19:13.534
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

7450
03:19:13.930 --> 03:19:15.340
<v Speaker 2>The worst balance,</v>

7451
03:19:16.740 --> 03:19:18.330
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to call moves,</v>

7452
03:19:18.331 --> 03:19:19.164
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7453
03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Just think of how I'm talking about standing,</v>

7454
03:19:21.011 --> 03:19:21.910
<v Speaker 2>standing matter.</v>

7455
03:19:21.911 --> 03:19:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Think about how good you got.</v>

7456
03:19:22.970 --> 03:19:23.651
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu moves,</v>

7457
03:19:23.651 --> 03:19:24.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7458
03:19:24.160 --> 03:19:26.710
<v Speaker 2>That's you're going to be able to get that good with yoga as well.</v>

7459
03:19:26.740 --> 03:19:26.991
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

7460
03:19:26.991 --> 03:19:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

7461
03:19:27.360 --> 03:19:29.050
<v Speaker 2>you just gotta be willing to put in the time.</v>

7462
03:19:29.680 --> 03:19:30.341
<v Speaker 2>The way I describe it,</v>

7463
03:19:30.341 --> 03:19:31.720
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're building a mountain,</v>

7464
03:19:32.050 --> 03:19:37.050
<v Speaker 2>one layer of paint at a time and so for me it's like two years in,</v>

7465
03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I still suck.</v>

7466
03:19:39.070 --> 03:19:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good at it.</v>

7467
03:19:39.970 --> 03:19:41.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking forward to it.</v>

7468
03:19:41.081 --> 03:19:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Definitely better than I was.</v>

7469
03:19:42.580 --> 03:19:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7470
03:19:42.880 --> 03:19:44.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm way better at Yoga than I was.</v>

7471
03:19:44.650 --> 03:19:46.360
<v Speaker 2>You probably can do a lot of the yoga.</v>

7472
03:19:46.361 --> 03:19:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Should you have a crazy balance from taekwondo?</v>

7473
03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Like Geo Martinez?</v>

7474
03:19:50.640 --> 03:19:50.831
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

7475
03:19:50.831 --> 03:19:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Richie Martinez.</v>

7476
03:19:51.760 --> 03:19:54.010
<v Speaker 2>They could jump into yoga right now and just cruise right.</v>

7477
03:19:54.860 --> 03:19:55.541
<v Speaker 2>That'd be easy.</v>

7478
03:19:55.541 --> 03:19:57.250
<v Speaker 2>They would want to do some crazy yoga,</v>

7479
03:19:57.251 --> 03:19:57.791
<v Speaker 2>some power,</v>

7480
03:19:57.791 --> 03:19:58.421
<v Speaker 2>Yoga and shit.</v>

7481
03:19:58.421 --> 03:20:00.010
<v Speaker 2>We have to do those side things from there.</v>

7482
03:20:00.020 --> 03:20:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Like legs are extended versions.</v>

7483
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:04.930
<v Speaker 2>There are options.</v>

7484
03:20:04.931 --> 03:20:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Like there's certain spots where you could sit in frog or you could stand frog</v>

7485
03:20:08.051 --> 03:20:11.080
<v Speaker 2>or you could work on your inversion right here and some people are doing crazy</v>

7486
03:20:11.081 --> 03:20:11.830
<v Speaker 2>handstands.</v>

7487
03:20:11.830 --> 03:20:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm in frog easily.</v>

7488
03:20:13.420 --> 03:20:14.021
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

7489
03:20:14.021 --> 03:20:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>

7490
03:20:14.530 --> 03:20:15.363
<v Speaker 2>this is my,</v>

7491
03:20:15.520 --> 03:20:16.810
<v Speaker 2>my world frog.</v>

7492
03:20:16.811 --> 03:20:17.644
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding?</v>

7493
03:20:17.770 --> 03:20:18.521
<v Speaker 2>That's the best one.</v>

7494
03:20:18.521 --> 03:20:21.160
<v Speaker 2>I got the best yoga pose I crushed with frog.</v>

7495
03:20:21.670 --> 03:20:22.590
<v Speaker 2>That's bone.</v>

7496
03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:23.430
<v Speaker 2>This is my,</v>

7497
03:20:23.430 --> 03:20:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I do this every day and Jujitsu.</v>

7498
03:20:25.870 --> 03:20:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Well most of the classes that we do the uh,</v>

7499
03:20:28.810 --> 03:20:33.810
<v Speaker 2>what fails me first is my feet and that's way less than it was before.</v>

7500
03:20:33.911 --> 03:20:38.530
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting to me is I always thought that like from kickboxing or</v>

7501
03:20:38.570 --> 03:20:38.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7502
03:20:38.831 --> 03:20:41.410
<v Speaker 2>just even lifting weights and my feet are probably pretty strong.</v>

7503
03:20:41.860 --> 03:20:43.150
<v Speaker 2>My feet are so weak.</v>

7504
03:20:43.360 --> 03:20:45.100
<v Speaker 2>It's kinda crazy how weak they are.</v>

7505
03:20:45.310 --> 03:20:46.660
<v Speaker 2>And with Yoga,</v>

7506
03:20:46.690 --> 03:20:50.350
<v Speaker 2>like the thing that would hurt the most is the arches of my feet.</v>

7507
03:20:50.530 --> 03:20:51.820
<v Speaker 2>My feet would start hurting.</v>

7508
03:20:52.120 --> 03:20:53.320
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't happen anymore.</v>

7509
03:20:53.410 --> 03:20:55.390
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting is that was always happening.</v>

7510
03:20:55.391 --> 03:20:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Also what I would go skiing too,</v>

7511
03:20:57.311 --> 03:20:58.090
<v Speaker 2>when I'll go schemes,</v>

7512
03:20:58.090 --> 03:20:58.481
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

7513
03:20:58.481 --> 03:20:58.911
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

7514
03:20:58.911 --> 03:21:01.570
<v Speaker 2>get these fat fucking caveman feet.</v>

7515
03:21:01.600 --> 03:21:02.440
<v Speaker 2>They're too wide.</v>

7516
03:21:02.470 --> 03:21:03.610
<v Speaker 2>So they don't fit into most,</v>

7517
03:21:03.640 --> 03:21:06.280
<v Speaker 2>most of the shoes have to buy my own shoes because they don't fit in.</v>

7518
03:21:06.281 --> 03:21:08.380
<v Speaker 2>The ones that are like if I buy a size 11,</v>

7519
03:21:08.381 --> 03:21:09.370
<v Speaker 2>they don't fit my size.</v>

7520
03:21:09.371 --> 03:21:11.730
<v Speaker 2>11 I have to get like size 11 has to be wider.</v>

7521
03:21:11.731 --> 03:21:14.380
<v Speaker 2>It is to and my foot would always hurt.</v>

7522
03:21:14.381 --> 03:21:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

7523
03:21:14.710 --> 03:21:15.071
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

7524
03:21:15.071 --> 03:21:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Jim went louder or something.</v>

7525
03:21:17.560 --> 03:21:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Something happened here.</v>

7526
03:21:18.340 --> 03:21:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Did it disconnect with them?</v>

7527
03:21:20.710 --> 03:21:21.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7528
03:21:22.210 --> 03:21:25.270
<v Speaker 2>but my foot would always hurt the most when I was small.</v>

7529
03:21:25.530 --> 03:21:26.331
<v Speaker 2>That's what his shoulder,</v>

7530
03:21:26.331 --> 03:21:27.190
<v Speaker 2>it's not real.</v>

7531
03:21:27.520 --> 03:21:28.353
<v Speaker 2>It's not a belt.</v>

7532
03:21:28.660 --> 03:21:29.261
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

7533
03:21:29.261 --> 03:21:29.441
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

7534
03:21:29.441 --> 03:21:30.400
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have a belt.</v>

7535
03:21:30.490 --> 03:21:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

7536
03:21:30.750 --> 03:21:31.583
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

7537
03:21:31.820 --> 03:21:32.653
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

7538
03:21:33.370 --> 03:21:34.900
<v Speaker 2>That's some shit you buy at the store.</v>

7539
03:21:37.450 --> 03:21:38.250
<v Speaker 2>I drank.</v>

7540
03:21:38.250 --> 03:21:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

7541
03:21:38.900 --> 03:21:40.020

7542
03:21:40.160 --> 03:21:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

7543
03:21:40.450 --> 03:21:41.830
<v Speaker 2>did you fuck up and drink one of those?</v>

7544
03:21:41.920 --> 03:21:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

7545
03:21:42.580 --> 03:21:42.971
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

7546
03:21:42.971 --> 03:21:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't touch my cannot getting me son of a bitch.</v>

7547
03:21:46.580 --> 03:21:47.930
<v Speaker 5>I said no at first.</v>

7548
03:21:48.110 --> 03:21:49.580
<v Speaker 5>So he convinced me.</v>

7549
03:21:49.610 --> 03:21:50.151
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

7550
03:21:50.151 --> 03:21:51.950
<v Speaker 5>from doing yoga for two years now,</v>

7551
03:21:51.951 --> 03:21:53.180
<v Speaker 5>my feet don't hurt anymore.</v>

7552
03:21:53.240 --> 03:21:54.290
<v Speaker 5>They don't hurt in yoga.</v>

7553
03:21:54.350 --> 03:21:58.280
<v Speaker 5>My balance fails me before my feet family or my hamstrings get sore.</v>

7554
03:21:58.370 --> 03:21:59.400
<v Speaker 5>Oh my caps.</v>

7555
03:21:59.410 --> 03:22:00.021
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

7556
03:22:00.021 --> 03:22:01.930
<v Speaker 5>I have the weakest calves on the jobs.</v>

7557
03:22:02.190 --> 03:22:03.170
<v Speaker 5>I have no cabs,</v>

7558
03:22:03.171 --> 03:22:03.710
<v Speaker 5>ma'am.</v>

7559
03:22:03.710 --> 03:22:04.850
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't hurt me at all.</v>

7560
03:22:04.851 --> 03:22:05.684
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting.</v>

7561
03:22:06.500 --> 03:22:07.220
<v Speaker 5>My meats,</v>

7562

03:22:08.121 --> 03:22:09.500
<v Speaker 5>it's always my hamstrings hurting.</v>

7564
03:22:09.501 --> 03:22:10.131
<v Speaker 5>Like when that one,</v>

7565
03:22:10.131 --> 03:22:12.950
<v Speaker 5>these standing on one leg and you're pulling your foot back and extending your</v>

7566
03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:13.833
<v Speaker 5>lag,</v>

7567
03:22:13.880 --> 03:22:17.330
<v Speaker 5>it's always Mike supporting hamstrings like about enough for you.</v>

7568
03:22:17.331 --> 03:22:18.100
<v Speaker 5>You fuck.</v>

03:22:18.100 --> 03:22:18.900
<v Speaker 5>And like my feet.</v>

7570
03:22:18.900 --> 03:22:19.130
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

7571
03:22:19.130 --> 03:22:19.311
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

7572
03:22:19.311 --> 03:22:21.080
<v Speaker 5>I mean arches of my feet just kill me.</v>

7573
03:22:21.630 --> 03:22:21.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

7574
03:22:21.860 --> 03:22:22.071
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

7575
03:22:22.071 --> 03:22:24.500
<v Speaker 5>I just have to like not have to sit on my ass.</v>

7576
03:22:24.560 --> 03:22:26.480
<v Speaker 5>That's the one thing that doesn't happen anymore.</v>

7577
03:22:26.481 --> 03:22:27.141
<v Speaker 5>It's shocking.</v>

7578
03:22:27.141 --> 03:22:32.030
<v Speaker 5>It took literally look over a year and then after a year and my foot just from</v>

7579
03:22:32.031 --> 03:22:32.511
<v Speaker 5>steady,</v>

7580
03:22:32.511 --> 03:22:33.291
<v Speaker 5>going steady,</v>

7581
03:22:33.291 --> 03:22:33.861
<v Speaker 5>going steady,</v>

7582
03:22:33.861 --> 03:22:34.640
<v Speaker 5>sucking,</v>

7583
03:22:34.640 --> 03:22:38.120
<v Speaker 5>my foot's eventually got strong enough where it doesn't happen at all anymore.</v>

7584
03:22:38.210 --> 03:22:39.470
<v Speaker 5>So now when I go skiing,</v>

7585
03:22:39.560 --> 03:22:40.760
<v Speaker 5>my feet don't bother me at all.</v>

7586
03:22:40.761 --> 03:22:45.761
<v Speaker 5>I got 30% better as a skier because of yoga hundred percent cause my big problem</v>

7592
03:22:49.220 --> 03:22:50.001
<v Speaker 5>I was always freaked out.</v>

7593
03:22:50.001 --> 03:22:50.181
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

7594
03:22:50.181 --> 03:22:51.110
<v Speaker 5>why do my feet hurt?</v>

7595
03:22:51.130 --> 03:22:51.963
<v Speaker 5>Like getting good at it.</v>

7596
03:22:52.210 --> 03:22:52.490
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

7597
03:22:52.490 --> 03:22:53.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty good guys.</v>

7598
03:22:53.300 --> 03:22:53.781
<v Speaker 5>Not Good.</v>

7599
03:22:53.781 --> 03:22:54.231
<v Speaker 5>Like real,</v>

7600
03:22:54.231 --> 03:22:55.190
<v Speaker 5>just a snowboarding.</v>

7601
03:22:55.520 --> 03:22:56.660
<v Speaker 5>I'll switch this with the promise.</v>

7602
03:22:56.661 --> 03:22:57.620
<v Speaker 5>Snowboarding is fun.</v>

7603
03:22:57.740 --> 03:22:58.670
<v Speaker 5>I bet it's awesome.</v>

7604
03:22:58.730 --> 03:23:00.440
<v Speaker 5>But if you fall down,</v>

7605
03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:04.390
<v Speaker 5>you kind of tend to fall on your fucking head because a lot of people get Kol.</v>

7606
03:23:04.400 --> 03:23:05.211
<v Speaker 5>You get good at it.</v>

7607
03:23:05.211 --> 03:23:06.930
<v Speaker 5>I know three people that got chaos.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Just be happy for flying down the mountain.</v>

7618
03:23:18.080 --> 03:23:18.913
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to jump.</v>

7619
03:23:18.920 --> 03:23:19.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't jump.</v>

7620
03:23:19.700 --> 03:23:20.533

03:23:21.560 --> 03:23:22.281
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

7623
03:23:22.281 --> 03:23:24.950
<v Speaker 5>The first day you got to sacrifice the first day.</v>

7624
03:23:25.040 --> 03:23:25.581
<v Speaker 5>First Day.</v>

7625
03:23:25.581 --> 03:23:26.414
<v Speaker 5>I tell everybody,</v>

7626
03:23:26.630 --> 03:23:27.620
<v Speaker 5>you're just trying to,</v>

7627
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:31.520
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to work today just to enjoy your second to,</v>

7628
03:23:31.521 --> 03:23:32.780
<v Speaker 5>so you live your first day.</v>

7629
03:23:32.870 --> 03:23:33.800
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to have fun.</v>

7630
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:37.060
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that I would sacrifice since I've skied for a few years,</v>

7631
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:38.600
<v Speaker 5>everybody starts skiing.</v>

7632
03:23:38.601 --> 03:23:40.370
<v Speaker 5>I started skiing and then once you switch and go,</v>

7633
03:23:40.371 --> 03:23:41.150
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit.</v>

7634
03:23:41.150 --> 03:23:43.070
<v Speaker 5>It's like going from uh,</v>

7635
03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:43.520
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

7636
03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:43.970
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>

7637
03:23:43.970 --> 03:23:47.120
<v Speaker 5>Microsoft to apple really is that much better.</v>

7638
03:23:47.350 --> 03:23:48.183
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

7639
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:52.790
<v Speaker 5>very few people go from snowboarding to skin really snowboarding's different and</v>

7640
03:23:52.791 --> 03:23:54.530
<v Speaker 5>feels different skins awesome too.</v>

7641
03:23:54.680 --> 03:23:55.610
<v Speaker 5>You're going down a mountain.</v>

7642
03:23:55.611 --> 03:23:55.941
<v Speaker 5>Either way,</v>

7643
03:23:55.941 --> 03:23:56.720
<v Speaker 5>you look at it,</v>

7644
03:23:56.720 --> 03:23:57.420
<v Speaker 5>you're going down the mountain.</v>

7645
03:23:57.420 --> 03:23:58.370
<v Speaker 5>It's just a different angle.</v>

7646
03:23:58.371 --> 03:23:59.061
<v Speaker 5>And different turns.</v>

7647
03:23:59.061 --> 03:24:00.830
<v Speaker 5>It feels like you're surfing on the God damn mountain,</v>

7648
03:24:00.831 --> 03:24:02.170
<v Speaker 5>but what bothers me that is he,</v>

7649
03:24:02.171 --> 03:24:03.710
<v Speaker 5>you're stuck on that board.</v>

7650
03:24:03.950 --> 03:24:04.221
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

7651
03:24:04.221 --> 03:24:06.230
<v Speaker 5>Like what I like about skiing is when you fall,</v>

7652
03:24:06.231 --> 03:24:07.820
<v Speaker 5>you kind of fall like a person.</v>

7653
03:24:08.090 --> 03:24:11.000
<v Speaker 5>Like you know the huskies pop off and then he can roll.</v>

7654
03:24:11.090 --> 03:24:13.160
<v Speaker 5>Like I never gotten hurt falling because I know how to fall.</v>

7655
03:24:13.161 --> 03:24:14.330
<v Speaker 5>As soon as I know I'm falling,</v>

7656
03:24:14.450 --> 03:24:18.380
<v Speaker 5>I just go with it and then I'm not trying to like plant my leg and stop it from</v>

7657
03:24:18.381 --> 03:24:19.214
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>

7658
03:24:19.270 --> 03:24:20.720
<v Speaker 5>I just roll and go with it.</v>

7659
03:24:20.721 --> 03:24:20.991
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

7660
03:24:20.991 --> 03:24:21.471
<v Speaker 5>that's like,</v>

7661
03:24:21.471 --> 03:24:23.690
<v Speaker 5>it's the same thing what you're saying because I've done both.</v>

7662
03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:24.970
<v Speaker 5>But you're for Sarah attached.</v>

7663
03:24:25.480 --> 03:24:26.313
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

7664
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:28.280
<v Speaker 5>it's like I understand where you're coming from.</v>

7665
03:24:28.520 --> 03:24:32.120
<v Speaker 5>It's like a guy that's a done karate and he's feeling comfortable with it,</v>

7666
03:24:32.121 --> 03:24:35.390
<v Speaker 5>but he doesn't want to do Jujitsu cause it's just way more dangerous and you're</v>

7667
03:24:35.391 --> 03:24:35.930
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

7668
03:24:35.930 --> 03:24:37.460
<v Speaker 5>I see why you think that,</v>

7669
03:24:37.461 --> 03:24:39.320
<v Speaker 5>but actually it's not more dangerous.</v>

7670
03:24:39.321 --> 03:24:40.010
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

7671
03:24:40.010 --> 03:24:40.880
<v Speaker 5>It's just like that.</v>

7672
03:24:40.910 --> 03:24:44.200
<v Speaker 5>So you could fall and control yourself just as you got a snowboard</v>

7673
03:24:44.200 --> 03:24:44.550
<v Speaker 2>boring,</v>

7674
03:24:44.550 --> 03:24:46.240
<v Speaker 2>you'll get hurt just as easy as you would.</v>

7675
03:24:46.360 --> 03:24:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask him cause the same thing.</v>

7676
03:24:47.641 --> 03:24:48.480
<v Speaker 2>He also does it.</v>

7677
03:24:48.500 --> 03:24:49.560
<v Speaker 2>What do you agree with this?</v>

7678
03:24:49.950 --> 03:24:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I've been snowboarding like my whole life,</v>

7679
03:24:51.470 --> 03:24:52.201
<v Speaker 2>but I started skiing.</v>

7680
03:24:52.201 --> 03:24:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Of course my parents had a scheme over here like to um,</v>

7681
03:24:55.350 --> 03:24:55.771
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

7682
03:24:55.771 --> 03:24:57.000
<v Speaker 2>you fuck yourself up to any other one.</v>

7683
03:24:57.540 --> 03:24:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I put myself in the hospital snowboarding.</v>

7684
03:24:59.311 --> 03:25:00.810
<v Speaker 2>My cousin put herself in the hospital,</v>

7685
03:25:00.930 --> 03:25:01.800
<v Speaker 2>ski skiing.</v>

7686
03:25:01.830 --> 03:25:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I just put yourself in the hospital snowboarding hitting my head.</v>

7687
03:25:04.680 --> 03:25:05.950
<v Speaker 2>The guys that my brother</v>

7688
03:25:08.790 --> 03:25:09.623
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

7689
03:25:09.760 --> 03:25:10.680
<v Speaker 2>my cousin's shattered his,</v>

7690
03:25:10.681 --> 03:25:13.050
<v Speaker 2>he knows people shout at the collar bones,</v>

7691
03:25:13.140 --> 03:25:15.210
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to flip in the air.</v>

7692
03:25:15.940 --> 03:25:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Don't slip exactly the right thing to do is how do you shatter his wrist,</v>

7693
03:25:19.720 --> 03:25:20.640
<v Speaker 2>shatter his heels.</v>

7694
03:25:20.670 --> 03:25:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gets hurt.</v>

7695
03:25:21.511 --> 03:25:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Just snowboarding.</v>

7696
03:25:22.371 --> 03:25:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Skiing is jumping a,</v>

7697
03:25:23.551 --> 03:25:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a road gap and a road gap or yeah,</v>

7698
03:25:26.791 --> 03:25:28.920
<v Speaker 2>some sort of gap that's a road.</v>

7699
03:25:28.921 --> 03:25:30.120
<v Speaker 2>But then you can jump over it,</v>

7700
03:25:30.121 --> 03:25:30.420

03:25:54.541 --> 03:25:55.770
<v Speaker 2>This isn't that fun.</v>

7719
03:25:56.850 --> 03:25:57.530

7725
03:26:04.390 --> 03:26:05.580

7728
03:26:11.630 --> 03:26:16.290
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just about that and I was raised eating in the car.</v>

7734
03:26:25.231 --> 03:26:26.064
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to die.</v>

7735
03:26:27.440 --> 03:26:28.150

<v Speaker 2>Say Sas food.</v>

7737
03:26:29.140 --> 03:26:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Meat isn't real meat judging.</v>

7738
03:26:30.690 --> 03:26:31.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm just asking.</v>

7739
03:26:31.980 --> 03:26:32.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to,</v>

7740
03:26:33.730 --> 03:26:37.380
<v Speaker 2>they're very concerned about cruelty to animals.</v>

7741
03:26:37.381 --> 03:26:40.560
<v Speaker 2>That's why they make those burgers that aren't really meet.</v>

7742
03:26:40.590 --> 03:26:41.190
<v Speaker 2>They're not real.</v>

7743
03:26:41.190 --> 03:26:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Would you guys say that they</v>

7744
03:26:43.830 --> 03:26:48.120
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to make test tube meat now get it down to $11 a burger.</v>

7745
03:26:48.410 --> 03:26:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7746
03:26:48.740 --> 03:26:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7747
03:26:49.410 --> 03:26:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

7748
03:26:49.770 --> 03:26:53.970
<v Speaker 2>it was like $300,000 a few years ago and they got it down to 11 one,</v>

7749
03:26:53.980 --> 03:26:56.090
<v Speaker 2>two kind of cancer that's going to cause all kinds,</v>

7750
03:26:56.230 --> 03:26:57.063
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

7751
03:26:57.100 --> 03:26:57.933
<v Speaker 2>Everything</v>

7752
03:26:59.880 --> 03:27:03.690
<v Speaker 2>comes near the first going to test it on inmates.</v>

7753
03:27:03.691 --> 03:27:05.170
<v Speaker 2>They're going to get inmates fake me.</v>

7754
03:27:05.171 --> 03:27:06.320
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to turn fucking,</v>

7755
03:27:06.321 --> 03:27:07.470
<v Speaker 2>they going to see what's up.</v>

7756
03:27:08.710 --> 03:27:12.120
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be the beginning of the nightmare of the living dead.</v>

7757
03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.983
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

7758
03:27:13.280 --> 03:27:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Come on me.</v>

7759
03:27:13.850 --> 03:27:16.650
<v Speaker 2>He's going to turn people into fucking Zombie movie about fake meat.</v>

7760
03:27:17.040 --> 03:27:20.030
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like there is movies called fake meat and it's,</v>

7761
03:27:20.130 --> 03:27:20.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

7762
03:27:20.430 --> 03:27:20.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7763
03:27:20.581 --> 03:27:21.341
<v Speaker 2>here's what's crazy.</v>

7764
03:27:21.341 --> 03:27:22.320
<v Speaker 2>And Bang brothers,</v>

7765
03:27:22.350 --> 03:27:24.480
<v Speaker 2>there's a recent study they did with,</v>

7766
03:27:24.481 --> 03:27:24.721
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7767
03:27:24.721 --> 03:27:25.590
<v Speaker 2>with rats,</v>

7768
03:27:25.620 --> 03:27:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was where they fed them meat from older animals and meat from</v>

7769
03:27:30.181 --> 03:27:31.170
<v Speaker 2>younger animals.</v>

7770
03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:35.100
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out that when they fed them meat from older animals,</v>

7771
03:27:35.130 --> 03:27:40.080
<v Speaker 2>it's sped up their aging process and compared to the animals that were fed meat</v>

7772
03:27:40.081 --> 03:27:41.040
<v Speaker 2>from younger animals.</v>

7773
03:27:41.050 --> 03:27:43.090
<v Speaker 2>That's why the politicians want to eat babies.</v>

7774
03:27:43.720 --> 03:27:44.920
<v Speaker 2>That's like with the whole blood thing,</v>

7775
03:27:44.921 --> 03:27:45.191
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7776
03:27:45.191 --> 03:27:46.830
<v Speaker 2>They change out your blood for that.</v>

7777
03:27:47.010 --> 03:27:51.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a new thing that they think possibly while they're doing it,</v>

7778
03:27:51.430 --> 03:27:52.263
<v Speaker 2>they don't know if there's,</v>

7779
03:27:52.270 --> 03:27:54.340
<v Speaker 2>there's no real proof that it works on people,</v>

7780
03:27:54.341 --> 03:27:59.290
<v Speaker 2>but they have shown that it works on rats and mice and they think it might be</v>

7781
03:27:59.291 --> 03:28:03.280
<v Speaker 2>more of a function of there's things in the new blood that aren't in the old</v>

7782
03:28:03.281 --> 03:28:06.190
<v Speaker 2>blood anymore that you need and as soon as you get them,</v>

7783
03:28:06.191 --> 03:28:06.351
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

7784
03:28:06.351 --> 03:28:09.820
<v Speaker 2>you just be behave like a younger person versus the,</v>

7785
03:28:09.821 --> 03:28:10.840
<v Speaker 2>it makes you younger.</v>

7786
03:28:11.110 --> 03:28:15.070
<v Speaker 2>They think that it's just your body at a certain age just lacks the essential</v>

7787
03:28:15.071 --> 03:28:18.250
<v Speaker 2>properties of the blood that it has when it's young.</v>

7788
03:28:18.370 --> 03:28:22.540
<v Speaker 2>So when they've shown it and in rats and in blue it was actually mice.</v>

7789
03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:25.210
<v Speaker 2>When they showed how they put young blood in them,</v>

7790
03:28:25.211 --> 03:28:28.720
<v Speaker 2>they started behaving like young mice and also when they put old blood in the</v>

7791
03:28:28.721 --> 03:28:29.201
<v Speaker 2>young mice,</v>

7792
03:28:29.201 --> 03:28:30.860
<v Speaker 2>they started behaving like old mice.</v>

7793
03:28:31.090 --> 03:28:31.511
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

7794
03:28:31.511 --> 03:28:31.970
<v Speaker 2>that sound,</v>

7795
03:28:31.970 --> 03:28:32.530
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

7796
03:28:32.530 --> 03:28:34.090
<v Speaker 2>that's why they're into babies.</v>

7797
03:28:36.130 --> 03:28:36.963
<v Speaker 2>Baby blood.</v>

7798
03:28:37.780 --> 03:28:38.171
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

7799
03:28:38.171 --> 03:28:40.570
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they could pull the blood out and that actually kill him.</v>

7800
03:28:40.571 --> 03:28:42.960
<v Speaker 2>Just like have them around just for the baby blood,</v>

7801
03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:44.380
<v Speaker 2>didn't they do then blade,</v>

7802
03:28:44.590 --> 03:28:45.070
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

7803
03:28:45.070 --> 03:28:46.240
<v Speaker 2>They just have a bunch of babies.</v>

7804
03:28:46.310 --> 03:28:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Which body goes hanging there?</v>

7805
03:28:47.830 --> 03:28:48.431
<v Speaker 2>Cruelty,</v>

7806
03:28:48.431 --> 03:28:49.780
<v Speaker 2>free baby blood lipid.</v>

7807
03:28:50.500 --> 03:28:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Let the babies play in the nurseries and baby fine.</v>

7808
03:28:53.160 --> 03:28:53.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7809
03:28:53.520 --> 03:28:57.650
<v Speaker 2>they can make this meet and they can make this fake meat if they can make a fake</v>

7810
03:28:57.700 --> 03:28:58.420
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

7811
03:28:58.420 --> 03:28:58.721
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>

7812
03:28:58.721 --> 03:29:02.720
<v Speaker 2>what if they made like fake babies that were headless that just gave you blood?</v>

7813
03:29:04.540 --> 03:29:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Then you're going to fucking find some reports on these fake news sites that the</v>

7814
03:29:11.530 --> 03:29:12.280
<v Speaker 2>dying,</v>

7815
03:29:12.280 --> 03:29:13.600
<v Speaker 2>when the blood is dying,</v>

7816
03:29:13.601 --> 03:29:14.440
<v Speaker 2>when the body is dying,</v>

7817
03:29:14.441 --> 03:29:14.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

7818
03:29:14.980 --> 03:29:16.990
<v Speaker 2>it needs to be that in the process of dying</v>

7819
03:29:18.670 --> 03:29:19.503
<v Speaker 2>the blood,</v>

7820
03:29:19.760 --> 03:29:21.010
<v Speaker 2>something happens to the blood.</v>

7821
03:29:21.011 --> 03:29:22.840
<v Speaker 2>That's where the gold is slow.</v>

7822
03:29:22.840 --> 03:29:25.480
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that there's a bunch of people that are looking at the human body</v>

7823
03:29:25.481 --> 03:29:27.880
<v Speaker 2>like it's a math problem or they're just trying to,</v>

7824
03:29:27.881 --> 03:29:28.181
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

7825
03:29:28.181 --> 03:29:29.140
<v Speaker 2>let's try that.</v>

7826
03:29:29.260 --> 03:29:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

7827
03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:30.341
<v Speaker 2>that's not doing it.</v>

7828
03:29:30.341 --> 03:29:30.611
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7829
03:29:30.611 --> 03:29:31.151
<v Speaker 2>let's try the,</v>

7830
03:29:31.151 --> 03:29:31.871
<v Speaker 2>what's the password?</v>

7831
03:29:31.871 --> 03:29:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Is it that and then one day they're going to find it and then got a bank.</v>

7832
03:29:35.950 --> 03:29:36.281
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7833
03:29:36.281 --> 03:29:36.851
<v Speaker 2>we got it.</v>

7834
03:29:36.851 --> 03:29:38.320
<v Speaker 2>You're going to live to a thousand we win.</v>

7835
03:29:38.660 --> 03:29:42.700
<v Speaker 2>This is probably a kid today that is going to live to a thousand and it might be</v>

7836
03:29:42.701 --> 03:29:44.730
<v Speaker 2>completely dependent upon when they catch you.</v>

7837
03:29:45.130 --> 03:29:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7838
03:29:45.310 --> 03:29:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe they catch you,</v>

7839
03:29:46.930 --> 03:29:47.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7840
03:29:47.530 --> 03:29:49.000
<v Speaker 2>and they give you the immortal,</v>

7841
03:29:49.480 --> 03:29:54.480
<v Speaker 2>immortal gene they injected in you before you quite hit puberty.</v>

7842
03:29:54.670 --> 03:29:55.361
<v Speaker 2>Like right.</v>

7843
03:29:55.361 --> 03:29:59.470
<v Speaker 2>They figure like you gotta make a decision when you're like 11 or 12 do you want</v>

7844
03:29:59.471 --> 03:30:00.041
<v Speaker 2>to live forever?</v>

7845
03:30:00.041 --> 03:30:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to die like everybody else?</v>

7846
03:30:01.360 --> 03:30:01.721
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

7847
03:30:01.721 --> 03:30:02.051
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>

7848
03:30:02.051 --> 03:30:02.590
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

7849
03:30:02.590 --> 03:30:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Well saw and I'm going to die and I won't be here for you.</v>

7850
03:30:07.470 --> 03:30:10.390
<v Speaker 2>You got to figure out whether or not you take it and if you got to give it to</v>

7851
03:30:10.391 --> 03:30:13.450
<v Speaker 2>your kids and then one day you know you're going to be 70 kids still going to be</v>

7852
03:30:13.451 --> 03:30:17.170
<v Speaker 2>20 he's going to still be 2080 he's still 2090 you're still,</v>

7853
03:30:17.230 --> 03:30:18.340
<v Speaker 2>he's still 20 you're dying.</v>

7854
03:30:18.341 --> 03:30:18.630
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

7855
03:30:18.630 --> 03:30:19.990
<v Speaker 2>everything's falling apart and shaking.</v>

7856
03:30:20.200 --> 03:30:22.600
<v Speaker 2>The kids out there playing tag football didn't give a fuck.</v>

7857
03:30:23.050 --> 03:30:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Surfing slinging dick all over the place.</v>

7858
03:30:25.241 --> 03:30:26.770
<v Speaker 2>He's still 27 years old.</v>

7859
03:30:26.771 --> 03:30:27.790
<v Speaker 2>He's 20 you're like,</v>

7860
03:30:27.791 --> 03:30:28.750
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck?</v>

7861
03:30:29.020 --> 03:30:29.853
<v Speaker 2>What did I do?</v>

7862
03:30:30.270 --> 03:30:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Like I made an immortal,</v>

7863
03:30:32.040 --> 03:30:33.340
<v Speaker 2>you can still get hit by a car though.</v>

7864
03:30:33.700 --> 03:30:34.533
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

7865
03:30:35.080 --> 03:30:39.650
<v Speaker 2>So you can still dial yourself or you'd have to die and people would probably</v>

7866
03:30:39.651 --> 03:30:41.450
<v Speaker 2>engage in much more risky activity.</v>

7867
03:30:41.451 --> 03:30:42.860
<v Speaker 2>They would heal like little kids.</v>

7868
03:30:43.280 --> 03:30:43.850
<v Speaker 2>It'd be,</v>

7869
03:30:43.850 --> 03:30:44.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

7870
03:30:44.361 --> 03:30:45.440
<v Speaker 2>that's going to happen.</v>

7871
03:30:45.441 --> 03:30:45.981
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna figure.</v>

7872
03:30:45.981 --> 03:30:48.230
<v Speaker 2>They've already figured out some incredible stuff with stem cells.</v>

7873
03:30:48.440 --> 03:30:53.440
<v Speaker 2>They had a guy who was paralyzed and now he's able to exercise with his upper</v>

7874
03:30:53.691 --> 03:30:54.071
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

7875
03:30:54.071 --> 03:30:55.340
<v Speaker 2>He's able to move his upper body.</v>

7876
03:30:55.341 --> 03:30:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a a first with stem cell therapy.</v>

7877
03:30:58.940 --> 03:30:59.900
<v Speaker 2>We're just finding this out.</v>

7878
03:31:00.350 --> 03:31:01.940
<v Speaker 2>The library and Youtube.</v>

7879
03:31:04.230 --> 03:31:05.063
<v Speaker 2>I found out,</v>

7880
03:31:05.140 --> 03:31:09.020
<v Speaker 2>I knew answer library and Youtube.</v>

7881
03:31:09.021 --> 03:31:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I looked at all sources,</v>

7882

7885
03:31:14.330 --> 03:31:17.300
<v Speaker 2>We mean we're living in weird times too because I think we're just one</v>

7886
03:31:17.301 --> 03:31:21.290
<v Speaker 2>generation or two away from people being able to completely change what they</v>

7887
03:31:21.291 --> 03:31:22.124
<v Speaker 2>look like,</v>

7888
03:31:22.160 --> 03:31:23.600
<v Speaker 2>like at a genetic level.</v>

7889
03:31:23.900 --> 03:31:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Like if you seen what like,</v>

7890
03:31:25.040 --> 03:31:26.930
<v Speaker 2>like some kids are doing today,</v>

7891
03:31:27.110 --> 03:31:28.250
<v Speaker 2>like young kids,</v>

7892
03:31:28.280 --> 03:31:32.750
<v Speaker 2>like young reality star kids like the Kim Kardashians getting extensive plastic</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh well I'm not a doctor,</v>

03:31:57.771 --> 03:31:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she did admit it.</v>

03:31:59.540 --> 03:32:01.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a before and after photos.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's got a fucking ass.</v>

7910
03:32:05.270 --> 03:32:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure it's,</v>

7911
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:06.800
<v Speaker 2>if she wanted a big ass,</v>

7912
03:32:06.801 --> 03:32:07.880
<v Speaker 2>she fucking got it.</v>

7913
03:32:07.910 --> 03:32:08.251

<v Speaker 2>she got her ass one.</v>

7915
03:32:09.740 --> 03:32:10.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest,</v>

7916
03:32:10.881 --> 03:32:13.160
<v Speaker 2>most gigantic ass based on her.</v>

7917
03:32:13.340 --> 03:32:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Her proportions like,</v>

7918
03:32:14.440 --> 03:32:14.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

7919
03:32:14.850 --> 03:32:15.620
<v Speaker 2>like all of this.</v>

7920
03:32:15.620 --> 03:32:17.660
<v Speaker 2>She looks like a normal thing in the hips up.</v>

7921
03:32:18.570 --> 03:32:20.650
<v Speaker 2>She just looks like a little frequency at the globe.</v>

7922
03:32:20.800 --> 03:32:23.760
<v Speaker 2>Freaking Ooh,</v>

7923
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:25.010
<v Speaker 2>holy shit dog.</v>

7924
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.881
<v Speaker 2>And in a giant,</v>

7925
03:32:25.881 --> 03:32:29.240
<v Speaker 2>large like Derriere to tremendous,</v>

7926
03:32:29.241 --> 03:32:29.901
<v Speaker 2>if you know what I mean.</v>

7927
03:32:29.901 --> 03:32:30.734
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7928
03:32:30.820 --> 03:32:34.250
<v Speaker 2>let's stop and think about that because that didn't exist 20 years ago.</v>

7929
03:32:34.430 --> 03:32:34.881
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

7930
03:32:34.881 --> 03:32:36.320
<v Speaker 2>it didn't exist in both ways.</v>

7931
03:32:36.410 --> 03:32:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Natural and unnatural.</v>

7932
03:32:38.090 --> 03:32:38.661
<v Speaker 2>It didn't exist,</v>

7933
03:32:38.661 --> 03:32:42.350
<v Speaker 2>exist natural because there weren't girls were doing squats like you didn't get</v>

7934
03:32:42.351 --> 03:32:46.700
<v Speaker 2>those crazy like crossfit acids and some of these girls have now when they look</v>

7935
03:32:46.710 --> 03:32:48.210
<v Speaker 2>like they're a thoroughbred,</v>

7936
03:32:48.230 --> 03:32:49.580
<v Speaker 2>they can leap over a building.</v>

7937
03:32:49.880 --> 03:32:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Some of those crossfit girls that are developing these muscular acids that</v>

7938
03:32:54.081 --> 03:32:55.970
<v Speaker 2>didn't exist 20 years ago.</v>

7939
03:32:56.120 --> 03:32:59.060
<v Speaker 2>He never saw that you and you see him like all the time now.</v>

7940
03:33:00.010 --> 03:33:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was the time I grew up in,</v>

7941
03:33:02.271 --> 03:33:05.970
<v Speaker 2>but I've accepted I'm totally cool.</v>

7942
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7943
03:33:06.500 --> 03:33:07.370
<v Speaker 2>fake titties,</v>

7944
03:33:07.520 --> 03:33:08.390
<v Speaker 2>real titties,</v>

7945
03:33:08.391 --> 03:33:09.224
<v Speaker 2>fake titties.</v>

7946
03:33:09.320 --> 03:33:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care.</v>

7947
03:33:10.460 --> 03:33:10.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

7948
03:33:10.820 --> 03:33:11.653
<v Speaker 2>I'll take either,</v>

7949
03:33:11.930 --> 03:33:13.670
<v Speaker 2>but ass is,</v>

7950
03:33:13.840 --> 03:33:18.290
<v Speaker 2>you can't have a fake ass little where you cannot have a fake bravos throwing it</v>

7951
03:33:18.291 --> 03:33:19.070
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

7952
03:33:19.070 --> 03:33:19.281
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

7953
03:33:19.281 --> 03:33:19.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

7954
03:33:19.610 --> 03:33:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I can't accept it except I can't.</v>

7955
03:33:23.270 --> 03:33:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7956
03:33:23.780 --> 03:33:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>

7957
03:33:24.500 --> 03:33:28.400
<v Speaker 2>do you think maybe in the future if they came out with a legit fake Dick,</v>

7958
03:33:29.120 --> 03:33:30.320
<v Speaker 2>like legit,</v>

7959
03:33:30.920 --> 03:33:33.290
<v Speaker 2>would that look back go through or not?</v>

7960
03:33:33.470 --> 03:33:36.230
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not talking about like early prototypes that don't give a shit.</v>

7961
03:33:36.231 --> 03:33:38.490
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the problem with fake Dick's,</v>

7962
03:33:38.491 --> 03:33:40.110
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like the same problem with fake boobs.</v>

7963
03:33:40.290 --> 03:33:42.330
<v Speaker 2>If you go back to fake boobs from the eighties bold,</v>

7964
03:33:42.331 --> 03:33:43.780
<v Speaker 2>now they feel like basketball.</v>

7965
03:33:43.781 --> 03:33:46.770
<v Speaker 2>So things are hard as a rock and disgusting and they feel weird.</v>

7966
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:48.540
<v Speaker 2>They don't feel like a fake boob,</v>

7967
03:33:48.780 --> 03:33:53.350
<v Speaker 2>but a fake boob circa 2017 they figured out how to,</v>

7968
03:33:53.351 --> 03:33:54.930
<v Speaker 2>a way to make it soft and mushy.</v>

7969
03:33:54.931 --> 03:33:56.940
<v Speaker 2>It Phil's Phil's outstanding,</v>

7970
03:33:57.030 --> 03:33:57.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7971
03:33:57.450 --> 03:33:58.283
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>

7972
03:33:59.400 --> 03:33:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>

7973
03:33:59.970 --> 03:34:02.220
<v Speaker 2>It's got a but a fake Dick.</v>

7974
03:34:02.400 --> 03:34:06.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that women would have the same appreciation for a fake Dick that a</v>

7975
03:34:06.031 --> 03:34:07.230
<v Speaker 2>man has for fake tits.</v>

7976
03:34:07.530 --> 03:34:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't think women are buying it.</v>

7977
03:34:08.940 --> 03:34:09.241
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7978
03:34:09.241 --> 03:34:09.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

7979
03:34:09.870 --> 03:34:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

7980
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7981
03:34:10.830 --> 03:34:11.663
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same thing.</v>

7982
03:34:11.700 --> 03:34:13.980
<v Speaker 2>The hair extensions in two what's going on?</v>

7983
03:34:15.580 --> 03:34:17.400
<v Speaker 2>He can wear your hair extensions ladies.</v>

7984
03:34:18.280 --> 03:34:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it seem like a hair transplants?</v>

7985
03:34:20.461 --> 03:34:22.770
<v Speaker 2>We've found out now it's been 20 years or whatever,</v>

7986
03:34:23.070 --> 03:34:23.970
<v Speaker 2>do or don't work.</v>

7987
03:34:24.330 --> 03:34:25.290
<v Speaker 2>They can work.</v>

7988
03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:27.450
<v Speaker 2>The problem is the rest of your hair keeps falling out.</v>

7989
03:34:27.850 --> 03:34:29.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like that bit that I used to do about it,</v>

7990
03:34:29.521 --> 03:34:31.160
<v Speaker 2>that they take hair from a,</v>

7991
03:34:31.170 --> 03:34:31.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7992
03:34:31.440 --> 03:34:35.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like taking people from a neighborhood where everyone's really healthy and</v>

7993
03:34:35.221 --> 03:34:37.290
<v Speaker 2>move him to an area where everyone's dying.</v>

7994
03:34:37.650 --> 03:34:39.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like they stay,</v>

7995
03:34:39.240 --> 03:34:42.210
<v Speaker 2>but the other stuff goes away.</v>

7996
03:34:42.510 --> 03:34:43.530
<v Speaker 2>So like for me,</v>

7997
03:34:43.560 --> 03:34:48.560
<v Speaker 2>my problem was I had hair transplants and the hair that's duck was like all the</v>

7998
03:34:49.141 --> 03:34:52.830
<v Speaker 2>hair I had left and they didn't like it filled it in at first.</v>

7999
03:34:52.950 --> 03:34:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Then the other stuff started falling out too,</v>

8000
03:34:55.140 --> 03:34:58.200
<v Speaker 2>and it got to this untenable position where there was just,</v>

8001
03:34:58.201 --> 03:34:59.210
<v Speaker 2>is not enough hair up there.</v>

8002
03:34:59.220 --> 03:35:00.053
<v Speaker 2>It's a solver.</v>

8003
03:35:00.680 --> 03:35:03.990
<v Speaker 2>It's time to just scorch and burn you.</v>

8004
03:35:04.470 --> 03:35:06.390
<v Speaker 2>I should have shaved my head from the jump.</v>

8005
03:35:06.420 --> 03:35:07.380
<v Speaker 2>I just wish I did.</v>

8006
03:35:07.710 --> 03:35:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had shaved it.</v>

8007
03:35:08.880 --> 03:35:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Who's that?</v>

8008
03:35:09.380 --> 03:35:10.260
<v Speaker 2>What do you show him here?</v>

8009
03:35:10.770 --> 03:35:11.161
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>

8010
03:35:11.161 --> 03:35:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Hair transplants.</v>

8011
03:35:11.830 --> 03:35:12.040
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

8012
03:35:12.040 --> 03:35:13.620
<v Speaker 2>that's the dude from the Brady bunch.</v>

8013
03:35:13.620 --> 03:35:14.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8014
03:35:15.630 --> 03:35:15.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8015
03:35:15.991 --> 03:35:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can definitely get your hair thicker,</v>

8016
03:35:18.571 --> 03:35:20.880
<v Speaker 2>but my hair was destined to fall out.</v>

8017
03:35:21.270 --> 03:35:23.730
<v Speaker 2>It depends on like how much your here is destined to fall out.</v>

8018
03:35:23.731 --> 03:35:24.840
<v Speaker 2>My hair had no chance.</v>

8019
03:35:25.950 --> 03:35:28.170
<v Speaker 2>If you had to like a little bit of a chance,</v>

8020
03:35:28.171 --> 03:35:31.830
<v Speaker 2>like maybe if you're only thinning and then it brought it back on,</v>

8021
03:35:31.831 --> 03:35:34.320
<v Speaker 2>but my hair was going son,</v>

8022
03:35:34.380 --> 03:35:35.370
<v Speaker 2>it was on its way out.</v>

8023
03:35:35.790 --> 03:35:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Your hair has to stop dying.</v>

8024
03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:37.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8025
03:35:37.881 --> 03:35:38.101
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

8026
03:35:38.101 --> 03:35:38.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

8027
03:35:38.640 --> 03:35:41.370
<v Speaker 2>And the only way it does is if you take Propecia,</v>

8028
03:35:41.610 --> 03:35:45.300
<v Speaker 2>which has massive problems of its own and just really bad for you and causes</v>

8029
03:35:45.301 --> 03:35:47.220
<v Speaker 2>depression and just,</v>

8030
03:35:47.250 --> 03:35:48.480
<v Speaker 2>it's just unhealthy for you.</v>

8031
03:35:48.530 --> 03:35:48.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

8032
03:35:48.870 --> 03:35:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I told you about one of my singers and I was a drummer and the speed metal bed,</v>

8033
03:35:53.190 --> 03:35:55.890
<v Speaker 2>what am I senders ended up getting a extensions.</v>

8034
03:35:56.040 --> 03:35:56.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8035
03:35:56.411 --> 03:35:57.900
<v Speaker 2>like a whole bunch of extensions.</v>

8036
03:35:57.900 --> 03:35:58.531
<v Speaker 2>There was like a wig.</v>

8037
03:35:58.531 --> 03:35:59.700
<v Speaker 2>It was basically a unit.</v>

8038
03:35:59.730 --> 03:36:00.563
<v Speaker 2>Will you support him?</v>

8039
03:36:00.930 --> 03:36:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Because he had long hair from the age of nine but he was one of those guys,</v>

8040
03:36:05.101 --> 03:36:05.821
<v Speaker 2>all his brothers,</v>

8041
03:36:05.821 --> 03:36:09.030
<v Speaker 2>they all lose their at 18 so he was the dude with the longest hair in high</v>

8042
03:36:09.031 --> 03:36:09.600
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

8043
03:36:09.600 --> 03:36:10.830
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as high school ended,</v>

8044
03:36:10.831 --> 03:36:11.700
<v Speaker 2>he lost all his hair.</v>

8045
03:36:11.850 --> 03:36:12.690
<v Speaker 2>So they decided to,</v>

8046
03:36:12.990 --> 03:36:17.820
<v Speaker 2>he decided to not wear a regular wig because his older brother.</v>

8047
03:36:17.880 --> 03:36:18.571
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

8048
03:36:18.571 --> 03:36:19.404
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

8049
03:36:19.770 --> 03:36:20.940
<v Speaker 2>We just literally saw,</v>

8050
03:36:20.941 --> 03:36:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

8051
03:36:21.570 --> 03:36:23.070
<v Speaker 2>We just literally saw in the highlights,</v>

8052
03:36:23.100 --> 03:36:25.170
<v Speaker 2>the version of the Gary Good rail.</v>

8053
03:36:25.171 --> 03:36:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8054
03:36:25.530 --> 03:36:26.520
<v Speaker 2>but with a hammer fist.</v>

8055
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:27.271
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy,</v>

8056
03:36:27.271 --> 03:36:27.451

8066
03:36:43.401 --> 03:36:44.234
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

8067
03:36:45.570 --> 03:36:46.403
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

8068
03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:47.393
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

8069
03:36:48.480 --> 03:36:49.950
<v Speaker 4>She got into that position.</v>

8070
03:36:49.980 --> 03:36:51.750
<v Speaker 4>It's literally the same position.</v>

8071
03:36:51.751 --> 03:36:52.411
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>

8072
03:36:52.411 --> 03:36:53.670
<v Speaker 4>Look at this watch.</v>

8073
03:36:53.760 --> 03:36:54.580
<v Speaker 4>She gets her down,</v>

8074
03:36:54.580 --> 03:36:55.413
<v Speaker 4>she traps it,</v>

8075
03:36:55.470 --> 03:36:56.470
<v Speaker 4>but instead of elbow on,</v>

8076

<v Speaker 4>They're crazy.</v>

8080
03:37:02.350 --> 03:37:03.183
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

8081
03:37:03.780 --> 03:37:04.500
<v Speaker 4>That is nuts.</v>

8082

8083
03:37:08.191 --> 03:37:08.821
<v Speaker 4>idea man.</v>

8084

<v Speaker 4>Cause that was,</v>

8085
03:37:09.630 --> 03:37:11.890
<v Speaker 4>I think this fight was in the prelims or whatever.</v>

8086
03:37:11.920 --> 03:37:12.481
<v Speaker 4>I missed it.</v>

8087
03:37:12.481 --> 03:37:13.500
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea.</v>

8088
03:37:13.710 --> 03:37:16.960
<v Speaker 4>I missed it to Carla Esparza and random Marco's.</v>

8089
03:37:17.800 --> 03:37:18.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

8090
03:37:18.240 --> 03:37:19.260
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea.</v>

8091
03:37:20.060 --> 03:37:21.050
<v Speaker 4>Zero idea.</v>

8092
03:37:21.810 --> 03:37:22.770
<v Speaker 4>What is this Jamie?</v>

8093
03:37:23.190 --> 03:37:26.310
<v Speaker 4>What does that toggle Santos knocks out Jack Marshman.</v>

8094
03:37:26.330 --> 03:37:26.490
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

8095
03:37:26.490 --> 03:37:27.180
<v Speaker 4>we'll kicked him.</v>

8096
03:37:27.180 --> 03:37:27.451
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

8097
03:37:27.451 --> 03:37:27.721
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

8098
03:37:27.721 --> 03:37:27.991
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

8099
03:37:27.991 --> 03:37:28.261
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

8100
03:37:28.261 --> 03:37:28.650
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

8101
03:37:28.650 --> 03:37:29.483
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

8102
03:37:30.890 --> 03:37:32.280
<v Speaker 4>Thiago Santos is bad ass.</v>

8103
03:37:32.300 --> 03:37:34.050
<v Speaker 4>Look at that blank.</v>

8104
03:37:34.280 --> 03:37:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus.</v>

8105
03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:41.870
<v Speaker 4>How did such a horrible kick to get hit with your fucking heel with that,</v>

8106
03:37:42.270 --> 03:37:42.800
<v Speaker 4>you like that?</v>

8107
03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:47.050
<v Speaker 4>How bizarre is it still to this day that you know you,</v>

8108
03:37:47.051 --> 03:37:51.050
<v Speaker 4>you can kick someone full blast with all your bones,</v>

8109
03:37:51.170 --> 03:37:53.540
<v Speaker 4>but your hands have to be covered by a leather pad.</v>

8110
03:37:55.210 --> 03:37:56.360
<v Speaker 4>Like how crazy is that?</v>

8111
03:37:56.510 --> 03:38:01.100
<v Speaker 4>You can clang your heel off of someone's eyeball and no problem.</v>

8112
03:38:01.520 --> 03:38:02.990
<v Speaker 4>The hardest part of your body,</v>

8113
03:38:03.170 --> 03:38:03.351
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

8114
03:38:03.351 --> 03:38:05.270
<v Speaker 4>he'll literally can stop on the ground.</v>

8115
03:38:05.390 --> 03:38:08.910
<v Speaker 4>It's not another part of your body where you can walk up to the ground and smash</v>

8116
03:38:08.911 --> 03:38:09.440
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

8117
03:38:09.440 --> 03:38:10.760
<v Speaker 4>I could stomp on the ground.</v>

8118
03:38:10.761 --> 03:38:12.230
<v Speaker 4>Barefoot is no,</v>

8119
03:38:12.231 --> 03:38:13.370
<v Speaker 4>I can't punch anything.</v>

8120
03:38:13.371 --> 03:38:15.230
<v Speaker 4>Pair handed like I can't punch a tree.</v>

8121
03:38:15.320 --> 03:38:16.700
<v Speaker 4>I stomped trees all time.</v>

8122
03:38:16.701 --> 03:38:17.570
<v Speaker 4>I'll walk up to a tree.</v>

8123
03:38:18.350 --> 03:38:19.430
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't even hurt me at all.</v>

8124
03:38:19.640 --> 03:38:20.320
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

8125
03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:21.470
<v Speaker 4>Your heals crazy,</v>

8126
03:38:21.500 --> 03:38:21.980
<v Speaker 4>your heels,</v>

8127
03:38:21.980 --> 03:38:25.970
<v Speaker 4>it crazy bone and the fact that you could bounce that off someone's head when</v>

8128
03:38:25.971 --> 03:38:30.620
<v Speaker 4>you're spinning around like a Ballerina full blast and whip your leg into their</v>

8129
03:38:30.621 --> 03:38:32.090
<v Speaker 4>head swollen like a bat,</v>

8130
03:38:32.180 --> 03:38:32.870
<v Speaker 4>but you can't,</v>

8131
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:34.070
<v Speaker 4>you can't have bare knuckles.</v>

8132
03:38:34.310 --> 03:38:35.270
<v Speaker 4>It's so bizarre.</v>

8133
03:38:35.690 --> 03:38:38.060
<v Speaker 4>Rogan fighting championships right there.</v>

8134
03:38:38.160 --> 03:38:39.160
<v Speaker 4>If I turn the skull,</v>

8135
03:38:39.410 --> 03:38:43.580
<v Speaker 4>if I changed him and that's why I would want a hundred percent change.</v>

8136
03:38:43.610 --> 03:38:44.443
<v Speaker 4>Bare knuckled,</v>

8137
03:38:44.510 --> 03:38:45.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what anybody says.</v>

8138
03:38:46.190 --> 03:38:46.911
<v Speaker 4>And when you say,</v>

8139
03:38:46.911 --> 03:38:48.260
<v Speaker 4>well you break your hands that way,</v>

8140
03:38:48.261 --> 03:38:49.940
<v Speaker 4>well you then you shouldn't be doing that.</v>

8141
03:38:50.330 --> 03:38:53.460
<v Speaker 4>Then we should figure out what actually no wraps,</v>

8142
03:38:53.461 --> 03:38:54.020
<v Speaker 4>sir.</v>

8143
03:38:54.020 --> 03:38:54.853
<v Speaker 4>No wraps.</v>

8144
03:38:55.040 --> 03:38:55.940
<v Speaker 4>This is what I think.</v>

8145
03:38:56.030 --> 03:38:56.900
<v Speaker 4>I think what,</v>

8146
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.470
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

8147
03:38:57.470 --> 03:38:59.060
<v Speaker 4>what actually works.</v>

8148
03:38:59.240 --> 03:39:04.240
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have anything tightened up unnaturally with wraps and tape and</v>

8149
03:39:04.311 --> 03:39:05.390
<v Speaker 4>gauze and t,</v>

8150
03:39:05.391 --> 03:39:08.990
<v Speaker 4>you've essentially got like a soft cast that keeps your wrist in place,</v>

8151
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:11.660
<v Speaker 4>that allows you to just throw bombs with impunity.</v>

8152
03:39:11.690 --> 03:39:16.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that makes any sense because that's not a real skill in the real,</v>

8153
03:39:16.660 --> 03:39:16.851
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

8154
03:39:16.851 --> 03:39:17.750
<v Speaker 4>you can still punch people,</v>

8155
03:39:17.751 --> 03:39:20.940
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a realistic application of luck.</v>

8156
03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:23.780
<v Speaker 4>What could happen with two people just using their bodies.</v>

8157
03:39:23.930 --> 03:39:26.360
<v Speaker 4>You've added in this extra element of rap.</v>

8158
03:39:26.570 --> 03:39:27.170
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

8159
03:39:27.170 --> 03:39:28.850
<v Speaker 4>That's the same way I feel about the cage.</v>

8160
03:39:29.060 --> 03:39:32.240
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the cage allows people to get taken down and stand back up where</v>

8161
03:39:32.241 --> 03:39:33.074
<v Speaker 4>they might not be able,</v>

8162
03:39:33.080 --> 03:39:33.920
<v Speaker 4>it's ads in</v>

8163
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:36.710
<v Speaker 5>this artificial thing that you're handling.</v>

8164
03:39:36.720 --> 03:39:38.690
<v Speaker 5>You have to deal with no raps,</v>

8165
03:39:38.870 --> 03:39:41.090
<v Speaker 5>no cage basketball court.</v>

8166
03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:42.531
<v Speaker 5>We already got that.</v>

8167
03:39:42.531 --> 03:39:43.364
<v Speaker 5>An Ebi.</v>

8168
03:39:43.710 --> 03:39:44.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

8169
03:39:44.310 --> 03:39:44.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

8170
03:39:44.540 --> 03:39:45.640
<v Speaker 5>That's basically bi.</v>

8171
03:39:45.820 --> 03:39:47.980
<v Speaker 5>W s very similar except with Ebi.</v>

8172
03:39:47.990 --> 03:39:48.500
<v Speaker 5>You're not throwing,</v>

8173
03:39:48.500 --> 03:39:49.580
<v Speaker 5>throwing kicks and punches,</v>

8174
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:51.590
<v Speaker 5>combat Jiu Jitsu are that starts,</v>

8175
03:39:51.620 --> 03:39:52.880
<v Speaker 5>but you're not kicking head kick,</v>

8176
03:39:52.890 --> 03:39:53.370
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

8177
03:39:53.370 --> 03:39:54.190
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

8178
03:39:54.190 --> 03:39:55.430
<v Speaker 5>Or palm strikes now,</v>

8179
03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:56.450
<v Speaker 5>but on the ground,</v>

8180
03:39:56.450 --> 03:39:57.231
<v Speaker 5>but only on the ground.</v>

8181
03:39:57.231 --> 03:39:58.064
<v Speaker 5>Not standing up,</v>

8182
03:39:58.390 --> 03:39:58.970
<v Speaker 5>wrestling,</v>

8183
03:39:58.970 --> 03:39:59.803
<v Speaker 5>standing up.</v>

8184
03:39:59.810 --> 03:40:01.400
<v Speaker 5>Only on the ground palm strikes.</v>

8185
03:40:01.550 --> 03:40:06.230
<v Speaker 5>It's designed not to add knockouts are Tkos to the show,</v>

8186
03:40:06.380 --> 03:40:08.000
<v Speaker 5>but to open submissions up.</v>

8187
03:40:08.390 --> 03:40:08.660
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

8188
03:40:08.660 --> 03:40:10.610
<v Speaker 5>there will be an a TKL every now and then,</v>

8189
03:40:10.611 --> 03:40:12.890
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think there's going to be that many with just your homes.</v>

8190
03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:14.000
<v Speaker 5>Do you ask no elbows?</v>

8191
03:40:14.001 --> 03:40:14.600
<v Speaker 5>No nothing.</v>

8192
03:40:14.600 --> 03:40:14.691
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

8193
03:40:14.691 --> 03:40:16.610
<v Speaker 5>but some guys can hit so hard with their palms.</v>

8194
03:40:16.611 --> 03:40:20.600
<v Speaker 5>Remember boss smashing guys with his palms rushing him.</v>

8195
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:24.230
<v Speaker 5>Well he figured out a way to pull his hands with my hand.</v>

8196
03:40:24.230 --> 03:40:25.610
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't even go that far back.</v>

8197
03:40:25.880 --> 03:40:27.260
<v Speaker 5>Like my hand stops.</v>

8198
03:40:27.280 --> 03:40:28.113
<v Speaker 5>He was right there.</v>

8199
03:40:28.260 --> 03:40:29.780
<v Speaker 5>That's as far as my hand goes back.</v>

8200
03:40:29.781 --> 03:40:34.730
<v Speaker 5>But boss gets his fucking hand back like an extra 10 15 degrees.</v>

8201
03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:37.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he stretched it or it's natural.</v>

8202
03:40:37.220 --> 03:40:38.930
<v Speaker 5>So he was just throwing punches.</v>

8203
03:40:39.260 --> 03:40:42.530
<v Speaker 5>He was throwing palm strike punches and just smashing guys.</v>

8204
03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:43.011
<v Speaker 5>Well here,</v>

8205
03:40:43.011 --> 03:40:47.240
<v Speaker 5>if you a accidentally throw an elbow or a closed fist strike,</v>

8206
03:40:47.540 --> 03:40:50.150
<v Speaker 5>stop the time that guy gets to be on your back.</v>

8207
03:40:50.151 --> 03:40:51.240
<v Speaker 5>Just like Ebi overtime.</v>

8208
03:40:51.320 --> 03:40:53.700
<v Speaker 5>And then we start in regulations.</v>

8209
03:40:53.701 --> 03:40:56.600
<v Speaker 5>Still start with the guy on your back with the leg hooks because you can't take</v>

8210
03:40:56.601 --> 03:40:58.010
<v Speaker 5>a point away when there's no points.</v>

8211
03:40:58.760 --> 03:40:59.593
<v Speaker 5>There's no points.</v>

8212
03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:00.553
<v Speaker 5>So what do you do?</v>

8213
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:01.730
<v Speaker 5>You have right there,</v>

8214
03:41:01.731 --> 03:41:02.091
<v Speaker 5>Bam.</v>

8215
03:41:02.091 --> 03:41:02.924
<v Speaker 5>Any,</v>

8216
03:41:03.020 --> 03:41:06.560
<v Speaker 5>any clear elbow striker closed fist strike.</v>

8217
03:41:06.770 --> 03:41:08.930
<v Speaker 5>I stopped the time you start on the back,</v>

8218
03:41:08.950 --> 03:41:13.200
<v Speaker 5>you know that'll just ensure the no one's tries to take you know that that</v>

8219
03:41:13.250 --> 03:41:13.940
<v Speaker 5>warning shot.</v>

8220
03:41:13.940 --> 03:41:14.061
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

8221
03:41:14.061 --> 03:41:14.894
<v Speaker 5>that was just a warning.</v>

8222
03:41:15.050 --> 03:41:15.651
<v Speaker 5>No warning.</v>

8223
03:41:15.651 --> 03:41:16.550
<v Speaker 5>It's clear shot.</v>

8224
03:41:16.970 --> 03:41:21.620
<v Speaker 5>That's automatic penalty if they Kayo and with that punch or an elbow because</v>

8225
03:41:21.621 --> 03:41:23.150
<v Speaker 5>the problem with that is if somebody,</v>

8226
03:41:23.151 --> 03:41:26.090
<v Speaker 5>that's a promise sacrifice that that might be want to sacrifice that.</v>

8227
03:41:26.091 --> 03:41:27.470
<v Speaker 5>If they want to catch somebody on the jaw,</v>

8228
03:41:27.680 --> 03:41:28.513
<v Speaker 5>they get,</v>

8229
03:41:28.630 --> 03:41:29.460
<v Speaker 5>it's a DQ.</v>

8230
03:41:29.460 --> 03:41:30.293
<v Speaker 5>Have to be a deal.</v>

8231
03:41:31.110 --> 03:41:32.660
<v Speaker 5>If the guy gets knocked out DQ.</v>

8232
03:41:32.720 --> 03:41:34.400
<v Speaker 5>What if the guy gets really hurt too?</v>

8233
03:41:34.401 --> 03:41:35.234
<v Speaker 5>We give them five.</v>

8234
03:41:35.350 --> 03:41:38.360
<v Speaker 5>I give them five minutes to recover and then he's going to be on Dude's back</v>

8235
03:41:38.361 --> 03:41:39.021
<v Speaker 5>from that point on.</v>

8236
03:41:39.021 --> 03:41:41.330
<v Speaker 5>What if he says after the five minutes he can't come back?</v>

8237
03:41:41.810 --> 03:41:43.070
<v Speaker 5>What if he says he got too fucked up?</v>

8238
03:41:43.071 --> 03:41:45.350
<v Speaker 5>Like what if somebody drops a bomb on him and he stays conscious,</v>

8239
03:41:45.560 --> 03:41:45.981
<v Speaker 5>but he's like,</v>

8240
03:41:45.981 --> 03:41:46.281
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

8241
03:41:46.281 --> 03:41:46.971
<v Speaker 5>I'm out of it.</v>

8242
03:41:46.971 --> 03:41:48.080
<v Speaker 5>My feet aren't working.</v>

8243
03:41:48.290 --> 03:41:49.250
<v Speaker 5>I can't do this.</v>

8244
03:41:49.250 --> 03:41:49.671
<v Speaker 5>I can't go.</v>

8245
03:41:49.671 --> 03:41:53.240
<v Speaker 5>I can't get hit again to Dq Dq,</v>

8246
03:41:54.530 --> 03:41:57.590
<v Speaker 5>so that'll live the opening for guys to to fake it.</v>

8247
03:41:57.620 --> 03:41:58.151
<v Speaker 5>That's a double.</v>

8248
03:41:58.151 --> 03:41:59.240
<v Speaker 5>That's a double DQ.</v>

8249
03:41:59.660 --> 03:41:59.901
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

8250
03:41:59.901 --> 03:42:00.681
<v Speaker 5>the guy that threw it,</v>

8251
03:42:00.681 --> 03:42:01.880
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be dqued for sure.</v>

8252
03:42:01.881 --> 03:42:02.180
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

8253
03:42:02.180 --> 03:42:02.620
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

8254
03:42:02.620 --> 03:42:03.453
<v Speaker 5>Guided through it,</v>

8255
03:42:03.770 --> 03:42:06.920
<v Speaker 5>but it also leaves room for someone to fake it that,</v>

8256
03:42:06.921 --> 03:42:09.860
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't that hard both out and the other guy wins because we're only doing</v>

8257
03:42:09.861 --> 03:42:11.640
<v Speaker 5>four man combat Jujitsu.</v>

8258
03:42:11.680 --> 03:42:11.980
<v Speaker 5>Turn it.</v>

8259
03:42:11.980 --> 03:42:12.500
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

8260
03:42:12.500 --> 03:42:13.370
<v Speaker 5>It's a four man thing.</v>

8261
03:42:13.490 --> 03:42:15.360
<v Speaker 5>We're still doing the regular Ebi rule.</v>

8262
03:42:15.361 --> 03:42:17.600
<v Speaker 5>16 land welterweight tournament Sunday,</v>

8263

<v Speaker 5>March 5th on UFC fight pass,</v>

8264
03:42:19.700 --> 03:42:23.750
<v Speaker 5>but in between the rounds of the regular Ebi 16 Man Tournament,</v>

8265
03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:26.270
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be a four man combat Jiu Jitsu tournament.</v>

8266
03:42:26.510 --> 03:42:27.200

03:42:31.501 --> 03:42:31.980
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be</v>

8273
03:42:31.980 --> 03:42:32.970
<v Speaker 2>interesting how it turns out.</v>

8274
03:42:33.410 --> 03:42:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Imagine Ebi,</v>

8275
03:42:34.740 --> 03:42:37.770
<v Speaker 2>but you can palm strike as hard as you can on the floor.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Combat Sambo combat.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Sambo is one of the best martial arts for people enter into MMA.</v>

8281
03:42:52.120 --> 03:42:52.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8282

03:42:53.730 --> 03:42:53.880
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

8288
03:42:56.011 --> 03:42:57.520
<v Speaker 2>It always short and it gets a little short.</v>

8289
03:42:57.521 --> 03:42:58.261
<v Speaker 2>It's not full length.</v>

8290
03:42:58.261 --> 03:42:58.810
<v Speaker 2>He had been there.</v>

8291
03:42:58.810 --> 03:42:59.643
<v Speaker 2>That goes back here.</v>

8292
03:42:59.850 --> 03:43:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>

8293
03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:03.150
<v Speaker 2>it's enough that you could get a good grip on each other.</v>

8294
03:43:03.370 --> 03:43:04.470
<v Speaker 2>They're cut off sleeves,</v>

8295
03:43:04.471 --> 03:43:04.651
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

8296
03:43:04.651 --> 03:43:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I think they're like karate kid.</v>

8297
03:43:05.910 --> 03:43:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Like Kilkee Shin a thing.</v>

8298
03:43:06.851 --> 03:43:07.630
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

8299
03:43:07.630 --> 03:43:08.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like the thing,</v>

8300
03:43:08.581 --> 03:43:09.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

8301
03:43:09.130 --> 03:43:10.140
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like it is,</v>

8302
03:43:10.380 --> 03:43:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I think a little sleeve fate combat sambo.</v>

8303
03:43:13.621 --> 03:43:15.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more long than you think it is.</v>

8304
03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I think I know what you're thinking of variations there will be different,</v>

8305
03:43:20.070 --> 03:43:23.160
<v Speaker 2>but I believe probably that should be a Jujitsu.</v>

8306
03:43:23.760 --> 03:43:27.360
<v Speaker 2>He's got a full sleeves fedoras fighting in combat against the guy from the</v>

8307
03:43:27.361 --> 03:43:28.194
<v Speaker 2>university that,</v>

8308
03:43:28.420 --> 03:43:30.030
<v Speaker 2>and we know what they do have though.</v>

8309
03:43:30.031 --> 03:43:30.390
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

8310
03:43:30.390 --> 03:43:31.021
<v Speaker 2>Oh damn.</v>

8311
03:43:31.021 --> 03:43:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Fado was a beast in this shit.</v>

8312
03:43:32.341 --> 03:43:34.410
<v Speaker 2>See this is not in a cage and they're fighting.</v>

8313
03:43:35.100 --> 03:43:36.910
<v Speaker 2>They also have shoes on,</v>

8314
03:43:37.350 --> 03:43:38.900
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing ground impound.</v>

8315
03:43:38.940 --> 03:43:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Look at this with headgear on has got to stop.</v>

8316
03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:45.240
<v Speaker 2>The world is not as is missing something here and look what they've been doing.</v>

8317
03:43:45.570 --> 03:43:47.190
<v Speaker 2>They've been doing this for a long time.</v>

8318
03:43:47.400 --> 03:43:47.880
<v Speaker 2>The world,</v>

8319
03:43:47.880 --> 03:43:50.430
<v Speaker 2>the world really needs to zero in on what,</v>

8320
03:43:50.640 --> 03:43:53.040
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing in Russia with the combat sambo</v>

8321
03:43:54.780 --> 03:43:54.930
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

8322
03:43:54.930 --> 03:43:55.830
<v Speaker 2>But let me ask you this,</v>

8323
03:43:55.950 --> 03:44:00.950
<v Speaker 2>why is that better with Judogi on instead of just doing combat sambo,</v>

8324
03:44:01.200 --> 03:44:03.060
<v Speaker 2>like MMA amateur style.</v>

8325
03:44:03.060 --> 03:44:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's really what it is.</v>

8326
03:44:04.290 --> 03:44:06.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just there's more grappling because they're allowed to grab ahold of the</v>

8327
03:44:06.901 --> 03:44:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Geek.</v>

8328
03:44:07.340 --> 03:44:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8329
03:44:07.520 --> 03:44:10.770
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange because in a lot of ways you could get more vulnerable.</v>

8330
03:44:11.010 --> 03:44:13.290
<v Speaker 2>You're putting yourself into positions that you might not be in.</v>

8331
03:44:13.291 --> 03:44:14.124
<v Speaker 2>So they're doing,</v>

8332
03:44:14.340 --> 03:44:16.260
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a version of MMA,</v>

8333
03:44:16.410 --> 03:44:20.130
<v Speaker 2>but you can grab each other better because you have all the g like this kind of</v>

8334
03:44:20.131 --> 03:44:20.940
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

8335
03:44:20.940 --> 03:44:22.170
<v Speaker 2>And you also,</v>

8336
03:44:22.460 --> 03:44:23.340
<v Speaker 2>there's no cage.</v>

8337
03:44:23.550 --> 03:44:26.040
<v Speaker 2>The basic idea they're doing,</v>

8338
03:44:26.050 --> 03:44:27.000
<v Speaker 2>it's the size of vote,</v>

8339
03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:28.610
<v Speaker 2>like an Olympic wrestling match.</v>

8340
03:44:28.890 --> 03:44:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

8341
03:44:29.310 --> 03:44:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

8342
03:44:29.820 --> 03:44:30.511
<v Speaker 2>That's all you need.</v>

8343
03:44:30.511 --> 03:44:31.344
<v Speaker 2>You don't need,</v>

8344
03:44:32.130 --> 03:44:32.963
<v Speaker 2>you don't need a cage.</v>

8345
03:44:33.240 --> 03:44:34.620
<v Speaker 2>It's better off without a cage.</v>

8346
03:44:34.680 --> 03:44:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

8347
03:44:35.310 --> 03:44:38.790
<v Speaker 2>it's way better off without a cage and when people stand up,</v>

8348
03:44:38.820 --> 03:44:40.380
<v Speaker 2>they actually have to stand up.</v>

8349
03:44:40.620 --> 03:44:42.180
<v Speaker 2>You can't push up against the end,</v>

8350
03:44:42.330 --> 03:44:43.770
<v Speaker 2>better seating for everybody.</v>

8351
03:44:43.771 --> 03:44:44.640
<v Speaker 2>You could see better.</v>

8352
03:44:44.670 --> 03:44:46.710
<v Speaker 2>That's the most important thing right there.</v>

8353
03:44:46.710 --> 03:44:51.030
<v Speaker 2>The most important thing is you can see way better as a spectator,</v>

8354
03:44:51.210 --> 03:44:53.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's new IFCs most of the time,</v>

8355
03:44:53.011 --> 03:44:54.510
<v Speaker 2>most of the guys are looking at the big screens.</v>

8356
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:56.310
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to see through the cage.</v>

8357
03:44:56.400 --> 03:44:57.990
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to see through the fence.</v>

8358
03:44:58.380 --> 03:45:01.470
<v Speaker 2>It's that easy to see through the house as you keep psychos from different</v>

8359
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:04.860
<v Speaker 2>rushing onto the mat and you know working people in the head,</v>

8360
03:45:04.890 --> 03:45:05.570
<v Speaker 2>no you don't want to,</v>

8361
03:45:05.570 --> 03:45:06.450
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to do that.</v>

8362
03:45:06.451 --> 03:45:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I NMA event.</v>

8363
03:45:07.291 --> 03:45:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Those guys or those guys would never have the balls to do that.</v>

8364
03:45:09.961 --> 03:45:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

8365
03:45:10.290 --> 03:45:15.290
<v Speaker 2>You imagine if Anderson Silva like lost by some funky way and people were</v>

8366
03:45:15.361 --> 03:45:18.090
<v Speaker 2>betting and there's a bunch of Brazilians in the crowd and they stormed the</v>

8367
03:45:18.091 --> 03:45:21.350
<v Speaker 2>American stormed cause say 1990 setting show.</v>

8368
03:45:21.360 --> 03:45:22.193
<v Speaker 2>It can happen.</v>

8369
03:45:22.320 --> 03:45:22.561
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

8370
03:45:22.561 --> 03:45:23.370
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

8371
03:45:23.370 --> 03:45:25.830
<v Speaker 2>people get in fights all the time inside the ring.</v>

8372
03:45:27.330 --> 03:45:28.590
<v Speaker 2>I like the no cage at all.</v>

8373
03:45:28.740 --> 03:45:30.050
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about the GE?</v>

8374
03:45:30.610 --> 03:45:31.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that's okay.</v>

8375
03:45:32.330 --> 03:45:33.730
<v Speaker 3>He's taking a totally different approach.</v>

8376
03:45:34.600 --> 03:45:35.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't see a problem with that.</v>

8377
03:45:35.471 --> 03:45:36.070
<v Speaker 3>It's different.</v>

8378
03:45:36.070 --> 03:45:36.850
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

8379
03:45:36.850 --> 03:45:38.440
<v Speaker 3>At least there's punches and strikes.</v>

8380
03:45:38.500 --> 03:45:39.041
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah man.</v>

8381
03:45:39.041 --> 03:45:39.461
<v Speaker 3>I know what I mean.</v>

8382
03:45:39.461 --> 03:45:40.261
<v Speaker 3>So the Gig,</v>

8383
03:45:40.261 --> 03:45:41.350
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with the gay,</v>

8384
03:45:42.020 --> 03:45:43.180
<v Speaker 3>you know right here.</v>

8385
03:45:43.590 --> 03:45:44.423
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

8386
03:45:45.040 --> 03:45:45.730
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

8387
03:45:45.730 --> 03:45:45.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

8388
03:45:45.930 --> 03:45:48.970
<v Speaker 3>You might not want to grab the sleeves as much if someone can punch you,</v>

8389
03:45:49.090 --> 03:45:49.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

8390
03:45:49.511 --> 03:45:52.000
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe you don't grab the sleeves as much,</v>

8391
03:45:52.030 --> 03:45:52.540
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

8392
03:45:52.540 --> 03:45:53.081
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

8393
03:45:53.081 --> 03:45:54.480
<v Speaker 3>I haven't really even looked at this.</v>

8394
03:45:54.690 --> 03:45:56.440
<v Speaker 3>This is going to start paying attention to this</v>

8395
03:45:56.800 --> 03:45:57.820
<v Speaker 4>crazy way to fight,</v>

8396
03:45:57.821 --> 03:45:58.001
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

8397
03:45:58.001 --> 03:45:59.860
<v Speaker 4>Cause he can hold you in this position.</v>

8398
03:46:00.180 --> 03:46:00.601
<v Speaker 4>That shit.</v>

8399
03:46:00.601 --> 03:46:00.850
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

8400
03:46:00.850 --> 03:46:03.670
<v Speaker 4>he's pounding on you with a Gian in a lot of ways.</v>

8401
03:46:03.671 --> 03:46:05.620
<v Speaker 4>It's more dangerous and a lot of ways,</v>

8402
03:46:05.621 --> 03:46:07.030
<v Speaker 4>this is your argument,</v>

8403
03:46:07.070 --> 03:46:07.480
<v Speaker 4>Eddie,</v>

8404
03:46:07.480 --> 03:46:08.201
<v Speaker 4>for MMA.</v>

8405
03:46:08.201 --> 03:46:09.820
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no grease involved here.</v>

8406
03:46:09.920 --> 03:46:10.520
<v Speaker 3>No grease.</v>

8407
03:46:10.520 --> 03:46:11.470
<v Speaker 3>Zero Greece.</v>

8408
03:46:11.490 --> 03:46:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

8409
03:46:12.170 --> 03:46:13.610
<v Speaker 3>and they're wearing jackets.</v>

8410
03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:17.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying make them wear Reebok rash guards.</v>

8411
03:46:17.331 --> 03:46:18.740
<v Speaker 3>It'd be so goddamn cool</v>

8412
03:46:18.840 --> 03:46:20.310
<v Speaker 4>or let them continue to,</v>

8413
03:46:20.311 --> 03:46:20.461
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

8414
03:46:20.461 --> 03:46:21.031
<v Speaker 4>he just ripped.</v>

8415
03:46:21.031 --> 03:46:22.220
<v Speaker 4>That guy showed the shore.</v>

8416
03:46:22.530 --> 03:46:25.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe let them wear the judo pants too.</v>

8417
03:46:26.730 --> 03:46:27.563
<v Speaker 3>It how much,</v>

8418
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:29.330
<v Speaker 3>how about let them wear whatever they want.</v>

8419
03:46:29.331 --> 03:46:30.410
<v Speaker 3>If they want to wear a rash guard,</v>

8420
03:46:30.411 --> 03:46:30.741
<v Speaker 3>they can.</v>

8421
03:46:30.741 --> 03:46:31.251
<v Speaker 3>If they don't,</v>

8422
03:46:31.251 --> 03:46:31.940
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to,</v>

8423
03:46:31.940 --> 03:46:32.451
<v Speaker 3>but here's a,</v>

8424
03:46:32.451 --> 03:46:33.470
<v Speaker 3>here's a whatever they want.</v>

8425
03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:37.970
<v Speaker 4>Here's a point to think about the way he is right here with the shorts on.</v>

8426
03:46:38.240 --> 03:46:42.290
<v Speaker 4>It's not as big of a factor because we're where he's going to most of the time</v>

8427
03:46:42.291 --> 03:46:44.600
<v Speaker 4>be in contact with is covered with cloth,</v>

8428
03:46:45.020 --> 03:46:45.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

8429
03:46:45.460 --> 03:46:45.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

8430
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:47.840
<v Speaker 4>because his legs are going to be wrapped around the other guys.</v>

8431
03:46:47.841 --> 03:46:48.680
<v Speaker 4>Upper Body.</v>

8432
03:46:48.800 --> 03:46:50.630
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a wrapped around his arms.</v>

8433
03:46:50.720 --> 03:46:51.950
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff's covered in cost,</v>

8434
03:46:51.951 --> 03:46:53.480
<v Speaker 4>so he doesn't even need pants.</v>

8435
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

8436
03:46:53.870 --> 03:46:55.790
<v Speaker 4>so it's just a different approach.</v>

8437
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:58.220
<v Speaker 4>Instead of using a rash guard like you came up with,</v>

8438
03:46:58.250 --> 03:46:59.830
<v Speaker 4>it's just using MMA.</v>

8439
03:46:59.880 --> 03:47:01.730
<v Speaker 4>Maybe combat sambos the fucking way to go.</v>

8440
03:47:01.910 --> 03:47:03.320
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's a geek for real.</v>

8441
03:47:04.820 --> 03:47:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Maybe when you really stop and think about it,</v>

8442
03:47:06.411 --> 03:47:07.244
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

8443
03:47:07.760 --> 03:47:08.593
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

8444
03:47:10.040 --> 03:47:10.521
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

8445
03:47:10.521 --> 03:47:11.354
<v Speaker 4>that's a really,</v>

8446
03:47:11.440 --> 03:47:12.770
<v Speaker 3>because they're already doing it.</v>

8447
03:47:12.771 --> 03:47:13.604
<v Speaker 3>They got it down.</v>

8448
03:47:13.730 --> 03:47:14.481
<v Speaker 3>They shut out of there.</v>

8449
03:47:14.481 --> 03:47:16.070
<v Speaker 3>You should have a variation for an Ebi.</v>

8450
03:47:16.610 --> 03:47:16.791
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

8451
03:47:16.791 --> 03:47:17.241
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

8452
03:47:17.241 --> 03:47:18.350
<v Speaker 3>with combat Jujitsu,</v>

8453
03:47:18.440 --> 03:47:19.760
<v Speaker 3>we're going to see how that goes first.</v>

8454
03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:21.200
<v Speaker 3>It could be a disaster.</v>

8455
03:47:21.260 --> 03:47:21.471
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

8456
03:47:21.471 --> 03:47:24.650
<v Speaker 3>it could be a total disaster or it could be a total success.</v>

8457
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:25.201
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be,</v>

8458
03:47:25.201 --> 03:47:26.034
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

8459
03:47:26.040 --> 03:47:28.370
<v Speaker 3>I think Jiu Jitsu with some palm strikes,</v>

8460
03:47:28.400 --> 03:47:30.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how that can be bad.</v>

8461
03:47:30.800 --> 03:47:31.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how that can fail.</v>

8462
03:47:31.881 --> 03:47:32.360
<v Speaker 3>It's an,</v>

8463
03:47:32.360 --> 03:47:33.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a little closer to MMA.</v>

8464
03:47:33.771 --> 03:47:34.604
<v Speaker 3>It's not an a,</v>

8465
03:47:34.650 --> 03:47:35.510
<v Speaker 3>it's not even close,</v>

8466
03:47:35.511 --> 03:47:38.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's a little closer than your regular submission.</v>

8467
03:47:38.271 --> 03:47:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Only Jiu Jitsu match.</v>

8468
03:47:39.860 --> 03:47:41.550
<v Speaker 3>So to this</v>

8469
03:47:41.800 --> 03:47:43.180
<v Speaker 4>fade or when he was at king,</v>

8470
03:47:43.450 --> 03:47:44.170
<v Speaker 4>he'll get here fade.</v>

8471
03:47:44.170 --> 03:47:46.570
<v Speaker 4>Oregon's semi shell look at this shit man.</v>

8472
03:47:46.960 --> 03:47:48.310
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

8473
03:47:48.550 --> 03:47:50.320
<v Speaker 4>He was so dominant dude.</v>

8474
03:47:51.190 --> 03:47:52.510
<v Speaker 4>And you know the one thing,</v>

8475
03:47:53.080 --> 03:47:54.040
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus.</v>

8476
03:47:54.240 --> 03:47:57.970
<v Speaker 4>And one thing you got to read really be impressed with when it comes to faith</v>

8477
03:47:57.971 --> 03:48:01.210
<v Speaker 4>oars victories is that he fought that crazy shit.</v>

8478

<v Speaker 4>When you can stomp and soccer kick like go get that.</v>

8479
03:48:04.450 --> 03:48:09.010

8480
03:48:09.011 --> 03:48:09.700
<v Speaker 4>king,</v>

8481
03:48:09.700 --> 03:48:11.680
<v Speaker 4>when he was the best fucking heavyweight in the world,</v>

8482
03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:15.190
<v Speaker 4>they have the craziest rule system in all of MMA.</v>

8483
03:48:15.820 --> 03:48:16.630
<v Speaker 4>Stomps,</v>

8484
03:48:16.630 --> 03:48:17.920
<v Speaker 4>soccer kicks.</v>

8485
03:48:18.370 --> 03:48:21.330
<v Speaker 4>You could basically do anything that you needed to hit on the ground.</v>

8486
03:48:21.720 --> 03:48:22.553
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

8487

<v Speaker 2>I have pictures of me.</v>

8503
03:48:38.001 --> 03:48:43.001
<v Speaker 2>And when Daddy got Amsterdam Training Jiu Jitsu from 2001 well this one Kevin</v>

8504
03:48:44.231 --> 03:48:46.280
<v Speaker 2>random and slammed him and as he's going down,</v>

8505
03:48:46.281 --> 03:48:47.570
<v Speaker 2>he's holding on looking at him.</v>

8506
03:48:47.571 --> 03:48:52.000
<v Speaker 2>He's literally landing on his head trying to hold onto a Komora.</v>

8507
03:48:52.370 --> 03:48:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean who survives like that and then the escapes and taps him right here.</v>

8508
03:48:56.211 --> 03:48:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8509
03:48:56.390 --> 03:48:57.380
<v Speaker 2>he got him in a Kamora.</v>

8510
03:49:00.110 --> 03:49:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8511
03:49:00.490 --> 03:49:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Fader was something special,</v>

8512
03:49:01.611 --> 03:49:02.120
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

8513
03:49:02.120 --> 03:49:02.953
<v Speaker 2>He was really something.</v>

8514
03:49:04.010 --> 03:49:05.870
<v Speaker 2>He just got up reversed.</v>

8515
03:49:05.900 --> 03:49:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Just rolled them over.</v>

8516
03:49:07.040 --> 03:49:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8517
03:49:07.430 --> 03:49:08.263
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

8518
03:49:08.930 --> 03:49:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Loosen them up with these punches.</v>

8519
03:49:10.610 --> 03:49:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Trap the arm and Bingo.</v>

8520
03:49:12.290 --> 03:49:13.123
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

8521
03:49:13.600 --> 03:49:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

8522
03:49:13.870 --> 03:49:14.720
<v Speaker 2>It's going right to that.</v>

8523
03:49:14.721 --> 03:49:15.620
<v Speaker 2>He's not messing around.</v>

8524
03:49:16.670 --> 03:49:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's hard to knock someone out.</v>

8525
03:49:18.280 --> 03:49:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

8526
03:49:18.920 --> 03:49:22.220
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you wrap that up tab to get outta here.</v>

8527
03:49:22.850 --> 03:49:25.280
<v Speaker 2>He was also knock dudes out from that position.</v>

8528
03:49:25.340 --> 03:49:25.810
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

8529
03:49:25.810 --> 03:49:28.250
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that you gotta give him credit for,</v>

8530
03:49:28.620 --> 03:49:32.180
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get fade or credit for the ability to tap guys out and knocked him</v>

8531
03:49:32.181 --> 03:49:33.014
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

8532
03:49:33.510 --> 03:49:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Cause he was a guy that was always threatening with submissions,</v>

8533
03:49:36.620 --> 03:49:37.960
<v Speaker 2>catching people with a armbars,</v>

8534
03:49:38.060 --> 03:49:39.920
<v Speaker 2>catching people Kimora is everything.</v>

8535
03:49:40.250 --> 03:49:40.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8536
03:49:40.491 --> 03:49:41.390
<v Speaker 2>he could do everything.</v>

8537
03:49:41.391 --> 03:49:42.081
<v Speaker 2>He could rear naked,</v>

8538
03:49:42.081 --> 03:49:46.790
<v Speaker 2>choke you everything and he would explode and take everything that was</v>

8539
03:49:46.791 --> 03:49:47.360
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>

8540
03:49:47.360 --> 03:49:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Would you allow and Rogan finding championships in basketball arenas with rash</v>

8541
03:49:51.531 --> 03:49:51.771
<v Speaker 2>guards.</v>

8542
03:49:51.771 --> 03:49:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Would you allow a stomps to the head?</v>

8543
03:49:54.290 --> 03:49:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

8544
03:49:54.980 --> 03:49:56.660
<v Speaker 2>What about a kicks?</v>

8545
03:49:56.730 --> 03:49:59.870
<v Speaker 2>And he said everything hundred percent Dan.</v>

8546
03:50:00.090 --> 03:50:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Hundred percent we need a backer.</v>

8547
03:50:01.690 --> 03:50:02.523
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

8548
03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:03.710
<v Speaker 2>no gloves.</v>

8549
03:50:03.920 --> 03:50:04.731
<v Speaker 2>Knees to the head.</v>

8550
03:50:04.731 --> 03:50:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Soccer kicks to the head,</v>

8551
03:50:05.810 --> 03:50:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but really good referees.</v>

8552
03:50:07.720 --> 03:50:08.553
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

8553
03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Some crazy millionaire.</v>

8554
03:50:09.601 --> 03:50:10.670
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to finance it.</v>

8555
03:50:10.880 --> 03:50:11.571
<v Speaker 2>I'd say good luck,</v>

8556
03:50:11.571 --> 03:50:11.841
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

8557
03:50:11.841 --> 03:50:12.650
<v Speaker 2>You could use my name.</v>

8558
03:50:12.650 --> 03:50:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

8559
03:50:13.190 --> 03:50:13.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

03:50:13.311 --> 03:50:13.611

8561
03:50:13.611 --> 03:50:13.880
<v Speaker 2>Rogan.</v>

03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:15.381
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

8564
03:50:15.381 --> 03:50:15.761
<v Speaker 2>Let's do,</v>

8565
03:50:15.761 --> 03:50:16.481
<v Speaker 2>I think it's got to be,</v>

8566
03:50:16.481 --> 03:50:18.380
<v Speaker 2>so if you do really well,</v>

8567
03:50:18.381 --> 03:50:19.214
<v Speaker 2>eventually I'm gonna see you.</v>

8568
03:50:19.700 --> 03:50:20.533
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

8569
03:50:21.390 --> 03:50:22.100
<v Speaker 2>not a sewer.</v>

8570
03:50:22.100 --> 03:50:22.281
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

8571
03:50:22.281 --> 03:50:23.630
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good name for it anyway.</v>

8572
03:50:23.631 --> 03:50:27.010
<v Speaker 2>It should be something like unlimited fighting or so broken.</v>

8573
03:50:27.100 --> 03:50:27.933
<v Speaker 2>Now I,</v>

8574
03:50:27.980 --> 03:50:28.880
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't have my name in it.</v>

8575
03:50:28.881 --> 03:50:30.040
<v Speaker 2>It should be something like,</v>

8576
03:50:30.041 --> 03:50:30.380

03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Mexico,</v>

8589
03:50:51.970 --> 03:50:52.803
<v Speaker 2>Bubba casino.</v>

8590
03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:55.640
<v Speaker 2>That might be Mexico's when he was doing a basketball arena,</v>

8591
03:50:55.800 --> 03:50:58.970
<v Speaker 2>hologram basketball and an on an Indian reservation.</v>

8592
03:50:59.230 --> 03:50:59.840
<v Speaker 2>You need,</v>

8593
03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:01.550
<v Speaker 2>he would need really good security though,</v>

8594
03:51:01.551 --> 03:51:02.870
<v Speaker 2>especially on amateur fights,</v>

8595
03:51:02.871 --> 03:51:05.540
<v Speaker 2>on Indian reservations and things like that because people will rush that</v>

8596
03:51:05.541 --> 03:51:06.290
<v Speaker 2>fucking Matt,</v>

8597
03:51:06.290 --> 03:51:08.480
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to stop people from Russia in the map.</v>

8598
03:51:08.990 --> 03:51:11.540
<v Speaker 2>That's the one thing that saves people in the cage.</v>

8599
03:51:11.840 --> 03:51:13.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like when they rushed the cage,</v>

8600
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.791
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole event.</v>

8601
03:51:13.791 --> 03:51:14.650
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to get to,</v>

8602
03:51:14.670 --> 03:51:16.250
<v Speaker 2>everyone's got to sit in the bleachers,</v>

8603
03:51:16.340 --> 03:51:16.581
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

8604
03:51:16.581 --> 03:51:18.140
<v Speaker 2>No one's allowed to sit on the floor.</v>

8605
03:51:18.141 --> 03:51:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Everyone sits on the bleachers.</v>

8606
03:51:19.730 --> 03:51:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8607
03:51:20.240 --> 03:51:20.960
<v Speaker 2>That's your shit.</v>

8608
03:51:20.960 --> 03:51:21.530
<v Speaker 2>There should be,</v>

8609
03:51:21.530 --> 03:51:25.830
<v Speaker 2>it should be difficult to get to the case or get to the bat area and there</v>

8610
03:51:25.831 --> 03:51:27.420
<v Speaker 2>should be a lot of security.</v>

8611
03:51:27.500 --> 03:51:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8612
03:51:27.810 --> 03:51:31.290
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to have people standing by and all these areas also to</v>

8613
03:51:31.291 --> 03:51:33.380
<v Speaker 2>block people to block fighters.</v>

8614
03:51:33.400 --> 03:51:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Keep them from going into the crowd is going to have to be someone that makes</v>

8615
03:51:36.391 --> 03:51:39.060
<v Speaker 2>like almost like a physical wall that stops them.</v>

8616
03:51:39.061 --> 03:51:40.350
<v Speaker 2>If someone's bum rushing.</v>

8617
03:51:41.040 --> 03:51:41.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8618
03:51:42.180 --> 03:51:46.200
<v Speaker 2>but there's got to be like a warning tracked and you gotta like not,</v>

8619
03:51:46.230 --> 03:51:50.310
<v Speaker 2>you got to respect that warning track has got to be a big ass area as you get</v>

8620
03:51:50.311 --> 03:51:51.780
<v Speaker 2>into the outside ring.</v>

8621
03:51:51.780 --> 03:51:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8622
03:51:52.230 --> 03:51:53.780
<v Speaker 2>You gotta break Selfie shot.</v>

8623
03:51:53.810 --> 03:51:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8624
03:51:54.070 --> 03:51:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I going to want to go once you know there's no where to go,</v>

8625
03:51:57.210 --> 03:51:58.260
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to go that way.</v>

8626
03:51:58.440 --> 03:51:59.400
<v Speaker 2>When there's a fence,</v>

8627
03:51:59.470 --> 03:52:00.810
<v Speaker 2>you'd lean on it,</v>

8628
03:52:01.050 --> 03:52:01.890
<v Speaker 2>your pressure him,</v>

8629
03:52:01.950 --> 03:52:03.300
<v Speaker 2>he's leaning on the fence.</v>

8630
03:52:03.450 --> 03:52:04.283
<v Speaker 2>But if it's not there,</v>

8631
03:52:04.310 --> 03:52:05.400
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to do you any good.</v>

8632
03:52:05.610 --> 03:52:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

8633
03:52:06.120 --> 03:52:06.660
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>

8634
03:52:06.660 --> 03:52:11.510
<v Speaker 2>if you've got pressed against the fence and they break it immediately after a</v>

8635
03:52:11.511 --> 03:52:11.761
<v Speaker 2>while,</v>

8636
03:52:11.761 --> 03:52:12.481
<v Speaker 2>people would be like,</v>

8637
03:52:12.481 --> 03:52:14.700
<v Speaker 2>what's the point of pushing him against the fence?</v>

8638
03:52:14.701 --> 03:52:16.350
<v Speaker 2>And they're going to break it up in one second.</v>

8639
03:52:16.830 --> 03:52:17.191
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

8640
03:52:17.191 --> 03:52:20.110
<v Speaker 2>So then there's not going to be strategies that involve the fence,</v>

8641
03:52:20.340 --> 03:52:21.600
<v Speaker 2>so it will be no fence.</v>

8642
03:52:21.960 --> 03:52:22.141
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

8643
03:52:22.141 --> 03:52:22.880
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

8644
03:52:22.880 --> 03:52:25.350
<v Speaker 2>But you could do accomplish the same thing in a,</v>

8645
03:52:25.351 --> 03:52:25.921
<v Speaker 2>in a ring.</v>

8646
03:52:25.921 --> 03:52:27.600
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to go on the outside.</v>

8647
03:52:27.660 --> 03:52:28.710
<v Speaker 2>You're going to start looking around.</v>

8648
03:52:28.711 --> 03:52:29.880
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a wrestling match.</v>

8649
03:52:30.040 --> 03:52:31.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like combat sambo.</v>

8650
03:52:31.290 --> 03:52:32.790
<v Speaker 2>They're not trying to get to the outside.</v>

8651
03:52:32.850 --> 03:52:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8652
03:52:33.180 --> 03:52:34.350
<v Speaker 2>You know what you could do,</v>

8653
03:52:34.380 --> 03:52:37.320
<v Speaker 2>you actually could do some sort of offense,</v>

8654
03:52:37.650 --> 03:52:39.180
<v Speaker 2>but you're not allowed to go anywhere near it.</v>

8655
03:52:40.210 --> 03:52:41.260
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen if you touched it?</v>

8656
03:52:41.261 --> 03:52:41.760
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it,</v>

8657
03:52:41.760 --> 03:52:43.750
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't want the fence because it's all about the visual.</v>

8658
03:52:43.751 --> 03:52:44.041
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

8659
03:52:44.041 --> 03:52:44.910
<v Speaker 2>it's all about the visuals.</v>

8660
03:52:44.911 --> 03:52:45.744
<v Speaker 2>You'll be fine.</v>

8661
03:52:46.020 --> 03:52:46.561
<v Speaker 2>Maybe electric,</v>

8662
03:52:46.561 --> 03:52:47.220
<v Speaker 2>basketball,</v>

8663
03:52:47.220 --> 03:52:48.900
<v Speaker 2>maybe like one of them things or a dog collar.</v>

8664
03:52:49.250 --> 03:52:50.520
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do you step out of bounds.</v>

8665
03:52:50.530 --> 03:52:51.510
<v Speaker 2>I think I get to a free shot.</v>

8666
03:52:51.570 --> 03:52:52.920
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen an electric fences?</v>

8667
03:52:52.921 --> 03:52:55.620
<v Speaker 2>The dogs have where they get to a certain part that gets zapped.</v>

8668
03:52:56.380 --> 03:52:57.780
<v Speaker 2>You set up the stakes in the ground.</v>

8669
03:52:57.781 --> 03:53:00.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like a radio frequency and when it gets to a certain point and the dog</v>

8670
03:53:00.811 --> 03:53:01.740
<v Speaker 2>passes that line,</v>

8671
03:53:01.741 --> 03:53:05.850
<v Speaker 2>you know it's about if you take someone and you push someone out of bounds,</v>

8672
03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:06.833
<v Speaker 2>your opponent,</v>

8673
03:53:07.440 --> 03:53:09.990
<v Speaker 2>they stop it and that guy gets on your back blooming.</v>

8674
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.650
<v Speaker 2>It started from there.</v>

8675
03:53:10.650 --> 03:53:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if you were front row and you saw Travis Brown and Derrick</v>

8676
03:53:14.910 --> 03:53:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Lewis dog and your way trust someone to try to defend a take down the other ones</v>

8677
03:53:18.301 --> 03:53:20.550
<v Speaker 2>trying to get it and they're coming straight towards you and you realize,</v>

8678
03:53:20.551 --> 03:53:21.240
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

8679
03:53:21.240 --> 03:53:22.980
<v Speaker 2>that guy was blocking is not going to get two on top.</v>

8680
03:53:22.981 --> 03:53:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get crushed.</v>

8681
03:53:24.330 --> 03:53:27.180
<v Speaker 2>And you get crushed by Derrick Lewis and Travis Brown on top of you.</v>

8682
03:53:28.290 --> 03:53:30.180
<v Speaker 2>You're stupid front row seats now bitch.</v>

8683
03:53:31.500 --> 03:53:32.333
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

8684
03:53:32.430 --> 03:53:34.080
<v Speaker 2>Like you ever see that happen in a basketball game?</v>

8685
03:53:34.530 --> 03:53:37.910
<v Speaker 2>We're dudes falls on Jesus different.</v>

8686
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:39.150
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to happen in fighting.</v>

8687
03:53:39.450 --> 03:53:40.380
<v Speaker 2>It could easily happen.</v>

8688
03:53:40.381 --> 03:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>And finally you would have to have a good amount of space,</v>

8689
03:53:44.070 --> 03:53:45.600
<v Speaker 2>a good amount of space,</v>

8690
03:53:45.960 --> 03:53:48.240
<v Speaker 2>and I wouldn't take the front row for a fucking bet.</v>

8691
03:53:48.410 --> 03:53:49.243
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

8692
03:53:50.640 --> 03:53:51.473
<v Speaker 2>I would do.</v>

8693
03:53:51.510 --> 03:53:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8694
03:53:52.290 --> 03:53:53.370
<v Speaker 2>he made it like to the,</v>

8695
03:53:53.371 --> 03:53:55.560
<v Speaker 2>that guy leaped into the audience and he made,</v>

8696
03:53:55.860 --> 03:53:59.310
<v Speaker 2>the guys will have a little pads like you know pads.</v>

8697
03:54:00.090 --> 03:54:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

8698
03:54:01.890 --> 03:54:06.310
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to be doing that is so exciting for to save balls from going.</v>

8699
03:54:06.340 --> 03:54:07.320
<v Speaker 2>He's just crowd a bounce.</v>

8700
03:54:07.321 --> 03:54:07.771
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

8701
03:54:07.771 --> 03:54:10.770
<v Speaker 2>But I did fly into those people and someone could have died.</v>

8702
03:54:11.130 --> 03:54:12.240
<v Speaker 2>He's 400 pounds.</v>

8703
03:54:12.241 --> 03:54:13.140
<v Speaker 2>He's so big.</v>

8704
03:54:13.530 --> 03:54:15.720
<v Speaker 2>If he landed on your hand and talk there,</v>

8705
03:54:16.540 --> 03:54:19.890
<v Speaker 2>no guitar player invest in Atlanta.</v>

8706
03:54:21.200 --> 03:54:24.520
<v Speaker 2>He just smashes all your fingers like crack,</v>

8707
03:54:24.521 --> 03:54:24.791
<v Speaker 2>crack,</v>

03:54:28.720 --> 03:54:30.070
<v Speaker 2>You know those disposable chopsticks,</v>

8712
03:54:30.071 --> 03:54:32.050
<v Speaker 2>they give you some Sushi places and you fucking break.</v>

8713
03:54:32.051 --> 03:54:32.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm wrong.</v>

8714
03:54:32.500 --> 03:54:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

8715
03:54:33.160 --> 03:54:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Then he's tried to get clean to the top and it's dead.</v>

8716
03:54:36.431 --> 03:54:39.940
<v Speaker 2>You got one and three quarters chopsticks and then one quarter chopstick.</v>

8717
03:54:40.290 --> 03:54:41.200
<v Speaker 2>He just so depressed,</v>

8718
03:54:41.201 --> 03:54:43.770
<v Speaker 2>but just shitty chopsticks trying to eat you spicy tuna roll.</v>

8719
03:54:45.820 --> 03:54:46.840
<v Speaker 2>What is this guy doing?</v>

8720
03:54:47.440 --> 03:54:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Was another guy flying into the crowd.</v>

8721
03:54:49.210 --> 03:54:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Same with shack with the whole team gets out of the way here.</v>

8722
03:54:51.640 --> 03:54:52.473
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

8723
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:54.580
<v Speaker 2>that's Alaris boy,</v>

8724
03:54:54.581 --> 03:54:55.331
<v Speaker 2>those are athletes.</v>

8725
03:54:55.331 --> 03:54:55.751
<v Speaker 2>Heel Quik.</v>

8726
03:54:55.751 --> 03:54:56.584
<v Speaker 2>They moved.</v>

8727
03:54:56.830 --> 03:54:58.630
<v Speaker 2>When you see Shaq barrel and down your way,</v>

8728
03:54:59.470 --> 03:55:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I think the front row should be all security with kicking shields.</v>

8729
03:55:03.790 --> 03:55:07.180
<v Speaker 2>That's not a bad hold the fuck up.</v>

8730
03:55:07.181 --> 03:55:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Your vision you,</v>

8731
03:55:08.021 --> 03:55:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh you have him down your chest.</v>

8732
03:55:10.781 --> 03:55:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Some guys who the person is not going to get to see.</v>

8733
03:55:12.821 --> 03:55:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

8734
03:55:13.360 --> 03:55:13.960
<v Speaker 2>So like those,</v>

8735
03:55:13.960 --> 03:55:16.300
<v Speaker 2>those referees and you can get in those towns.</v>

8736
03:55:18.660 --> 03:55:19.271
<v Speaker 2>I solved it.</v>

8737
03:55:19.271 --> 03:55:22.450
<v Speaker 2>You just have security on the front row and you want to look bad.</v>

8738
03:55:22.570 --> 03:55:23.403
<v Speaker 2>It might work.</v>

8739
03:55:23.650 --> 03:55:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I think this is probably a way to do it.</v>

8740
03:55:25.390 --> 03:55:25.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

8741
03:55:25.710 --> 03:55:26.620
<v Speaker 2>had a real good way.</v>

8742
03:55:26.621 --> 03:55:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>

8743
03:55:27.400 --> 03:55:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Frank Shamrock,</v>

8744
03:55:28.660 --> 03:55:30.790
<v Speaker 2>he had a a recessed arena.</v>

8745
03:55:31.150 --> 03:55:31.971
<v Speaker 2>He had a,</v>

8746
03:55:31.971 --> 03:55:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I remember that he had it set up a little thing where there was like,</v>

8747
03:55:34.931 --> 03:55:38.290
<v Speaker 2>it was a flat area and towards the end it kind of went up a little bit like a</v>

8748
03:55:38.420 --> 03:55:38.801
<v Speaker 2>pole.</v>

8749
03:55:38.801 --> 03:55:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Looks like an actual frank,</v>

8750
03:55:42.940 --> 03:55:45.190
<v Speaker 2>frank shamrock fighting arena.</v>

8751
03:55:45.191 --> 03:55:45.941
<v Speaker 2>What did he call it?</v>

8752
03:55:45.941 --> 03:55:46.930
<v Speaker 2>He had a name for it.</v>

8753
03:55:47.390 --> 03:55:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Shoot the shit.</v>

8754
03:55:48.770 --> 03:55:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8755
03:55:49.280 --> 03:55:49.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

8756
03:55:49.610 --> 03:55:50.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

8757
03:55:50.350 --> 03:55:50.561
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

8758
03:55:50.561 --> 03:55:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what it was.</v>

8759
03:55:52.030 --> 03:55:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we would just shoot bucks maybe and then member the Yama Yama.</v>

8760
03:55:57.311 --> 03:55:58.144
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

8761
03:55:58.270 --> 03:55:58.661
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

8762
03:55:58.661 --> 03:55:59.710
<v Speaker 2>that was afterwards.</v>

8763
03:55:59.711 --> 03:56:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Frank shamrock did it first.</v>

8764
03:56:01.270 --> 03:56:03.010
<v Speaker 2>The Yama thing came afterwards.</v>

8765
03:56:03.040 --> 03:56:03.401
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>

8766
03:56:03.401 --> 03:56:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Frank Shepherd Yama thing was the guy from the UFC the early days.</v>

8767
03:56:08.780 --> 03:56:10.030
<v Speaker 2>He's river that no,</v>

8768
03:56:10.530 --> 03:56:10.930
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

8769
03:56:10.930 --> 03:56:11.250
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

8770
03:56:11.250 --> 03:56:11.870
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

8771
03:56:11.870 --> 03:56:12.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

8772
03:56:12.130 --> 03:56:12.963
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

8773
03:56:13.110 --> 03:56:13.943
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

8774
03:56:14.560 --> 03:56:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Why can I not?</v>

8775
03:56:15.280 --> 03:56:16.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not art Davies.</v>

8776
03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:19.930
<v Speaker 2>The fuck is wrong with my memory lately.</v>

8777
03:56:21.250 --> 03:56:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Campbell Mclaren.</v>

8778
03:56:22.440 --> 03:56:23.273
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

8779
03:56:23.290 --> 03:56:24.610
<v Speaker 2>the other Guy Art Davey.</v>

8780
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.971
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

8781
03:56:24.971 --> 03:56:27.520
<v Speaker 2>the other guy got the cash.</v>

8782
03:56:28.630 --> 03:56:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Put it all together.</v>

8783
03:56:29.290 --> 03:56:30.190
<v Speaker 2>How can I not remember his name?</v>

8784
03:56:30.191 --> 03:56:31.024
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>

8785
03:56:31.450 --> 03:56:34.740
<v Speaker 2>God my brain shit is this frank shamrock spot on.</v>

8786
03:56:34.741 --> 03:56:35.530
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

8787
03:56:35.530 --> 03:56:36.363
<v Speaker 2>This show,</v>

8788
03:56:36.760 --> 03:56:39.280
<v Speaker 2>he's got like a little bit of a raised edge.</v>

8789
03:56:40.890 --> 03:56:45.010
<v Speaker 2>This may be the length Swick he may have figured it out long ago.</v>

8790
03:56:45.550 --> 03:56:45.731
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

8791
03:56:45.731 --> 03:56:47.170
<v Speaker 2>you definitely had a good idea.</v>

8792
03:56:47.410 --> 03:56:51.190
<v Speaker 2>He was right at the fights look like and that no holds barred movie though too.</v>

8793
03:56:53.210 --> 03:56:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Which one?</v>

8794
03:56:53.770 --> 03:56:54.550
<v Speaker 2>No holds barred.</v>

8795
03:56:54.550 --> 03:56:55.383
<v Speaker 2>This is awesome.</v>

8796
03:56:56.020 --> 03:56:57.550
<v Speaker 2>This is exactly what we're talking about.</v>

8797
03:56:57.730 --> 03:56:58.511
<v Speaker 2>Bob Myerwitz,</v>

8798
03:56:58.511 --> 03:56:59.161
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

8799
03:56:59.161 --> 03:56:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Mary,</v>

8800
03:56:59.340 --> 03:56:59.550
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

8801
03:56:59.550 --> 03:57:00.280
<v Speaker 2>there we go.</v>

8802
03:57:00.280 --> 03:57:00.970
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

8803
03:57:00.970 --> 03:57:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8804
03:57:01.360 --> 03:57:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean essentially it's basically what we're talking about.</v>

8805
03:57:03.980 --> 03:57:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

8806
03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:06.700
<v Speaker 2>because when you get to the edge,</v>

8807
03:57:06.701 --> 03:57:07.330
<v Speaker 2>it goes up,</v>

8808
03:57:07.330 --> 03:57:09.790
<v Speaker 2>it goes up and you know what's going on.</v>

8809
03:57:09.820 --> 03:57:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows what's going on.</v>

8810
03:57:10.841 --> 03:57:14.590
<v Speaker 2>I think he could give it a little bit more and get a little bit more distance.</v>

8811
03:57:14.740 --> 03:57:17.080
<v Speaker 2>I think the center area could be a little larger,</v>

8812
03:57:17.081 --> 03:57:18.580
<v Speaker 2>but I think essentially nailed it.</v>

8813
03:57:18.640 --> 03:57:18.941
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

8814
03:57:18.941 --> 03:57:19.421
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

8815
03:57:19.421 --> 03:57:20.254
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>

8816
03:57:21.250 --> 03:57:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>

8817
03:57:23.571 --> 03:57:23.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8818
03:57:23.781 --> 03:57:24.260
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

8819
03:57:24.260 --> 03:57:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Hey Dude,</v>

8820
03:57:24.830 --> 03:57:25.430
<v Speaker 2>that's a great,</v>

8821
03:57:25.430 --> 03:57:26.001
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

8822
03:57:26.001 --> 03:57:27.020
<v Speaker 2>He was ahead of his term,</v>

8823
03:57:27.021 --> 03:57:27.854
<v Speaker 2>frank shamrock.</v>

8824
03:57:28.220 --> 03:57:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Shamrock ahead of his time.</v>

8825
03:57:29.800 --> 03:57:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

8826
03:57:30.230 --> 03:57:31.070
<v Speaker 2>that's the way to do it,</v>

8827
03:57:31.280 --> 03:57:31.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

8828
03:57:31.930 --> 03:57:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Someone's right to invest in that.</v>

8829
03:57:33.291 --> 03:57:34.430
<v Speaker 2>That looks pretty damn cool.</v>

8830
03:57:34.431 --> 03:57:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to have the best vas.</v>

8831
03:57:37.300 --> 03:57:38.360
<v Speaker 2>They're all immediately,</v>

8832
03:57:38.420 --> 03:57:42.140
<v Speaker 2>because what are the best seats at UFC is the risers on the floor,</v>

8833
03:57:42.141 --> 03:57:42.974
<v Speaker 2>the risers.</v>

8834
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets a riser.</v>

8835
03:57:44.240 --> 03:57:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8836
03:57:44.550 --> 03:57:45.710
<v Speaker 2>and we see it as a riser.</v>

8837
03:57:46.640 --> 03:57:46.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8838
03:57:46.851 --> 03:57:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>

8839
03:57:47.570 --> 03:57:49.130
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what you were looking.</v>

8840
03:57:49.160 --> 03:57:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

8841
03:57:49.700 --> 03:57:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Frank,</v>

8842
03:57:50.300 --> 03:57:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

8843
03:57:51.290 --> 03:57:52.123
<v Speaker 2>Frank nailed it.</v>

8844
03:57:52.160 --> 03:57:52.993
<v Speaker 2>He nailed it.</v>

8845
03:57:53.060 --> 03:57:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Mike Swick with the beautiful knock out there.</v>

8846
03:57:55.040 --> 03:57:55.281
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

8847
03:57:55.281 --> 03:57:56.114
<v Speaker 2>Let's see another one.</v>

8848
03:57:56.150 --> 03:57:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Look at this frank.</v>

8849
03:57:57.590 --> 03:58:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Frank would have viewed idea how many views is it happened and what was it</v>

8850
03:58:00.861 --> 03:58:01.161
<v Speaker 2>called?</v>

8851
03:58:01.161 --> 03:58:01.581
<v Speaker 2>Was it called?</v>

8852
03:58:01.581 --> 03:58:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Chicago has 9,000 views.</v>

8853
03:58:03.410 --> 03:58:03.921
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

8854
03:58:03.921 --> 03:58:06.080
<v Speaker 2>It's called shoot box shoe box number one.</v>

8855
03:58:06.230 --> 03:58:08.720
<v Speaker 2>And it says Mike Swick versus who's the gentleman he fought.</v>

8856
03:58:08.780 --> 03:58:09.560
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>

8857
03:58:09.560 --> 03:58:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Which Bacon?</v>

8858
03:58:10.370 --> 03:58:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Which Bacon?</v>

8859
03:58:11.150 --> 03:58:12.440
<v Speaker 2>My fucking name dude.</v>

8860
03:58:12.441 --> 03:58:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

8861
03:58:13.160 --> 03:58:14.930
<v Speaker 2>You should invest in frank shamrock.</v>

8862
03:58:14.931 --> 03:58:19.280
<v Speaker 2>Is that the only video of shoe box in testing and bacon and shit.</v>

8863
03:58:19.490 --> 03:58:24.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to give out advice for people for free run with it that I'm not,</v>

8864
03:58:24.500 --> 03:58:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't want any money.</v>

8865
03:58:25.700 --> 03:58:26.533
<v Speaker 2>Just take my,</v>

8866
03:58:26.930 --> 03:58:31.190
<v Speaker 2>well I think the basketball court idea is perfect but that's it.</v>

8867
03:58:31.220 --> 03:58:34.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to implement it to the basketball court or if that seems like a</v>

8868
03:58:34.350 --> 03:58:35.111
<v Speaker 2>highschool jammer,</v>

8869
03:58:35.111 --> 03:58:36.980
<v Speaker 2>mass Halco cause that's risers immediately.</v>

8870
03:58:37.040 --> 03:58:38.540
<v Speaker 2>It's the way to implement it.</v>

8871
03:58:38.570 --> 03:58:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a little larger move and it has a metal fence.</v>

8872
03:58:41.650 --> 03:58:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the metal fence?</v>

8873
03:58:42.771 --> 03:58:44.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that and I don't like the metal fence.</v>

8874
03:58:44.840 --> 03:58:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you have like every 10 yards.</v>

8875
03:58:46.880 --> 03:58:48.230
<v Speaker 2>You have a dude with a kicking shield,</v>

8876
03:58:48.320 --> 03:58:48.890
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

8877
03:58:48.890 --> 03:58:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Huddled down in the frogs.</v>

8878
03:58:50.720 --> 03:58:52.400
<v Speaker 2>The frogs dance.</v>

8879
03:58:53.630 --> 03:58:56.480
<v Speaker 2>We need a man to state a frog stands for seven bouts.</v>

8880
03:58:56.481 --> 03:58:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Can you do it soldier?</v>

8881
03:58:58.700 --> 03:58:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about the frog stance,</v>

8882
03:58:59.721 --> 03:58:59.961
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

8883
03:58:59.961 --> 03:59:01.730
<v Speaker 2>I to back squats against the wall.</v>

8884
03:59:02.270 --> 03:59:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about the Lotus position and I double up with the horse dance.</v>

8885
03:59:07.730 --> 03:59:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I have the kicking shield.</v>

8886
03:59:09.740 --> 03:59:11.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it's definitely better than a cage.</v>

8887
03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I think the cage also gives,</v>

8888
03:59:14.570 --> 03:59:18.020
<v Speaker 2>it gives it a weird douchey connotation.</v>

8889
03:59:18.021 --> 03:59:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

8890
03:59:18.530 --> 03:59:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Cage fighting.</v>

8891
03:59:19.521 --> 03:59:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

8892
03:59:20.060 --> 03:59:23.780
<v Speaker 2>You know it always had that weird sort of pit bull on a fucking chain with</v>

8893
03:59:23.781 --> 03:59:25.830
<v Speaker 2>spikes coming out of a snack feel to it.</v>

8894
03:59:26.330 --> 03:59:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8895
03:59:26.960 --> 03:59:27.793
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

8896
03:59:27.890 --> 03:59:28.221
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

8897
03:59:28.221 --> 03:59:31.010
<v Speaker 2>It seems like to look at it for what it would,</v>

8898
03:59:31.011 --> 03:59:34.430
<v Speaker 2>it really is like martial arts in its purest application.</v>

8899
03:59:34.760 --> 03:59:35.960
<v Speaker 2>You would want no cage.</v>

8900
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

8901
03:59:36.700 --> 03:59:37.430
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

8902
03:59:37.430 --> 03:59:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Frank shamrock nailed it.</v>

8903
03:59:38.421 --> 03:59:39.254
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

8904
03:59:39.430 --> 03:59:40.263
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

8905
03:59:40.490 --> 03:59:44.090
<v Speaker 2>All he needs is rash guards and no gloves,</v>

8906
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.930
<v Speaker 2>no gloves,</v>

8907
03:59:44.930 --> 03:59:45.631
<v Speaker 2>rash guards.</v>

8908
03:59:45.631 --> 03:59:47.810
<v Speaker 2>So the rock fought with no gloves.</v>

8909
03:59:47.811 --> 03:59:48.644
<v Speaker 2>He fought,</v>

8910
03:59:48.890 --> 03:59:50.090
<v Speaker 2>he did everything.</v>

8911
03:59:50.091 --> 03:59:51.770
<v Speaker 2>He did all the styles.</v>

8912
03:59:51.771 --> 03:59:54.470
<v Speaker 2>He did Pancrase back when they had slaps.</v>

8913
03:59:54.740 --> 03:59:54.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8914
03:59:54.891 --> 03:59:57.890
<v Speaker 2>he fought MMA when you didn't have to wear gloves,</v>

8915
03:59:58.880 --> 04:00:00.110
<v Speaker 2>like when he beat,</v>

8916
04:00:00.650 --> 04:00:04.250
<v Speaker 2>when he became the UFC champion,</v>

8917
04:00:05.630 --> 04:00:06.860
<v Speaker 2>did they have to wear gloves back then?</v>

8918
04:00:06.930 --> 04:00:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8919
04:00:07.600 --> 04:00:08.011
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

8920
04:00:08.011 --> 04:00:08.844
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

8921
04:00:09.230 --> 04:00:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Definitely for sure.</v>

8922
04:00:10.580 --> 04:00:12.780
<v Speaker 2>I think 100% when he was fighting,</v>

8923
04:00:12.800 --> 04:00:13.633
<v Speaker 2>he wore gloves</v>

8924
04:00:15.440 --> 04:00:17.500
<v Speaker 2>when he fought Kevin Jackson arm barred them.</v>

8925
04:00:18.020 --> 04:00:19.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about in Japan.</v>

8926
04:00:19.690 --> 04:00:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Didn't know about that.</v>

8927
04:00:20.720 --> 04:00:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I think by them they were wearing gloves,</v>

8928
04:00:22.770 --> 04:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>which everyone does have a Jackson,</v>

8929
04:00:24.241 --> 04:00:25.170
<v Speaker 2>frank shamrock.</v>

8930
04:00:25.550 --> 04:00:26.640
<v Speaker 2>You have see Japan,</v>

8931
04:00:26.850 --> 04:00:27.900
<v Speaker 2>they were wearing gloves.</v>

8932
04:00:27.901 --> 04:00:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I definitely know that in my tenure with the UFC,</v>

8933
04:00:31.831 --> 04:00:34.800
<v Speaker 2>when I started in 1997 you did not have to wear gloves.</v>

8934
04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:39.950
<v Speaker 2>You could wear shoes and they let like way smaller people fight way bigger</v>

8935
04:00:40.771 --> 04:00:41.040
<v Speaker 2>piece,</v>

8936
04:00:41.040 --> 04:00:43.320
<v Speaker 2>but when you could still grab cups,</v>

8937
04:00:43.860 --> 04:00:45.630
<v Speaker 2>you can still grab someone's crotch.</v>

8938
04:00:46.560 --> 04:00:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I remember volleyed g the lead Ishmael fought some Japanese character and has</v>

8939
04:00:50.811 --> 04:00:53.070
<v Speaker 2>got Japanese dude gave him a Wedgie from hell,</v>

8940
04:00:53.240 --> 04:00:53.650
<v Speaker 2>you will.</v>

8941
04:00:53.650 --> 04:00:57.150
<v Speaker 2>You were allowed to grab shorts and his shorts were just digging into his ass</v>

8942
04:00:57.151 --> 04:00:57.690
<v Speaker 2>and balls.</v>

8943
04:00:57.690 --> 04:00:58.800
<v Speaker 2>It was horrific.</v>

8944
04:00:59.550 --> 04:01:04.550
<v Speaker 2>It was totally legal back then when he fought frank shamrock when he fought Dan</v>

8945
04:01:05.100 --> 04:01:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Henderson and I think it was battle Kade,</v>

8946
04:01:06.661 --> 04:01:07.291
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

8947
04:01:07.291 --> 04:01:09.270
<v Speaker 2>or one of those weird one off shoots.</v>

8948
04:01:09.490 --> 04:01:11.330
<v Speaker 2>It was frank shamrock toehold,</v>

8949
04:01:11.430 --> 04:01:12.263
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson,</v>

8950
04:01:12.720 --> 04:01:14.340
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think they'd be wearing gloves then.</v>

8951
04:01:14.370 --> 04:01:14.521
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

8952
04:01:14.521 --> 04:01:15.061
<v Speaker 2>but that was,</v>

8953
04:01:15.061 --> 04:01:15.990
<v Speaker 2>that was a different thing.</v>

8954
04:01:16.570 --> 04:01:18.960
<v Speaker 2>That was an all grappling thing.</v>

8955
04:01:19.170 --> 04:01:20.190
<v Speaker 2>That was all grappling.</v>

8956
04:01:20.430 --> 04:01:20.521
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

8957
04:01:20.521 --> 04:01:21.630
<v Speaker 2>was that was uh,</v>

8958
04:01:21.960 --> 04:01:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hume</v>

8959
04:01:24.630 --> 04:01:27.000
<v Speaker 2>against an Olympic wrestler all grappling there were,</v>

8960
04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:27.930
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

8961
04:01:27.930 --> 04:01:29.190
<v Speaker 2>that one was all grappling.</v>

8962
04:01:29.191 --> 04:01:29.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8963
04:01:29.371 --> 04:01:30.330
<v Speaker 2>that was all grappling.</v>

8964
04:01:30.600 --> 04:01:33.450
<v Speaker 2>The one you're thinking of with Dan Harrison versus frank shamrock was all</v>

8965
04:01:33.451 --> 04:01:35.160
<v Speaker 2>grappling and I don't remember,</v>

8966
04:01:35.161 --> 04:01:36.900
<v Speaker 2>it was a pro grappling thing.</v>

8967
04:01:37.030 --> 04:01:37.863
<v Speaker 2>Matthew,</v>

8968
04:01:39.080 --> 04:01:42.000
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to find the best grappler and then they were trying to find the</v>

8969
04:01:42.001 --> 04:01:46.140
<v Speaker 2>best striker and Dan Gable did commentary along with,</v>

8970
04:01:46.200 --> 04:01:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it was John Perretti,</v>

8971
04:01:47.581 --> 04:01:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it was John Perretti and Dan Gable.</v>

8972
04:01:49.350 --> 04:01:50.580
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong about Peretti.</v>

8973
04:01:50.940 --> 04:01:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it was John Peretti's event.</v>

8974
04:01:52.740 --> 04:01:53.573
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

8975
04:01:53.820 --> 04:01:55.970
<v Speaker 2>think about what happens in battle Cade.</v>

8976
04:01:55.971 --> 04:01:56.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

8977
04:01:56.520 --> 04:01:56.731
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

8978
04:01:56.731 --> 04:01:57.870
<v Speaker 2>He did that as well.</v>

8979
04:01:57.990 --> 04:02:00.870
<v Speaker 2>But I think he had already left that by the time I think it was called the</v>

8980
04:02:00.871 --> 04:02:01.860
<v Speaker 2>contenders.</v>

8981
04:02:03.030 --> 04:02:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a submission grappling event only that was called the contender.</v>

8982
04:02:06.890 --> 04:02:08.620
<v Speaker 2>See if I made all that shit up.</v>

8983
04:02:08.740 --> 04:02:09.573
<v Speaker 2>I don't think</v>

8984
04:02:11.590 --> 04:02:12.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm 100% positive number.</v>

8985
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:15.660
<v Speaker 2>It was at the same show where Eric Paulson had long hair and he was getting his</v>

8986
04:02:15.780 --> 04:02:16.613
<v Speaker 2>hair pulled.</v>

8987
04:02:16.980 --> 04:02:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Don't think that's the same show.</v>

8988
04:02:18.300 --> 04:02:19.770
<v Speaker 2>And the guy in mezcal was pulling his hair.</v>

8989
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

8990
04:02:20.200 --> 04:02:21.270
<v Speaker 2>That was a different thing.</v>

8991
04:02:21.630 --> 04:02:22.560
<v Speaker 2>That was a different thing.</v>

8992
04:02:22.590 --> 04:02:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

8993
04:02:22.990 --> 04:02:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh Eric Paulson against um,</v>

8994
04:02:25.170 --> 04:02:27.270
<v Speaker 2>a black kickboxer Chi or the are black box.</v>

8995
04:02:27.271 --> 04:02:28.081
<v Speaker 2>And I remember that.</v>

8996
04:02:28.081 --> 04:02:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Which show was that?</v>

8997
04:02:29.580 --> 04:02:29.851
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

8998
04:02:29.851 --> 04:02:30.241
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

8999
04:02:30.241 --> 04:02:30.691
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>

9000
04:02:30.691 --> 04:02:31.980
<v Speaker 2>we're bart veil fought.</v>

9001
04:02:31.980 --> 04:02:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Didn't Bart veil fight on that card?</v>

9002
04:02:33.661 --> 04:02:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Member Barn Vale.</v>

9003

9016
04:03:02.131 --> 04:03:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Just kept him going and kept him going.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Warm out,</v>

9018
04:03:04.441 --> 04:03:05.274
<v Speaker 2>kept him going.</v>

9019
04:03:05.610 --> 04:03:07.350
<v Speaker 2>The adventure you just hand was hammer fist.</v>

9020
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:08.423
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the fight.</v>

9021
04:03:08.990 --> 04:03:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Tito was just done.</v>

9022
04:03:09.960 --> 04:03:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Me and frank shamrock played Mexican prison guards in a movie with Mickey</v>

9023
04:03:14.100 --> 04:03:14.933
<v Speaker 2>Rourke.</v>

9024
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:17.010
<v Speaker 2>We're both Mexican prison.</v>

9025
04:03:17.350 --> 04:03:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

9026
04:03:17.980 --> 04:03:21.970
<v Speaker 3>And in in wardrobes that were like really trying to dirty up our uniform and</v>

9027
04:03:21.971 --> 04:03:23.980
<v Speaker 3>really try to make it all messed up and dirty.</v>

9028
04:03:24.430 --> 04:03:25.480
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty racist.</v>

9029
04:03:25.481 --> 04:03:26.620
<v Speaker 3>What year was this?</v>

9030
04:03:26.710 --> 04:03:28.680
<v Speaker 3>This was a long eight,</v>

9031
04:03:28.690 --> 04:03:33.010
<v Speaker 3>maybe seven before make Rourke had that comeback.</v>

9032
04:03:33.190 --> 04:03:34.540
<v Speaker 3>This was before the wrestler?</v>

9033
04:03:34.840 --> 04:03:36.100
<v Speaker 3>This is after the wrestler,</v>

9034
04:03:36.250 --> 04:03:36.750
<v Speaker 3>was it?</v>

9035
04:03:36.750 --> 04:03:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

9036
04:03:37.150 --> 04:03:38.290
<v Speaker 3>He made the comeback already.</v>

9037
04:03:38.291 --> 04:03:40.990
<v Speaker 3>This is a movie that if 50 cent was in it,</v>

9038
04:03:41.140 --> 04:03:44.620
<v Speaker 3>it's called 13 the wrestlers way before 2008 right.</v>

9039
04:03:44.621 --> 04:03:45.454
<v Speaker 3>What was the wrestler?</v>

9040
04:03:45.460 --> 04:03:49.330
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize how many movies are made by big name actors that you never know</v>

9041
04:03:49.331 --> 04:03:53.260
<v Speaker 3>about that just they just consider them failures is letting go that you know,</v>

9042
04:03:53.261 --> 04:03:56.050
<v Speaker 3>there's so many movies that you never see.</v>

9043
04:03:56.051 --> 04:03:58.820
<v Speaker 3>They decided to pull the plug midway through production or something.</v>

9044
04:03:58.830 --> 04:04:00.790
<v Speaker 3>They just released it on DVD all quietly.</v>

9045
04:04:01.030 --> 04:04:02.410
<v Speaker 3>They didn't tell anybody about it.</v>

9046
04:04:02.580 --> 04:04:02.920
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

9047
04:04:02.920 --> 04:04:03.670
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

9048
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:04.930
<v Speaker 3>I thought for sure.</v>

9049
04:04:05.350 --> 04:04:06.183
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

9050
04:04:06.220 --> 04:04:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Mickey Rourke's in it and at 50 cents in an adjacent stayed them is in it.</v>

9051
04:04:10.690 --> 04:04:11.560
<v Speaker 3>It's called 13.</v>

9052
04:04:11.650 --> 04:04:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was going to be big.</v>

9053
04:04:13.170 --> 04:04:14.003
<v Speaker 3>Nobody watched it.</v>

9054
04:04:14.550 --> 04:04:15.290
<v Speaker 2>It's submission.</v>

9055
04:04:15.290 --> 04:04:16.123
<v Speaker 2>They buried it.</v>

9056
04:04:16.650 --> 04:04:17.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

9057
04:04:18.450 --> 04:04:19.270

9063
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:28.400

9117
04:05:21.711 --> 04:05:22.700
<v Speaker 2>This is a grappling match.</v>

<v Speaker 2>1997 but 1997 again,</v>

9122
04:05:28.080 --> 04:05:31.730

<v Speaker 2>He had gloves on.</v>

9130
04:05:45.690 --> 04:05:48.950
<v Speaker 2>I totally forgot all about it being a grappling match.</v>

9131
04:05:48.980 --> 04:05:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

9135
04:05:54.391 --> 04:05:57.650
<v Speaker 2>of the volume on the commentary so we could figure out who look at that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He jumped back for that leg lock.</v>

04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.860
<v Speaker 2>John Perretti,</v>

9143
04:06:03.860 --> 04:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>one of the most underappreciated commentators of all time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

9147
04:06:13.940 --> 04:06:14.900
<v Speaker 2>and look with the heel.</v>

9148
04:06:16.130 --> 04:06:16.930
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

9149
04:06:16.930 --> 04:06:19.100
<v Speaker 2>What's the issue is where it hits a toehold right here.</v>

9150
04:06:19.130 --> 04:06:19.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

9151
04:06:19.521 --> 04:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

04:06:19.940 --> 04:06:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Especially with that shoe.</v>

9153
04:06:21.860 --> 04:06:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Or it could be a heel hook.</v>

9154
04:06:23.430 --> 04:06:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Whereas yeah,</v>

9155
04:06:23.850 --> 04:06:26.420
<v Speaker 2>that's a heel hook kilo.</v>

9156
04:06:26.421 --> 04:06:27.254
<v Speaker 2>It was a heel hook.</v>

9157
04:06:27.260 --> 04:06:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

9158

04:06:28.551 --> 04:06:29.330
<v Speaker 2>That was nasty.</v>

9160
04:06:29.330 --> 04:06:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

9161
04:06:29.730 --> 04:06:33.350
<v Speaker 2>That looks like high level leg lock you in for them.</v>

9162
04:06:33.440 --> 04:06:36.140
<v Speaker 2>It did do French homework was a beast.</v>

9163
04:06:36.800 --> 04:06:37.471
<v Speaker 2>He was a beast.</v>

9164
04:06:37.471 --> 04:06:38.960
<v Speaker 2>You went after that lag.</v>

9165
04:06:39.740 --> 04:06:40.573
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

9166
04:06:41.480 --> 04:06:44.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a gem right there that just got resurrected that,</v>

9167
04:06:44.900 --> 04:06:45.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

04:06:45.201 --> 04:06:46.630
<v Speaker 2>he follows his leg up.</v>

9169
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:48.370
<v Speaker 2>He fucked his leg up.</v>

9170
04:06:48.400 --> 04:06:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what happens when he stands up.</v>

9171
04:06:50.830 --> 04:06:51.261
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

9172

04:06:51.561 --> 04:06:52.640
<v Speaker 2>His leg is fucked up.</v>

9174
04:06:53.210 --> 04:06:54.800
<v Speaker 2>And especially with those heels,</v>

9175
04:06:55.310 --> 04:06:55.761
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

04:06:55.911 --> 04:06:58.420
<v Speaker 2>the shoes on heel hooks with wrestling shoes on.</v>

9178
04:06:58.950 --> 04:07:00.240
<v Speaker 2>He was like a talk.</v>

9179
04:07:00.241 --> 04:07:01.100
<v Speaker 2>That thing in there,</v>

9180
04:07:01.101 --> 04:07:02.090
<v Speaker 2>it's not going nowhere.</v>

9181
04:07:02.120 --> 04:07:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Frank shamrock versus Allen goes crazy.</v>

9182
04:07:05.850 --> 04:07:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Pancrase those crazy rules that if you,</v>

9183
04:07:08.540 --> 04:07:10.690
<v Speaker 2>if your cotton and anything on the ground,</v>

9184
04:07:10.700 --> 04:07:11.480
<v Speaker 2>you're in trouble.</v>

9185
04:07:11.480 --> 04:07:14.810
<v Speaker 2>You could grab the rope and you have to restart grabbing.</v>

9186
04:07:14.811 --> 04:07:16.310
<v Speaker 2>The girls get to restarts.</v>

9187
04:07:16.490 --> 04:07:17.780
<v Speaker 2>That's the dumbest shit ever.</v>

9188
04:07:18.440 --> 04:07:19.360
<v Speaker 2>This is beautiful.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

9194
04:07:23.330 --> 04:07:24.650
<v Speaker 2>This is high level stuff right here.</v>

9195
04:07:24.680 --> 04:07:25.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

9196
04:07:26.510 --> 04:07:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Go to Matt Hume versus Kenny Monday.</v>

9197
04:07:28.731 --> 04:07:31.720
<v Speaker 2>See if you could find that Matt Hume versus Kenny Monday was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Shit's crazy.</v>

9203
04:07:35.781 --> 04:07:37.070
<v Speaker 2>You never called caution records.</v>

9204
04:07:37.880 --> 04:07:41.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange time for being able to view things,</v>

9205
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.830
<v Speaker 2>but it does happen.</v>

9206
04:07:42.890 --> 04:07:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

9207
04:07:43.490 --> 04:07:44.323
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

9209
04:07:45.870 --> 04:07:46.703
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

04:07:46.750 --> 04:07:47.431
<v Speaker 2>Ba Ba boom.</v>

9211
04:07:47.431 --> 04:07:48.660
<v Speaker 2>He's the fucking ring announcer.</v>

9212
04:07:48.680 --> 04:07:49.610
<v Speaker 2>This is insane,</v>

9213
04:07:49.640 --> 04:07:50.060
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

9214
04:07:50.060 --> 04:07:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

9215
04:07:50.600 --> 04:07:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

9216
04:07:51.230 --> 04:07:52.063
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

9217
04:07:52.100 --> 04:07:54.980
<v Speaker 2>people forget how fucking good Matt Hume was.</v>

9218
04:07:55.100 --> 04:07:55.940
<v Speaker 2>People Forget.</v>

9219
04:07:56.360 --> 04:07:59.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why Dimitris mighty mouse Johnson is the pound for pound best</v>

9220
04:07:59.751 --> 04:08:00.620
<v Speaker 2>fighter in the world.</v>

9221
04:08:01.160 --> 04:08:03.380
<v Speaker 2>A big part of it is this guy's fucking brain.</v>

9222
04:08:03.800 --> 04:08:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

9223
04:08:05.000 --> 04:08:07.550
<v Speaker 2>This guy knows a whole lot about fighting.</v>

9224
04:08:08.330 --> 04:08:11.270
<v Speaker 2>He's so high level in so many different things.</v>

9225
04:08:11.520 --> 04:08:12.353
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

9226
04:08:12.690 --> 04:08:15.000
<v Speaker 6>James available digitally.</v>

9227
04:08:15.220 --> 04:08:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Well does Kenny Monday was a serious wrestler too.</v>

9228
04:08:18.910 --> 04:08:22.150
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't know what to do with Matt human.</v>

9229
04:08:22.420 --> 04:08:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hume I think gets him in a toe hold.</v>

9230
04:08:24.761 --> 04:08:26.140
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where I got confused.</v>

9231
04:08:26.141 --> 04:08:27.310
<v Speaker 2>What's the format here?</v>

9232
04:08:27.311 --> 04:08:28.144
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>

9233
04:08:28.500 --> 04:08:29.750
<v Speaker 2>what's a good question?</v>

9234
04:08:29.950 --> 04:08:31.060
<v Speaker 2>What if there's no submission?</v>

9235
04:08:31.330 --> 04:08:32.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

9236
04:08:32.110 --> 04:08:33.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the rule set was.</v>

9237
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.863
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

9238
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I do not remember how they set it up.</v>

9239
04:08:37.521 --> 04:08:38.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a circular cage though.</v>

9240
04:08:41.690 --> 04:08:42.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

9241
04:08:42.081 --> 04:08:44.810
<v Speaker 2>See Kenny Mondays on top.</v>

9242
04:08:45.100 --> 04:08:45.933
<v Speaker 2>Oh look it</v>

9243
04:08:47.400 --> 04:08:48.230
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

9244
04:08:48.230 --> 04:08:50.430
<v Speaker 2>It fucked up cause he had absolutely no idea.</v>

9245
04:08:50.530 --> 04:08:54.440
<v Speaker 2>He went for it and he gave it up and he's got the toe down.</v>

9246
04:08:54.680 --> 04:08:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And what is he going to do here?</v>

9247
04:08:55.740 --> 04:08:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Cold.</v>

9248
04:08:56.390 --> 04:08:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

9249
04:08:56.690 --> 04:08:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

9250
04:08:57.050 --> 04:08:57.883

9251
04:08:58.060 --> 04:08:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

9252
04:08:58.310 --> 04:08:59.030
<v Speaker 2>he got him.</v>

9253
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

9254
04:08:59.690 --> 04:09:00.523
<v Speaker 2>So that's where I,</v>

9255
04:09:00.820 --> 04:09:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I confused it.</v>

9256
04:09:01.850 --> 04:09:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Ooh Man.</v>

9257
04:09:03.100 --> 04:09:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Think about that in that show.</v>

9258
04:09:05.420 --> 04:09:07.790
<v Speaker 2>That was 1997 you know,</v>

9259
04:09:07.791 --> 04:09:08.624
<v Speaker 2>we got this big,</v>

04:09:08.780 --> 04:09:09.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

9261
04:09:09.230 --> 04:09:11.390
<v Speaker 2>leg lock revolution going on right now.</v>

9262
04:09:11.560 --> 04:09:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

9263
04:09:12.000 --> 04:09:14.380
<v Speaker 2>But that was basically the first metamorris</v>

9264
04:09:14.380 --> 04:09:16.230
<v Speaker 3>star style Ebi style,</v>

9265
04:09:16.231 --> 04:09:17.940
<v Speaker 3>all grappling shells.</v>

9266
04:09:18.240 --> 04:09:19.940
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I forgot about that.</v>

9267
04:09:19.941 --> 04:09:20.774
<v Speaker 3>John Perretti.</v>

9268
04:09:20.880 --> 04:09:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

9269
04:09:21.660 --> 04:09:22.200

04:09:22.200 --> 04:09:22.920
<v Speaker 3>And you know what?</v>

9271
04:09:22.920 --> 04:09:27.240
<v Speaker 3>We had two high level leg locks displayed in 1997.</v>

9272
04:09:27.270 --> 04:09:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Incredible.</v>

9273
04:09:28.080 --> 04:09:28.913
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

9274
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:30.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like opening up an old,</v>

9275
04:09:30.031 --> 04:09:34.500
<v Speaker 3>it's like opening up an old judo book from the 1920s and seen it all blocked</v>

9276
04:09:34.501 --> 04:09:34.860
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

9277
04:09:34.860 --> 04:09:35.251

<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

9279
04:09:35.880 --> 04:09:39.720
<v Speaker 3>I thought the Brazilians made up an Omoplata and you're like those old Japanese</v>

9280
04:09:39.721 --> 04:09:40.201
<v Speaker 3>judo books,</v>

9281
04:09:40.201 --> 04:09:42.240
<v Speaker 3>you realize that it's all been done before.</v>

9282
04:09:42.290 --> 04:09:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

9283
04:09:42.720 --> 04:09:44.580
<v Speaker 3>Well it is kind of incredible.</v>

9284
04:09:44.850 --> 04:09:47.850
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of incredible when you go back and get to watch that.</v>

9285
04:09:48.690 --> 04:09:50.220
<v Speaker 3>We've seen some nutty shit man.</v>

9286
04:09:50.340 --> 04:09:51.061
<v Speaker 3>We really have.</v>

9287
04:09:51.061 --> 04:09:53.430
<v Speaker 3>We've seen martial arts just evolved.</v>

9288
04:09:53.490 --> 04:09:55.650
<v Speaker 3>What about Hickson's grappling show?</v>

9289
04:09:55.651 --> 04:09:56.484
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>

9290
04:09:56.940 --> 04:09:58.830
<v Speaker 3>And I think this was 2007,</v>

9291
04:09:59.550 --> 04:10:00.383
<v Speaker 3>what was it called?</v>

9292
04:10:00.720 --> 04:10:01.640
<v Speaker 3>It was called Bushido.</v>

9293
04:10:01.770 --> 04:10:01.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

9294
04:10:01.970 --> 04:10:02.480
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

9295
04:10:02.480 --> 04:10:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

9296
04:10:02.850 --> 04:10:04.890
<v Speaker 3>And you were a gay if you want it to.</v>

9297
04:10:04.890 --> 04:10:05.310
<v Speaker 3>He had some,</v>

9298
04:10:05.310 --> 04:10:06.750
<v Speaker 3>I think there were some Gnocchi matches too.</v>

9299
04:10:06.751 --> 04:10:08.220
<v Speaker 3>I think Shinya Yogi thought on that.</v>

9300
04:10:08.221 --> 04:10:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Marcello Garcia found on that one show bricks and he could've kept that going.</v>

9301
04:10:12.360 --> 04:10:13.530
<v Speaker 3>And then there was um,</v>

9302
04:10:14.040 --> 04:10:18.030
<v Speaker 3>a Rico chip rally had a show and it was called the professional submission</v>

9303
04:10:18.031 --> 04:10:18.330
<v Speaker 3>league.</v>

9304
04:10:18.330 --> 04:10:19.260
<v Speaker 3>I think it was PSL.</v>

9305
04:10:19.290 --> 04:10:19.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

9306
04:10:19.560 --> 04:10:23.760
<v Speaker 3>it was a dam professionals submission,</v>

9307
04:10:24.500 --> 04:10:25.051
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

9308
04:10:25.051 --> 04:10:27.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's when Jack Ray fought Randy coture.</v>

9309
04:10:27.860 --> 04:10:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

9310
04:10:28.170 --> 04:10:29.010
<v Speaker 3>That was a good one.</v>

9311
04:10:29.040 --> 04:10:33.540
<v Speaker 3>Marcella Garcia fought Jake shields and Cameron Earl on that one girl.</v>

9312
04:10:33.541 --> 04:10:34.171
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

9313
04:10:34.171 --> 04:10:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Remember that Cameron are off on the Hixson one two didn't eat.</v>

9314
04:10:36.690 --> 04:10:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Glover fought Hobson Maura and that,</v>

9315
04:10:39.520 --> 04:10:39.900

<v Speaker 3>He tells us</v>

9346
04:11:13.770 --> 04:11:16.380
<v Speaker 3>a ubi 10 Ebi 10 was in December.</v>

9347
04:11:16.410 --> 04:11:20.400
<v Speaker 3>And that show was when GL Martinez beat Eddie Cummings.</v>

9348
04:11:20.401 --> 04:11:23.460
<v Speaker 3>And that was so huge on a few different levels.</v>

9349
04:11:23.461 --> 04:11:27.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Danaher death squad has been dominating and they've been dominating</v>

9350
04:11:27.811 --> 04:11:28.051
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

9351
04:11:28.051 --> 04:11:33.051
<v Speaker 3>They've been beat tapping us out in Ebi over and over and the fact that Glb</v>

9352
04:11:34.780 --> 04:11:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Cummings,</v>

9353
04:11:35.070 --> 04:11:38.220
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Collins is the best leg locker that's ever lived ever.</v>

9354
04:11:38.400 --> 04:11:39.570
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's as good as that.</v>

9355
04:11:39.580 --> 04:11:40.620
<v Speaker 3>He coming with a leg lock,</v>

9356
04:11:40.621 --> 04:11:41.520
<v Speaker 3>there's nobody out there.</v>

9357
04:11:41.520 --> 04:11:42.353
<v Speaker 3>He's the best.</v>

9358
04:11:42.540 --> 04:11:47.540
<v Speaker 3>And for Geo to serve vive in all his leg locks for like seven minutes,</v>

9359
04:11:47.821 --> 04:11:48.391
<v Speaker 3>six minutes,</v>

9360
04:11:48.391 --> 04:11:49.224
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

9361
04:11:49.530 --> 04:11:52.650
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Cummins was all over his legs deep,</v>

9362
04:11:52.800 --> 04:11:54.500
<v Speaker 3>deep as deep as he wanted.</v>

9363
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Geo was stuck.</v>

9364
04:11:55.921 --> 04:11:57.030
<v Speaker 3>Cause like if I tried to get out of it,</v>

9365
04:11:57.031 --> 04:12:02.031
<v Speaker 3>most people are trying to get out when Eddie Cummings bites deep and you know if</v>

9366
04:12:02.161 --> 04:12:03.210
<v Speaker 3>you can nip it in the bud,</v>

9367
04:12:03.211 --> 04:12:03.481
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

9368
04:12:03.481 --> 04:12:04.500
<v Speaker 3>you want your attractions,</v>

9369
04:12:04.501 --> 04:12:05.161
<v Speaker 3>you want to get it out,</v>

9370
04:12:05.161 --> 04:12:06.660
<v Speaker 3>you want to nip that shit in the bud.</v>

9371
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:09.750
<v Speaker 3>But if they get in deep and you try to get out right,</v>

9372
04:12:09.840 --> 04:12:10.591
<v Speaker 3>right then and there,</v>

9373
04:12:10.591 --> 04:12:13.390
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's good but sometimes it's not the best idea.</v>

9374
04:12:13.391 --> 04:12:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes like if you're caught in the arm bar or like the arm bar position and</v>

9375
04:12:16.391 --> 04:12:17.860
<v Speaker 3>you're defending your arm right now,</v>

9376
04:12:17.861 --> 04:12:18.940
<v Speaker 3>might not be the best time.</v>

9377
04:12:19.090 --> 04:12:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Let's be patient.</v>

9378
04:12:20.020 --> 04:12:21.160
<v Speaker 3>Let's get a little position.</v>

9379
04:12:21.310 --> 04:12:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Let's set this up.</v>

9380
04:12:22.270 --> 04:12:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Let's wait for the right timing.</v>

9381
04:12:23.770 --> 04:12:25.240
<v Speaker 3>You have to have patience and timing.</v>

9382
04:12:25.600 --> 04:12:26.111
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

9383
04:12:26.111 --> 04:12:27.100
<v Speaker 3>geo survived.</v>

9384
04:12:27.370 --> 04:12:27.821
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

9385
04:12:27.821 --> 04:12:28.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

9386
04:12:28.150 --> 04:12:30.700
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Cummins jumped on his back and he survived that and they went into</v>

9387
04:12:30.701 --> 04:12:33.490
<v Speaker 3>overtime and Geo bidding beat them in overtime and,</v>

9388
04:12:33.730 --> 04:12:35.800
<v Speaker 3>and because of their dominance and B,</v>

9389
04:12:35.830 --> 04:12:39.040
<v Speaker 3>because how vicious Eddie Cummins is with those leg locks.</v>

9390
04:12:39.041 --> 04:12:42.580
<v Speaker 3>It was a ginormous win for 10 planner for Geo.</v>

9391
04:12:42.581 --> 04:12:43.660
<v Speaker 3>And for me it was,</v>

9392
04:12:43.661 --> 04:12:44.440
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

9393
04:12:44.440 --> 04:12:44.831
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

9394
04:12:44.831 --> 04:12:45.280

9396
04:12:48.490 --> 04:12:49.280
<v Speaker 4>Plan of history.</v>

9397
04:12:49.280 --> 04:12:49.760
<v Speaker 4>No doubt.</v>

9398
04:12:49.760 --> 04:12:50.593

9399
04:12:50.710 --> 04:12:51.351

04:13:42.861 --> 04:13:43.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean five passes,</v>

9436
04:13:44.030 --> 04:13:47.660
<v Speaker 4>they've got millions of subscribers now and it's just blowing up for the UFC.</v>

9437
04:13:47.661 --> 04:13:49.910
<v Speaker 4>It was a risky endeavor like to start</v>

9438
04:13:50.790 --> 04:13:51.090
<v Speaker 3>flex.</v>

9439
04:13:51.090 --> 04:13:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

9440
04:13:51.430 --> 04:13:52.890
<v Speaker 3>that's the future and to,</v>

9441
04:13:52.891 --> 04:13:53.940
<v Speaker 3>so your question,</v>

9442
04:13:54.240 --> 04:13:58.050
<v Speaker 3>Ebi 10 was such a hit with the reviews and the numbers fight.</v>

9443
04:13:58.080 --> 04:14:01.870
<v Speaker 3>The guys from fight pass contacted me and I went out and had a meeting and they</v>

9444
04:14:01.980 --> 04:14:04.830
<v Speaker 3>told me they were really impressed with the numbers and they want to get behind</v>

9445
04:14:04.831 --> 04:14:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Ebi even more so we've been going back and forth.</v>

9446
04:14:07.621 --> 04:14:08.640
<v Speaker 3>I have another meeting with them.</v>

9447
04:14:08.730 --> 04:14:10.350
<v Speaker 3>We want to do something really big,</v>

9448
04:14:10.380 --> 04:14:11.750
<v Speaker 3>but we just got to work things out.</v>

9449
04:14:11.760 --> 04:14:16.760
<v Speaker 3>We want to go just fucking destroy with like a just a big giant show.</v>

9450
04:14:17.371 --> 04:14:18.150
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

9451
04:14:18.150 --> 04:14:18.860
<v Speaker 4>talk about it.</v>

9452
04:14:18.860 --> 04:14:19.940
<v Speaker 4>Well you don't have to talk about it,</v>

9453
04:14:19.941 --> 04:14:21.770
<v Speaker 4>but I just tell everybody has never seen it.</v>

9454
04:14:21.771 --> 04:14:22.604
<v Speaker 4>You figured it out.</v>

9455
04:14:22.730 --> 04:14:23.660
<v Speaker 4>Fast rule sets.</v>

9456
04:14:24.100 --> 04:14:25.550
<v Speaker 4>It's so exciting to watch.</v>

9457
04:14:25.980 --> 04:14:26.870
<v Speaker 4>It makes grappling,</v>

9458
04:14:26.871 --> 04:14:28.130
<v Speaker 4>especially submission grappling.</v>

9459
04:14:28.131 --> 04:14:31.700
<v Speaker 4>And you give it a a finish in a lot of fights and you put people in bad</v>

9460
04:14:31.701 --> 04:14:33.260
<v Speaker 4>situations and it's just awesome.</v>

9461
04:14:33.620 --> 04:14:36.350
<v Speaker 4>And you're seeing like the level of grappling is coming out of there.</v>

9462
04:14:36.351 --> 04:14:37.460
<v Speaker 4>It's so exciting.</v>

9463
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:38.260
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>

9464
04:14:38.260 --> 04:14:39.350
<v Speaker 4>It's so fun to watch.</v>

9465
04:14:39.351 --> 04:14:41.530
<v Speaker 4>It's so good for not just Jujitsu,</v>

9466
04:14:41.540 --> 04:14:41.810
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

9467
04:14:41.810 --> 04:14:44.750
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the best thing to ever happen for competitive Jujitsu.</v>

9468
04:14:44.900 --> 04:14:45.440
<v Speaker 4>I think your rule,</v>

9469
04:14:45.440 --> 04:14:46.251
<v Speaker 4>your rule systems,</v>

9470
04:14:46.251 --> 04:14:49.190
<v Speaker 4>the best thing that happened and the fact that it's blowing up on fight pass.</v>

9471
04:14:49.400 --> 04:14:51.830
<v Speaker 4>But I also think anytime we're seeing any of these,</v>

9472
04:14:51.920 --> 04:14:53.510
<v Speaker 4>all of these different organizations,</v>

9473
04:14:53.810 --> 04:14:55.200
<v Speaker 4>like even the one with the geese were,</v>

9474
04:14:55.210 --> 04:14:55.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

9475
04:14:55.520 --> 04:14:58.970
<v Speaker 4>Gary Thompson tone and fought a j for all those things.</v>

9476
04:14:58.970 --> 04:15:01.370
<v Speaker 4>And Chael Sonnen thing sug good for everybody.</v>

04:15:06.170 --> 04:15:07.190
<v Speaker 4>I think it's good for MMS.</v>

9482
04:15:07.380 --> 04:15:08.213
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully.</v>

9483
04:15:09.050 --> 04:15:10.670
<v Speaker 4>Good for MMA or kickboxing.</v>
