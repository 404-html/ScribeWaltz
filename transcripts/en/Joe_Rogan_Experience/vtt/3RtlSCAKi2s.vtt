1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.511
<v Speaker 1>And she'll,</v>

2
00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:02.010
<v Speaker 1>for an entirely nother universe.</v>

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I read this really cool book by physicists.</v>

4
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.591
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that,</v>

5
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>that actually there might be entry point to different universe where the</v>

6
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:11.200
<v Speaker 1>cosmological constants are slightly different and just like genetic mutations,</v>

7
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>which are different in every organism,</v>

8
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>the Dm such that instead of having a big bang you would have actually had an</v>

9
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of universes constantly kind of creating and developing through</v>

10
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>these different black hole portals makes actually more sense to me.</v>

11
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've always felt like when I have like really intense</v>

14
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences,</v>

15
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>like would it,</v>

16
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>the thought that,</v>

17
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean a million people have is what if this is not actually an hallucination,</v>

18
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>but in fact some sort of a chemical doorway into some other state.</v>

19
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>There's something else out there and we're just so used to the idea that like</v>

20
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>this chair sits on the ground and this table sits here and a laptop sits in a</v>

21
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>chair and this is all normal,</v>

22
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.050
<v Speaker 1>but we could easily be from that DMT dimension.</v>

23
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>That would be our normal everyday reality.</v>

24
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>And they would come here and we would think this is the craziest fucking</v>

25
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experience ever.</v>

26
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Drinking red liquid from thin glasses and talking into electrical impulses that</v>

27
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>send them through wires.</v>

28
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>And hundreds of thousands of people listen and they ride out of mass</v>

29
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>transportation on fucking elliptical machines all over the world.</v>

30
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 1>That is psychedelic,</v>

31
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>that's psychedelic as fuck.</v>

32
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.591
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

35
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>if you lived in a dimension of pure love and,</v>

36
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.150
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

37
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.371
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

38
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:17.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:17.851
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

40
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

41
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>and eternal consciousness,</v>

42
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>all interconnected.</v>

43
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.770
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

44
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.141
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

45
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>there was no physical matter.</v>

46
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>You would just live in the DMT realm.</v>

47
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.140
<v Speaker 1>This world would be a completely.</v>
