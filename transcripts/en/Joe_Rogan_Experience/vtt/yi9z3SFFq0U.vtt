<v Speaker 1>That's hard and fast rule.</v>

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.010
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.520
<v Speaker 1>it's chemists or whatever they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying estes fucking science dorks.</v>

9
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.460
<v Speaker 1>They've done a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even the same thing anymore.</v>

11
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

12
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a uh,</v>

13
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

14
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>it's Gmo all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

16
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>you guys tested this on people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.490
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

18
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I know you took the seeds out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>watermelon,</v>

19
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>but what the fuck did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

20
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>How did that even happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

21
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I just read that a Barbara streisand </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloned her dogs.</v>

22
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Did you read that or heard about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie told me like the weirdest thing.</v>

23
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>She has two dogs from one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

24
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>It made two clones of her favorite dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is like the polar opposite of adopt</v>

25
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>don't shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't get any further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

27
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 1>It costs like $100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh,</v>

28
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't have a different shape.</v>

29
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be a different dog.</v>

30
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>So possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

31
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird.</v>

32
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird move to fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really believed that personality </v>

33
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.910
<v Speaker 1>comes from that,</v>

34
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>if it's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if it just looks the same or you </v>

35
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>don't want it to just look the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know?</v>

36
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.240
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be an identical clone </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your original doctor,</v>

37
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.670
<v Speaker 1>so it really kind of would really </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

38
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>What if it's your favorite dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit all over the place.</v>

39
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Walking into walls where we've got bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>

40
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't work all the way where we</v>

41
00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:40.201
<v Speaker 1>go to the way it looks like 94 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your dog and then you know it's </v>

42
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:44.401
<v Speaker 1>missing an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 30 percent as smart as your last </v>

43
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:47.851
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty good because your last </v>

44
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:47.851
<v Speaker 1>dog was a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

45
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:51.181
<v Speaker 1>there's another dog attached to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's walking in the different </v>

46
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:54.841
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's eventually going to pull each </v>

47
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:54.841
<v Speaker 1>other apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for now,</v>

48
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 1>now you got six to eight weeks with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these weird to speak for a hundred </v>

49
00:01:58.271 --> 00:01:58.750
<v Speaker 1>grand.</v>

50
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>You could just go to the pound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fruit there is.</v>

51
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I have a story that I do my act about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound dog that I had.</v>

52
00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I had a pound dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed one of my dogs.</v>

53
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pound dogs are tricky man.</v>

54
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a dog that's been in like a </v>

55
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 1>shelter for a long time sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were in there for months.</v>

56
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>They come out highly aggressive and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like my,</v>

57
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 1>some of them my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got her.</v>

58
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's 13 now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I got her she was a puppy,</v>

59
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they found she was a stray puppy.</v>

60
00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:33.751
<v Speaker 1>She's a little black lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just wandering in the Bronx and I </v>

61
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>got her probably like three days after </v>
<v Speaker 1>they found her.</v>

62
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.360
<v Speaker 1>What age do you think a dog would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like,</v>

63
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:42.361
<v Speaker 1>you got to imagine like a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of abuse that a dog suffers early and </v>

64
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:44.560
<v Speaker 1>it's life before it gets to the pound </v>
<v Speaker 1>has got a really fuck with his head.</v>

65
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's dogs that you get at the</v>

66
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:51.541
<v Speaker 1>pound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially like taking on and </v>

67
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:51.541
<v Speaker 1>abused organism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not ugly.</v>

68
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that it doesn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>home is that it might've been in dog </v>

69
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.680
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm pretty sure that mine,</v>

70
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>either it's family was in dog fights or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in a dog fight and there's,</v>

71
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around you that are probably </v>

72
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.920
<v Speaker 1>kicking you and beating you or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Or you're tied up for hours at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

74
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no free.</v>

75
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think dogs can be </v>

76
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.880
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think it takes.</v>

77
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a look to even have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog be a good dog like that.</v>

78
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Like I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

79
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.960
<v Speaker 1>when I had my puppy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I worked with my dog so much and </v>

80
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.960
<v Speaker 1>she's a great dog.</v>

81
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Like I could walk in New York City </v>
<v Speaker 1>without a leash.</v>

82
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Just follows me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's really is.</v>

83
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>She's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

84
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>But I worked so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you add to that,</v>

85
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you have to first like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.950
<v Speaker 1>like a brainwash them or get them over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the anxieties they have.</v>

87
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Like there are certain dogs that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate men because obviously in their </v>

88
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>former home and was an abusive man in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house and you know,</v>

89
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>they react differently to men than </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

90
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

91
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>You mean you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A dog can't tell you what it's seen?</v>

93
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one dog that I adopted choose too,</v>

94
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>and she had mange all over her body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all over her body.</v>

95
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>And she looked terrible man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they caught her.</v>

96
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:08.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating out of garbage cans in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this family's house that rescues </v>

97
00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>pitbulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

98
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I took her in and like within a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>she had hair on her body.</v>

99
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>She looked great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was healthy,</v>

100
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 1>sweetest dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweetest dog with people.</v>

101
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>But if another dog got too close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would fuck that dog up there.</v>

102
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.260
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

103
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.300
<v Speaker 1>protecting what she had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was real.</v>

104
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.230
<v Speaker 1>It was real hard to have an aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

105
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>pound dog yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

106
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.280
<v Speaker 1>depending on the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is like the thing I would always </v>

107
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 1>tell people to try to do first because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am a big like adopt,</v>

108
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:44.641
<v Speaker 1>don't shop guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to a dog pound you could </v>

109
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:45.120
<v Speaker 1>find some amazing where I got my dog if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

110
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>which like animal care and control in </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City,</v>

111
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>like they euthanized like 100 dogs a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

112
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Like it's literally just like the dogs </v>
<v Speaker 1>are coming in all the time.</v>

113
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Dogs with stab wounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs they find in the park half day and </v>

114
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.401
<v Speaker 1>then they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have five days in that pound and </v>

115
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:02.401
<v Speaker 1>then they're out.</v>

116
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I was when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is again,</v>

117
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:07.531
<v Speaker 1>like 13 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was getting my dog and I was </v>

118
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:10.111
<v Speaker 1>waiting to pick her up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman came in with two rottweilers,</v>

119
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>beautiful rottweilers and unleashes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

120
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't want these anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

121
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.290
<v Speaker 1>That the lady behind the counter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

122
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>well what do you mean like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

123
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't handle them.</v>

124
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>And then they took the leash and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked out.</v>

125
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And then there were just these two.no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they were trained to </v>

126
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.800
<v Speaker 1>kill or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to be like,</v>

127
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.210
<v Speaker 1>ed two rottweilers to my test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

128
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows I have no.</v>

129
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I knew nothing about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

130
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in five days those dogs are dead because</v>

131
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>they're like four year old rottweilers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a doberman that we adopted as when</v>

132
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid and it had distemper and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

133
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a disease that makes them really </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive in this crazy way that dog </v>

134
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>turned on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

135
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so scary.</v>

136
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:51.511
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have been more than 12.</v>

137
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 12 somewhere around then.</v>

138
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And this big ass Doberman is showing its</v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth</v>

139
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 2>and barking and snapping us out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere.</v>

140
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.400
<v Speaker 2>It was the sweetest dog before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden it's on the </v>

141
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.400
<v Speaker 2>couch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like looking down on us.</v>

142
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

143
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 2>what is happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

144
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

145
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came and took the dog,</v>

146
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or did we take the dog to the pound?</v>

147
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what happened or to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>vet rather,</v>

148
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 2>and then they ran an examination that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog and they're like,</v>

149
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.430
<v Speaker 2>this dog is tamper so we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got it with this vineyard disease.</v>

150
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Then that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have that in a house with </v>

151
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.440
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck they do.</v>

152
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid at the time.</v>

153
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 2>My parents weren't having it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember.</v>

154
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember too much about it.</v>

155
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:40.931
<v Speaker 2>They send him to the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just remembered that dog on the couch </v>

156
00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 2>showing its teeth snapping at us.</v>

157
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

158
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We brought home a dog.</v>

159
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 2>He'll full grown dog that has a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

160
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom's cousin,</v>

161
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.860
<v Speaker 2>second cousin was married to a dude for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a number of years who have this </v>

162
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 2>rottweiler that was like a psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>

163
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.710
<v Speaker 2>And like at one point it jumped through </v>
<v Speaker 2>their bake glass windows in their house </v>

164
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 2>to try to get the mailman and got </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught.</v>

165
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swing the two windows.</v>

166
00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 2>And was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fine.</v>

167
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean it had stitches and they had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull some glass out of it.</v>

168
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 2>But it didn't impact the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how.</v>

169
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.670
<v Speaker 2>And it dove through a window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just didn't make it look like it </v>

170
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 2>would have killed the mail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just because somebody was walking</v>

171
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:19.870
<v Speaker 2>up their porch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 2>and the doctors and that same like </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost one time,</v>

173
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.360
<v Speaker 2>like my grandparents had a house upstate</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were there,</v>

174
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 2>like my brother opened the door and came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and you know,</v>

175
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 2>it was just like.</v>

176
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 2>But some people just like having like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scary dog.</v>

177
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 2>That's not the kind of dog you just want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to run at a kid that you don't know.</v>

178
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 2>People get killed on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly can happen,</v>

179
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive with people like that.</v>

180
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Like Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so dangerous.</v>

181
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:45.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

182
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 2>And they're cute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

183
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:51.641
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's like 110 and it is those </v>
<v Speaker 2>big males,</v>

184
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 2>those big fucking frying pan heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're giant flatheads.</v>

185
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.690
<v Speaker 2>It's funny too because we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like genetic modifications or </v>

186
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:01.690
<v Speaker 2>cloning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really dogs,</v>

187
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.591
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at them historically that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been that the whole time like </v>

188
00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:09.011
<v Speaker 2>Ben have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man has manipulated what they wanted of </v>

189
00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:09.230
<v Speaker 2>certain animals and like they've bred </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

190
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meanest,</v>

191
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 2>toughest ones to be guard dogs and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>bred the cutest.</v>

192
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Take a piss on a paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt wants to be left alone.</v>

193
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Those are all choices that were made by </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans by humans.</v>

194
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 2>It overtime by continued breeding of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that were the same and same and </v>

195
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.561
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You end up with like breeds and things </v>

196
00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:29.561
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

197

<v Speaker 2>kind of dog man.</v>

198
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:30.820

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

199
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.100
<v Speaker 2>because when they did the genome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the DNA.</v>

200
00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:35.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

201
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.560

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

202
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 2>No matter how big the dog is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that crazy?</v>

203
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Think about how powerful and terrifying </v>

205
00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:51.130
<v Speaker 2>creatures in the forest and agree more </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we found just the one that was just </v>

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:00.560
<v Speaker 2>like no one takes them seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had yo,</v>

233
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 2>I got a bunch of guard dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you got?</v>

234
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.250
<v Speaker 2>The 90 pound poodles just shut the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

235
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still a dog thing.</v>

236
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.750
<v Speaker 2>It would be so funny if that thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like a Barbie toy,</v>

237
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a Barbie Toy.</v>

238
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't even look a real dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That dog will fuck you up.</v>

239
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:21.670
<v Speaker 2>It'll bite your dick off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I have to say I feel bad when I see </v>

240
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 2>dogs have that haircut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have no part in it.</v>

241
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:28.550
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're just jamie showing us a </v>

<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

245
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it might be there a white </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:39.360
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't be a football player from </v>

<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

298
00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:57.710

<v Speaker 2>Where's his head?</v>

299
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.950

<v Speaker 2>Asset is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

307
00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 2>it looks like it might be actually just </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing there and they have the </v>

308
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 2>feathers propped up against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Possibly.</v>

309
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Am I seeing that correctly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other stuff has done to it.</v>

313
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:33.480
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>How about decorate your house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Dog,</v>

316
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 2>man Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

317
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.320
<v Speaker 2>People are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>

318
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 2>They're gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make so many bad decisions,</v>

319
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:56.341
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that was coming out of South </v>

320
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Korea during the Olympics was people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about,</v>

321
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Asian countries,</v>

322
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:03.520
<v Speaker 2>the consumption of dogs.</v>

323
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.150
<v Speaker 2>That became a big hot point issue with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people.</v>

324
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

325
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.060
<v Speaker 2>it is weird that we choose certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

326
00:14:12.061 --> 00:14:14.080
<v Speaker 2>that it's okay to kill and eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could agree more,</v>

327
00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:15.370
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that our,</v>

328
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.020
<v Speaker 2>our food hangups are so specific to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

329
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 2>I think about it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a bacon,</v>

330
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:24.490
<v Speaker 2>egg and cheese sandwich is fried pig's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>

331
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Unfertilized embryo and mold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not true and bold,</v>

332
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.860
<v Speaker 2>but what do you mean video but not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to die today.</v>

333
00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an egg.</v>

334
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

335
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.600
<v Speaker 2>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you ever crack an egg and </v>

336
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a little chicken in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never had that.</v>

337
00:14:43.111 --> 00:14:44.920
<v Speaker 2>I've had a little extra things in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

338
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I've had like a little grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most really?</v>

339
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not like a full chicken,</v>

340
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:49.000
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

341
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

342
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I was in my before I</v>

343
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.980
<v Speaker 1>knew that an egg couldn't become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken because I never thought about </v>

344
00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.390
<v Speaker 1>until I had to get the rooster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been in the hen house.</v>

345
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know were they just laugh all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

346
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that until I was in my </v>

347
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:07.450
<v Speaker 1>forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you got to,</v>

348
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.040
<v Speaker 1>you got to be in a forum setting to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you imagine if you were a farmer,</v>

349
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:15.041
<v Speaker 1>what a fucking asshole you would think </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody is that you offer on your </v>

350
00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:16.520
<v Speaker 1>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd get someone that didn't know.</v>

351
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.510
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know if that couldn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a chicken like no.</v>

352
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like this one things where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are vegetarians,</v>

353
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I urge you to eat eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat eggs.</v>

354
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a free ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just coming out anyway.</v>

355
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 1>They're coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out anyway.</v>

356
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:36.010
<v Speaker 1>If you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get it from a place like just </v>

357
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 1>like you can get organic grass fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get pasture raised chickens.</v>

358
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.190
<v Speaker 1>They do have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then pasture raised chicken,</v>

359
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:42.200
<v Speaker 1>eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The yolks come out dark.</v>

360
00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:43.430
<v Speaker 1>You just got to figure out where to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to.</v>

361
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:48.431
<v Speaker 1>Not as they're more expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not as expensive as meat.</v>

362
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

363
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.090
<v Speaker 1>they're really good for it to last a </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly long time.</v>

364
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:58.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a free ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That chicken is going to eat all that </v>

365
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160
<v Speaker 1>stuff on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bugs and all the worms.</v>

366
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to kill anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just eat those eggs.</v>

367
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good for you.</v>

368
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.920
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking amazing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

369
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm anti big propaganda.</v>

370
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Do big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

371
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I can eat eggs every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

372
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I eat them almost every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

373
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that it's one of the most </v>

374
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.061
<v Speaker 1>Karma free things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've got to exchange with these </v>

375
00:16:22.061 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I haven't exchange.</v>

376
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I give the animals food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat the food.</v>

377
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.900
<v Speaker 1>They lay the eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm nice to them.</v>

378
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I come into their little caged area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't run from me.</v>

379
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 1>They'd come around and give him little </v>
<v Speaker 1>treats and shit.</v>

380
00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:32.380
<v Speaker 1>They're like pets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

381
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.110
<v Speaker 1>They have this really cool life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get to wander around occasionally.</v>

382
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:38.070
<v Speaker 1>They get jacked by coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

383
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I've had a three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how?</v>

384
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much are they?</v>

385
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:43.790
<v Speaker 1>They're not in a two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least two.</v>

386
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:49.090
<v Speaker 1>One of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm suspicious that you don't have them </v>

387
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:49.090
<v Speaker 1>in a coop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

388
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucked up story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told it before.</v>

389
00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:54.881
<v Speaker 1>I'll briefly tell it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My massive got honey dicked by female </v>

390
00:16:54.881 --> 00:16:56.180
<v Speaker 1>coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

391
00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:01.210
<v Speaker 1>And he thought the coyote was his buddy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got to know this is,</v>

392
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I should say that my gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identifying with this coyote,</v>

393
00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:11.000
<v Speaker 1>I did not have a chance to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely examine it.</v>

394
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm just being a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for the good of the story.</v>

395
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.920
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think is my theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a littler coyote and I </v>

396
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.761
<v Speaker 1>really think it was a female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was hanging around my house for </v>

397
00:17:24.761 --> 00:17:26.550
<v Speaker 1>awhile and it talked my dog and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking down a fence and he's huge.</v>

398
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.890
<v Speaker 1>And when he got through the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got to the chicken coop and one of </v>

399
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:32.480
<v Speaker 1>the chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

400
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.180
<v Speaker 1>was doing a thing called brooding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they brewed,</v>

401
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:40.181
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're convinced that if they sit on </v>

402
00:17:40.181 --> 00:17:42.371
<v Speaker 1>their egg that that egg is going to turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a chicken convinced they just to </v>

403
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:43.670
<v Speaker 1>get like a little depressed to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutty.</v>

404
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.330
<v Speaker 1>And what you have to do when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>brooding is you have to take them off of</v>

405
00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:50.610
<v Speaker 1>the nest and put them in a cage by </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves with just a perch.</v>

406
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.820
<v Speaker 1>So they just sit on the perch for like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day or two and then it leaves their </v>

407
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:55.820
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

408
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 1>But if you let them lay on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll take like 30 days.</v>

409
00:17:57.811 --> 00:17:58.940
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They plucked.</v>

410
00:17:58.941 --> 00:18:02.190
<v Speaker 1>But how do you pluck the feathers off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

411
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:07.191
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often are you monitoring your </v>

412
00:18:07.191 --> 00:18:07.191
<v Speaker 1>chickens that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

413
00:18:07.191 --> 00:18:07.191
<v Speaker 1>we got a brooder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

414
00:18:07.191 --> 00:18:09.600
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty evident for the obvious.</v>

415
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.420
<v Speaker 1>You look at them everyday if there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if one of them is in the um,</v>

416
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:12.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

417
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.020
<v Speaker 1>the sandbox where they lay their eggs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cheese.</v>

418
00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:21.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm like getting weird when you get near</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little weird with you and the </v>

419
00:18:21.021 --> 00:18:22.940
<v Speaker 1>little package a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not,</v>

420
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 1>they don't try to hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're like,</v>

421
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:26.450
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck away from protecting what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think is.</v>

422
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 1>They think there's a baby in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

423
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.290
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's the alternative?</v>

424
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 1>You got a bunch of Cox in your yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Jack Trends,</v>

425
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.040
<v Speaker 1>they're all running around.</v>

426
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I'd be watching chicken rape but my </v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard 24 slash seven,</v>

427
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe like once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring a caulk in to,</v>

428

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them a weekend.</v>

429
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.130
<v Speaker 1>And so we need his bird birth control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want these chickens shitting out</v>

430
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:52.320
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could bring in a couple of roosters.</v>

431
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to make a few adjustments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I want.</v>

432
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I want sever the roosters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vocal cords.</v>

433

<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

434
00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know the sun's coming up.</v>

435
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.660

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.120
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it so as Dick doesn't work like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>to stick their accounts.</v>

443
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I think a rooster without a voice is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>

444
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.870
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have a brooding rooster </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your hands,</v>

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to take what the rooster,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have clipped their dogs vocal</v>

451
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:40.890
<v Speaker 1>cords because their dogs barks team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of that before.</v>

452
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:42.660
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it is annoying when they bark at you </v>

454
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:47.900
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>have the weirdest birth control method </v>

<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

457
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.600
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a chemical.</v>

458
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Chickens have long known to a time a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Sperm after doing the deep wow.</v>

459
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't well established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

460
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.120
<v Speaker 1>what wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was well established was the underlying </v>

461
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.940
<v Speaker 1>reason for what's technically known as </v>
<v Speaker 1>seminal evacuation.</v>

462
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I like how they give us the technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>term is now I understand it better.</v>

463
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 1>I would prefer it's technically turned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just call it shooting.</v>

464
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Just just the just shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in a recently published paper,</v>

465
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:23.160
<v Speaker 1>a team led by Oxford researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rebecca Dean,</v>

466
00:20:23.161 --> 00:20:28.161
<v Speaker 1>explains that this behavior is in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far from random and that the tendency </v>

467
00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:32.810
<v Speaker 1>for females to jettison Burma's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>finely tuned mechanism of post Copula </v>

468
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.050
<v Speaker 1>sexual selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

469
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird,</v>

470
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

471
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.400
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a weird thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

472
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Walk into a chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken,</v>

473
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.280
<v Speaker 1>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check your sperm flirt.</v>

474
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.060
<v Speaker 1>She was</v>

475
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:53.070
<v Speaker 2>a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be the like evolutionary </v>

476
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.070
<v Speaker 2>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that you're a biologist,</v>

477
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 2>norma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should probably stop there.</v>

478
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.270
<v Speaker 2>What would be the evolutionary advantage</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being able to shoot sperm out?</v>

479
00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.810
<v Speaker 2>You get a vibe from rooster that he's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

480
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't consent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say yes to that tire is </v>

481
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.400
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

482
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>

483
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 2>why did he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did he take me last?</v>

484
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

485
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Why did I have to wait for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for other,</v>

486
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens.</v>

487
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if rooster crows are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

488
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.890
<v Speaker 2>like those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's called,</v>

489
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A crow when they see the guard thing.</v>

490
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:28.010
<v Speaker 2>So I wonder if he's like national </v>
<v Speaker 2>anthems and that some people nail it and</v>

491
00:21:28.391 --> 00:21:33.391
<v Speaker 2>some people just overdo it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some chickens kneel during it like some </v>

492
00:21:33.631 --> 00:21:35.740
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like Jesus Christ,</v>

493
00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

494
00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 3>you're awake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're awake.</v>

495
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.780
<v Speaker 3>We get it the first time.</v>

496
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

497
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
<v Speaker 2>that's the determining factor in when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

498
00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:57.990
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

499
00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not supposed to be that long.</v>

500
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a shorter song then you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a totally different song </v>

501
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.680
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing a thing with your voice </v>

502
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:09.680
<v Speaker 2>that can tell you not to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

503
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.611
<v Speaker 2>They loved that 100 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could do that thing when I </v>

504
00:22:14.611 --> 00:22:18.610
<v Speaker 2>lived in the East village in New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>City back like a year or 2000,</v>

505
00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 2>1999.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

506
00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.300
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hadn't really been like a,</v>

507
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:27.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a neighborhood that was gentrified or </v>

508
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:27.970
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

509
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.890
<v Speaker 2>And there was a lot of roosters in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood,</v>

510
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:35.260
<v Speaker 2>like these parking lots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have these empty lots where there </v>

511
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:35.680
<v Speaker 2>were no buildings and people just had </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens and roosters outside.</v>

512
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:37.000
<v Speaker 2>So I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

513
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>22 years old sleeping in my apartment in</v>

514
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:41.890
<v Speaker 2>the West village and the East village </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather.</v>

515
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.920
<v Speaker 2>And in every morning I'd wake up to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rooster crowing like every morning and </v>

516
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.940
<v Speaker 2>then after a while the community started</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging these signs like,</v>

517
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:50.240
<v Speaker 2>are you sick of the roosters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

518
00:22:50.241 --> 00:22:51.000
<v Speaker 2>and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

519
00:22:51.001 --> 00:22:52.530
<v Speaker 2>they turned it on the dudes who on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>roofs,</v>

520
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:58.670
<v Speaker 2>which is not cool because it like those </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys lived there a long time and have </v>

521
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 2>roosters treated that petitions to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of the roosters.</v>

522
00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:07.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these rooster petitions and then </v>

523
00:23:07.501 --> 00:23:08.440
<v Speaker 2>over like maybe a year and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years was no more roosters.</v>

524
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:14.710
<v Speaker 2>One of those like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like end of an era things in New York </v>

525
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.690
<v Speaker 2>City where people still had like just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering chickens in an empty lot.</v>

526
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.030
<v Speaker 2>It had like could help caps in it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens.</v>

527
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.880
<v Speaker 2>People don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How cool that is.</v>

528
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's like this,</v>

529
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.350
<v Speaker 2>it's this weird thing that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities where people come in and take all</v>

530
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:32.540
<v Speaker 2>the culture out of it and then complain </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

531
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

532
00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.810
<v Speaker 2>All the culture is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you were moved it?</v>

533
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.170
<v Speaker 2>You actively came in and removed it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

534
00:23:38.171 --> 00:23:43.171
<v Speaker 2>there isn't as much of a suburban </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment so you could have kids in a </v>

535
00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:43.900
<v Speaker 2>minivan and all this stuff you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have had in the burbs anyway,</v>

536
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 2>and now say that though it a problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not like one individual that's</v>

537
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:51.260
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a whole movement of economics,</v>

538
00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a movement of economics.</v>

539
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:57.731
<v Speaker 2>But there is a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion of sort of community like </v>

540
00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.470
<v Speaker 2>activism towards making the community </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they envisioned it to be around.</v>

541
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.920
<v Speaker 2>So you end up with a lot of science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>

542
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:06.270
<v Speaker 2>we're working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tomato Co op and you're like,</v>

543
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

544
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.610
<v Speaker 2>now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now you,</v>

545
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:13.690
<v Speaker 2>oh there's tomato cooperate working </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and got to get in on that and you </v>

546
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:13.690
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then like,</v>

547
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that things are doing are</v>

548
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:16.010
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're definitely,</v>

549
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

550
00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.690
<v Speaker 2>there's just been a removal of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

551
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.700
<v Speaker 2>And I look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this argument about New York </v>

552
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:24.700
<v Speaker 2>City that people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

553
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:24.700
<v Speaker 2>it used to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

554
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was really dangerous.</v>

555
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:27.760
<v Speaker 2>You better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're.</v>

556
00:24:27.761 --> 00:24:30.080
<v Speaker 2>So there's an up and down to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better unless you were the guy that</v>

557
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:31.130
<v Speaker 2>got shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

558
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the other part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is you can.</v>

559
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I look at cities like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're always building </v>

560
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.750
<v Speaker 2>something on top of something else that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was already there.</v>

561
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.900
<v Speaker 2>So what to us is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe that hardware store went</v>

562
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 2>out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

563
00:24:42.741 --> 00:24:44.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe my grandfather was,</v>

564
00:24:44.181 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe they put in a hardware </v>
<v Speaker 2>store and we're like,</v>

565
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:49.670
<v Speaker 2>the horseshoe guy used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

566
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.600
<v Speaker 2>that's really the telegraph guys going </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with this is bullshit.</v>

567
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

568
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 2>like it's probably something people </v>
<v Speaker 2>felt,</v>

569
00:24:55.610 --> 00:25:00.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime you're somewhere first you </v>

570
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:00.610
<v Speaker 2>always feel like someone's ruining it.</v>

571
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:01.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're in a very interesting time</v>

572
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.880
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in a lot of amazing ways and I think</v>

573
00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:09.170
<v Speaker 2>we're learning more about people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior I think than ever before.</v>

574
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:14.171
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to give ourselves a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of a break in this because I </v>

575
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:17.750
<v Speaker 2>think everybody has this feeling like </v>
<v Speaker 2>why haven't we got our shit together?</v>

576
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Why haven't we fully evolved and my take</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this is that this is a really recent </v>

577
00:25:24.051 --> 00:25:29.051
<v Speaker 2>thing like being aware of what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going on just in general in the </v>

578
00:25:29.051 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 2>general scheme of being in the universe </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very recent thing.</v>

579
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we know about life and what we </v>

580
00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:39.770
<v Speaker 2>know about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

581
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:44.771
<v Speaker 2>just our own finite life form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far it's going to be able to be </v>

582
00:25:44.771 --> 00:25:46.850
<v Speaker 2>pushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long we can stay alive,</v>

583
00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

584
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.900
<v Speaker 2>how easy it is to transfer information </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Australia to China to fucking </v>

585
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.480
<v Speaker 2>England and back and forth and back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

586
00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Or we're in the craziest time ever and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all really fucking recent.</v>

587
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Really new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

588
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Twenty plus years if that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you go back 20 years ago the </v>

589
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.440
<v Speaker 2>Internet existed but you couldn't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch a video on it.</v>

590
00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me the smartphone thing is every day </v>

591
00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I have this big of my </v>

592
00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.921
<v Speaker 2>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you don't remember what it </v>

593
00:26:20.921 --> 00:26:22.370
<v Speaker 2>was like to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

594
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.160
<v Speaker 2>there's this whole like vibe where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like millennials don't get it.</v>

595
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

596
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:31.361
<v Speaker 2>I have the same attention span is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>millennial because I'm on my phone like </v>

597
00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Deloitte that adults are better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

598
00:26:33.231 --> 00:26:38.231
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I did a US tour in </v>

599
00:26:38.231 --> 00:26:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan a couple of years ago and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>met all those soldiers,</v>

600
00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:42.620
<v Speaker 2>men and women over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like really blown away.</v>

601
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.080
<v Speaker 2>I was like impressed this idea that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>our best days are behind us,</v>

602
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff and I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

603
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 2>this is a really impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impressive group of young people who are</v>

604
00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:55.491
<v Speaker 2>like fighting for the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>volunteering to fight for the country </v>

605
00:26:55.491 --> 00:26:57.130
<v Speaker 2>and like coming back here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes wounded sometimes you know,</v>

606
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.580
<v Speaker 2>all the things that they risk going </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

607
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.680
<v Speaker 2>But then like you meet them and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

608
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.540
<v Speaker 2>these are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not like jarheads,</v>

609
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:08.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like sophisticated thinkers and </v>

610
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 2>they're like trying to like be a part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

611
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:09.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

612
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.330
<v Speaker 2>I found it very inspiring to be around </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

613
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh baby boy,</v>

614
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.110
<v Speaker 2>bunch of bunch of losers if millennials </v>
<v Speaker 2>loser.</v>

615
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.640
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just awesome.</v>

616
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

617
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.490
<v Speaker 2>we have a soft life now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's gonna be a lot of people that</v>

618
00:27:23.491 --> 00:27:28.491
<v Speaker 2>are ridiculous and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always been those people that </v>

619
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:33.591
<v Speaker 2>are weak willed and they want the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be nerved up and of course pad their </v>

620
00:27:33.591 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 2>feelings.</v>

621
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:38.890
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also more people that have </v>

622
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.890
<v Speaker 2>an understanding of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a happy,</v>

623
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:42.430
<v Speaker 2>healthy way to live your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

624
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.570
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that like reality at </v>
<v Speaker 2>some point will always supersede nerf </v>

625
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:49.300
<v Speaker 2>padding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

626
00:27:49.301 --> 00:27:51.720
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be a push back </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that where you go look like,</v>

627
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to offend anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

628
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 2>and I do agree that there is a movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the left that really does push,</v>

629
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a thing,</v>

630
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.070
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this charity event for a,</v>

631
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.020
<v Speaker 2>like an urban program for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

632
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.370
<v Speaker 2>mainly inner city black kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm hosting with my,</v>

633
00:28:11.371 --> 00:28:16.371
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddy Mike Yard is a really funny </v>

634
00:28:16.371 --> 00:28:18.081
<v Speaker 2>comic black dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we went to meet with the guys for </v>

635
00:28:18.081 --> 00:28:18.081
<v Speaker 2>this charity and they were telling us </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

636
00:28:18.081 --> 00:28:19.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>charity,</v>

638
00:28:22.161 --> 00:28:27.161
<v Speaker 2>then write an auctioneer comes out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll try to auction off and raise a </v>

639
00:28:27.161 --> 00:28:27.161
<v Speaker 2>lot of money from rich people to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>the program.</v>

640
00:28:27.161 --> 00:28:30.960
<v Speaker 2>That's a very basically 99 point nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of every charity event I've ever</v>

641
00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:32.550
<v Speaker 2>been involved with has an auction </v>
<v Speaker 2>segment.</v>

642
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.160
<v Speaker 2>The in the dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

643
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.710
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can't use the word auction.</v>

644
00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

645
00:28:39.221 --> 00:28:41.250
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean you can't use the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>auction?</v>

646
00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Don't like it's a sensitive word for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

647
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 2>the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

648
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.230
<v Speaker 2>and then the yard goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you talking about slavery?</v>

649
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like his head almost exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

650
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.560
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

651
00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.830
<v Speaker 2>we can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't say the word auction.</v>

652
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but aren't you hiring a guy from </v>

653
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:01.160
<v Speaker 2>southerby's?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

654
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:01.160
<v Speaker 2>his card's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say Auctioneer on it.</v>

655
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.120
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to pretend that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's called.</v>

656
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.550
<v Speaker 2>And they were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just don't feel comfortable with that</v>

657
00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:07.650
<v Speaker 2>word in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just going,</v>

658
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I can't see.</v>

659
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

660
00:29:09.121 --> 00:29:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I gotta tell you it like you're making </v>
<v Speaker 2>me want to vote for trump.</v>

661
00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.480
<v Speaker 2>That's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how dumb I think this is.</v>

662
00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll agree to it because I want to help </v>

663
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.731
<v Speaker 2>these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is one of the dumbest things </v>

664
00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:22.731
<v Speaker 2>I've ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

665
00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:22.731
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I say cotton?</v>

666
00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Am I allowed to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what other words can I say?</v>

667
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.980
<v Speaker 2>That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get triggered auctions </v>

668
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 2>going to make a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're not going to joke around </v>

669
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 2>about like auctioning off a black </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

670
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Although yard and I probably would have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But first of all,</v>

671
00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:40.290
<v Speaker 2>like when you say oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you automatically think of that voice is</v>

672
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.890
<v Speaker 2>going to avoid him out of my head when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

673
00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 2>do you think they did that with when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were doing that with slaves?</v>

674
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I do not think they talked like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what their technique was,</v>

675
00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 2>but I do know when I think of the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>auction,</v>

676
00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

677
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:55.480
<v Speaker 2>don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't say the a word,</v>

678
00:29:55.481 --> 00:29:56.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

679
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.050
<v Speaker 2>it's a new league.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely accepted.</v>

680
00:29:59.051 --> 00:30:00.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

681
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like the word gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be flintstones gay.</v>

682
00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Have time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having a gay time was like,</v>

683
00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:10.440
<v Speaker 2>we're out having a gay old time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

684
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.660
<v Speaker 2>And then it became gay and then you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop saying it that way,</v>

685
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.140
<v Speaker 2>but just go back to gay happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Flint.</v>

686
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.340
<v Speaker 2>No you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't.</v>

687
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.880
<v Speaker 2>For me growing up was the thing we just </v>
<v Speaker 2>said about everything.</v>

688
00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Almost everything is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>

689
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Like the only thing you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

690
00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.000
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when did gay go bad?</v>

691
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

692
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.480
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went bad after the f word went bad.</v>

693
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

694
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.940
<v Speaker 2>Was it connecting the two of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking gay and they're like,</v>

695
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:36.510
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

696
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.520
<v Speaker 2>not fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meant the other word for gay people </v>

697
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:41.520
<v Speaker 2>that they get to the same fact that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

698
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not afraid to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just kind of being sarcastic </v>

699
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.120
<v Speaker 2>with the other f word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the other white meat.</v>

700
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

701
00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.530
<v Speaker 2>But like that was the and not that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

702
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.830
<v Speaker 2>it was this idea of like if something </v>
<v Speaker 2>was stupid,</v>

703
00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:56.420
<v Speaker 2>it was gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it didn't mean homosexual.</v>

704
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.560
<v Speaker 2>It meant like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

705
00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.310
<v Speaker 2>don't be so gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you start thinking about,</v>

706
00:30:59.311 --> 00:31:00.460
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it does.</v>

707
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's offensive because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying like that stupid shirt you're </v>

708
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.960
<v Speaker 2>wearing is gay listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's that way,</v>

709
00:31:07.961 --> 00:31:10.810
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it weird that gay took a turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the worst?</v>

710
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you have loved to been at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intersection when gay went bad?</v>

711
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Like for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll have.</v>

712
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time.</v>

713
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.190
<v Speaker 2>That's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

714
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.360
<v Speaker 2>What are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a intersection one overran it.</v>

715
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.490
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The main one beat the happy gay it did.</v>

716
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Gay took that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took the word gay and turns it into</v>

717
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:37.190
<v Speaker 2>either a negative like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

718
00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:42.210
<v Speaker 2>that's gay or homosexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it not connected to homosexuality</v>

719
00:31:42.641 --> 00:31:44.800
<v Speaker 2>before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

720
00:31:44.801 --> 00:31:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the connection came from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that like they're like,</v>

721
00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:50.530
<v Speaker 2>oh those guys are gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like being like.</v>

722
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Because they were being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

723
00:31:51.791 --> 00:31:56.791
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how happy they were like saying </v>

724
00:31:56.791 --> 00:31:56.791
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that Guy's gay,</v>

725
00:31:56.791 --> 00:31:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really gay.</v>

726
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Like a gay is with that shiny shirt on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

727
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.440
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

728
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:04.440
<v Speaker 2>someone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you the next thing.</v>

729
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:04.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we should stop with that word.</v>

732
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Come up with a new word gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A different thing now because I asked </v>

733
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:12.480
<v Speaker 2>the guy to get gay with me and it got </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

734
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.190
<v Speaker 2>really uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There had to be like a time in between </v>

735
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.670
<v Speaker 2>where it was real confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

736
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Where they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't fully establish what it meant yet</v>

737
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.350
<v Speaker 2>where people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then guy tackles him in the bushes </v>

741
00:32:32.131 --> 00:32:32.131
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:32:32.131 --> 00:32:34.150
<v Speaker 2>like the word hookup changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

743
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Like right around like when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.360
<v Speaker 2>but like my dad will be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's not what it means.</v>

749
00:32:45.891 --> 00:32:50.891
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my buddies would be in the room </v>

<v Speaker 2>So funny.</v>

755
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The language shifts occur.</v>

756
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:05.700
<v Speaker 2>I it feel like right now there's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>policing of it and there's more people </v>

757
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:05.700
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

758
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.380
<v Speaker 2>There's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot like the word pushy was,</v>

759
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 2>is one of those where you can say pussy </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

760
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:16.150
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get offended by it because the </v>

761
00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:16.150
<v Speaker 2>idea is you're getting offended by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>

762
00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:16.810
<v Speaker 2>but unless you're overusing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

763
00:33:16.811 --> 00:33:18.650
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying again,</v>

764
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.710
<v Speaker 2>what I say or don't say is what I say or</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't say it.</v>

765
00:33:21.711 --> 00:33:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I take my licks if I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people get offended by it.</v>

766
00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a word now that like if you're,</v>

767
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.520
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a hardcore leftist </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

768
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.560
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't say pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll still say dick guys being a </v>

769
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:36.560
<v Speaker 2>deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

770
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.960
<v Speaker 2>well that's offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those communities need a hug.</v>

771
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they don't need a hug </v>

772
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.120
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

773
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they need to have too many </v>
<v Speaker 2>hugs,</v>

774
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's just too much.</v>

775
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to our lives are easy now,</v>

776
00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:53.480
<v Speaker 2>so we have a lot of free time to come up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with bullshit.</v>

777
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.330
<v Speaker 2>We do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if we had to actually,</v>

778
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.660
<v Speaker 2>we didn't have electricity or we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have like all this ease.</v>

779
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:04.690
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't be harping on this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just like you have a lot of </v>

780
00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:05.000
<v Speaker 2>downtime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of downtime.</v>

781
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:05.360
<v Speaker 2>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

782
00:34:05.361 --> 00:34:07.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll start a blog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'll start blogging about words.</v>

783
00:34:07.881 --> 00:34:12.881
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't say we have so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>surplus that one of our biggest problems</v>

784
00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:18.110
<v Speaker 2>is that we eat too much food and we get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to big.</v>

785
00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the number one health </v>

786
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.110
<v Speaker 2>problems that humans have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is how much surplus we have.</v>

787
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Even though I know people have it hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's people that are starving all</v>

788
00:34:27.141 --> 00:34:27.590
<v Speaker 2>over the world.</v>

789
00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm aware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just in general,</v>

790
00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.270
<v Speaker 2>specially in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

791
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.780
<v Speaker 2>what is it like one of our number one </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems is people just eat too much and</v>

792
00:34:35.781 --> 00:34:40.781
<v Speaker 2>when we have the wrong shit about people</v>
<v Speaker 2>starving in America and you think about </v>

793
00:34:40.781 --> 00:34:43.520
<v Speaker 2>how much food is wasted and thrown out </v>
<v Speaker 2>for days doing a documentary on it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

796
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:51.280

<v Speaker 2>there's like no in internal desire to,</v>

797
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:56.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like why I get annoyed at the </v>

<v Speaker 2>and support young mothers who uh,</v>

807
00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:18.320
<v Speaker 2>but they don't fucking do anything about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

808
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:23.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a nice little box to put yourself </v>

809
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:25.991
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some people they think they're a </v>

810
00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:25.991
<v Speaker 2>good person because they're a Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

811
00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 2>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much do you really act?</v>

812
00:35:26.091 --> 00:35:27.780
<v Speaker 2>But you're taking your day to stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

813
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Planned parenthood was assigned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not take the day to go help that kid</v>

814
00:35:30.771 --> 00:35:34.210
<v Speaker 2>who didn't get aborted and his mom can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed him?</v>

815
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not stop by there instead of holding</v>

816
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:39.930
<v Speaker 2>a sign about the devil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A clinic for women.</v>

817
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.240
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is weird.</v>

818
00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

819
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing that you can do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

820
00:35:45.451 --> 00:35:50.451
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the weird things </v>

821
00:35:50.451 --> 00:35:52.011
<v Speaker 2>about people is that we know that if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything and we take care of </v>

822
00:35:52.011 --> 00:35:55.641
<v Speaker 2>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a baby's coming and like if you get the </v>

823
00:35:55.641 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 2>first countdown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like countdown,</v>

824
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:59.970
<v Speaker 2>like it's almost like we agree that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like levels to the countdown.</v>

825
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Like in the first couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one gives a shit.</v>

826
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Just pull the plug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull the plot,</v>

827
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.970
<v Speaker 2>and then every everyone's looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody like you feel,</v>

828
00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

829
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:09.500
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

830
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not that big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like would we.</v>

831
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.250
<v Speaker 2>How many cells was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was only four cells at the time.</v>

832
00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Like okay for Salads is not a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells and you start thinking,</v>

833
00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it really ever can be for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sales,</v>

834
00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:22.380
<v Speaker 2>but you get my point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tiny little thing.</v>

835
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.480
<v Speaker 2>And then when does it become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when do you decide,</v>

836
00:36:25.481 --> 00:36:28.350
<v Speaker 2>decide that's a person I get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get by the way it looks like one,</v>

837
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get the argument and you know,</v>

838
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that I have my own personal </v>

839
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 2>philosophy on how I would handle a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

840
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.900
<v Speaker 2>but I don't if you were a woman.</v>

841
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

842
00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:45.501
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying if I was in a relationship </v>

843
00:36:45.501 --> 00:36:47.121
<v Speaker 2>with a woman and she got pregnant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to have the kid or didn't </v>

844
00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:47.121
<v Speaker 2>want to have the at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

845
00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:50.930
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day we'd have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation together and if she was </v>

846
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.930
<v Speaker 2>dead set on doing it then we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>

847
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:51.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that.</v>

848
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.950
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point being,</v>

849
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that like it's a weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to just tell other people what </v>

850
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.190
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to do or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

851
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I feel about gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that way about everything.</v>

852
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:01.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

853
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a strange thing to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictate to someone else how they,</v>

854
00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:10.770
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agreed because there's too many people </v>

855
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.410
<v Speaker 2>there with that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we got the right doing it through </v>

856
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:13.410
<v Speaker 2>the Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

857
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:13.410
<v Speaker 2>And we've got the left doing it through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

858
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:14.430
<v Speaker 2>all their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all their movements.</v>

859
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:19.430
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason most people are so </v>

860
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.430
<v Speaker 2>annoyed in the country isn't like even </v>
<v Speaker 2>political.</v>

861
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:20.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're just sick of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling them how to live,</v>

862
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.200
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I get it.</v>

863
00:37:22.201 --> 00:37:23.190
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

864
00:37:23.191 --> 00:37:25.450
<v Speaker 2>you want me to not have a gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hate guns.</v>

865
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like everyone's fucking stopper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we need like a,</v>

866
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.660
<v Speaker 2>just like a national time out for five </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and we're just learning how to </v>

867
00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:34.660
<v Speaker 2>use this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

868
00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:39.070
<v Speaker 2>where we're learning how to integrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>society into this kind of communication </v>

869
00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.410
<v Speaker 2>that we share right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just while we're still figuring it out.</v>

870
00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:45.450
<v Speaker 2>I did talk about that with somebody the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day and I was actually just doing </v>

871
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:46.770
<v Speaker 2>a set on stage and I was riffing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit about how,</v>

872
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:52.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the second amendment a </v>

873
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.310
<v Speaker 2>lot and the founding fathers didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were gonna have assault rifles.</v>

874
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:58.310
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the foresight to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that so that we have to rethink what </v>

875
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.310
<v Speaker 2>that means and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

876
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.350
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know we were going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

877
00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe we have to rethink what the </v>

878
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.601
<v Speaker 2>first amendment means that no every </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking moron who's going to have the </v>

879
00:38:05.601 --> 00:38:07.140
<v Speaker 2>ability to you say stuff out loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just on a national level,</v>

880
00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.490
<v Speaker 2>just the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

881
00:38:08.491 --> 00:38:11.340
<v Speaker 2>imagine how easy it was to govern people</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the Internet came around.</v>

882
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:13.680
<v Speaker 2>It must have been so much easier to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie to them,</v>

883
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:17.340
<v Speaker 2>lie to them to have almost no access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth and what you get.</v>

884
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:19.230
<v Speaker 2>We get with Walter cronkite tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

885
00:38:19.231 --> 00:38:20.490
<v Speaker 2>that's all you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you get?</v>

886
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the entertainment industry.</v>

887
00:38:22.651 --> 00:38:24.300
<v Speaker 2>It used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to hear a song?</v>

888
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Merv Griffin and Dick Clark will let you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what song was.</v>

889
00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:27.060
<v Speaker 2>It can hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

890
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.150
<v Speaker 2>we're on the side of the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti abortion.</v>

891
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.720
<v Speaker 2>There's one side of you that has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>logically interpret that.</v>

892
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.550
<v Speaker 2>If these people really did feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>babies</v>

893
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:41.550
<v Speaker 1>were being murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was their perspective that </v>

894
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:44.400
<v Speaker 1>babies were being murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you completely ignore that </v>

895
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.040
<v Speaker 1>perspective and just try to say it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman's health issue like I get,</v>

896
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I almost get where their mind is at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that they should be </v>

897
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.660
<v Speaker 1>interfering in anybody's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when something is illegal and</v>

898
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.520
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally believe that's what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and you could see how that </v>

899
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:02.520
<v Speaker 1>thought babies were being killed up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

900
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:04.990
<v Speaker 1>We can't allow this to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying,</v>

901
00:39:04.991 --> 00:39:09.991
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that they are babies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that argument is it's.</v>

902
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.890
<v Speaker 1>It holds some water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

903
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Like you really have to me as if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a rational person and I'm </v>

904
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.680
<v Speaker 1>100 percent pro choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a rational person,</v>

905
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:20.920
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at what it actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>

906
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 1>well then we're playing a game.</v>

907
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.060
<v Speaker 1>The game is you want your side to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>

908
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.540
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is this is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>

909
00:39:28.541 --> 00:39:29.750
<v Speaker 1>weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

910
00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:34.830
<v Speaker 1>there's like a life in your body and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure a guy shouldn't be able to tell </v>

911
00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:34.830
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can do.</v>

912
00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Totally agree with that can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell a woman.</v>

913
00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:38.320
<v Speaker 1>She has to keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have already aborted babies.</v>

914
00:39:38.321 --> 00:39:43.321
<v Speaker 1>There's a precedent for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell them what they could do </v>

915
00:39:43.321 --> 00:39:43.321
<v Speaker 1>or you can do to support their decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>or can weigh in.</v>

916
00:39:43.321 --> 00:39:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're the dad you can weigh </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and what you want,</v>

917
00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:48.370
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day she's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide what she wants to do and you just</v>

918
00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:49.690
<v Speaker 1>got to agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

919
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.660
<v Speaker 1>and that's the move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

920
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complicated thing,</v>

921
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.520
<v Speaker 1>but like a life form that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually become a person is inside </v>

922
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:02.520
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

923
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:07.350
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you imagine we had to make that </v>

924
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:08.290
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky that chicks do it because we</v>

925
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:10.740
<v Speaker 1>don't think correctly for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that proposition.</v>

926
00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Now ability to weigh those options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that the,</v>

927
00:40:13.991 --> 00:40:15.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

928
00:40:15.131 --> 00:40:15.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

929
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.040
<v Speaker 1>when I think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you and I,</v>

930
00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:23.090
<v Speaker 1>and I think most issues in the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>are like that and that's the whole </v>

931
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:23.090
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no rationality on either side,</v>

932
00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:23.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

933
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:25.570
<v Speaker 1>no one will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rational Center,</v>

934
00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>

935
00:40:26.351 --> 00:40:27.970
<v Speaker 1>people will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:33.030
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot going on with trump and </v>

937
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Russia and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

938
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.080
<v Speaker 1>what have you heard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

939
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.880
<v Speaker 1>and then people will post them thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

940
00:40:35.881 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Obama scandals and then someone on</v>

941
00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:38.310
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the building,</v>

942
00:40:38.311 --> 00:40:40.740
<v Speaker 1>he had no scandals and then someone will</v>
<v Speaker 1>list like five scanners.</v>

943
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.290
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

944
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 1>those were scandals.</v>

945
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't just pretend that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fast.</v>

946
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:47.920
<v Speaker 1>And the furious thing was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bad.</v>

947
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Like if you really like muscle cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

948
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:51.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

949
00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Speaker 1>that Obama thing where he like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

950
00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:58.420
<v Speaker 1>that's where you gave all the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lost all those guns and some of </v>

951
00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:58.970
<v Speaker 1>them were used to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

952
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

953
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:02.530
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the logic behind that?</v>

954
00:41:02.531 --> 00:41:05.050
<v Speaker 1>They were going to trace them to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran contra account.</v>

955
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that movie by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scam?</v>

956
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Or was it a thing where they were trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give them guns that they could trace,</v>

957
00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:14.920
<v Speaker 1>they could trace and then they instantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>can trace because I think that was.</v>

958
00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the gist of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine that?</v>

959
00:41:17.381 --> 00:41:19.450
<v Speaker 1>That was just really a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is.</v>

960
00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Some people do think it was like a just </v>
<v Speaker 1>an illegal arms sale that happened right</v>

961
00:41:22.781 --> 00:41:27.781
<v Speaker 1>under our nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you imagine if that's really what </v>

962
00:41:27.781 --> 00:41:27.781
<v Speaker 1>it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

963
00:41:27.781 --> 00:41:30.841
<v Speaker 1>did you watch that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just watched it the other night that </v>

964
00:41:30.841 --> 00:41:30.841
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise movie American made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

965
00:41:30.841 --> 00:41:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I did not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know what it's about.</v>

966
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the first good Tom cruise movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's</v>

967
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:39.100
<v Speaker 2>had out I think in a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's funny because he's that kind </v>

968
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:39.100
<v Speaker 2>of a dark character is not like a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

969
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I know at Barry Seal story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's,</v>

970
00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

971
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.550
<v Speaker 2>like a pilot who basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

972
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.980
<v Speaker 2>the CIA was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

973
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.580
<v Speaker 2>you're a really good pilot and we need a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy to like bring some guns to the,</v>

974
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.300
<v Speaker 2>it's all the precursor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Iran Contra thing,</v>

975
00:41:56.301 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 2>which as a kid I remember hearing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

976
00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.130
<v Speaker 2>but then understanding of the federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

977
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.420
<v Speaker 2>which was us trying to arm rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we've been doing for,</v>

978
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.520
<v Speaker 2>we are been loud and against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians.</v>

979
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:06.020
<v Speaker 2>We've been arming rebels for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

980
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's our move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

981
00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Time Gang.</v>

982
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

983
00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:10.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he became the dude,</v>

984
00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:12.800
<v Speaker 2>the CIA asked to do that and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

985
00:42:12.801 --> 00:42:14.360
<v Speaker 2>you got to pay me more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy was like,</v>

986
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 2>you'll figure it out.</v>

987
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.450
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden it became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would land the,</v>

988
00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:18.470
<v Speaker 2>bring the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the dude was like,</v>

989
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want you to bring an escobar.</v>

990
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 2>And his crew were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pablo Escobar,</v>

991
00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:23.690
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

992
00:42:23.691 --> 00:42:28.691
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're bringing us guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also want you on your flight home to </v>

993
00:42:28.691 --> 00:42:31.661
<v Speaker 2>bring a 1500 pounds of cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he was like,</v>

994
00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No thanks.</v>

995
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:37.550
<v Speaker 2>And they were like a 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2000 bucks a kilo.</v>

996
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.250
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many kilos at 50?</v>

997
00:42:39.251 --> 00:42:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Fifteen hundred pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became like,</v>

998
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:46.750
<v Speaker 2>it became like this insane to wait </v>
<v Speaker 2>smugglers smuggling guns in and drugs </v>

999
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 2>and guns and drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really interesting story.</v>

1000
00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:53.380
<v Speaker 2>What do you think happens today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that stuff like that is </v>

1001
00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:54.610
<v Speaker 2>still going on today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do you think that this,</v>

1002
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.680
<v Speaker 2>when it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they figured out that it was a </v>

1003
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.340
<v Speaker 2>bunch of cowboys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ca operatives that were just trying</v>

1004
00:43:01.341 --> 00:43:02.450
<v Speaker 2>to make some money on the side?</v>

1005
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Or do you think it's like a systematic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's like.</v>

1006
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.720
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's human error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that like people,</v>

1007
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.830
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm not like a big conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>theorist because it's like I don't think</v>

1008
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:18.430
<v Speaker 2>the government's organized enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always weird to me when people who </v>

1009
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:19.340
<v Speaker 2>think that government sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wants small government,</v>

1010
00:43:19.341 --> 00:43:22.190
<v Speaker 2>they want the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government mishandles everything.</v>

1011
00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:23.790
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how to do this.</v>

1012
00:43:23.791 --> 00:43:27.140
<v Speaker 2>They can't magic imagine manage traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>lights,</v>

1013
00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:28.520
<v Speaker 2>whatever they think the government can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1014
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:30.320
<v Speaker 2>They can't do healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're idiots.</v>

1015
00:43:30.321 --> 00:43:32.000
<v Speaker 2>They're idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Private sector and then they're like,</v>

1016
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:37.330
<v Speaker 2>but there's a giant government </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy where all the government </v>

1017
00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.941
<v Speaker 2>knows this thing and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can't fucking manage traffic </v>

1018
00:43:39.941 --> 00:43:43.241
<v Speaker 2>lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are they pulling off like a fake </v>

1019
00:43:43.241 --> 00:43:43.450
<v Speaker 2>moon landing or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1020
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:44.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you that kind of stuff,</v>

1021
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:45.730
<v Speaker 2>to me it's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1022
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.320
<v Speaker 2>you're perpetuating two very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>views of it.</v>

1023
00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Extremely competent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clandestine and group of people who can </v>

1024
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.951
<v Speaker 2>achieve these like dark shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We things without anyone knowing or </v>

1025
00:43:56.951 --> 00:43:57.920
<v Speaker 2>bumbling morons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're the same people.</v>

1026
00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:00.210
<v Speaker 2>They're government workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

1027
00:44:00.211 --> 00:44:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I think some CIS or like the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind going into Iraq is interesting.</v>

1028
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Like a CIA operative had a theory about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're been.</v>

1029
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Osama fucking other dudes so download.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saddam Hussein had a,</v>

1030
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:17.360
<v Speaker 2>had weapons of mass destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a theory and he was an analyst at</v>

1031
00:44:17.361 --> 00:44:21.470
<v Speaker 2>the CIA and he wrote up this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>document and they read it.</v>

1032
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:22.070
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1033
00:44:22.071 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we have no proof of any of this.</v>

1034
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was so mad they did that,</v>

1035
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:30.910
<v Speaker 2>that he published it on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just leaked it to the Internet and then </v>

1036
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:34.560
<v Speaker 2>that story got on the Internet and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dude in Australia who was a spy.</v>

1037
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:39.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like a guy from Australia and </v>

1038
00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.670
<v Speaker 2>another guy from Afghanistan or Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 2>read it on the Internet,</v>

1039
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:46.910
<v Speaker 2>came to America and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have all the secrets of what he's </v>

1040
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:50.331
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he just used that guy's document </v>

1041
00:44:50.331 --> 00:44:52.980
<v Speaker 2>that he read online and told the CIA and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the guy came in and goes,</v>

1042
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:54.410
<v Speaker 2>he has weapons here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons here,</v>

1043
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.250
<v Speaker 2>weapons here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that analyst goes,</v>

1044
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was right.</v>

1045
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile he's quoting him his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>report,</v>

1046
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.130
<v Speaker 2>so then he goes back to Cheyney and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

1047
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:07.220
<v Speaker 2>we've got this dude talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans saying all the things I </v>

1048
00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.140
<v Speaker 2>theorized and then that's the guy curve </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>

1049
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:13.340
<v Speaker 2>We listen to a dude named curveball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like that's how the whole fucking </v>

1050
00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.660
<v Speaker 2>thing went down and basically some do </v>
<v Speaker 2>tricked us.</v>

1051
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.180
<v Speaker 2>He actually didn't know anything but it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was too late.</v>

1052
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:23.181
<v Speaker 2>We like went off the information that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude read off the Internet from a guy </v>

1053
00:45:23.181 --> 00:45:23.181
<v Speaker 2>who was mad.</v>

1054
00:45:23.181 --> 00:45:24.840
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't take his info,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was wrong,</v>

1055
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:26.630
<v Speaker 2>which is why there were no weapons of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass destruction.</v>

1056
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.890
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a crazy.</v>

1057
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:30.510
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that shit happens all the time,</v>

1058
00:45:30.511 --> 00:45:33.330
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think they're sloppy.</v>

1059
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Government employee are dealing with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different things for some of </v>

1060
00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:39.990
<v Speaker 2>them are sloppy government employees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are not.</v>

1061
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's that too.</v>

1062
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Like Robert Muller's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's A.</v>

1063
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a ton of them.</v>

1064
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a ton of them that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant,</v>

1065
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:52.580
<v Speaker 2>but you're also going to have cowboys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what I think when you find </v>

1066
00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.770
<v Speaker 2>out about these CIA drug deals gone bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did you see that one?</v>

1067
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Where the plane crashed in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't let them refuel.</v>

1068
00:45:57.691 --> 00:46:02.691
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't let them land refuel </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they kind of knew maybe they </v>

1069
00:46:02.691 --> 00:46:06.201
<v Speaker 2>were smuggling drugs and they made him </v>
<v Speaker 2>crash and the plane wound up crashing </v>

1070
00:46:06.201 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 2>and it had how many tons of cocaine did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it have in it,</v>

1071
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:10.290
<v Speaker 2>and people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is proof the CIA sells cocaine.</v>

1072
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1073
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:14.370
<v Speaker 2>it's proved those guys flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That plane had cocaine.</v>

1074
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real question is did they just get </v>

1075
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.351
<v Speaker 2>too Loosey Goosey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traveling back and forth to South </v>

1076
00:46:21.351 --> 00:46:21.351
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little too tight with some people that</v>

1077
00:46:21.351 --> 00:46:25.791
<v Speaker 2>have had a little bit too much money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realized we could fucking do this </v>

1078
00:46:25.791 --> 00:46:25.830
<v Speaker 2>so we could do this and no one would </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspect it.</v>

1079
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing though.</v>

1080
00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:31.851
<v Speaker 2>Say what the what the five point five </v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of five point five tons.</v>

1081
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that 11 pounds 11.</v>

1082
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:37.020
<v Speaker 2>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many thousand pounds?</v>

1083
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:38.800
<v Speaker 2>11,000?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Two Thousand Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five and a half.</v>

1085
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.330
<v Speaker 2>And 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds of fucking cocaine.</v>

1087
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you,</v>

1088
00:46:46.321 --> 00:46:51.321
<v Speaker 2>it's insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but show the pictures of the crash </v>

1089
00:46:51.321 --> 00:46:51.321
<v Speaker 2>because it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just six of coke,</v>

1090
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:53.130
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say like 2005,</v>

1091
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:54.240
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

1092
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:57.150
<v Speaker 2>but so the but the barry seal story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he just a pilot,</v>

1093
00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.980
<v Speaker 2>a CIA operative who's trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections with them,</v>

1094
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.400
<v Speaker 2>do his mission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is given to him,</v>

1095
00:47:02.401 --> 00:47:04.350
<v Speaker 2>which is arm these rebels.</v>

1096
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.280
<v Speaker 2>So five guys in the CIA have to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to arm rebels.</v>

1097
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:13.310
<v Speaker 2>So he approaches this pilot that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>hears is a good pilot who flies for Twa </v>

1098
00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:13.310
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1099
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:16.380
<v Speaker 2>you're now in the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not really in the CIA.</v>

1100
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:19.680
<v Speaker 2>He's not part of this age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a pilot that this guy subcontracts.</v>

1101
00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.830
<v Speaker 2>And then he doesn't tell the bosses how </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's getting the guns in.</v>

1102
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just made up a little thing.</v>

1103
00:47:24.811 --> 00:47:28.680
<v Speaker 2>He has his own budget to do his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>little thing and he finds this dude.</v>

1104
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.080
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like barry seal was</v>

1105
00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:35.140
<v Speaker 1>a CIA guy flying cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just a pilot that the CIA told </v>

1106
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.830
<v Speaker 1>and only one guy from the CIA told it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and then it's crazy story,</v>

1107
00:47:38.831 --> 00:47:43.831
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's doing it and then he </v>

1108
00:47:43.831 --> 00:47:43.831
<v Speaker 1>starts making his little side business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy looks the other way because</v>

1109
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.950
<v Speaker 1>he just wants buried delivering the guns</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then after a while,</v>

1110
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:49.310
<v Speaker 1>like as it starts to fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1111
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:52.000
<v Speaker 1>so it's like burn everything with Barry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Seal's name on it.</v>

1112
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:55.620
<v Speaker 1>We've never had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've never had connection to barry seal</v>

1113
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:56.620
<v Speaker 1>and entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1114
00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.430
<v Speaker 1>that's all the coke that they got off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That plane looks like.</v>

1115
00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:05.440
<v Speaker 1>What size was that for an army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had like a army troop and </v>

1116
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:11.851
<v Speaker 1>like boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is your career and it's all rolled </v>

1117
00:48:11.851 --> 00:48:14.701
<v Speaker 1>up in these giant bags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it if so funny though that like that </v>

1118
00:48:14.701 --> 00:48:14.701
<v Speaker 1>is crazy.</v>

1119
00:48:14.701 --> 00:48:16.330
<v Speaker 1>People still think a wall is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1120
00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like drugs were coming in on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>airplane.</v>

1121
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that the airplane was a </v>

1122
00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:24.790
<v Speaker 1>cia or playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they have in the movie,</v>

1123
00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.060
<v Speaker 1>did they have the reason why they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1124
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 1>the whole scheme got busted in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>

1125
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1126
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:35.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it like a spoiler for </v>

1127
00:48:35.701 --> 00:48:37.231
<v Speaker 1>listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you the real story about </v>

1128
00:48:37.231 --> 00:48:37.231
<v Speaker 1>the kids that were murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1129
00:48:37.231 --> 00:48:38.470
<v Speaker 1>the kids that were murdered were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't in the movie?</v>

1130
00:48:38.471 --> 00:48:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1131
00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:44.540
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways this whole thing came </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart was two kids were apparently in </v>

1132
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:50.041
<v Speaker 1>the woods when they made a drop and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids saw a drop and they were </v>

1133
00:48:50.041 --> 00:48:54.631
<v Speaker 1>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were stabbed and then they lead </v>

1134
00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:56.940
<v Speaker 1>left their bodies on the train tracks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their bodies were run over by train </v>

1135
00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.571
<v Speaker 1>tracks and then the parents got an </v>
<v Speaker 1>autopsy and the autopsy showed that at </v>

1136
00:49:00.571 --> 00:49:01.450
<v Speaker 1>least one of the kids had been stabbed.</v>

1137
00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so something I realized something </v>

1138
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.230
<v Speaker 1>had happened in New Orleans where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids got killed.</v>

1139
00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:09.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was MENA,</v>

1140
00:49:09.371 --> 00:49:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Arkansas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1141
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:12.390
<v Speaker 1>That's the main part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:15.460
<v Speaker 1>That's where the drop was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The drop was apparently in Mena,</v>

1143
00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:20.461
<v Speaker 1>Arkansas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they killed these kids and then this </v>

1144
00:49:20.461 --> 00:49:21.400
<v Speaker 1>whole thing happened and then the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing fell apart and then people started</v>

1145
00:49:21.401 --> 00:49:26.401
<v Speaker 1>looking into it and then barry seal's </v>
<v Speaker 1>was murdered actually as he was getting </v>

1146
00:49:26.401 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 1>to court to testify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I could be,</v>

1177
00:50:48.411 --> 00:50:50.540
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what the fuck the history of this</v>

1178
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:55.541
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you lie to me about something so </v>

1179
00:50:55.541 --> 00:50:58.060
<v Speaker 2>insignificant as who the guy was that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought in the UFC,</v>

1180
00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.740
<v Speaker 2>he takes it out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else are you lying about?</v>

1181
00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.630
<v Speaker 2>A great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just so stupid to do.</v>

1182
00:51:02.631 --> 00:51:07.631
<v Speaker 2>It's a real story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that movie with Marky </v>

1183
00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:09.170
<v Speaker 2>Mark and the rock?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

1184
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That column.</v>

1185
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Marky mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1186
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it's marketing.</v>

1187
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Mark Wahlberg and the rock and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a true based on a true story.</v>

1188
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:18.680
<v Speaker 2>It came out like two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years ago.</v>

1189
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 2>It's really good and in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie it's one of the coolest things</v>

1190
00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:24.050
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen done in a true story </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

1191
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:29.410
<v Speaker 2>They're like doing this absurd thing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like jumping off a rooftop together and </v>

1192
00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:31.430
<v Speaker 2>it just pauses and then a text comes up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and says,</v>

1193
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:34.550
<v Speaker 2>this all happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is still a true story.</v>

1194
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Like it reminds you in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

1195
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.320
<v Speaker 2>pain and gain was oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain and gain.</v>

1196
00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fun.</v>

1197
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Moving in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dump or something.</v>

1198
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this the part?</v>

1199
00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Just the trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trailer.</v>

1200
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Did this a fun movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great movie.</v>

1201
00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:49.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

1202
00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:53.060
<v Speaker 2>my favorite movies that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun ass movie.</v>

1203
00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rocks.</v>

1204
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the rock.</v>

1205
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:59.330
<v Speaker 2>I love the Rock in the middle of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the movie,</v>

1206
00:51:59.331 --> 00:52:00.590
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pause it and they go.</v>

1207
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.170
<v Speaker 2>This is still a true story like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

1208
00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:08.380
<v Speaker 2>which is cool because it like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it gets almost inconceivable </v>

1209
00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.681
<v Speaker 2>after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the rock is going to be our </v>

1210
00:52:11.681 --> 00:52:13.451
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the rock should be our </v>

1211
00:52:13.451 --> 00:52:14.861
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he can pull it off and I'm not </v>

1212
00:52:14.861 --> 00:52:14.861
<v Speaker 2>joking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not joking either,</v>

1213
00:52:14.861 --> 00:52:19.211
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never in a serious political </v>

1214
00:52:19.211 --> 00:52:21.461
<v Speaker 2>discussion in good hands with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients for real politics has waned it.</v>

1215
00:52:22.571 --> 00:52:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1216
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 2>we're on our way there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen idiocracy,</v>

1217
00:52:24.801 --> 00:52:25.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're on our way,</v>

1218
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:27.460
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still haven't seen that.</v>

1219
00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will love that movie.</v>

1220
00:52:29.181 --> 00:52:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

1221
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got salty because when I had a bit </v>

1222
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:36.160
<v Speaker 2>that was the same premise of that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about dumb people out.</v>

1223
00:52:36.161 --> 00:52:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Fucking all the smart people.</v>

1224
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.810
<v Speaker 2>One day we wake up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the power's off and uh,</v>

1225
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one knows how to turn it back on.</v>

1226
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:47.470
<v Speaker 2>That would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would annoy me too if it was your </v>

1227
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:49.580
<v Speaker 2>bed because it's not my bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stole the parallel thinking.</v>

1228
00:52:49.581 --> 00:52:52.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's an obvious concept if you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are out,</v>

1229
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.490
<v Speaker 2>if they think that people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>dumber and dumber,</v>

1230
00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.630
<v Speaker 2>people are having more kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1231
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:58.800
<v Speaker 2>it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1232
00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:00.350
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.540
<v Speaker 2>That's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I traced it back to the pyramid,</v>

1234
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.720
<v Speaker 2>like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing was like that.</v>

1235
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:07.500
<v Speaker 2>The smart people just died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the one that had done,</v>

1236
00:53:07.501 --> 00:53:09.560
<v Speaker 2>people showed up at the pyramid and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just moved in.</v>

1237
00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Nobody lives here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the alien culture created exactly </v>

1238
00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.090
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of like fat dudes look good.</v>

1239
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idiot workers,</v>

1240
00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:23.591
<v Speaker 2>if you just stumbled into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We built this whole generation to go </v>

1241
00:53:23.591 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 2>with the best that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's still,</v>

1242
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:31.130
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had one time in like if you could </v>

1243
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.000
<v Speaker 1>go back in a time machine and go to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in history and see something,</v>

1244
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it would have to be Egypt while </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were building the pyramids.</v>

1245
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I would just love to see what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture was like.</v>

1246
00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:44.160
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you look at all the stone and </v>

1247
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:44.160
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1248
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Even if you were standing there automat </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to Egypt,</v>

1249
00:53:44.581 --> 00:53:46.570
<v Speaker 1>but I've been to cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She needs on.</v>

1250
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.540
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of the same feeling you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you like,</v>

1251
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 1>what was it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>

1252
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:51.890
<v Speaker 1>when this place was popping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1253
00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.280
<v Speaker 1>what did this feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was this?</v>

1254
00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:58.490
<v Speaker 1>These people have built these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures like what was a normal day </v>

1255
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.490
<v Speaker 1>for them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1256
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.790
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the,</v>

1257
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched the documentary about the </v>

1258
00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Pyramids and not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1259
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:08.790
<v Speaker 1>not the one with the aliens and which </v>
<v Speaker 1>one Nazis and what,</v>

1260
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.200
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1261
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:09.870
<v Speaker 1>what's that one on?</v>

1262
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Like with the guy with the crazy hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1263
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:18.710
<v Speaker 1>and it George Hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to Giorgio sucralose and he's </v>

1264
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 1>like ancient astronauts theorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>surmise.</v>

1265
00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Tell people that's not a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know he's fairly reasonable.</v>

1266
00:54:25.771 --> 00:54:29.730
<v Speaker 1>When you talk to Georgiou is just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lover of all possibilities.</v>

1267
00:54:29.731 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an hour's worth of a show.</v>

1268
00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.770
<v Speaker 1>They're on like season 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>89.</v>

1269
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:36.590
<v Speaker 1>There was camping out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1270
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not the first one with like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazca lines.</v>

1271
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:44.240
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now they're like eight inch an </v>

1272
00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.090
<v Speaker 1>astronaut feared semis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that palm trees,</v>

1273
00:54:45.091 --> 00:54:46.260
<v Speaker 1>what brought here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in you're like,</v>

1274
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:47.310
<v Speaker 1>just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1275
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:48.870
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you finished it.</v>

1276
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:53.930
<v Speaker 1>If ghost shows are still on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them be on the air because at least </v>

1277
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:57.561
<v Speaker 1>they're showing cool old buildings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and stone structures ever be </v>

1278
00:54:57.561 --> 00:55:01.590
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a family wanting to go to </v>

1279
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:01.590
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one ghost man,</v>

1280
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:04.110
<v Speaker 1>at least we have some cool rocks to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at where you look at like,</v>

1281
00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:06.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are those giant stones in?</v>

1282
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Is it Peru?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stonehenge?</v>

1283
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:09.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1284
00:55:09.581 --> 00:55:09.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1285
00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:14.860
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still interested in England and in </v>

1286
00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:14.860
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1287
00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:16.830
<v Speaker 1>there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some crazy structures somewhere </v>

1288
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:21.050
<v Speaker 1>in south America that Giorgio was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to us about and it was one of </v>

1289
00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:26.001
<v Speaker 1>the reasons why some people speculate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's possible that some of the </v>

1290
00:55:26.001 --> 00:55:30.081
<v Speaker 1>things that are constructed that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't have any idea how ancient </v>

1291
00:55:30.081 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 1>primitive man did were actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed by someone from another.</v>

1292
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Another plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think it's any less </v>

1293
00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:39.081
<v Speaker 1>reasonable than people thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God sent like pointed his finger </v>

1294
00:55:39.081 --> 00:55:40.080
<v Speaker 1>giraffe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right about that.</v>

1295
00:55:40.081 --> 00:55:43.170
<v Speaker 1>You're right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like half the world believes that you're</v>

1296
00:55:43.171 --> 00:55:48.171
<v Speaker 1>right about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more reasonable to think that </v>

1297
00:55:48.171 --> 00:55:50.391
<v Speaker 1>it was done by people because we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are a real thing and we know </v>

1298
00:55:50.391 --> 00:55:51.470
<v Speaker 1>people have built a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>

1299
00:55:51.471 --> 00:55:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

1300
00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:54.870
<v Speaker 1>This is the exact structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fucking stones there,</v>

1301
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.780
<v Speaker 1>they're not just cut and placed </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly,</v>

1302
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:03.080
<v Speaker 1>but they're in fit together like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>jigsaw puzzle and somehow or another </v>

1303
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:08.031
<v Speaker 1>they carved and move these enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>stones and if you stand right next to </v>

1304
00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:08.031
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1305
00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:11.010
<v Speaker 1>there's some photos of people standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>next to him stand right next to him.</v>

1306
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they just tower over people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these were all done,</v>

1307
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:19.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows how many thousands of years </v>

1308
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.370
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't there like a reasonable </v>

1309
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:23.380
<v Speaker 1>thing to think that maybe they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that is lost to time.</v>

1310
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a reasonable thing to think for </v>

1311
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:28.410
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in other words,</v>

1312
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:31.040
<v Speaker 1>like if our civilization crumbles and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 years people dig it up.</v>

1313
00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they find the empire state building.</v>

1314
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:38.761
<v Speaker 1>But like how'd they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not gonna find like a backhoe </v>

1315
00:56:38.761 --> 00:56:38.761
<v Speaker 1>looking at this picture.</v>

1316
00:56:38.761 --> 00:56:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Look at these fucking steroids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

1317
00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Go back to the other one with the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of it so you can see the </v>

1318
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.090
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how big it is.</v>

1319
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did not think it was that big.</v>

1320
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:52.890
<v Speaker 1>They're so big dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like a staircase and this was </v>

1321
00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:55.741
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he was saying like we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the technology to do this </v>

1322
00:56:55.741 --> 00:56:56.270
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

1323
00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Like if you wanted to get someone to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and move those giant stones,</v>

1324
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 1>cut them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>place them.</v>

1325
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:05.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean we kind of have the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but holy Shit,</v>

1326
00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:08.470
<v Speaker 1>we did take a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it take giant fucking cranes?</v>

1327
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.690
<v Speaker 1>It would take forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what they did.</v>

1328
00:57:10.691 --> 00:57:13.540
<v Speaker 1>They did this whole structure and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

1329
00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:18.541
<v Speaker 1>You got to get the guys to show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about how it is to like get your </v>

1330
00:57:18.541 --> 00:57:18.541
<v Speaker 1>kitchen done because I need.</v>

1331
00:57:18.541 --> 00:57:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I need two more weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know Mike Stone,</v>

1332
00:57:19.931 --> 00:57:24.931
<v Speaker 1>guys out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long would it take to build </v>

1333
00:57:24.931 --> 00:57:24.931
<v Speaker 1>something that fucking crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1334
00:57:24.931 --> 00:57:29.140
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea was that aliens came </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1335
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:33.070
<v Speaker 1>built some thing's fucked with our DNA </v>
<v Speaker 1>and got ghost.</v>

1336
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Say Fuck the fuck some early man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keeps early man.</v>

1337
00:57:36.411 --> 00:57:38.200
<v Speaker 1>A couple of pokes and pokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1338
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:43.230
<v Speaker 1>And then decide coyote your backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't finish that story.</v>

1339
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So the brooding chicken that was in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>cage,</v>

1340
00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:51.780
<v Speaker 1>she honey Dick my mast if into smashing </v>
<v Speaker 1>open the cage because the massive just </v>

1341
00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.770
<v Speaker 1>smashed the cage like she was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get at the cage.</v>

1342
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Like she was like where the chicken was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coyote,</v>

1343
00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:01.820
<v Speaker 1>the coyote was and my masters like I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and just smash the fucking thing </v>

1344
00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:05.411
<v Speaker 1>and tore it open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she was running out the back </v>

1345
00:58:05.411 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 1>yard with the chicken in her mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hop the fence.</v>

1346
00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 1>And I saw her hop the fence with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken in her mouth.</v>

1347
00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm living in the Goddamn Disney movie.</v>

1348
00:58:10.391 --> 00:58:11.590
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1349
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I just watched a coyote snatched chicken</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the.</v>

1350
00:58:14.261 --> 00:58:15.460
<v Speaker 1>From your yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1351
00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:17.020
<v Speaker 1>that's bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was wild?</v>

1352
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.780
<v Speaker 1>But the crazy thing is my fucking dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard over there.</v>

1353
00:58:19.781 --> 00:58:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is it guy?</v>

1355
00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.020
<v Speaker 1>animals are handled today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't really expect much more</v>

1359
00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:33.160
<v Speaker 1>from a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1361
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:37.420

<v Speaker 1>these stones.</v>

1362
00:58:37.421 --> 00:58:38.710
<v Speaker 1>What part of the world is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

1363
00:58:38.711 --> 00:58:40.060
<v Speaker 1>So people go look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in Peru,</v>

1364
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the name of the structures?</v>

1365
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:46.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like something tie you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1369
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:54.130

<v Speaker 1>That's not what we were.</v>

1370
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Just looking at it earlier though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1371
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:58.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole overstructured that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it looks like from the top.</v>

1372
00:58:58.030 --> 00:58:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I googled it.</v>

1373
00:58:58.891 --> 00:59:03.891
<v Speaker 1>And then it's a fortress to holy shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does look like aliens built it well</v>

1374
00:59:04.931 --> 00:59:08.620
<v Speaker 1>or super sophisticated man that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped out in a disaster.</v>

1375
00:59:08.621 --> 00:59:09.510
<v Speaker 1>That's more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1376
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:12.670
<v Speaker 1>but the crazy thing is how quickly then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>

1377
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:17.620
<v Speaker 1>how quickly then we came from some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ape man to what we are now.</v>

1378
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't been that long.</v>

1379
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1380
00:59:20.711 --> 00:59:22.230
<v Speaker 1>the amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long ago was that?</v>

1381
00:59:22.231 --> 00:59:27.231
<v Speaker 1>I think this was built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit was built like at least a </v>

1382
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 1>thousand years ago I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they know though.</v>

1383
00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:33.580
<v Speaker 1>See the problem is if you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get stuff from like something that </v>

1384
00:59:33.861 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 1>someone ate or it has to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon based thing.</v>

1385
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't test the stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can test some of the material in the</v>

1386
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:42.220
<v Speaker 1>stone or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1387
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:45.440
<v Speaker 1>like scratches on the stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in crevices and shit like that.</v>

1388
00:59:45.441 --> 00:59:50.441
<v Speaker 1>You can get stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they're around things that </v>

1389
00:59:50.441 --> 00:59:54.381
<v Speaker 1>would have been several thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 1>of man's advancing at that point a </v>

1390
00:59:54.381 --> 00:59:54.381
<v Speaker 1>hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1391
00:59:54.381 --> 00:59:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Wonder because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1392
00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say because I don't know </v>

1393
00:59:59.660 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 1>when it was actually built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when do they think it was built?</v>

1394
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.220
<v Speaker 1>So there's all these theories and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these uh,</v>

1395
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:03.730
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1396
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>fringe theories that push everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1397
01:00:06.741 --> 01:00:07.520
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way back.</v>

1398
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>And that stuff gets resisted a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the carbon dating though,</v>

1399
01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some,</v>

1400
01:00:12.201 --> 01:00:17.201
<v Speaker 1>in some cases occupied since 900,</v>
<v Speaker 1>900 occupied since $900.</v>

1401
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>900,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody moved in.</v>

1402
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then just said to until about the </v>

1403
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>13th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a long run.</v>

1404
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.370
<v Speaker 1>So who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who built it though?</v>

1405
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Do they know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When do they guess?</v>

1406
01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it does it say like what year it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was built or as you said,</v>

1407
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>occupied from 900.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean that's when they first </v>

1408
01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>moved in indicate the earliest </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation on the hilltop dates to about</v>

1409
01:00:38.961 --> 01:00:40.090
<v Speaker 1>900 seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1410
01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So wow.</v>

1411
01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I built it over 400 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like so more than a thousand </v>

1412
01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>years and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you know the jewels in years,</v>

1413
01:00:49.071 --> 01:00:54.071
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to wrap your head around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Jewish calendar goes back to like </v>

1414
01:00:54.071 --> 01:00:54.071
<v Speaker 1>5,700</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and I know.</v>

1415
01:00:54.071 --> 01:00:55.190
<v Speaker 1>So there's no nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1416
01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>So band has man had a lot of time to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sweet tech,</v>

1417
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>but 900.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1418
01:00:59.711 --> 01:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>It's so arbitrary that we started at </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero then start up again.</v>

1419
01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.790
<v Speaker 1>If you go backwards and you go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative numbers,</v>

1420
01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>like what's so stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So dumb Christians.</v>

1421
01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how we do that.</v>

1422
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1423
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean even with like temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no snapping on the metric system is so </v>

1424
01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:17.500
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stupid.</v>

1425
01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Like you go to places Neela Celsius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it's those 20 slash Celsius </v>

1426
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is 23 cells if you learned</v>

1427
01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>anything by though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1428
01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we should.</v>

1429
01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>We're all going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're all gonna die someday.</v>

1430
01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:33.410
<v Speaker 1>So winter had her shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

1431
01:01:33.411 --> 01:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them know our stupid shit,</v>

1432
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more sort of a we're,</v>

1433
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a real American movie.</v>

1434
01:01:41.651 --> 01:01:46.651
<v Speaker 1>Like they tried to switch over in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies to the metrics and people </v>

1435
01:01:46.651 --> 01:01:46.651
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you ain't learned French man.</v>

1436
01:01:46.651 --> 01:01:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it.</v>

1437
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I remember it being taught in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was in school.</v>

1438
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>They tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried soccer too.</v>

1439
01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pick it up now.</v>

1440
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Just maybe a little heat now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little bit,</v>

1441
01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.660
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

1442
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.460
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1443
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.560
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to me that stuff that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda what I love about America </v>

1444
01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>is that just like that we're not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with that.</v>

1445
01:02:06.081 --> 01:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't give a shit.</v>

1446
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1447
01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>The metric system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds fresh.</v>

1448
01:02:12.171 --> 01:02:17.171
<v Speaker 1>It sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a gay sister is made three </v>

1449
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.500
<v Speaker 1>gay math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1450
01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>We're Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

1451
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.200
<v Speaker 2>better though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's intense.</v>

1452
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Why are we doing 12?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's better and,</v>

1453
01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:29.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is confusing when somebody tells </v>

1454
01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:29.260
<v Speaker 2>you a metric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1455
01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:29.260
<v Speaker 2>they say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1456
01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a leader like leaders of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always aura.</v>

1457
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:33.170
<v Speaker 2>If you drive in Europe and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the,</v>

1458
01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:38.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spin on winner and that it has the </v>

1459
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.210
<v Speaker 2>conversion on there for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whenever we,</v>

1460
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:39.840
<v Speaker 2>you'd say like 12 inches is a foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why 12?</v>

1461
01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1462
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Why did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why'd you arbitrarily.</v>

1463
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:49.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's only us and a few other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries that still accept that.</v>

1464
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that 12 inches.</v>

1465
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.120
<v Speaker 2>How many people do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they accept it in Canada?</v>

1466
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Canada's metric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1467
01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:57.350
<v Speaker 2>And then three feet a yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like thanks.</v>

1468
01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.570
<v Speaker 2>Canada is metric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1469
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.870
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most places are metric.</v>

1470
01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend from Australia,</v>

1471
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.490
<v Speaker 2>my friend Adam Green tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he talks in meters.</v>

1472
01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.550
<v Speaker 2>It was about hunting 20 meters on what </v>
<v Speaker 2>that means.</v>

1473
01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Nothing like how many football fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How far is that?</v>

1474
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.140
<v Speaker 2>There's only two distances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand school bus,</v>

1475
01:03:16.141 --> 01:03:21.141
<v Speaker 2>length of football field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way things have been taught to </v>

1476
01:03:21.141 --> 01:03:21.141
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1477
01:03:21.141 --> 01:03:21.570
<v Speaker 2>How many meters are in a real unit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>measurement?</v>

1478
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Like a real one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an American one.</v>

1479
01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:27.000
<v Speaker 2>How many meters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many feet run that fucking meter?</v>

1480
01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:30.580
<v Speaker 2>You have a fucking goofy ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me that.</v>

1481
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a yacht.</v>

1482
01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what a yacht.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eighty yards.</v>

1483
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Thirty yards away and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when you're in school,</v>

1484
01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:40.590
<v Speaker 2>the only way they teach you about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance of things.</v>

1485
01:03:40.591 --> 01:03:43.020
<v Speaker 2>His stack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>school buses or football field,</v>

1486
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:46.130
<v Speaker 2>like the moon is 147 billion football </v>
<v Speaker 2>fields,</v>

1487
01:03:46.131 --> 01:03:51.131
<v Speaker 2>you know like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I understand whatever the distance </v>

1488
01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:51.131
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's always.</v>

1489
01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:52.560
<v Speaker 2>It's always converted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two football fields at school.</v>

1490
01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:53.730
<v Speaker 2>Buses are always right.</v>

1491
01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a student,</v>

1492
01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:00.140
<v Speaker 2>that's all I remember ever in science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes taking school buses and going </v>

1493
01:04:00.391 --> 01:04:01.890
<v Speaker 2>from here to Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1494
01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like 97 million school buses.</v>

1495
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:06.810
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>School buses,</v>

1496
01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.750
<v Speaker 2>that's constant unit of measurement and </v>
<v Speaker 2>football fields.</v>

1497
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.530
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1498
01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:14.100
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trick of how far does she live?</v>

1499
01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Like two football fields with three </v>
<v Speaker 2>school buses.</v>

1500
01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:18.060
<v Speaker 2>We could walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could.</v>

1501
01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:20.610
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cold.</v>

1502
01:04:20.611 --> 01:04:22.680
<v Speaker 2>So how cold is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty four Celsius.</v>

1503
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a 23 Celsius is probably like,</v>

1504
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.100
<v Speaker 2>is that like 70 degrees?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1505
01:04:29.101 --> 01:04:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I literally have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a little bit about kilos,</v>

1506
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:38.210
<v Speaker 2>but very little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the limit is 75 slash 2175 slash </v>

1507
01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:40.620
<v Speaker 2>24 slash 75.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1508
01:04:40.621 --> 01:04:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I'll remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And remember that.</v>

1509
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:44.220
<v Speaker 2>And that way if it gets to like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go,</v>

1510
01:04:44.221 --> 01:04:49.221
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be hot as zero Celsius is 32 </v>

1511
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're zero is freezing.</v>

1512
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Zero is our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's freezing.</v>

1513
01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But our 40 below is the same as their 40</v>

1514
01:04:57.481 --> 01:05:00.000
<v Speaker 2>below.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do another math trick.</v>

1515
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:05.030
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine fifth Celsius plus 32 to nine.</v>

1516
01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Fifth Celsius plus 32.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>

1517
01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you do nine?</v>

1518
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost a half.</v>

1519
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.660
<v Speaker 2>A little bit under somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of you.</v>

1520
01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Fuck one of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody.</v>

1521
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:18.030
<v Speaker 2>We need to figure out who's</v>

1522
01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:19.890
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's got a simpler thing that.</v>

1523
01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Who's got a simpler thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of here with your.</v>

1524
01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.750
<v Speaker 1>With your fair to mentally switch over </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Celsius,</v>

1525
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>but zero Celsius is freezing in 32 </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fahrenheit is freezing.</v>

1526
01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just offset by 32 </v>

1527
01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:38.360
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something happens around 40.</v>

1528
01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become the same.</v>

1529
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it maintains for very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long or degrees.</v>

1530
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Get Colder and I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1531
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.920
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just zero makes more sense as the </v>

1532
01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.491
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird like how the fuck is if our </v>

1533
01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:54.630
<v Speaker 1>32 is the Celsius zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck is it?</v>

1534
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>The same thing at 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Below.</v>

1535
01:05:55.931 --> 01:05:57.280
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

1536
01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Here's another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

1537
01:05:58.481 --> 01:06:03.481
<v Speaker 1>How are you not just adding 30 Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said gave you the gay.</v>

1538
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.760
<v Speaker 1>My friend gave me this tip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Double the centigrade temperature.</v>

1539
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Subtract the first digit of the result </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the result and then add 32 to that.</v>

1540
01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aren't you really?</v>

1541
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 23.</v>

1542
01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1543
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>So 46.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what do we do with the first </v>

1544
01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>digit of the result?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is right there.</v>

1545
01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:27.241
<v Speaker 1>So 23 Celsius equals 74 Fahrenheit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three c plus c times two is 46 </v>

1546
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.710
<v Speaker 1>minus the first digit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So minus the 4:46</v>

1547
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:37.740
<v Speaker 1>minus four is 42,</v>
<v Speaker 1>42 plus 32 is 74 works.</v>

1548
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Hey fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1549
01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:43.590
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the easy one.</v>

1550
01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:49.520
<v Speaker 1>But what's amazing to me is like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet someone that lets you know like</v>

1551
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:54.810
<v Speaker 1>what you just talked to them about math </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can do like math problems in </v>

1552
01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.230
<v Speaker 1>their head and you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I am a baby math baby.</v>

1553
01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a math baby.</v>

1554
01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

1555
01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:00.280
<v Speaker 1>There's people that were like looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that going,</v>

1556
01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:01.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>

1557
01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:06.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the obvious thing in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 slash 74 degrees.</v>

1558
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll have moments where like I had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

1559
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I was just laying in bed in an insomniac</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1560
01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Like I offered them in and I was going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you do?</v>

1561
01:07:15.461 --> 01:07:20.461
<v Speaker 1>Long Division,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's like I haven't done long </v>

1562
01:07:20.461 --> 01:07:24.241
<v Speaker 1>division and I and I tried doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and I got it wrong and then I </v>

1563
01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:25.390
<v Speaker 1>have to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1564
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll be like,</v>

1565
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:27.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was like,</v>

1566
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:28.120
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1567
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:33.300
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was confusing and I haven't done it </v>

1568
01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.870
<v Speaker 1>in was the last time you put out a pen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and paper to do a long division dude.</v>

1569
01:07:34.871 --> 01:07:38.050
<v Speaker 1>I barely do the ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tip part thing,</v>

1570
01:07:38.051 --> 01:07:38.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1571
01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:42.070
<v Speaker 1>just met down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just double it and it moved.</v>

1572
01:07:42.071 --> 01:07:45.130
<v Speaker 1>The decimal adding sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put that on my instagram recently.</v>

1573
01:07:45.131 --> 01:07:47.800
<v Speaker 1>It was a depression to get on into mit </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 18,</v>

1574
01:07:47.801 --> 01:07:48.550
<v Speaker 1>69.</v>

1575
01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really just the order of </v>

1576
01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:53.590
<v Speaker 1>operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can figure this out,</v>

1577
01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:57.480
<v Speaker 1>let e equals eight and the following </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation and there's a bunch of tough.</v>

1578
01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.530
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a numerical value of the equation.</v>

1579
01:07:59.531 --> 01:08:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Hint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a mentioned,</v>

1580
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:06.150
<v Speaker 1>as mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the order of operations </v>

1581
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.150
<v Speaker 1>will be pretty important here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scroll down to read the answer.</v>

1582
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.550
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people did not get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people kind of got it right.</v>

1583
01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

1584
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:14.220
<v Speaker 1>The answer's 15 to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Are you a well versed in these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>equations?</v>

1586
01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I remembered how to do it pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

1587
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>That's like a friend showed it to me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1588
01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how to do any of that.</v>

1589
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Interesting checkmark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm square root,</v>

1590
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:28.730
<v Speaker 1>fairly positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never learned any of that.</v>

1591
01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Fairly positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a good example.</v>

1592
01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a completely illiterate when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to that and that's a cube root.</v>

1593
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>No one knew what that was either a cube </v>
<v Speaker 1>root.</v>

1594
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second exponent.</v>

1595
01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1596
01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:47.321
<v Speaker 1>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally was just nothing I could do </v>

1597
01:08:47.321 --> 01:08:47.321
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1598
01:08:47.321 --> 01:08:49.710
<v Speaker 1>that's what's so fascinating about </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and that's why you know,</v>

1599
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>if anybody tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not all good,</v>

1600
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:56.650
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating by society is that there's </v>

1601
01:08:56.650 --> 01:08:58.460
<v Speaker 1>so many different people with so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different abilities and there are people</v>

1602
01:08:58.461 --> 01:09:02.660
<v Speaker 1>that gravitate towards that and are </v>
<v Speaker 1>wizards at mathematics and there's other</v>

1603
01:09:02.661 --> 01:09:04.550
<v Speaker 1>people like you and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're good at talking shit.</v>

1604
01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was guy.</v>

1605
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.880
<v Speaker 1>We live in a world where that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1606
01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1607
01:09:09.171 --> 01:09:13.210
<v Speaker 1>I often think about how useless I'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like if the apocalypse goes down,</v>

1608
01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.870
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be like the dude you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to hang out with,</v>

1609
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:16.250
<v Speaker 1>but the apocalypse goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done,</v>

1610
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:17.960
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the apocalypse goes down,</v>

1611
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:18.860
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens.</v>

1612
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:20.420
<v Speaker 1>You want it to happen in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>

1613
01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.000
<v Speaker 1>so it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1614
01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1615
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:24.800
<v Speaker 1>if a meteor hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want it to hit your house.</v>

1616
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:27.650
<v Speaker 1>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's an earthquake post apocalyptic.</v>

1617
01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>society say we both survived it and we </v>

1618
01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:32.670
<v Speaker 1>living in a shanty town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind of.</v>

1619
01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:33.980
<v Speaker 1>You have skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hunt,</v>

1620
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:39.550
<v Speaker 1>you can do shit to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can teach you the things that I know </v>

1621
01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:40.250
<v Speaker 1>how pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring no value.</v>

1622
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Let's eat first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would figure it out after a couple </v>

1623
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:46.400
<v Speaker 1>of weeks and fix things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how to fix things.</v>

1624
01:09:46.401 --> 01:09:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to hunt with a bow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrow.</v>

1625
01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:51.200
<v Speaker 1>You had figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you use a gun ever?</v>

1626
01:09:51.201 --> 01:09:52.790
<v Speaker 1>You've ever used it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore rifle,</v>

1627
01:09:52.791 --> 01:09:54.190
<v Speaker 1>but I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

1628
01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:57.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a better way to get meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more accurate.</v>

1629
01:09:57.230 --> 01:10:00.680
<v Speaker 1>You can do it from further away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1630
01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:05.720
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't require nearly as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline still requires a lot of </v>

1631
01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.161
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not nearly as much as a bone marrow </v>

1632
01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:09.161
<v Speaker 1>donor.</v>

1633
01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:09.161
<v Speaker 1>It's just cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder,</v>

1634
01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:11.870
<v Speaker 1>it's way more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's other people that use a</v>

1635
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:17.110
<v Speaker 1>traditional bow and they think that guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>like me are pussies because I use a </v>

1636
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.450
<v Speaker 1>compound bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean like Lego last bow,</v>

1637
01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:22.400
<v Speaker 1>like just one Robin Hood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like a lot of them use recurves,</v>

1638
01:10:22.401 --> 01:10:25.400
<v Speaker 1>but some don't even use recursive old </v>
<v Speaker 1>school stick bow.</v>

1639
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1640
01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:29.210
<v Speaker 1>There's people that like want to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>things tougher on themselves.</v>

1641
01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.730
<v Speaker 1>They want a bigger and bigger challenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1642
01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.880
<v Speaker 1>it gets into this weird territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So w like some people said like you </v>

1643
01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.580
<v Speaker 1>should only hunt with a rifle because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the most deadly thing that</v>

1644
01:10:40.581 --> 01:10:45.581
<v Speaker 1>you could use in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so you shouldn't use a bow and </v>

1645
01:10:45.581 --> 01:10:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Arrow because you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not using a bow and Arrow because</v>

1646
01:10:47.391 --> 01:10:50.150
<v Speaker 1>it's more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just using it.</v>

1647
01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:52.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's more of a challenge to use.</v>

1648
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:52.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1649
01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:57.770
<v Speaker 1>let's have a bastardization of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original idea of what hunting is right </v>

1650
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:58.100
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people feel like that,</v>

1651
01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:59.980
<v Speaker 1>but then other people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1652
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a different kind of hunting.</v>

1653
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:05.870
<v Speaker 1>If you do it correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have pretty much,</v>

1654
01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:09.530
<v Speaker 1>you have less likelihood of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do it correctly,</v>

1655
01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:11.750
<v Speaker 1>you have just as much of a likelihood of</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing the animal.</v>

1656
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:14.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like it's an unethical thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's done correctly,</v>

1657
01:11:14.851 --> 01:11:16.800
<v Speaker 1>just requires way more work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1658
01:11:16.801 --> 01:11:18.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like you said,</v>

1659
01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:19.000
<v Speaker 1>more skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1660
01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:24.050
<v Speaker 1>But if you were in an apocalyptic </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario where we had to go out and get </v>

1661
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:27.381
<v Speaker 1>food and you and I went out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could teach you what you need to know </v>

1662
01:11:27.381 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 1>pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stupid.</v>

1663
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1664
01:11:28.031 --> 01:11:30.570
<v Speaker 1>did the hard part would be learning how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be accurate with a bow.</v>

1665
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.950
<v Speaker 1>That will be the hardest I want to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1666
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I was actually going texted me one day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

1667
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:35.300
<v Speaker 1>what's a good starter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bo Got,</v>

1668
01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:40.460
<v Speaker 1>want to learn how to shoot a bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real good means a bunch of good </v>

1669
01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:40.530
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use a white.</v>

1670
01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of great ones.</v>

1671
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:47.931
<v Speaker 1>Like Matthew's makes great bows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a bunch of companies that make </v>

1672
01:11:47.931 --> 01:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>recurve bows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those which are fun to practice.</v>

1673
01:11:48.331 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Like Dunkin has a recurve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does,</v>

1674
01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shoots him in his backyard.</v>

1675
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:52.830
<v Speaker 1>He loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1676
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fun thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1677
01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Even if you never want to ever shoot an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and you don't even want to eat </v>

1678
01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.650
<v Speaker 1>eggs and just straight up Vegan like </v>
<v Speaker 1>archery's a fun thing to do.</v>

1679
01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like a weird kind of a meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1680
01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:10.040
<v Speaker 1>like something happens when you're at </v>
<v Speaker 1>full draw and you're like holding on </v>

1681
01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Arrow and then you release that Arrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just sales right into the target.</v>

1682
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:15.780
<v Speaker 1>It gives you this weird charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like your,</v>

1683
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:21.110
<v Speaker 1>you're doing like almost like a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga with your mind and your body </v>

1684
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:23.010
<v Speaker 1>together because like everything has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be perfectly still.</v>

1685
01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 1>And then on the release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it goes in the right spot,</v>

1686
01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you get this big burst of satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

1687
01:12:30.061 --> 01:12:35.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something and you can't think </v>

1688
01:12:35.061 --> 01:12:35.100
<v Speaker 1>about anything else other than the shop </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're attempting to make.</v>

1689
01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to keep your eyes on what </v>

1690
01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:41.601
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a mind thing going on with </v>

1691
01:12:41.601 --> 01:12:41.601
<v Speaker 1>archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

1692
01:12:41.601 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I do think though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shooting a gun is like that.</v>

1693
01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Not probably not as intense or </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditative,</v>

1694
01:12:45.871 --> 01:12:48.500
<v Speaker 1>but there's something like it when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>

1695
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why anyone wants a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1696
01:12:50.101 --> 01:12:52.810
<v Speaker 1>have you ever shot one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1697
01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't own a gun.</v>

1698
01:12:54.181 --> 01:12:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in New York City.</v>

1699
01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not really been an option for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1700
01:12:57.930 --> 01:12:58.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1701
01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:00.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been on it.</v>

1702
01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was when I was in Afghanistan when </v>

1703
01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.131
<v Speaker 1>some of those dudes and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take us to the shooting range and we </v>

1704
01:13:07.131 --> 01:13:07.131
<v Speaker 1>were shooting all their different ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

1705
01:13:07.131 --> 01:13:08.960
<v Speaker 1>it was a war zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not getting into my,</v>

1706
01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:10.800
<v Speaker 1>my ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1707
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.060
<v Speaker 1>not a huge fan of aa or fifteens for 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old.</v>

1708
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:18.090
<v Speaker 1>But I get why people want guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get why people want to own guns.</v>

1709
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:18.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1710
01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that's like the argument that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1711
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I wish people would just like take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat and go.</v>

1712
01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I like you just said about the abortion </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1713
01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like it's like that's okay.</v>

1714
01:13:28.711 --> 01:13:33.711
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you feel that way and then it's that </v>

1715
01:13:33.711 --> 01:13:33.711
<v Speaker 1>way it becomes less of a conversation.</v>

1716
01:13:33.711 --> 01:13:33.711
<v Speaker 1>But we gotta get rid of guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of a conversation about like,</v>

1717
01:13:33.711 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just have to tidy,</v>

1718
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:37.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe just tidy up a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>components of it,</v>

1719
01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:42.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of definitely have to figure </v>

1720
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:43.980
<v Speaker 1>out how to stop people from buying them </v>
<v Speaker 1>legally when they're crazy.</v>

1721
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Well there's something wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1722
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean here's a question,</v>

1723
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:54.350
<v Speaker 1>how many of these mass shootings were </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually done by someone who was in the </v>

1724
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:55.080
<v Speaker 1>NRA?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1725
01:13:55.081 --> 01:13:57.470
<v Speaker 1>according to the people on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>

1726
01:13:57.750 --> 01:14:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I don't know that that's out</v>

1727
01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:03.690
<v Speaker 1>there right now on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I wanted to ask you if,</v>

1728
01:14:03.691 --> 01:14:06.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be a Russian Bot for probably</v>

1729
01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:10.290
<v Speaker 1>just spreading that fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag fake news.</v>

1730
01:14:10.770 --> 01:14:11.700
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

1731
01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.500
<v Speaker 2>see if that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense to you?</v>

1732
01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's an interesting question.</v>

1733
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that is and then it gets weird,</v>

1734
01:14:18.581 --> 01:14:21.250
<v Speaker 2>like why is everybody attacking the NRA?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1735
01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I know they were the ones who are making</v>
<v Speaker 2>it easier to access these guys.</v>

1736
01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:29.580
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones a cock blocking any </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation getting done because they </v>

1737
01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.850
<v Speaker 2>have paying so much money to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressmen and senators.</v>

1738
01:14:30.851 --> 01:14:35.851
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you saw that Lieutenant Governor </v>

1739
01:14:35.851 --> 01:14:35.851
<v Speaker 2>Delta said they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to.</v>

1740
01:14:35.851 --> 01:14:36.910
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to be honest with you man.</v>

1741
01:14:36.911 --> 01:14:41.911
<v Speaker 2>Like I had no idea you got like your </v>
<v Speaker 2>flights are cheaper because you want a </v>

1742
01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:41.911
<v Speaker 2>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1743
01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:46.201
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just getting ripped off on </v>

1744
01:14:46.201 --> 01:14:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Delta because I don't own a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what a fucking bullshit thing where</v>

1745
01:14:47.261 --> 01:14:50.230
<v Speaker 2>you could actually own a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was just like,</v>

1746
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.040
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1747
01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:52.990
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know the discounts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1748
01:14:52.991 --> 01:14:56.290
<v Speaker 2>It was just such a weird thing to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and now the delta pulled that.</v>

1749
01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.610
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1750
01:14:57.611 --> 01:15:01.660
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my passive mentality cost more money</v>

1751
01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:07.410
<v Speaker 2>is so the thought is that the NRA has </v>
<v Speaker 2>made it more easy for crazy people to </v>

1752
01:15:08.381 --> 01:15:11.470
<v Speaker 2>access these guns and so we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1753
01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:17.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that like we can't raise the </v>

1754
01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:17.180
<v Speaker 2>age to 21.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1755
01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.550
<v Speaker 2>if you can go to war at 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't you,</v>

1756
01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe raising,</v>

1757
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1758
01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:21.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1759
01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:26.940
<v Speaker 2>it seems like when you go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting trained by the military </v>

1760
01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 2>versus when you have just 18 and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk into a concern and walk out with an</v>

1761
01:15:28.421 --> 01:15:30.490
<v Speaker 2>ar 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody taught you how to use it.</v>

1762
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Literally just bought a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange,</v>

1763
01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:34.760
<v Speaker 2>like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1764
01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:37.150
<v Speaker 2>my thought on it has always been like </v>
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

1765
01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have a driver's license for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a car,</v>

1766
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.480
<v Speaker 2>but then if you have enough to drive a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bus or like a truck,</v>

1767
01:15:43.481 --> 01:15:45.070
<v Speaker 2>you have to get a different class of </v>
<v Speaker 2>driver's license.</v>

1768
01:15:45.071 --> 01:15:46.780
<v Speaker 2>You have to get like a class D or Class </v>
<v Speaker 2>C,</v>

1769
01:15:46.781 --> 01:15:51.781
<v Speaker 2>whatever the next level is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's different classes of driver's </v>

1770
01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:51.781
<v Speaker 2>license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't just go buy a big rig and</v>

1771
01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:56.581
<v Speaker 2>start driving it around the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get a license for driving </v>

1772
01:15:56.581 --> 01:15:57.250
<v Speaker 2>a big rig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means you have to go to school,</v>

1773
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:59.170
<v Speaker 2>learn how to drive one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn how to park one,</v>

1774
01:15:59.171 --> 01:16:04.171
<v Speaker 2>all the things that have fuck it takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to prove it to an expert </v>

1775
01:16:04.171 --> 01:16:04.171
<v Speaker 2>and you have to talk to her about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday.</v>

1776
01:16:04.171 --> 01:16:06.970
<v Speaker 2>So why not just have it be that simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is you want own handgun,</v>

1777
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:11.080
<v Speaker 2>just get you get the class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a handgun license and you take your road</v>

1778
01:16:11.081 --> 01:16:13.030
<v Speaker 2>test which is low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to load it,</v>

1779
01:16:13.031 --> 01:16:14.890
<v Speaker 2>know how to clean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the rules become.</v>

1780
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:18.580
<v Speaker 2>And then it takes four hours to pass the</v>
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

1781
01:16:18.581 --> 01:16:21.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like 10 written questions and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1782
01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:23.080
<v Speaker 2>And then you get the license and get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun and it's yours.</v>

1783
01:16:23.081 --> 01:16:24.880
<v Speaker 2>And then next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next class you.</v>

1784
01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:26.170
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to own a shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1785
01:16:26.171 --> 01:16:27.820
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Class B shotgun license.</v>

1786
01:16:27.821 --> 01:16:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Take the class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think fine and then you get to like</v>

1787
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:31.880
<v Speaker 2>the Ar 15 level and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1788
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.520
<v Speaker 2>now you have an instructor looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy.</v>

1789
01:16:34.521 --> 01:16:37.570
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy doesn't seem a little,</v>

1790
01:16:37.571 --> 01:16:39.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a little bit like of a dead.</v>

1791
01:16:39.141 --> 01:16:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1792
01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:42.090
<v Speaker 2>like maybe we'd all be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1793
01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe we'd double check this guy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1794
01:16:43.781 --> 01:16:44.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can,</v>

1795
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:50.110
<v Speaker 2>you can get a sense of people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that environment or if it's a five </v>

1796
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.920
<v Speaker 2>question question thing you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer,</v>

1797
01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.000
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1798
01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.680
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what are your hobbies?</v>

1799
01:16:53.681 --> 01:16:56.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's like eating rabbits alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1800
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.680
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn man,</v>

1801
01:16:56.681 --> 01:16:58.810
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hide those answers though.</v>

1802
01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I real crazy person.</v>

1803
01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:05.850
<v Speaker 2>A real psychologists can spot a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy person based on how they hide </v>

1804
01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:06.140
<v Speaker 2>their answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychologist,</v>

1805
01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:09.490
<v Speaker 2>do you think from the written word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you could divide tasks.</v>

1806
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I think you could</v>

1807
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.260
<v Speaker 1>devise a written test where someone will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

1808
01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:17.320
<v Speaker 1>this is an alarming answer to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>question because it references his </v>

1809
01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.200
<v Speaker 1>mother and it has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this bathrooms or whatever.</v>

1810
01:17:18.201 --> 01:17:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking weird,</v>

1811
01:17:19.161 --> 01:17:24.161
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I looked at that sounds really </v>

1812
01:17:24.161 --> 01:17:24.161
<v Speaker 1>unappealing to people and I get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were met,</v>

1813
01:17:24.161 --> 01:17:24.650
<v Speaker 1>but that wouldn't be banning any guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be.</v>

1814
01:17:24.651 --> 01:17:29.651
<v Speaker 1>You can have any gun you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to like do a very basic </v>

1815
01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:35.140
<v Speaker 1>rudimentary seven question test and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a firing range with a pro for two </v>

1816
01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.740
<v Speaker 1>hours and he has to make sure you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>

1817
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:40.190
<v Speaker 1>The NRAS perspective is they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to give an inch.</v>

1818
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if they give an inch,</v>

1819
01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:44.360
<v Speaker 1>they feel like the ultimate is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just going to lose ground,</v>

1820
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:45.820
<v Speaker 1>are going to lose more grounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more ground.</v>

1821
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:46.940
<v Speaker 1>What's the slippery slope for?</v>

1822
01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1823
01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:48.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1824
01:17:48.041 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1825
01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.250
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever anything happens.</v>

1826
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Like now more than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are demanding some sort </v>

1827
01:17:57.550 --> 01:18:01.691
<v Speaker 1>of a change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there has to be some sort of a </v>

1828
01:18:01.691 --> 01:18:02.240
<v Speaker 1>chain says 75 percent of the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants some kind of change.</v>

1829
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Even trump to raise the age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it won't happen because the </v>

1830
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:09.800
<v Speaker 1>legislation won't pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things where I,</v>

1831
01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I seriously doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying this is a good or a bad </v>

1832
01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.711
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I seriously doubt if we didn't have </v>

1833
01:18:17.711 --> 01:18:21.401
<v Speaker 1>guns and all of a sudden guns became a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and we all had to vote as to </v>

1834
01:18:22.551 --> 01:18:25.010
<v Speaker 1>whether or not everyone should be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have guns.</v>

1835
01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:29.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would have passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would pass away.</v>

1836
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:33.710
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting though because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists now and now you know,</v>

1837
01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:39.280
<v Speaker 1>most politicians are in favor of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because some are in favor of limiting it</v>

1838
01:18:39.351 --> 01:18:40.490
<v Speaker 1>slightly.</v>

1839
01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a lot of money.</v>

1840
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of money from the NRA,</v>

1841
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:47.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying you shouldn't be able</v>

1842
01:18:47.691 --> 01:18:50.450
<v Speaker 1>to have guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who wants us to have guns?</v>

1843
01:18:50.451 --> 01:18:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Like if you just going to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic,</v>

1844
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:55.370
<v Speaker 1>like what percentage of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually want everybody to have guns and</v>

1845
01:18:55.371 --> 01:19:00.371
<v Speaker 1>what don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just out of pure curiosity with no </v>

1846
01:19:00.371 --> 01:19:01.160
<v Speaker 1>judgment percentage went everyone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have guns.</v>

1847
01:19:01.230 --> 01:19:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I want people to be able to have guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what percentage thinks that no one </v>

1848
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:09.581
<v Speaker 1>should have guns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you add the site Australia or </v>

1849
01:19:09.581 --> 01:19:09.740
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the guns.</v>

1850
01:19:09.741 --> 01:19:14.741
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a much smaller group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that don't want anyone to have a </v>

1851
01:19:14.811 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think so.</v>

1852
01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I think there's probably like 14 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country that thinks we'd no one </v>

1853
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:22.060
<v Speaker 1>should have a gun.</v>

1854
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the vast majority think we need </v>

1855
01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:27.200
<v Speaker 1>some new sort of regulations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions.</v>

1856
01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just reasonable,</v>

1857
01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:31.820
<v Speaker 1>reasonable restrict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think anyone is saying.</v>

1858
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a right that's embedded in the DNA,</v>

1859
01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.720
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you like it or not,</v>

1860
01:19:38.721 --> 01:19:40.160
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

1861
01:19:40.161 --> 01:19:43.880
<v Speaker 1>And like that's very important to day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just stays that way forever.</v>

1862
01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that to me their arguments can </v>

1863
01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:49.050
<v Speaker 1>be made about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1864
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:50.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1865
01:19:50.131 --> 01:19:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people really understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>how everyone,</v>

1866
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:57.610
<v Speaker 1>how everyone lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's so many different </v>

1867
01:19:57.610 --> 01:19:57.800
<v Speaker 1>lifestyles in this country that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1868
01:19:57.801 --> 01:20:02.801
<v Speaker 1>I think you have a perception of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>say like a suburban just outside of </v>

1869
01:20:02.801 --> 01:20:06.400
<v Speaker 1>metropolis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a mom that doesn't realize that </v>

1870
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:06.620
<v Speaker 1>for some people in the country when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>dial nine,</v>

1871
01:20:06.621 --> 01:20:07.130
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1872
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:10.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like a 50 minute response time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1873
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:12.720
<v Speaker 1>like it's not like there's like a local </v>
<v Speaker 1>firehouse and they could,</v>

1874
01:20:12.721 --> 01:20:17.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people feel like I have to be able </v>

1875
01:20:17.721 --> 01:20:19.170
<v Speaker 1>to protect my family because I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily rely on the police to come.</v>

1876
01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1877
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does happen.</v>

1878
01:20:22.201 --> 01:20:27.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that like there's a </v>

1879
01:20:27.201 --> 01:20:27.201
<v Speaker 1>component to people's fears of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1880
01:20:27.201 --> 01:20:29.670
<v Speaker 1>society on folding and whatever that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetuated.</v>

1881
01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:34.671
<v Speaker 1>But I actually believe that people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dawn of time have always believed </v>

1882
01:20:34.671 --> 01:20:36.360
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be the last ones on </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

1883
01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:37.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that,</v>

1884
01:20:37.571 --> 01:20:42.571
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to live through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse because I really think it's </v>

1885
01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:43.170
<v Speaker 1>all about Fomo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of missing out.</v>

1886
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's this feeling of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I die everyone else should die.</v>

1887
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:52.250
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool shit doesn't keep happening once </v>

1888
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1889
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:54.930
<v Speaker 1>but I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people have this instinct </v>

1890
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:54.930
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die with everyone else.</v>

1891
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:54.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1892
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:56.750
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die and then we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to forget about you and then cool shit's</v>

1893
01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:57.510
<v Speaker 1>going to keep happening.</v>

1894
01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.640
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I left the daily show,</v>

1895
01:20:59.641 --> 01:21:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I felt that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1896
01:21:00.331 --> 01:21:00.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1897
01:21:00.811 --> 01:21:03.180
<v Speaker 1>good luck at the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kept going.</v>

1898
01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1899
01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:04.660
<v Speaker 1>they're fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1900
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:06.430
<v Speaker 1>my life has no purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1901
01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that.</v>

1902
01:21:07.621 --> 01:21:11.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's that feeling of like you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want the sea.</v>

1903
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:12.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like when a football player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1904
01:21:12.751 --> 01:21:15.000
<v Speaker 1>any athlete leaves a team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1905
01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:16.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like good luck winning without me.</v>

1906
01:21:16.831 --> 01:21:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And then they win the super bowl the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next year.</v>

1907
01:21:18.091 --> 01:21:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1908
01:21:18.391 --> 01:21:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you were the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Shockey,</v>

1909
01:21:19.951 --> 01:21:24.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think that applies to the </v>

1910
01:21:24.951 --> 01:21:26.811
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the apocalypse is people </v>

1911
01:21:26.811 --> 01:21:29.151
<v Speaker 1>understanding and knowing in their head </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're fragile and that they're </v>

1912
01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:33.321
<v Speaker 1>very environment is fragile and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were lucky that it stays the way it is </v>

1913
01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:36.201
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the more we learned about </v>

1914
01:21:36.201 --> 01:21:36.300
<v Speaker 1>supervolcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroidal impacts,</v>

1915
01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:38.040
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tsunamis,</v>

1916
01:21:38.041 --> 01:21:39.960
<v Speaker 1>all the crazy shit that can happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1917
01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:43.470
<v Speaker 1>the more we realize how fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly fragile we are.</v>

1918
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:48.470
<v Speaker 1>So we're always worried about the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that happens because there could </v>

1919
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:52.221
<v Speaker 1>be a big thing that can happen if some </v>
<v Speaker 1>super volcano blows and there's ash that</v>

1920
01:21:52.711 --> 01:21:57.240
<v Speaker 1>covers the sun or blocks out the sun and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lose all our crops.</v>

1921
01:21:57.290 --> 01:22:00.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like a new shortages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent possible.</v>

1922
01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Totally earthquakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking asteroidal impacts all that </v>

1923
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Shit's 100 million asteroid hitting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth or not hideous.</v>

1924
01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:09.590
<v Speaker 1>It's just up to fucking what's floating </v>
<v Speaker 1>around in.</v>

1925
01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if people have been alive,</v>

1926
01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:16.050
<v Speaker 1>if human beings have been what we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>now for how many thousands of years,</v>

1927
01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:17.460
<v Speaker 1>what is it like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1928
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:18.360
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

1929
01:22:18.361 --> 01:22:20.480
<v Speaker 1>No more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think more than that.</v>

1930
01:22:20.481 --> 01:22:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're sick about modern humans,</v>

1931
01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:24.740
<v Speaker 1>modern humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern.</v>

1932
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:26.820
<v Speaker 1>You want to say like 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1933
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense for modern humans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1934
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably wrong though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's mainly because it depends </v>

1935
01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:34.760
<v Speaker 1>on what we're calling modern.</v>

1936
01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Like is there a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

1937
01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we call modern like a,</v>

1938
01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:43.230
<v Speaker 1>a society that has like an African </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy and trade system,</v>

1939
01:22:43.481 --> 01:22:44.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

1940
01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.870
<v Speaker 1>trade roads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>

1941
01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.870
<v Speaker 1>shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1942
01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:48.510
<v Speaker 1>When it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we got?</v>

1943
01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Stone tools was two and a half million </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone tool,</v>

1944
01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:52.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1945
01:22:52.981 --> 01:22:57.981
<v Speaker 1>but that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw an orangutan at the zoo using a </v>

1946
01:22:57.981 --> 01:22:59.430
<v Speaker 1>stick to try to get bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the next thing says a modern man is</v>

1947
01:22:59.431 --> 01:23:00.720
<v Speaker 1>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1948
01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1949
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guess 200,000</v>

1950
01:23:04.561 --> 01:23:09.561
<v Speaker 1>years ago they look just like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a homo sapiens pretty close to </v>

1951
01:23:09.561 --> 01:23:09.760
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1952
01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet if you thought a woman for 200,000</v>

1953
01:23:13.511 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

1954
01:23:14.201 --> 01:23:14.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's hot.</v>

1955
01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:15.460
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

1956
01:23:15.461 --> 01:23:19.690
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1957
01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.390
<v Speaker 1>That's a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a long time ago.</v>

1958
01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Are you swiping right?</v>

1959
01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.540
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking up.</v>

1960
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I was just googling piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1961
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy notion when you really </v>

1962
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 1>think of 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1963
01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:36.220
<v Speaker 1>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago we weren't even people.</v>

1964
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:41.460
<v Speaker 1>We were some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other thing that became people </v>

1965
01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:41.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to become?</v>

1966
01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like,</v>

1967
01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:43.240
<v Speaker 1>like I like when you go back to 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1968
01:23:43.241 --> 01:23:45.880
<v Speaker 1>it feels like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1969
01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:49.390
<v Speaker 1>that's like pretty close to like caveman</v>
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>

1970
01:23:50.370 --> 01:23:52.730
<v Speaker 1>This caveman I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really crits,</v>

1971
01:23:52.731 --> 01:23:54.460
<v Speaker 1>not like ape man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

1972
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like super primitive,</v>

1973
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:59.620
<v Speaker 1>primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's modern human I guess.</v>

1974
01:23:59.930 --> 01:24:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was revised something recently that</v>

1975
01:24:03.551 --> 01:24:06.020
<v Speaker 1>modern human was like when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade,</v>

1976
01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:06.930
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1977
01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:12.060
<v Speaker 1>like civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the more you know versus the versus</v>

1978
01:24:12.401 --> 01:24:15.310
<v Speaker 1>the actual body being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1979
01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I think they used to think it was where </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq is.</v>

1980
01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I think they thought that was the oldest</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tamia that area.</v>

1981
01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sumir.</v>

1982
01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:27.280
<v Speaker 1>They think that that was the one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first real civilizations.</v>

1983
01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:29.140
<v Speaker 1>They think that was the first day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1984
01:24:29.141 --> 01:24:31.090
<v Speaker 1>at least the first evidence of written </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

1985
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.660
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sumeria Mesopotamia as in fact the first</v>

1986
01:24:34.661 --> 01:24:39.661
<v Speaker 1>known complex civilization developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first city states in the fourth </v>

1987
01:24:39.661 --> 01:24:40.210
<v Speaker 1>millennium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

1988
01:24:40.211 --> 01:24:45.211
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was around these cities at the </v>

1989
01:24:45.211 --> 01:24:47.221
<v Speaker 1>earliest known form of writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuneiform script appeared around 3000 </v>

1990
01:24:47.771 --> 01:24:48.860
<v Speaker 1>bce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I like everything OBC now for the Non </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians before current era,</v>

1992
01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.320
<v Speaker 1>like what is weight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it current?</v>

1993
01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.970
<v Speaker 1>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that bce?</v>

1994
01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Sneaky Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what it was even earlier than </v>

1995
01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:04.390
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it was 3000 likes.</v>

1996
01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Five Jewish calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1997
01:25:08.131 --> 01:25:13.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty 700 years ago where they like </v>

1998
01:25:13.131 --> 01:25:13.131
<v Speaker 1>started keeping track of shit and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had like,</v>

1999
01:25:13.131 --> 01:25:17.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what they watch and that's </v>

2000
01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.340
<v Speaker 1>about all those structures like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramids and all those different things </v>

2001
01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:23.641
<v Speaker 1>that you think that there was advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations that died off and that </v>

2002
01:25:23.641 --> 01:25:23.641
<v Speaker 1>that's why all those things were there.</v>

2003
01:25:23.641 --> 01:25:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Well you know about like the library in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexandria?</v>

2004
01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those things that probably</v>

2005
01:25:28.631 --> 01:25:33.631
<v Speaker 1>loss of thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they burned all the shit the Egyptians </v>

2006
01:25:33.631 --> 01:25:35.950
<v Speaker 1>knew like thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we might not ever figure it out,</v>

2007
01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying like just God knows what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had discovered and how we could </v>

2008
01:25:42.131 --> 01:25:44.830
<v Speaker 1>have stacked our science on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And right now be,</v>

2009
01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:48.250
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could be living to like 250 years old</v>

2010
01:25:48.251 --> 01:25:50.110
<v Speaker 1>for all we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we don't know what they knew or how</v>

2011
01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:52.300
<v Speaker 1>they built that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just like what?</v>

2012
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:55.750
<v Speaker 1>That's like total religious move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much knowledge in here.</v>

2013
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The enemy.</v>

2014
01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.800
<v Speaker 1>We're never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're never going to be able to convince</v>

2015
01:25:59.801 --> 01:26:01.330
<v Speaker 1>these people have an invisible cloud </v>
<v Speaker 1>band.</v>

2016
01:26:01.331 --> 01:26:02.640
<v Speaker 1>If they could read these books were </v>
<v Speaker 1>burned.</v>

2017
01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:07.650
<v Speaker 1>This fucking picked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People had been apparently going back </v>

2018
01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:09.410
<v Speaker 1>and forth to Egypt forever knowledge.</v>

2019
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:11.030
<v Speaker 1>They would go there to learn shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2020
01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.460
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a lush place.</v>

2021
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

2022
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.970
<v Speaker 1>a Patra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was closer.</v>

2023
01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Cleo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra is closer to the birth of the </v>

2024
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.750
<v Speaker 1>iphone than she is to the construction </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the pyramids.</v>

2025
01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you go from Cleopatra to today is </v>

2026
01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:31.580
<v Speaker 1>a shorter time period than Cleopatra to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the construction.</v>

2027
01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.630
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrap your fucking head around that jazz.</v>

2028
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.690
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you listen to Graham Hancock,</v>

2029
01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2030
01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:45.280
<v Speaker 1>John Anthony West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was an egyptologist who just </v>

2031
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:45.280
<v Speaker 1>passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that it goes back way further</v>

2032
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:50.231
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that the pyramids of Giza </v>

2033
01:26:50.231 --> 01:26:50.231
<v Speaker 1>might be from 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2034
01:26:50.231 --> 01:26:51.140
<v Speaker 1>but they think there's a lot of shit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

2035
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Giant things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the spanx that are thousands </v>

2036
01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:56.440
<v Speaker 1>and thousands of years older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2037
01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.100
<v Speaker 1>did you see that they just invented this</v>
<v Speaker 1>new air sonar?</v>

2038
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Guatemalan society in the fucking </v>

2039
01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:03.620
<v Speaker 1>jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2040
01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:07.520
<v Speaker 1>My mind exploded all that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that lost city ofZ ,</v>

2041
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:11.240
<v Speaker 1>that movie he didn't touch on my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a movie I want to watch,</v>

2042
01:27:11.241 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>but then I watched the trailer and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2043
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Moshe Kasher sent me the book and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost read it,</v>

2044
01:27:15.711 --> 01:27:17.180
<v Speaker 1>but then I found out there was a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2045
01:27:17.181 --> 01:27:22.181

<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2047
01:27:22.181 --> 01:27:27.110
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as good though because portia </v>

2048
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.110
<v Speaker 1>was raving about the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulations to Moshe and Latasha </v>

2052
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:37.120

<v Speaker 1>interesting because this,</v>

2053
01:27:37.150 --> 01:27:42.150
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people were just the raw cost of </v>

<v Speaker 1>raw adventurous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can get horrible mosquito </v>

2055
01:27:44.591 --> 01:27:47.051
<v Speaker 1>bites and then go into the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these crazy Englishman and like that to </v>

2056
01:27:47.051 --> 01:27:49.220
<v Speaker 1>me was what was interesting about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>book to try to see.</v>

2057
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really well done.</v>

2058
01:27:51.381 --> 01:27:56.381
<v Speaker 1>So I assume that their version of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what these English scholarly gentleman </v>

2059
01:27:56.421 --> 01:27:59.810
<v Speaker 1>were like when they were planning out </v>
<v Speaker 1>these epic mega trips,</v>

2060
01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:02.240
<v Speaker 1>but when you were watching it take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

2061
01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:07.241
<v Speaker 1>like the way they did it in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really felt like that could have </v>

<v Speaker 1>deep into the jungle looking for a lost </v>

2064
01:28:13.481 --> 01:28:13.481
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journals and things.</v>

2065
01:28:13.481 --> 01:28:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Which most of those students did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it,</v>

2066
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:20.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what they're writing with a </v>

2067
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.030
<v Speaker 1>grain of salt because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make myself sound as bad as as</v>

2068

<v Speaker 1>possible for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they definitely found some stuff </v>

<v Speaker 1>they found pottery and they found a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of different things that the guy </v>

2072
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it might be his head.</v>

2073
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to that page.</v>

2076
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd probably killed that dude and cut</v>

2077
01:28:42.321 --> 01:28:47.321
<v Speaker 1>his head off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what they were doing to </v>

2078
01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:48.671
<v Speaker 1>people down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably got tired of this white </v>

2079
01:28:48.671 --> 01:28:48.671
<v Speaker 1>dude stumbled around through the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had thing.</v>

2080
01:28:48.671 --> 01:28:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they shrink head?</v>

2081
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:54.250
<v Speaker 1>They cut your skull out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing I used to think they </v>

2082
01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:54.440
<v Speaker 1>shrunk the whole skull and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so stupid.</v>

2083
01:28:54.441 --> 01:28:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I already told you how dumb I am when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to eggs with shrunken heads.</v>

2084
01:28:57.681 --> 01:28:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2085
01:28:58.270 --> 01:29:00.950
<v Speaker 1>They got some fucking solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes their head shrink up.</v>

2086
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2087
01:29:01.681 --> 01:29:04.560
<v Speaker 1>They take the skull out and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the skin,</v>

2088
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:09.710
<v Speaker 1>stitch it all up together and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do something with it to make it like </v>

2089
01:29:09.710 --> 01:29:09.740
<v Speaker 1>shrivel up like a put a.</v>

2090
01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:12.090
<v Speaker 1>put a coconut or something in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

2091
01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how they make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have never in a million years</v>

2092
01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:20.601
<v Speaker 1>have you asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was shrunken head would make and </v>

2093
01:29:20.601 --> 01:29:20.601
<v Speaker 1>they stuff it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have no,</v>

2094
01:29:20.601 --> 01:29:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they stuff it to kind of looked </v>

2095
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:25.140
<v Speaker 1>like the guy that's his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's homeboys head.</v>

2096
01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2097
01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:27.060
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2098
01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:29.970
<v Speaker 1>they chopped that dude up and did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to his head.</v>

2099
01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so crazy.</v>

2100
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:37.520
<v Speaker 1>But what a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a dark way of approaching other </v>

2101
01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:38.820
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have his eyeballs stitched up.</v>

2102
01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:42.070
<v Speaker 1>They have a rope coming out of his mouth</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like a.</v>

2103
01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:44.770
<v Speaker 1>just a carrying strap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2104
01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.830
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put it on your belt.</v>

2105
01:29:46.831 --> 01:29:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stitched his mouth up though,</v>

2106
01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:54.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like his mouth is </v>

2107
01:29:54.051 --> 01:29:54.051
<v Speaker 1>stitched up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That looks like a little bit.</v>

2108
01:29:54.051 --> 01:29:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they made a key chain,</v>

2109
01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:55.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like.</v>

2110
01:29:55.261 --> 01:29:58.260
<v Speaker 1>They got that little loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They carried that dude around their dick</v>

2111
01:29:58.730 --> 01:30:01.040
<v Speaker 1>just walked through the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2112
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:03.270
<v Speaker 1>it was all for a novelty store in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venice.</v>

2113
01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:08.680
<v Speaker 1>That was their version of forever 21 </v>
<v Speaker 1>little like Hudson News in town with </v>

2114
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:11.700
<v Speaker 1>little knickknacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a fucked up practice.</v>

2115
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Cutting people's heads off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the skin off,</v>

2116
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:17.050
<v Speaker 1>stitching it all up and shrinking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2117
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:18.990
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like we were talking about food.</v>

2118
01:30:18.991 --> 01:30:21.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like we got a lot of fucked up shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did here too.</v>

2119
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2120
01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Smallpox on blankets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't.</v>

2121
01:30:23.971 --> 01:30:25.780
<v Speaker 1>That's not really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not right.</v>

2122
01:30:25.810 --> 01:30:26.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2123
01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:31.970
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know what bacteria was </v>

2124
01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:34.260
<v Speaker 1>back then that they would just know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can figure out how to get.</v>

2125
01:30:34.330 --> 01:30:36.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently it's an urban myth.</v>

2126
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on urban or rural.</v>

2127
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:45.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a wild west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently would happen was just the </v>

2128
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:47.520
<v Speaker 1>first European settlers just alone by </v>
<v Speaker 1>their presence,</v>

2129
01:30:47.521 --> 01:30:52.521
<v Speaker 1>killed somewhere around 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the native America bringing outside </v>

2130
01:30:52.521 --> 01:30:56.841
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of crazy shit that people had </v>

2131
01:30:56.841 --> 01:30:57.360
<v Speaker 1>no immune systems for and that this idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they did it all with blankets would</v>

2132
01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:02.420
<v Speaker 1>look the is not to say that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do horrible things to the native </v>

2133
01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They absolutely did and it's not to.</v>

2134
01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Not to in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diminish the genocide that took place on</v>

2135
01:31:07.741 --> 01:31:11.340
<v Speaker 1>the native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that the blanket thing</v>

2136
01:31:11.370 --> 01:31:13.740
<v Speaker 1>was true because they didn't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolate syphilis.</v>

2137
01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they just went to pe patients </v>

2138
01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:19.010
<v Speaker 1>that had syphilis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smallpox,</v>

2139
01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:19.560
<v Speaker 1>smallpox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

2140
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:21.680
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just what I thought I guild alcohol.</v>

2141
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I thought they just knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2142
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I got my stories mixed up.</v>

2143
01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:26.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a good way to go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you go blind,</v>

2144
01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:29.220
<v Speaker 1>sarcastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2145
01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2146
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:31.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2147
01:31:31.650 --> 01:31:34.740
<v Speaker 1>just exposure to Europeans killed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great many of them.</v>

2148
01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:40.190
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named Dan Flores that I </v>

2149
01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:40.190
<v Speaker 1>had on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2150
01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:41.310
<v Speaker 1>an expert in history of animals in North</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

2151
01:31:41.311 --> 01:31:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I think I heard that podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking guys are genius.</v>

2152
01:31:44.251 --> 01:31:49.251
<v Speaker 1>He's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was talking about buffalo and </v>

2153
01:31:49.251 --> 01:31:52.551
<v Speaker 1>that when the native Americans died off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like literally 90 percent of them </v>

2154
01:31:52.551 --> 01:31:55.680
<v Speaker 1>were killed by European diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy.</v>

2155
01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of them that were killed off </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Europeans,</v>

2156
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:04.050
<v Speaker 1>the buffalo were in hunted anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they grew to these mammoth </v>

2157
01:32:04.050 --> 01:32:07.201
<v Speaker 1>proportions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's his contention that those giant </v>

2158
01:32:07.201 --> 01:32:10.650
<v Speaker 1>fields of buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people experience where there was </v>

2159
01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:13.051
<v Speaker 1>like thousands and thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of Buffalo stampeding and </v>

2160
01:32:13.051 --> 01:32:14.980
<v Speaker 1>cross the field that would have never </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken place if the same amount of native</v>

2161
01:32:14.981 --> 01:32:19.981
<v Speaker 1>Americans had been there previously </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they weren't controlling the </v>

2162
01:32:19.981 --> 01:32:19.981
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

2163
01:32:19.981 --> 01:32:23.500
<v Speaker 1>They were the primary Predator because </v>
<v Speaker 1>all they did was follow these.</v>

2164
01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why they had these </v>
<v Speaker 1>teepees.</v>

2165
01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:29.671
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them would follow the herds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>buffalo and they'd peck at it from the </v>

2166
01:32:29.671 --> 01:32:29.990
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just nomadic culture.</v>

2167
01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just stayed with the Buffalo.</v>

2168
01:32:31.391 --> 01:32:33.790
<v Speaker 1>But they also kept their numbers down </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2169
01:32:33.791 --> 01:32:36.520
<v Speaker 1>if there's several hundred native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans or how many in their camp,</v>

2170
01:32:36.521 --> 01:32:37.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

2171
01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:42.200
<v Speaker 1>they're killing a couple buffalo a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day and everybody's eating it and </v>

2172
01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:42.940
<v Speaker 1>then there's no refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So go after it again,</v>

2173
01:32:43.450 --> 01:32:45.880
<v Speaker 1>keep following it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're basically just eating buffalo</v>

2174
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.170
<v Speaker 1>and shooting arrows at them and taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the populations down all the time.</v>

2175
01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:51.760
<v Speaker 1>That's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2176
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I'd never heard it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on my friend,</v>

2177
01:32:53.831 --> 01:32:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his podcast,</v>

2178
01:32:54.971 --> 01:32:58.090
<v Speaker 1>and he explained it on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Rinella explained it to me also</v>

2179
01:32:58.091 --> 01:33:00.880
<v Speaker 1>independently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I had him on the podcast.</v>

2180
01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Then I read his book too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got two books to see if he could </v>

2181
01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.350
<v Speaker 1>find the titles of Dan Flores books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2182
01:33:07.351 --> 01:33:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them actually use a paper.</v>

2183
01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Populations expand exponentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2184
01:33:11.731 --> 01:33:13.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the daily America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2185
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:16.620

<v Speaker 1>Cody America is.</v>

2186
01:33:16.621 --> 01:33:21.621

<v Speaker 1>America said about the history of the </v>

2187
01:33:21.621 --> 01:33:21.621
<v Speaker 1>coyote within North America.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like a Venti starbucks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like 250 or 240 and that's it to 70.</v>

01:34:16.411 --> 01:34:19.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a touch mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really need it.</v>
