WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.740
And we're live,
ladies and gentlemen,
UFC fight companion podcast.
Well,

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:07.500
not necessarily.
You have to,
it's not UFC endorsed or supported.

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:10.560
And the opinions on this show are not those of the UFC.
Definitely.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.980
Even though I'm UFC employee,
a proud u of c employee,
both of us,

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.570
both of us were watching the UFC fight pass or we're watching it on fight pass.

6
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.480
But we,
we might do this motherfucker for glory.
Okay.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.070
We might do this motherfucker for the pack.
He,
I'll fight.

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.220
I'm here with Brendan Motherfucka Chalk.
What is,
uh,

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.290
and of course [inaudible] you can't say that I did too late.

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.130
Just happen.
Set it live.
Uh,
we are about to watch,

11
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.860
we're watching UFC fight pass.

12
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:45.690
We'll watch it on my computer so I can't pull up,
uh,
who is fighting.

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.830
But,
uh,
this is a lady fighter.
I lady,

14
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.820
there's so many fighters in the UFC now.

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.500
Even the employees of the UFC don't know who the fuck is,
who?
It's tough.

16
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.311
It's getting crazy.

17
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:04.311
There's 500 signed fighters that far surpasses the Dunbar's number of one 50.

18
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.780
That's tough.
Especially when it's international ICUs in Poland.
It's tough.
Man.

19
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.300
I remember back in the day when someone try to,

20
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.450
we'll try to get away with saying that they're a UFC fighter and you'd say,
yeah,

21
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:21.270
fuck you now.
Shit.
You'd have to do some research.
Yeah.
You can't just say,

22
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:25.160
fuck you.
You got to go.
He might be,
yeah,

23
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.090
my B.
And then you find out,
oh,
this dude.
Yeah,
he fought.
Yeah,
almost to six.

24
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.430
And I'm even like really good fighters.

25
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:36.190
Like how many people didn't know about Brendan Dash until he fought Benson?
Yeah.

26
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.310
I.
Dot.
Sanchez fucking budget.
I nightmare his name sounded familiar.

27
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.590
I was like fat.
Okay,
dude,
that guy's legit big in Denver.
He's big.

28
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.520
He's fucking good.
Oh,
that's your boy crush.
Calderwood and morose.
It's,

29
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000
is that her name?
Moros how do you,
I don't know how to say it.

30
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.340
There's a lot of fighters from other countries now to man's,

31
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.940
one of the cool things that we're seeing.
Jamie,

32
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:02.670
give us a little volume so we can hear this too so we could hear the fights.

33
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.000
No one's told us to not do that.
So let's just keep doing that.

34
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.870
And I've got to take this fucking goofy,
a lava lamp town.
I can't see shit.

35
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.430
It's a big ass lava lamp.

36
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.690
<v 1>So on this thing</v>

37
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.810
still flows.

38
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.943
Insulation,

39
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.800
<v 0>boom,
boom,
boom.
We're back.
It's hard.
You doing the commentating on this.</v>

40
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.360
It doesn't sound like hardy if a play by play guy,
but I didn't hear him earlier.

41
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:40.180
Did you hear him?
I haven't heard him,
Jamie.
We lost it.
What happened?

42
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.800
What the fuck happened to on flight path?
I don't know.

43
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.940
<v 1>MMM,</v>

44
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.620
<v 0>we're fucked.
Hmm.</v>

45
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.350
Let me try us again.
Well,

46
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.940
<v 2>um,
take this off because otherwise</v>

47
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.070
take this off of my desktop can be what are,
what are people seeing right now?

48
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:10.840
Just us.
Okay.
Damn,
look at that picture.
Sucks.
Gary Anderson Silva.

49
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.360
I know that was one of the greatest knockouts of all time.

50
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.730
He could say no when he missed.
Yeah.
Not,

51
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.690
not because it was like most of the price set up.
It was just crazy.

52
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.820
Like as far as like the result of a knockout,

53
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.180
like the jolted sends through your body.

54
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.720
Wouldn't Weidman connected on Anderson?
It was like one of the greatest moments,

55
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:33.400
like not great.
Like,
I'm happy,
interesting got knocked out or none of that.

56
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.150
Just like the burst of what the fuck is more is doing.

57
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.570
Langland buster Douglas knocked out Tyson but crazier because he came out of

58
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:43.300
nowhere like Buster Douglas whooping that ass.

59
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.550
Buster Douglas was a hit true that long.
The handbooks through.
Wow.

60
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.150
He was hitting him with that.
That Larry Holmes style jabbing the hook behind it.

61
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.190
That was buster Douglas,
his finest moment.

62
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.780
I just saw that fight within the last six months and God damn,

63
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.070
even though buster,
buster Douglas looked amazing,

64
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.130
he looked flawless.
He was on fire,
but even,

65
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.940
and Tyson didn't train for it or whatever,
but if you look at Tyson,

66
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.530
even though he didn't train,
he looked good.
He looked good in that fight.

67
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.870
All his head movement was that he was still on big shot.

68
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.890
He was really trying to knock out buster Douglas with everything he had.

69
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:25.240
He was throwing a great shit.
Any did drop them in the eighth round,
dropped him.

70
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.760
Did you hear what Tyson speaking before that?

71
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:32.761
He was saying how he was just doing work on those Tokyo.

72
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.900
Is that right?
He was just doing work on some Asian lady.

73
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.150
He talked about doing more hours more than your mind.

74
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.660
Tyson.
He probably never took time off.
All right,
here we go.
Perfect timing.

75
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.410
We're back.
Fipass how dare you kicked me off like that.

76
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.000
It looks like an Atari game for you fucking guys.
How dare you?

77
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.850
How dare you.
I wonder how many half Mike Tyson kids are are in Japan,
right?

78
00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:03.851
70 can we got Joanne Calderwood and Mirin and morose.

79
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.080
Here we go.
We're going to hear it.

80
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.790
<v 3>Professional record.
Damn.
That bitch looks mean.</v>

81
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.970
Five in no respect.
Five foot tall.
Oh no,

82
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.990
that's fine.

83
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.940
And I say bitch,
with all due respect,

84
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.270
I'm more kind of kicked off to holding an undefeated professional.
But Damn,

85
00:05:32.271 --> 00:05:37.190
Scotland does not play games.
I've met this chick is tough as fuck.
She is good.

86
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.600
Joanne's back to whoop that ass.
She,
she does look like he's paralyzed,
right?

87
00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:46.280
They're terrified.
Terrified.
That's the Carla Esparza a fact,
right?
It's not real.

88
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.510
I don't know.
Carla just does this and then she goes out there and with that,

89
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.380
not that last night,
but you not that last fight.
The last fight.
She was just,

90
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.920
the striking was so cool,
man.
Think that's true.

91
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.230
I think that chick is going to make what?
Was there any Joanna?
I think be right.

92
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.820
There she is.
She's the Ronda Rousey at one 15 we better striking.

93
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.270
She's gonna make everybody look like Carla.
She's terrible.
Look like Corey.

94
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.530
$100 they're going to look lost.

95
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.400
It's going to be able to take her down shit out of me to be able to take her

96
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:17.810
down.
If Carla can't take her down.

97
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.510
Most fighters in that division are not going to be able to take her down.
Well,

98
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.460
did you see her fight with Amanda Nunez

99
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.110
who's a very close fight in a lot of people actually thought that Nunez won the

100
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:30.200
fight.
I think it was Nunez,
right?
Was it Nunez?

101
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.450
I'm wrong.
Then she's a beast.
Oh Dude.
She's fucking,

102
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.760
she's wind pig.
She looked like that rafter.
She is intense.
I would Google her,

103
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:42.970
but I don't know how to say her name on Google either.

104
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.920
I can't even spell it if you gave me $1 million right now.

105
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.860
I'm going to try you on,
man.
Joanne got good striking.
She throws it some power.

106
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:52.940
I just tried Jay y,
z.

107
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.650
You want to Jay y,Z and let's see if they figure it out.
Dude,
isn't it weird?

108
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.510
I can't do this while I'm not a,

109
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:04.280
I'm a girls fight like dudes and I'm still not used to it.

110
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.870
How long did we think that girls can throw punches?
We just,
we believe that as a,

111
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.410
as a,
as a society.
Girls can't throw punches,

112
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.190
but then you look at Kathleen,
Kathleen Long.
Holy Shit.
Have you seen her?

113
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.110
Have you seen her highlight reel?
No.

114
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.400
She is the best American female kick and the eighties and nineties Holy Shit.

115
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.220
Old School when old youtube,
youtube search.
Kathy long highlight reel.

116
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:30.240
Who've seen Holly Holm.
You Seen Holly Holmes.

117
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.760
Do you know what all that can stand down for a moment.

118
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.050
Have you guys seen and mother fucking Wolf?
No.
What's the can,

119
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.080
we should stop watching this fight immediately and watch how Ann Wolfe used said

120
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.700
knock chicks.
Beautycon armbar wow.
Wow.

121
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.260
Armbar damn.
That was beautiful.

122
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.540
Cranium Ukrainian.
She was a huge underdog man.
That was beautiful.

123
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.383
Huge underdog.

124
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.740
I got to see how that was all set up.

125
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.230
We were talking about don't show the replay for sure.

126
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.310
We were talking about just girls will Kathy long.
No,

127
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.280
we were just talking about Ann Wolfe.

128
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.160
She pulled the car.
Wow,
that's pretty bad at join his haircut.

129
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.880
Look at this nice cause roll guard right into an arm bar that she just can't get

130
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.040
out of that.
That's what's crazy.
Control their legs.
Yeah.

131
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:32.990
Great controls like curls.
Look at those leg curls.
Damn Shit.
That is legit.

132
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.880
You know Eddie,

133
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.910
there's still people that say that you shouldn't cross your feet and I don't,

134
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.720
I don't agree with that.
It crossing your feet with the arm bar thing.

135
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:43.010
That's like people are pretending.

136
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:45.470
Some people pretend it's just like crossing the feet when you have someone's

137
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:49.760
back.
Well it all depends if the guys on their back and you're in spider web,

138
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.060
if they're on their back,
yeah,
you cross your feet all the time.

139
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.980
But if they're on top of you,
it all

140
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.510
<v 0>depends on what's going on.
The angle.
I mean what,
what's going on with the arm?</v>

141
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:04.680
Exactly.
And what's going on with the locking of the shoulder?
What angle?

142
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.120
Where is she,
uh,
put uh,
putting all her weight.
Watch this.

143
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:13.740
This is Ann Wolf.
She's going Americans.
He's a black check.
Oh,

144
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.660
check this.
Cause that American chicken.
Wait for some trauma.
Wait,

145
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.531
wait for some shit.

146
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:22.680
That's gonna Change Your feeling about what would happen if a chick punched you.

147
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.000
You just got to see this fucking chaos.
I think you'd be surprised.
Oh,

148
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:28.120
it hold up books.
This.

149
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.390
Oh Dude.

150
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.440
Are you fucking shitting me?

151
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.300
Are you fucking shitting me to Tyson dude,
she lifted her in the air.

152
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.170
Those ridiculous flying God.

153
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.720
That girl like literally went flying and wolf can bang and she changed.

154
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.770
She trains James Kirkland.
Who's a high level guy.
The Guy who your corner.

155
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.880
Yeah,
I see.
She's in a tense corner.
Let's see what she says.
Okay.

156
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.933
<v 1>That's it.</v>

157
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.150
<v 0>Choose you too.</v>

158
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.670
<v 1>I want to make a champion.</v>

159
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.810
<v 0>I bet she does.
Great speech.
What powerful.</v>

160
00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:15.070
Dan Hardee liked Dan Hardee.
Men love that.
Great Guy.

161
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.070
The best.
He's good on the mic too.
He's very good.

162
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.743
He's very smart.

163
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.870
Her walk out of here just says fight night.
Just fuck it.
Fight night.

164
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.070
Does that Reebok,
I don't know what that has to be a better,

165
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.010
it says Reebok.
They're fighting has to be something bad.

166
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:36.870
Is that what they're calling it?
I hope not.

167
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.080
That better not be what they want people to buy.
I'm not wearing that.

168
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.460
I'm gonna fucking throwing a big brown on the back.
Maybe it's,

169
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.320
Oh you know what it probably is.

170
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.400
It's probably what they're wearing on fight night.
Like that's why.

171
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.010
Does that make sense?
I should probably ask somebody since I worked for hold on.

172
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.150
Oh that's beautiful.
Look at the control she has with her hands.
Boom.

173
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.590
No capitalization is small gap before the closure.

174
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.080
She didn't capitalize on that was a warm up and extend that for sure.

175
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.900
Don't stand up and extend the offer but she,
she hung out in there.

176
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.320
We should have squashed her.
Yeah,

177
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.190
she hung out in there when there was this one brief moment.

178
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:17.940
Was she going to pull the arm out?
Yeah.
Shit.

179
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.680
Damn.
How do you say join his last name?
Jared Dick again.
Jen jet check.

180
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.300
Shit like the laughing.
Well,

181
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:29.670
they know that that's where the money's at and that isn't that crazy.

182
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.630
Fuck you bitch.

183
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.593
<v 1>Six.</v>

184
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.350
<v 0>Damn.
She powerful collared white shirt.</v>

185
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.100
Beautiful.
I think we've come champ.

186
00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:44.840
They should have a stylus where you right away.

187
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.500
You can't dress like an asshole anymore.
I put,
what about Roy Nelson?

188
00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:53.090
If Roy Nelson became champ and decided to see Ya.
See,

189
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.473
no

190
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.710
<v 3>one else would be sorry.
You're so wrong for women's MMA.</v>

191
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:02.680
They should be allowed to pull hair and that'd be part of the game.

192
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.420
It's too much,
man.
So dark.

193
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.110
It's too much cool.
Not Cool at all.
Those girls.

194
00:12:12.111 --> 00:12:14.720
Can you imagine the technique horrible too.

195
00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:17.880
That'd be all of these different chokes you could do with the hair.
That's good.

196
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.630
Did I hear you man,
but this bugs me.
This,
this here's you inject,

197
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.860
check taken out of spar.
That too.
She's so lethal on the feet.

198
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.780
That's some real legit six time world more Thai champion right there.
Right?

199
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.510
Get that beautiful.
This is a goddamn firing gallery.

200
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.460
It's like she was just having like sparring practice with like pads that don't

201
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:39.190
hit back.
Do you know?
This was like,
it's like she was like,

202
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:43.300
she was hitting the Mitts with some light defense work,
right?
God Damn.

203
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:46.540
She's good to the technique that you see there.

204
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.050
That data is as clean as it gets when it comes to striking in MMA.

205
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.530
She got no pen.
That's a scary girlfriend I have right there.

206
00:12:53.531 --> 00:12:58.000
She can fuck you up if you're not on your shin.
You're kind of drunk.

207
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.530
I shoot man.
I'll tell you what though.
No girlfriend.

208
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.590
Mine's walking out of the house.

209
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.410
You guys were in a real fight.
She was your girlfriend.

210
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.900
I would snap her downtown.
Now you would.
You'd fuck her up but kind of drunk.

211
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:18.280
You're in your underwear.

212
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.840
That's the thing though.

213
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.330
I think of girl like that needs a boyfriend like him.
She,

214
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:34.040
she needs a giant gorilla that she can't just kicking ass.

215
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.450
Multibillionaire dude is like a little old man that she beats up.

216
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.280
Shelly rides him.
Fucking little man.

217
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.230
Keep your life.
I keep your life at least to have her beat her up.
Beat him up,

218
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.360
dude.
A woman like that,
like you'd done.
That takes a lot of man.

219
00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.010
You need an Alpha male.
The complete opposite.
Oh,
copped cro.
Cop would work.

220
00:14:00.011 --> 00:14:04.150
She's not hot enough for cro cop.
Let's be honest.
Well,
how dare you.
I dare you.

221
00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:09.100
I think she's,
I'm sorry.
She,
yes,
she's beautiful for cro cop though.

222
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.170
This mother fucker runs Croatia.
Can you imagine?

223
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.710
Imagine the damage he's doing.
Jesus Christ.
He's married.

224
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:21.490
He's got a family for that though.
I've tried and Denny was single.

225
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.880
Google this woman's name.
I've never had a harder time.
Google a woman's name.

226
00:14:24.881 --> 00:14:28.420
I know termites are ticket checker.
I basically know how to say it,

227
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.650
but to spell it,
I really need to learn how to spell it.
It's,

228
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.390
it's preposterous that they require that of,
you know,
I think,
yeah,

229
00:14:37.391 --> 00:14:40.570
I know,
man.
I'm trying to figure it out.
Click on it and see what's,

230
00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:43.600
what was her last fight?
Go to her Wikipedia.

231
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.030
Besides Carla Esparza.
I want to say it was Nunez,

232
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.870
but I'm doing this totally off a memory and I might

233
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.343
get all

234
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.880
<v 0>God,
that's,
it was,
it was Claude.
You get Dahlia.
Okay.
My account,
my apologies.</v>

235
00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.360
[inaudible] names are tough because in man and Nunez I think is a one 35.

236
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.960
Yeah,
she is.
She is.
Can we see,
uh,

237
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.320
the caffeine long add a highlight reel on that?
Is that possible?

238
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:14.300
[inaudible] fight.
That was a really fucking close fight.

239
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.220
A really close fight.
Pundits matchups man styles champ for awhile.

240
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.450
Well that's tricking.
Claude is very good dude.
Yeah,
she's very good.

241
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.290
I mean that was a really good fight between those two.
Um,
I'm not,

242
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.200
I think there's a lot of action in this division.
I think.

243
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.600
I really think that Joanna,
Joanna,

244
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.350
that's what he's saying is above and beyond the rest of them when it comes to

245
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.100
striking.

246
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.180
But there's some really good grapplers and that division and if they get ahold

247
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:45.170
of her,
who the fuck knows?
It's very,
very exciting.
That means it's true.

248
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.240
Every fighter is going to be taught.
It's true.

249
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.740
No one's going to take her down easily.

250
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.450
But a Stryker with really good wrestling might be able to pull it off.

251
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.880
The problem with Carla was the gap in the striking was so goddamn and norm and

252
00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.720
the length,
the reach was troubling.

253
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.900
It's just an enormous gap and the striking like did get inside and she got deep

254
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.500
and that's beyond the striking.
Yup.
She couldn't finish it.
It's true.

255
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.800
She could gotten tagged before that though.
She definitely did.

256
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.830
She could have been diminished by that.
There's a lot of possibilities there.

257
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.440
If you saw the two of them,
I would have to go back and watch it again.
Um,

258
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.880
but if you,
if you watch anytime you see someone get tagged,

259
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.590
you know there's a possibility that they're functioning in a diminished
capacity.

260
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.460
Right?
Hell yeah.
That's what people need from round five

261
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.450
Jujitsu guy to fucking to stripe white belt.

262
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.400
I think he went back mount just and I had no idea.

263
00:16:38.401 --> 00:16:41.210
I had no idea what was going on.
Yeah.
I thought I was fine.

264
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.420
And just weird when you think about how good you are on his hands are,

265
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.680
she could have easily clip Carla coming in and shirt and then your,
your,
your,

266
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.150
your memory.
You know,
you're more skills or slow you,

267
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.980
you think you're moving at a good pace.
You're really not.

268
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.870
It's just the distance is,
there's a haze that distance you.

269
00:16:58.871 --> 00:17:03.590
You seem like you're all right.
You're really not.
Everything's slow trouble man.

270
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.600
God Damn,
you just have some killer focus,
not days.
Ooh,
let me be a fighter.

271
00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:10.220
Huh?
God Damn Dude.

272
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.360
Did you see the Jamie Varner Shit?

273
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.530
The interviews a Jamie Varner has been doing lately.
What's he talking about?

274
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.483
Very interesting.

275
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.790
He's talking about how he thinks fighter should spar way less than they do.

276
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.820
He's like,
what you need to be doing.
It's working on drills,
hidden pads,

277
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.220
working out on strength and conditioning,
you know,

278
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:29.510
do your wrestling and Hugh Jitsu.

279
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.500
But he's like hardcore sparring should be done once a week at most and not,

280
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.350
and only when you're preparing for a fight.
I agree 100%.

281
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:39.230
He said maybe you could even stretch it out to even more than once a week,

282
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.160
like once every two weeks.
He's like,
what's really important is that you,

283
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.300
you take care of your brain and he makes sure you don't spar with bigger guys.

284
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:51.690
He was saying that he,
he made mistakes by sparring with,
um,
uh,

285
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.670
he's sparring with,
um,
who was it?
Uh,
who's with me?
Bader.

286
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.080
I know he's part of the Beta.

287
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.720
I think he's sparred with Bazinsky who's a little bit large than them,
too big.

288
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:05.910
Um,
CB Dalloway he's larger than him too.
When you and painters,
big dude,

289
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:10.350
he's a big boy.
Big fic.
Motherfucker throws haymakers he's uh,

290
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.970
he's a hard puncher.
I agree 100% with Jamie.
Jamie [inaudible] a 155 or,

291
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:18.150
and he's fighting a guy that's literally fighting the division 50 pounds heavier

292
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:21.630
than him and he's sparring with that guy,
you know?
I mean,
that's pretty crazy.

293
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.570
Binders at two oh five,
you know,
that's,
that's bananas.

294
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.270
You think we'll ever see Bader striking like Conor McGregor?
Well,
he,

295
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:34.350
you know what I mean by that is by just utilizing every possible strike,

296
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.050
he would have to change a lot about the way he moves.
You know,

297
00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:43.680
I think Beta has gotten a lot better and his striking like,
no doubt.

298
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.900
Like the Phage,
I'll fight to perfect example of that.

299
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.000
Like Fazio is a legit striker.

300
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.370
If you watched his fight with King Mo and strike for us.

301
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.190
You see what kind of striking Fazio has when he's on point.

302
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.000
Even later Glover's he showed you to strike and he clipped him with a right
hand.

303
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.020
Yes he did.
He did clovers a monster.

304
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:03.180
He heard him before he got caught when he was trying to close the deal.
Um,

305
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.350
that's totally true.
He's really good.
He's getting much better too.
He works hard.

306
00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:09.240
You can totally tell.
See that.
Uh,

307
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.260
there's a video going around like a highlight of the capillary MMA.

308
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.860
Have you seen this?
No.
No.
They're doing spinning kicks and Shit Dude.

309
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.520
I don't know if it's fake.
It looks real.
It looks real.

310
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:22.690
It's some vocabulary is just like wheel kicks,

311
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.970
Super Athletic Guys Against Cup of water guys and that's what they're throwing.

312
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.140
They're just throwing massive double spinning wheel kicks that are doing all

313
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:34.140
that shit and Jujitsu.
They go on the ground and choke each other out.

314
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.410
When I was going to say about Brian Bader in that like we were saying,

315
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:41.490
do you think you'll ever have like a four snow is the way moves to something

316
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:45.420
wrong with the way like when think wrong?
See,
I don't think wrong is wrong.

317
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.730
I don't think it's in his wheel house.
I mean for kicking.

318
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.901
Do you know what I'm saying?

319
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:52.080
Like you would not even wrong with the way he moves because obviously the way he

320
00:19:52.081 --> 00:19:54.690
moves is effective,
but it's almost like his lower legs.

321
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.200
Like he keeps them close together when he's,

322
00:19:58.201 --> 00:20:03.201
if you watch like a Machida or you watch like a branded fache like real strong

323
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.920
traditional karate type background,

324
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:07.830
which is the one that allows you to get away with everything.
Socratic type guy,

325
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.540
you know,
he throws a lot of wheel kicks.
You can throw everything.

326
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.460
That's what I'm talking because I can't like Pettis at once.

327
00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.480
You would have to have a wider stance so it's not,

328
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:17.160
there's something wrong with it was something wrong.

329
00:20:17.161 --> 00:20:19.590
If you wanted to throw all those kicks and all that other crazy shit.

330
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.460
He look at Anderson,
there's a wider stance.
If you look at taekwondo guys,

331
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:24.780
there's a wide stance going on.

332
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.660
I think that's the only way you get to throw those kicks.
Like with Moyie Thai,

333
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:32.010
you can stand way closer because it's Moitai you're throwing round kicks mostly

334
00:20:32.011 --> 00:20:35.160
and occasionally tepes but when you want to go off that back leg with anything

335
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:37.110
where you're spinning,
you want to have a little bit more space.

336
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.990
And I think if he wanted to have like Conor McGregor style,

337
00:20:39.991 --> 00:20:43.080
he would probably have to stand like Mcgregor.
If you see how McGregor standing,

338
00:20:43.081 --> 00:20:45.680
it's very wide stamp.
Super.
What would you think a,

339
00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:48.100
it's a good idea for every guy getting

340
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.270
<v 2>into MMA to try to emulate,
uh,
some,
uh,</v>

341
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:56.860
style like that.
Everyone,
the Christ.
How works though,
man,
if you get good at it,

342
00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.080
that it's when it's hard to hit a guy.

343
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.830
Like if you ever watch a good point fighter fight like Raymond Daniels,

344
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.990
we've Seen Raymond Daniels fight and glory.
Yes.

345
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.930
Only the super high level guys have been able to get past that.

346
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.910
Like the guys like Niki hold skin.
He's,
he's the guy who gets passage,

347
00:21:11.911 --> 00:21:16.650
a monster talking about wonder boy Joseph.
He's tough to hit man.
Yeah,
the UFC,

348
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.290
he's a phenomenal points.
Joseph [inaudible],

349
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.810
he's a perfect example of a guy gets passed Raymond Daniels and he's the champ

350
00:21:22.811 --> 00:21:24.520
cause he just kicked his legs out from under him.

351
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.640
He just used traditional solid Moyie Thai hands up kickboxing style block

352
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.660
through a lot of fucking leg kicks.

353
00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:33.220
Took him out and then took them out with a head kick.

354
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.180
But everybody else when Daniel's fights ago can't deal with that kind of hopping

355
00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:39.580
in and out.
Shit.
It's lethal.
It's legal.

356
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:44.360
So he had to have a guy like Conor McGregor style or like a guide,

357
00:21:44.361 --> 00:21:47.620
like a Leonardo or thatch and couch rose was wild kicks.

358
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.440
If Bader wanted to do that,
he would definitely have to widen it stance.

359
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.060
I don't think Beta is ever going to do that.

360
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:56.710
I also think the style you're describing is,
is in those guys.
Thatch,

361
00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:01.780
Connor Machida,
they're phenomenal athletes.
Phenomenal.
And that might not be,

362
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.910
you don't think of Bain is a phenomenal athlete compared to Machida.

363
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:11.430
I don't think he's as skilled in karate or in stand up as Machida is,

364
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.310
I mean Machida's a sly professional high level fighter and when they fought

365
00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:20.080
explosive.
Yeah.
Well the Cheetahs Jim Maci she is pretty special.

366
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.400
He's pretty special.
That gave special all those guys.

367
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.740
Sometimes I think certain styles aren't in guy's wheels.
Does that make sense?

368
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:30.760
Like Bob Sapp isn't going to fucking adapt to the taekwondo ever.
It's true.

369
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.210
Guys are made for it.
Too much mass there.
Right.

370
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.920
Well is a massive food and but he could do it cause phaseout can do those kind

371
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:40.050
of kicks page.

372
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.950
How could throw wheeled care cause he's a thick fucking dude to Melvin man who

373
00:22:43.951 --> 00:22:47.530
have,
who's thicker than that fucking guy when it was explosive and athletic.

374
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.220
Once you know a Melvin you don't see throw wheelchair because either you assume

375
00:22:50.221 --> 00:22:51.520
mostly with straight,
more tall,

376
00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:54.300
straight Moyie Thai leg kicks like a motherfucker who said what the fuck is

377
00:22:54.301 --> 00:22:57.920
different man,
I just don't like throwing them.
That's true.
I agree.

378
00:22:57.921 --> 00:23:01.240
Some guys don't because cause you got it cause they're no good at them because I

379
00:23:01.241 --> 00:23:04.930
don't practice them at all.
I'm a victim of that.
I'm just saying certain guys,

380
00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:07.600
like a guy like Bader who comes from a wrestling background,

381
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:12.100
the chances of him adapt and that's not good and you have to have the athletic

382
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:13.240
ability to pick it up.
Well,

383
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.760
I don't think Conor came from that background entirely.
You know?

384
00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:18.670
I think he's kind of picked that kicking style up more.

385
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:22.200
I think it started more as a boxer and boxer.
Yeah,

386
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.420
but he also taekwondo karate,
right.

387
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.350
He spends a lot of time with a homie in Iceland one day.

388
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.560
Gunnar Nelson Machida,
wicked,
wicked,
wicked.

389
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.860
She is single handedly everything.
Great.
Brought back karate.

390
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:39.320
I mean you can't say shit about karate.
Look at my,

391
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.340
you can't say shit about karate.
You can't say shit man.

392
00:23:42.341 --> 00:23:44.670
This is what we're going to have a couple of weeks.

393
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.690
<v 3>The UFC who comes out and it's stolen all them crazy.
Cowboy Caesar,</v>

394
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.750
Caesar Mouton.
It has though.

395
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.620
Cesar Mouton not going out.
That's his background.
That's his background.

396
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:02.450
He's really fun to start off with that.
He's just based super,
super good guy.

397
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.810
There's a lot of guys who've training cup of wire who've done the UFC,
I'm sure,

398
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.960
but who actually go out there and stand like those capillaries move through

399
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.720
that.
We'll throw a guy off.
What do you guys think about,
um,
about uh,

400
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:19.770
Daniel Cormier and Bader?
I would have to go with Cormier.

401
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:24.140
That's going to be a great fight,
man.
That's going to be a great fight,
man.

402
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:28.100
I friction really good.
I love data.
I love DC.
DC helps me out a lot.

403
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.280
They're both really good dude.
Good for the sport man.

404
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.560
Way of describing the great for the sport.
Dcs from New Orleans.

405
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:40.250
It's in his hometown.
Dude.
You look at dcs track record.

406
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.920
There's not too many dudes beating him.

407
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.420
There's one guy on this earth who can beat him.
It's Jon Jones.

408
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.250
I don't think he will ever beat John Jones.
No.
How could it's John?

409
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.640
John Discuss what the fuck it's posturing.

410
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:55.940
We're watching this man.
I don't think we ever get someone as good as John Jones.

411
00:24:55.941 --> 00:25:00.570
I just don't bother brighter.
He's something special.
Oh,

412
00:25:00.571 --> 00:25:03.140
and guess what?
Now he's training full time,
moved to Albuquerque.

413
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.430
Have you seen his Instagram?
Because Instagram is Bali house in Albuquerque.

414
00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.700
That means there's no distractions.
He's trading full time.
Oh,

415
00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:15.500
he thought he was good before.
Enjoy that.
Beautiful.
Um,

416
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.040
you know,
I'd say the same thing about Anthony Johnson.
He,
yeah,
you can.
Yeah,

417
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:23.040
you can.
Antioch,
we've Seen Anthony Lewis though.
We've seen Bruce,

418
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:24.800
we've seen issues in Anthony's game.

419
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.150
We've never seen an issue in Jon Jones game ever.
That's true.
Well,
you know what,

420
00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:33.620
we have that one aspect of Andrew Johnson's game that you can't neglect when you

421
00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:36.250
talk about him.
That's the fucking extreme weight cut.

422
00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.170
And it used to make sure who made the most extreme way cut in the sport.

423
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.640
Have we used to all see him walking around and hotels in between fights and he

424
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:44.380
would be,

425
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:49.380
he fucking normous who'd be like 220230240 two I saw him at two 40.

426
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.500
Oh my God.
And then he would fight at one 70.
Why?

427
00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:01.630
Why the fuck didn't so and sit them down like you're cutting 80 pounds.

428
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:05.740
Why don't we relax,
homey?
Why don't you pick somewhere else?
What are you doing?

429
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.710
What's the thought process that he likes?
Being a bully is how it is,
man.

430
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.370
I think why the fuck else would,
I mean,
what are you doing?
Well,

431
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:14.990
you know this also here.
How about this?

432
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:19.880
Some guys think that they're not doing all they can do to be a champion and
less,

433
00:26:19.881 --> 00:26:23.990
they cut as much weight as they can to get to a lower weight as they can.

434
00:26:23.991 --> 00:26:28.040
They think it's a part of this is that they think it's a part of the discipline

435
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:30.830
of being a fighter that you have to make that weight and they look at it as a

436
00:26:30.831 --> 00:26:33.560
badge of courage when he's,
they have to.
He's mess weight.

437
00:26:33.561 --> 00:26:36.680
So many times someone was just be like,
Yo,
how about Weidman then?

438
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.190
What do you think about Wyman?
Wyman has a hard cut 2085 he makes it,

439
00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:44.310
he makes it pretty pretty well.
He's obviously the most professional

440
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.500
<v 0>because he's the champion,
right?
He always gets on weight,
even in the fuckers.</v>

441
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.850
Never missed it though.
That's almost missed it or he didn't almost miss it,

442
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:55.590
but he had a really hard time with it.
In the fight with the fuck's his name?

443
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:59.880
An Italian boxer.
Oh,
of Philippi?
No,
no,
no,
no.
I suck.

444
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:04.580
Uraba or us the car.
Remember that?

445
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.800
Legionaries Alessio Succar he took that fight.

446
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.630
I think that was on like a real short notice to pat fight in the Maya

447
00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:14.080
[inaudible] super short notice.
That's what it was.

448
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.720
Me and Maya fight and it's on TV.
That was eight days.
Yeah.
That's different.

449
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:22.460
That was it.
That wasn't the legionaries fighty crushed him,
right?
Yeah.
Crushed.

450
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.860
Maya went to decisions short notice and it was a stand up fight.

451
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.460
Most of the time that was,
that was when Ray Longo was yelling at his corner.

452
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.420
I saw what you've got through at the fucking way and if you can lose that kind

453
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:37.500
of way can you can get through this.
Just give him the pep talk during the fight.

454
00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:39.450
Yeah.
How great is Ray Longo?

455
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.480
The thing with the Maci er with a Weidman though is there's,

456
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.520
again,
there's no holes in his game.
It's Anthony Johnson.

457
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:49.200
We've seen him cut weight and there's holes in his game.

458
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:53.700
Has Tried Min that we haven't seen you yet.
Man.
Mother fuckers and animal.

459
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.753
He's an animal.

460
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.350
He's a special type of long island animal that you never want to have a fight

461
00:27:58.351 --> 00:28:03.030
with at a bar.
How about his boy?
I Quinta.
It's crazy.
I love it.
I love that.

462
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.250
Was there to interview him?
Man would love that.
When he was like,

463
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.010
fuck you mean fuck you.
I loved it.
He didn't get in trouble for that.
Right?

464
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.280
I don't know.
Now that should give him a bonus.
I agree.
I will.

465
00:28:14.281 --> 00:28:16.320
Thousand dollars wanted to get,
if I was there,

466
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:19.710
I wanted to climb through the fucking screen and interview them.
I wanted to,

467
00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:25.290
I wanted to like,
like when he was hitting fact saying fuck you.
I wanted to like,

468
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.660
first of all he wasn't his fault.

469
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.700
You know who the fighter and he's not the judge.
He went on and gave,

470
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.710
he gave it his all.
Jon.
Anik was like,
okay,

471
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:38.350
it looks like we've got some curse words here.
Yeah,
just shut.
It's like,

472
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.840
all right,
take care.
All right.
I don't even ask him to stay.

473
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:45.210
I would have congratulated him on I really tough fight.

474
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:48.000
It was a great five and just score the fight.
I thought Mazda,

475
00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:50.850
I'll probably edged him.
Oh,
I disagree.
Really know.

476
00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:53.520
I had al winning two and three I think.

477
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.760
I thought the first round was pretty dominant from Moscow,

478
00:28:56.761 --> 00:29:01.440
from dominant from Hungary and I think the the other two rounds I find Mosfet al

479
00:29:01.441 --> 00:29:03.960
did just enough.
Who?
I disagree.
No,
I didn't.

480
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.290
I didn't think it was nearly as dominant as the first round.
I would have to go.

481
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:10.390
I would like to go over it again.
Watch it with you.
Let's do that.
Let's go do it.

482
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.000
We'll watch it after the fight.
That'd be cool.

483
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.420
Would you say a metal doll is a ten eight first round?

484
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.420
I could see it being a draw.
If you want to go that route.
I can see a draw.

485
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:20.910
If you give it ten eight that first one I think that definitely should be a

486
00:29:20.911 --> 00:29:22.620
wider disparity in scoring.

487
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:27.270
If that is a ten nine but then the less the last two rounds were also ten nine.

488
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.630
I agree.
Fight demonstrates it.
Right.

489
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.850
That fight demonstrates the difference between the first round,

490
00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:36.150
the domination that Mosfet all showed that first round and then the really

491
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.350
debatable second and third round.
Mosler adult kindness.
It's coasted though,

492
00:29:40.351 --> 00:29:42.100
especially the round.
And the second

493
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.820
<v 3>I thought he was losing it,
man.
Kinda did.
And he hasn't.
Well you know,
who knows.</v>

494
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.250
This is the thing dude.
You know what?
As much as I knew what you mean,

495
00:29:48.251 --> 00:29:50.410
you never know what the fuck's going on with these guys when they get into,

496
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:53.080
he could have been clipped.
He could've been clipped in the second round.

497
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:55.360
We don't know when he was coasting cause he just wasn't there.

498
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.450
Well it could have been that he was hurt in training.
He could have been oh,

499
00:29:58.451 --> 00:30:02.380
big huge knee.
Oh Sham.
Nice central.
We don't,

500
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:07.100
we haven't mentioned this fight once,
now.
Route once or rude.
Let me,
uh,

501
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.060
let me find out what fight.
This is
where the worst commentators ever.
The main,

502
00:30:12.061 --> 00:30:16.570
main co main event is the bomb.
Um,
yeah.
Especially the co main event.

503
00:30:16.571 --> 00:30:18.850
That's the best fight on the card.
Which one's that?

504
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.030
That's min awall verse the the Polish cat.

505
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:26.710
The Polish cad is beaten a lot of UFC guys and a lot of people don't know.
Yes.

506
00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.160
Um,
he beat Houston.
Alexandra,
you put up the card,

507
00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:33.220
like the full card so we could see what the whole main card is.
This is a,

508
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:37.120
we're right now we're watching Palo Powell block and Sheldon Wescott.

509
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.550
It looks like a good fucking fight so far,

510
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.450
but we were talking about all kinds of other shit.
First of all,

511
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:46.870
I got to go back to this Roy Nelson thing and strongly disagree that he gets a

512
00:30:46.871 --> 00:30:48.310
full style bro.

513
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:52.790
Get a stylist and the rest of these guys proper SEO look like assholes.

514
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.030
He looks like Royal Goddamn Nelson.

515
00:30:55.031 --> 00:30:58.840
He's a fabulous human being and not everybody has to be metro.
Not Everybody.

516
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:01.720
I'm just saying a beautiful UNC can hire me as a stylist.

517
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.860
The first thing I'll do is go to Joanna,
the 150 pound champ.
I'm like,
yeah,
that,

518
00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:10.060
that business a button up your wind.
Let's get rid of that.
Let's ditch that.

519
00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.680
You know,
I'm saying
that's hilarious Roy.

520
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.890
No more tee shirts.
Belize.
Genzler would be Roy.

521
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.740
I love Roy.
God love her too,
man.
He's alive.
God loved the what's next for him?

522
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.480
Um,
that's a good question.
Last over.
The more unique characters we have,

523
00:31:28.481 --> 00:31:31.840
the better,
you know,
that's fine.
He can dress nice and be a character.

524
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.600
You don't have to look like fucking,
they like they just booked a fight for him.

525
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:41.710
God dammit.
You see that documentary?
The chic yet the chic?
Yeah,

526
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:45.620
the iron sheik documentary.
No,
this documentary.
Good.
I love me.

527
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.280
So I was into the WWE.

528
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:53.080
I was in the WWE just watch culture high by the way.
It's pretty good.
Dope.

529
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:58.170
If I could,
I would do it,
but I would,
I mean I was like,
damn,
I'm fro,

530
00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.590
we'd iron sheik story.

531
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:04.180
Did the iron sheik story is fucking amazing.
You know,
he was,

532
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.480
he was an Iranian national champion wrestler.

533
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:13.390
Jet Wrestle ended up being a body guard for the Shah,
the Shah.

534
00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:17.080
I love the wrestlers and the top Iranian wrestlers and the May,

535
00:32:17.081 --> 00:32:19.660
his main body guard dude,
I forget his name,

536
00:32:19.661 --> 00:32:24.070
but he was the best Iranian wrestle ever and he was his main body guard.

537
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:27.790
The Shah,
that dude ended up committing suicide.

538
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.020
So everyone thought,
oh shit,
he got killed.
So the iron sheik,

539
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:34.760
he was one of the bodyguards.
He decided to bolt

540
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.050
bolted the Minnesota.
I'll

541
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:44.100
<v 5>scan yet,
but he was the second best wrestler and I,</v>

542
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.580
and I ran and he started teaching,
um,
the Olympic wrestling team,
number one,

543
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.610
he was really good.
Um,
and you,
you know,
you know,

544
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.400
it's crazy.
You know why he,
he wasn't even like a,
you know,

545
00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:01.000
how his character is the iron sheik with that would look,

546
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.750
what did they call those head pieces,
what are they call it or whatever.

547
00:33:04.751 --> 00:33:09.290
That wasn't a turban.
And he was
totally western.
I ran,

548
00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:11.810
was totally Westernized.
He had nothing to do with any of that.

549
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:14.310
None of those guys are like that.
He was like,
he was arrested,

550
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.440
was an athlete he did where he was a regular dude.
He didn't,
he wasn't like that.

551
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.040
But once he slowly started getting into pro wrestling in Minnesota,

552
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:24.590
he would coach like the college team live.

553
00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.290
And there were national champions five years in a row.

554
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.310
He was an amazing restaurant at University of Minnesota.
Yes.
Oh,

555
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.790
somewhere in Minnesota and,
and for the Olympic team.
And he was,

556
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.610
he was the man in wrestling and he started getting into pro wrestling,

557
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.380
not as iron sheet,
just as an American,
a Limpic,

558
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.300
a coach type.
He was an American,

559
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.600
but he was really an Iranian so that someone told him,
his wife told me,
he goes,

560
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.300
you should,
his wife suggested that he,
he,

561
00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:55.130
he uses that debt because,
uh,
because she likes money.
Well,

562
00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.700
we were in that Iran.
Exactly right.
Wrestling's great.

563
00:33:58.701 --> 00:34:02.390
Why don't we make some fucking money?
And you get a personality at that time.

564
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:06.500
At that time,
yeah.
Wrestlers are death row.

565
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.273
That's when we were at,

566
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:12.010
we were about to go to war with Iran back then and everybody,
you know,

567
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:16.850
the whole [inaudible] thing.
So she,
they took advantage of that.

568
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:20.420
They jumped on that.
How crazy is that to suit him though?

569
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:25.640
In America?
He loved it.
He loved,
he loved being the heel.
Really.

570
00:34:25.641 --> 00:34:28.910
He started blowing up in Minnesota.
Then Vince Mcmahon heard about this.

571
00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:33.380
The reason why he ended up being,
listen,
the reason why I ended up being,

572
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.780
you know,
getting the championship belt,
he'd be Bob Backlund.

573
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.240
But the way that Shit's decided,
they talk about this and the,
and uh,

574
00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:44.460
I mean openly about how these Bob Backlund was the American WWF champion and

575
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.710
they want to hell again dude.
What

576
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:55.010
they wanted to bring in Hulk Ho Kogan how are we going to make him a champion?

577
00:34:55.011 --> 00:34:58.970
Vince man,
big man goes,
well,
he can't beat the American champion.

578
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:02.540
We need a villain to come in to beat Bob Backlund.

579
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.670
So then Hulk Hogan saves the day.

580
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.790
We have a villain champion for like a year or two and then I'll say,

581
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.150
and then it blows up.
So they needed the perfect villain.
They fucking found it.

582
00:35:11.151 --> 00:35:13.470
They find I found iron sheik perfect time.

583
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:18.580
The crazy thing about iron sheik is he wouldn't lose because in reality he knew

584
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.910
he could beat everybody here.
Something real restless.
Yes,
exactly.

585
00:35:22.911 --> 00:35:25.790
So they're like Brock,
they all respect even hulk Hogan,
they all,

586
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.620
they all talk about this in the documentary.

587
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.700
The reason why the iron sheik was the only one that would beat him was hulk

588
00:35:34.221 --> 00:35:37.980
Hogan because he was the best wrestler.
He

589
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.530
<v 3>gets fucking hole and they all know it.
They all knew it.
So he took,</v>

590
00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:44.910
and Hulk Hogan says this,
you know,
it says iron.
She could beat it.

591
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:47.670
He could beat anybody in any room for real.

592
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.270
So for him to lay down for me and let me and pass the torch to me,

593
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.240
that created Hulkamania,
him passing the torch.

594
00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:00.210
I actually had a
real

595
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.620
gentlemen,
you're going to see this and have you seen it?
It's the best.

596
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.800
So much sadness and that that wouldn't have been no whole combined glorious

597
00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:14.370
smell areas still looks good.

598
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:19.260
I watched it a few seconds of what I getting a steak suck.
I be still yoked

599
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.030
dude.
Oklahoma called with the arms were huge.

600
00:36:23.031 --> 00:36:27.840
Still fucking Yo yo grounds here.
It's like a weird,

601
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.070
that's a weird love triangle with something someone got betrayed and that weird

602
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:36.480
love to put on the line like his best friend's girl or something like that.

603
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.110
They have some weird thing in the middle.
He's like,
hold on.
Nick's calling,

604
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.650
why he's getting his dick sucked checked his bone.
It's the hoaxed or man,

605
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:48.450
I'm not mad at him at all,
Larry.
No one gave a shit,
right?
That a sex tape.

606
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.770
I think if I think [inaudible] fans were like sad,

607
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:57.390
how dare you hope that if you found out that hooked did that on purpose,

608
00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.990
I'd be a bigger fan on.

609
00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.140
They talk about AI or shaping a massive coke head,

610
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.950
like he got busted with hacksaw dug in and the car they got pulled over and had

611
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:11.460
a bunch of coke and weed on him.
He met the nights.
Those two partied hard.

612
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.960
Iron Sheik is a mad party or did you see that ad for steeping meal check?

613
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:21.360
Good.
That's a fucking five big,

614
00:37:21.361 --> 00:37:24.990
big fan of Steve Bay.
Man.
After that fight with junior dos Santos,

615
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:30.060
I was like,
this guy,
he's still getting better.
He's still getting better.

616
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:34.570
He's fucking really good and still getting better.
You smiling.
Heavy waits,

617
00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:39.480
son of a bitch.
Competitive motherfucker.
I think,
don't get me wrong,

618
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.480
Steve Bay's a fucking monster.
He's a monster.

619
00:37:42.481 --> 00:37:45.990
I think that fight was more of Dos Santos,

620
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.570
the Cain Velasquez fights took its toll on him.

621
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.340
A lot of people believe that that's a little bit of speculation.

622
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.110
Surgery every other week.
And he uh,
he's,
he's definitely beat up.

623
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:59.520
I've heard that for that speculation.
He boy,
no girls fighting again.

624
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.190
It's truth.
Wow.
Why are boy

625
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.250
well we both love him.
Your love,
all of us love him.
Fuck yeah.

626
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.120
You know it's level.
It's one of those,

627
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.410
it's hard to watch.

628
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:18.210
They'll do real legends like that breaks your heart going out like the Roy

629
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:19.500
Nelson fight was hard for me to watch.

630
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.360
That was a hot was the worst fight I've ever seen.

631
00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:25.320
The words fight where it's like,
oh my God,
it was like a shotgun going off.
Yeah.

632
00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:29.730
When he got chaos,
you know,
it was,
it was tough to watch.

633
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:33.720
I told you man,
when,
when little nog fought Anthony Johnson,

634
00:38:33.721 --> 00:38:35.960
I was in the back warm and Pat Cummings up cause there's

635
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:40.450
<v 0>corn pat for that fight and he was just so beat up,
his body was so beat up,</v>

636
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:44.500
he couldn't hit myth.
He was just sitting down like we are now.
Wow.

637
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.180
Burt comes by and Albert goes,
fine.
The whole Europe,
no sweats.

638
00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:52.630
Walks up fucking Christmas stair walks up,
goes out there,

639
00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:56.680
gets fucking annihilated.
Or do you think that he's just had too many fights?

640
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:00.670
Yeah.
Too much training time.
Too much.
Too much,
too many wars in the gym.

641
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:03.710
Too many wars in the octagon.
Tom,
I won the best ever man.
Yeah.

642
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.270
So back to that Jamie Varner thing.
Jamie Varner was saying that,
um,

643
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:13.030
he believes he's having,
he's had about 30 concussions.
Dirty.
Yeah.
Or maybe more.

644
00:39:13.031 --> 00:39:15.460
That's what is his doctor fight?
Estimated.

645
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:20.230
I don't know how his doctor estimated that they did MRI brain scan if they,

646
00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:22.420
I dunno what they did,
but whatever it was,

647
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:26.070
his doctor urged him to retire and uh,
you know,

648
00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:30.100
then he started talking about cognitive issues,
memory issues,

649
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:30.970
things along those lines.

650
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.840
Then he sees a cognitive therapist once a week to deal with them.

651
00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.770
This guy's got Jujitsu,
man.
It's very good.

652
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:43.060
I can't name too many fighters should have retired rank where I'm like,
God damn,

653
00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:47.110
that guy's sharp.
You're doing really well.
My man,
I can't name too many.

654
00:39:47.111 --> 00:39:50.290
My Randy seems fine,
man.
When he talked to Randy,

655
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.320
Randy coture is very lucid.
He's fine.

656
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.960
And he had his last fight really late in life.

657
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.230
I think he was 48 his last fight.
It's true.

658
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:01.150
And what he started competing at what,

659
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:06.151
42 36 I believe it was his first UFC fight.

660
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:11.140
I was there.
That was in the home over here.
That was in,

661
00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:13.840
who the fuck was my hair was lush.
It's fucking dope.

662
00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.230
He got a rear naked choke and his first UFC,
Randy couture.
Um,

663
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:23.200
Randy coture.
I remember he took the Tony Halma.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He tried to,

664
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:27.220
to Tony Hama and he fought this other dude too that night that had real promise.

665
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.430
I forgot the gentleman's name.
Did he get his back?
He got his back as well.
Right.

666
00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.500
Um,
I don't remember what he did to him.

667
00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:37.120
He might've mounted him and grounded pounded him.
But the Tony Hama one was big,

668
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:41.590
right hand ducked under.
It.
Took him down.
Had is well with them towards a legend.

669
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:46.120
What Stud?
How about when Liotta kicked his tooth out and he's like,

670
00:40:46.121 --> 00:40:47.710
you know what,
I'm done with this bullshit.

671
00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.210
He's like enough and kicked it delays God damn movies

672
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:58.450
about to do some expandable series.
Spendable 67 yeah,
he's an animal.

673
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.700
I feel real bad that he in the UFC had that falling out was because of a son to

674
00:41:03.701 --> 00:41:06.610
write poems.
He cornered his son or some shit like that.
Right.

675
00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.320
Well I don't know if you can quantify stones right out,

676
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:15.250
but I think the thing that kicked it into overdrive,

677
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:17.110
I think there was a few issues over the years,

678
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:20.710
whether the thing that kicked it into overdrive was him doing that Bella tour

679
00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:25.120
show.
Yeah,
that'll do it.
Yeah.
After they put him in the UFC hall of fame,

680
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:29.350
he signed up to do that Bella tour show and you know,
was asked to show,

681
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.630
you know,
man,
we all different opinions about these things.

682
00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:38.840
You thought the show was good?
No,
no,
no.
Nothing.
I can wait.
I didn't watch it.

683
00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:39.230
Honestly.

684
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.290
I mean different opinions about like whether or not he should have been able to

685
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:46.210
go in to some rival organization and pump up the organization.

686
00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:51.530
So,
you know,
it's debatable.
It's tough.
He was a champion of one organization.

687
00:41:51.531 --> 00:41:55.130
They,
he but you kind of do what you gotta do,
man.
If people offer you some money,

688
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:59.060
you know,
and you have an opportunity to give him a stipend after he's retired.

689
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.870
I got weird feelings on um,

690
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.220
on competitiveness and a MMA right now,

691
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:08.950
competition amongst organizations in MMA.

692
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:13.610
And my weird feeling is I didn't get,
I don't think it's necessary.
I don't think,

693
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:17.840
and I think it will be a lot less of this now that Scott Coker is over at Bella

694
00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.810
[inaudible] a lot less.
Yeah,
he goes up.
I don't think so man.

695
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:23.290
All your crazy hostility.
It's not going to go,

696
00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.210
I disagree because bell towards it can get bigger.
Yeah.

697
00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:28.940
It's going to get picked up.
Cokers legit.
He is legit,

698
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.790
but I think the UFC likes him.
You know,

699
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.000
they worked with him when he was the owner strike force and it is possible.

700
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:40.790
That was then,
yeah,
it is.
It's all fun and games till till the bell tours.

701
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:44.390
A legit threat.
Have you watched bell lately?
Yeah,
I watched it last night.

702
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:47.800
You don't Miss One?
I don't miss a UFC.
You don't even know I'm UFC today.
I die.

703
00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:52.540
I don't miss one dude.
The uh,
I enjoyed it.
Um,
Marcin held.

704
00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.270
He's got some fucking nasty Jujitsu.
Jesus Christ.
How about your boy?

705
00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.520
Did Joe Schilling,
how about Joe Schilling is good fight.

706
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.340
He thought he won the fight after it was over edge.
Blog.

707
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.630
Do like these you're going to eat.
We've got to remember.
Um,
Brooks,

708
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:11.390
he won the fight.
It was a very close fight.
Super close.

709
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:13.790
He'd think takedowns a tough,
yeah.
Shilling did more damage,

710
00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:16.220
but the dude did get dominant position on him a bunch of times,

711
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:20.150
which shouldn't mean as much,
but it does oftentimes the way they scored it does.

712
00:43:20.151 --> 00:43:23.150
When the guy's on top of you and sigh control for prolonged periods of time,

713
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:27.440
for whatever reason,
that's worth a lot.
Even if he doesn't hurt you.
It is,

714
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:28.700
but it probably shouldn't be.

715
00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.930
We should probably figure out like what is what is actually it was one thing

716
00:43:32.931 --> 00:43:33.950
where you're controlling a guy,

717
00:43:33.951 --> 00:43:36.230
but if you're controlling guy and you're not getting any damage done,

718
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.290
what difference does that make?
Like is it,

719
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:42.710
is it 50% of controlling guy and doing damage that lasts than that?
Well,

720
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.620
you've got to quantify it.

721
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:48.630
The one positive thing I saw and Bella Tours when I'm homeboy Emanuel fought

722
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.280
who?
He just lost to the Henzel Gracie guy and Newton.

723
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.680
The Manual Newton.
Yeah,
and he just lost it.
Yeah,
I didn't see that fight.

724
00:43:57.681 --> 00:44:01.220
I missed you watch that fight a manual took the guy down a ton and the guy was

725
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:05.150
so active off his back triangle armbars so active and they gave him the win

726
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.810
because he's just threatening nonstop.
Nonstop.
You know who does that?

727
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.100
Charles Olivera.
Yes.
Ooh,
you get that kid on is a nightmare on his back.

728
00:44:13.101 --> 00:44:16.910
Feet and back.
He's scrambling on his back.
You know what cowboys?
Similar.

729
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:20.750
We don't see how boys very simply how boys God game is nasty.

730
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:23.340
That's what I'm interested in seeing.
This fight.
He badgering.

731
00:44:23.341 --> 00:44:27.700
If cowboy could submit Habib.
He say good cove.
Milby days.

732
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.060
Good googly Mowgli.
That is a tough fucking fight.
Tough.

733
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.520
<v 3>That's a tough fucking fight for both guys.
Speaking a tough fight.</v>

734
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:39.060
I saw a fucking,
uh,
Machida yesterday.
Spar five rounds.

735
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.820
Like it was nothing.
Not Shit.

736
00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:47.350
10 really that fights in two weeks to how's he look best I've ever seen it.

737
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:53.430
Do you do what you think about a professional?
What?
Yeah.
Fuck we has to be,

738
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:57.390
he doesn't have much time left man.
You know,
I mean you think he's 36,

739
00:44:57.391 --> 00:45:00.630
37 years old.
There's athletic prime is probably,

740
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:03.390
you know right now is about maintaining the,

741
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.310
the super high level he's at right now.

742
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.290
But like biologically in this day and age without taking anything,
you're,

743
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:12.420
you're going to start to the dummy branch that,

744
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:16.410
that pretty significant diminish diminishment,
Tony man though there's,

745
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.020
there's no one more professional in him.
He's awesome.

746
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.660
Can you do a documentary on Liotta just called the professional.

747
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.710
The mother fuckers just,

748
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:27.540
he's a legit Marshall rs 365 days a year.
Yeah.

749
00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:30.660
He's a super nice guy.
He's still drink urine.
Hey,

750
00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:32.970
how dare you think how they bring that up?
No,

751
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:37.080
I think someone schooled him on that.
They're,
you can't be drinking piss and I'm,

752
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:41.550
I drink my piss a couple of times.
I tried it like a a month.

753
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.480
Did you really try to tried it a few times?
Tried it too.

754
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.200
After I saw Machita dude,
I was like,
shit,
I'm just going to heat this show.

755
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:51.060
Really it's not that big a deal.
You know?
Everybody makes it out.

756
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:52.770
That is a big deal.
It's your own piss.
I'd really,

757
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.790
I did it and it with a Dj on the radio and he almost threw up was hilarious.

758
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.940
Really stupid.
No name in San Francisco.
He didn't think,

759
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:02.180
I don't think he thought I was going to do it.
He was like,
Joe,

760
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.850
you drink this pice.
Well,
it's really stupid to do.
Don't do it folks,

761
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:10.910
but there is some thought that certain vitamins or antioxidants,

762
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:14.640
I forget the the rap.
I would never do it if I read about it today.

763
00:46:14.641 --> 00:46:15.990
But when I did it back in the day,

764
00:46:15.991 --> 00:46:18.390
I was a little bit more susceptible to the Internet.

765
00:46:18.391 --> 00:46:21.980
Has schooled me on the reality of drinking Joe Piss run in the UFC.

766
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.990
I saw the Cheetah do and I started thinking piss man.
That's how it goes.

767
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.920
There's the way I look at it.
I,
I don't know shit about why um,

768
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.670
we can't just piss out of our asses.
Why do we need our dicks to,
uh,

769
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:37.980
get rid of liquid waste?
I mean,
that's a sign this is coming from

770
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:45.930
your peers is designed to clean that important.

771
00:46:45.931 --> 00:46:50.931
You're re throw out multiple times a day cleaning bacteria so that it can't,

772
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:55.530
that you're pissed can't be filled with bacteria.
It's cleaner.

773
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.910
It's cleaning your dick out.

774
00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:00.720
That's your body made cleaner for your Dick to keep it clean.
Shut.

775
00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:04.350
When you shoot out sperm,
it's healthy and clean.
Dude,
you should be a scientist.

776
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:07.860
I straight up.
That's my guess.
That's my guide upside to this.

777
00:47:07.861 --> 00:47:12.240
That's my gas at two out about 10 tickets in or that you don't think that makes

778
00:47:12.241 --> 00:47:13.980
sense?
It does a little.
I guess

779
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:19.980
there has to be a special reason for pes are otherwise we just piss out of our

780
00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:22.050
asses.
Every animal does it that way too.

781
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.230
But women don't ejaculate and they pee out of their vaginas too.

782
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.070
So that's some of that.
Throw a wrench into it.
No,
no,
no.

783
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.380
Cause everyone's born a woman.
Everyone's not born a woman.

784
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:37.090
Everyone's hatched a woman.
That's when you are a,
when you're an embryo,

785
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.840
every one's a woman.
That's why we all nipples.
Yeah.

786
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.730
Whatever the difference in the chromosomes are.
You know,

787
00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:47.610
obviously I'm doing a shitty job with the biology here,
but you know,
we're x,
y.

788
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.150
That's what men are.
I've always said this,
snacks hits that.
Y gets established.

789
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:56.920
Testosterone kicks into gear,
dit,
dit,
dit,
and you become a boy.

790
00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:01.020
But everything in the beginning,
every embryo,
whatever it is,
every now and then,

791
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:06.130
what starts out as a female to be obsessed with Dick size?

792
00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:11.380
No.
When it comes to women to less than nothing.
Yeah,

793
00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:16.570
it's there's,
there's a void.
There's nothing that,
it's nothing.
It's a whole,

794
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:18.940
it goes in and there's a void.

795
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:22.240
Have you heard of that lady valor then the navy seal?
What do you mean?

796
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.370
I'm just trying to and hold on.
No,
no,
no.

797
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.470
I'm just trying to figure out what you're saying.
You know,
God,

798
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.420
when a girl likes a guy guy's private parts,
there's actually a six,
seven,

799
00:48:34.421 --> 00:48:38.020
eight,
eight inches of a thing that they have to,
you know,

800
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:42.940
for some reason they liked the way it looks,
I don't like.
But when it comes to,

801
00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.030
when it comes to female genitalia,

802
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:51.250
we are obsessed with avoid.
There's nothing.
Not only is there no eight inches,

803
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:54.160
but it goes eight inches deep of nothingness.

804
00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:58.090
So there's just a void that we have to,
I don't know.
We're obsessed with.

805
00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:00.730
That doesn't make any sense.
Exactly.
It makes zero sense.

806
00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:06.020
Not avoid anything that grabs your finger,
dude.
That's the outer edges.
No,

807
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.920
the inside cause your finger.
He squeezes.

808
00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.760
It's like saying your mouth as a void.
It is.
It's a whole,

809
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:21.430
the vacuum bro.
Raiders,
stone biology.
Rent of all time.
Hold up.

810
00:49:21.431 --> 00:49:26.410
Why the fuck that's a jockey.
Ravers Chris Kamozi.
Where's my boy?
Fucking,
oh,

811
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:31.230
that's right.
You didn't hear him?
Yeah,
he got hurt.
No fucking way,

812
00:49:31.231 --> 00:49:34.870
man got hurt.
He got hurt a couple of days ago already fought.

813
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:35.960
Chuck writes a minimum,

814
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:40.210
like three second Kamozi gets a rematch on fucking Fox.

815
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:46.470
Good for him.
He's a Denver boy.
I like shit,
dude.

816
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:50.560
He brings it one day.
Boom.
Big Brown up in there.

817
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.930
Two Oh five one day.

818
00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:00.040
Joseph.
I'm trying to figure out,

819
00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:02.290
trying to figure out the rankings here.

820
00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:06.970
Did you hear big brown mentioned two oh five yeah.

821
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:12.100
What do you weigh right now I'm about to 47 I've lost six pounds in a week.

822
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:16.160
How does it feel to lose six pounds?
Glorious.
Does it feel good?
I feel great.

823
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:18.460
You feel physically good?
Great.
What did you do?

824
00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:23.380
Would you change just calories or the tallies?
I buy food.
I was doing it myself,

825
00:50:23.381 --> 00:50:26.110
you know,
for like two or three months and you just can't do that man.

826
00:50:26.111 --> 00:50:27.980
So I hired a and

827
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.250
<v 0>do they prepare the meals for you and every drop him off every Sunday meals.</v>

828
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:35.360
Water plan,
everything.
I checked in with them all the time.

829
00:50:35.361 --> 00:50:36.850
So you easier that way,
right?

830
00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:41.930
Wazer so do you help one of those body fat tasks and a body composition test?

831
00:50:42.411 --> 00:50:45.260
Do they do that stuff too?
No.
No he can.
I just,

832
00:50:45.261 --> 00:50:46.730
I don't want to drive out there to all that shit.

833
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:49.040
The good thing with those is those are numbers.
You know,

834
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:50.540
you get it down on paper.

835
00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:53.210
You got to make sure that you're hydrated because those things,
the,

836
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:57.560
the equipment that they use,
unless they're dunking you,
it can,

837
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:58.940
it can be a little fuckery.

838
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.160
There's always like a plus or minus 3% on those things.
Right.
Those bod pods,

839
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:08.180
I think they say the calpers,
the little pinchy things like the least effective,

840
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:12.170
the most effective is the flotation.
This is a bad motherfucker.
Jimmy Manoa.

841
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.350
He is a bad model.

842
00:51:13.351 --> 00:51:17.300
Only losses to Augusta to these aren't even doing MMA for like six years.

843
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:20.840
He's like,
he's like a straight off the street,
right?
Yes.

844
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.060
Got It.
Dan Athlete for sure.
It's a nasty striker dude.

845
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:30.860
Serious fucking power.
This Jan Dude's no punk man hit.
He's no guys.

846
00:51:30.861 --> 00:51:34.830
And then Jimmy,
Jimmy,
you have to call in on.
Is His name?
[inaudible].

847
00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.380
How do they see cousin goes here,
Colorado.
Call them fucking Jan.
All right.

848
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:43.520
Where's he from?
He's from Poland.
This is his hometown.
Colorado in Denver,

849
00:51:43.521 --> 00:51:47.840
Colorado.
Recom Jan,
but it's probably young for sure.
He said he had,
yeah,

850
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:52.750
so Yans Houston Alexander,
he's be Soca Jew.
He beat you.
Remember that?

851
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:57.170
Uh,
what's his fucking name?
How relic Chiarella dude going yell.
Rally.
Yeah.

852
00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:00.950
Well you ask Croatian beat him.
What happened to that dude?

853
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:03.800
That dude has potential,
right?
He had skills.

854
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:06.470
I think he's just think about him today.
Thank you.
Got Injured.

855
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:11.030
His standup was nasty.
He was a mean dude and he was really good.

856
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:14.150
I think a man who was the favorite.

857
00:52:14.151 --> 00:52:17.960
I'm taking my boy Yan as we call them in Denver.
Strong words.

858
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:22.610
John Words for I know Colorado Kid.
What?

859
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:29.300
I guess this guy's just a Harrell out there in Poland is it might see my

860
00:52:29.301 --> 00:52:33.020
feelings about this whole bellatore UFC thing is it doesn't have to be some

861
00:52:33.021 --> 00:52:35.360
crazy fucking hatred between the organizations.

862
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:38.300
Everybody would benefit if everybody benefits.

863
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:42.710
I really believe that the sport of MMA still has room to grow.

864
00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:48.100
And I think that a big organization that is alongside the UFC is not a bad thing

865
00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.360
and it's a very good thing for the athletes.
It's a very,

866
00:52:51.361 --> 00:52:54.500
it's great for the athletes spare for the athletes in the UFC.

867
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:55.970
It's very good for the athletes.

868
00:52:56.210 --> 00:53:01.210
I think the UFC is obviously above and beyond in terms of like,

869
00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.730
the talent is,
it's not even close,

870
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:08.540
but it's not a bad thing to have [inaudible] around.
I think they do a great job.

871
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:11.600
I enjoyed the shit out of the fights.
Yeah,
I like them in.
I don't miss them.

872
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:15.170
I enjoy the shit out of Joe Shellings fight.
That was a great Joe Schilling.

873
00:53:15.171 --> 00:53:18.370
Does Gloria and Bella Tony's house fucking dope beast.

874
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:23.630
That dude is a star rate up savage.
He's a straight killer.

875
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:27.510
Super talented and a real good dude too.
Real good dude.

876
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:31.070
How many it was bell tour guys you think would come into the UFC and welcome

877
00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.320
Cindy?
Well,
not many.
Um,
you know what man?

878
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.930
You really don't know until they get in there.
You don't know.

879
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:40.530
Eddie Alvarez.
What?

880
00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:44.510
He fought Donald and Donald was on point just saying Donald was on point with

881
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:49.350
any lost again.
Yeah,
he did.
Including was again too.

882
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

883
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:53.230
<v 0>What did he lose to Henderson?</v>

884
00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:57.970
Look at all the fighters that strike force and ours is different.

885
00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.400
I feel like that flight got canceled.
Maybe you're right.

886
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:03.940
Did Eddie get hurt in that?
Cause that's a hell of a surprise.

887
00:54:03.941 --> 00:54:07.990
Why can I not remember that?
I can't remember.
We'd head shots.

888
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.620
All right.
Let's see.
You've been saying

889
00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:17.920
this is your best fight on the card right here.
Yeah,
I agree.
Well,
you know what?

890
00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:22.120
I'm very curious to see what happens in the main event.
I am too cause 2003

891
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:24.170
<v 1>can you still see the Sweden?</v>

892
00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:29.320
<v 0>Yeah.
It's just we keep Pete,
we're already at the Co main event.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

893
00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:33.580
There's not that many fights.
Is this a two hour show?
No,

894
00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:36.793
<v 1>I think so,</v>

895
00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.020
<v 0>man.
We've been here one hour and we're already at the Co main event.</v>

896
00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:45.760
That's weird.
I also fight pests.
Yeah.

897
00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:50.520
Eddie Alvarez lost a cowboy and they lost one more.
Okay.

898
00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.590
The last fights for Benson were Brandon.

899
00:54:53.591 --> 00:54:58.480
Thatch and then the Donald Cowboy Cerrone fight and then Hofeld dos Anjos.

900
00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.110
I feel dos Anjos making fights up everybody.
Yeah,

901
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.430
I think that was a fight that was scheduled.

902
00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:08.410
Supposed to happen and take place at his last fight because he's lost two.

903
00:55:08.411 --> 00:55:12.580
I thought I didn't know that he lost to,
why do I not remember that?

904
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:17.680
You can just say
I love Google.
God,

905
00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:18.514
it's awesome.

906
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:20.103
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

907
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.780
<v 0>Oh,
Serone beat him and then who beat him after Serone though?</v>

908
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:30.990
<v 1>You'd beat Michael Gym.
I go to fight.</v>

909
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:34.530
<v 0>Know Michael Chandler.
Chandler was in Beltour.
Yeah,</v>

910
00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:37.340
you in UFC when you are who you looking at?
Jamie?

911
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:38.490
<v 1>Sorry.
Eddie Alvarez.</v>

912
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.710
<v 0>Yeah.
He beat Michael Chandler to leave Bella tour.
Yeah.
It just says yes.</v>

913
00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.740
He wants seven.
I think he's only four at once,
dude.
And then he got hurt.

914
00:55:46.741 --> 00:55:49.630
He was supposed to fight Ben,
right?
Yeah.
I don't think he's dumb.

915
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:51.150
Fight Pass went down again.

916
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:56.570
Mostly fipass fipass it keeps kicking me off and I have to re log in.

917
00:55:58.330 --> 00:55:59.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

918
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.800
<v 0>This is really dumb.
I'm going to sign in with Facebook,</v>

919
00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:05.510
see if it makes a difference.

920
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.090
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.</v>

921
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:13.680
<v 0>Powerful.
Jimmy Martin.
Noah.
I love listening to the European commentators.</v>

922
00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:17.100
Yeah,
you're really,
they talk is only one fight was Donald.

923
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:20.460
You're trying to give him more losses because he's so handsome.
Dude.

924
00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:23.920
His eyebrows are on point.
He's beautiful.
He for sure gets those waxed.

925
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.580
I'm mom really excited to see him adjust to the higher level of competition

926
00:56:27.581 --> 00:56:31.600
cause I think he will.
You do?
Yeah.
I think you will.
Um,
I think he'd be,

927
00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:35.140
I think you'd be surprised how high he needs some work with his leg kick

928
00:56:35.141 --> 00:56:36.610
checking obviously.
Um,

929
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.300
I just don't think he ever fought a guy who has this as slick as Donald on his

930
00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:43.300
feet.
When you say higher level guys who do,
who are you talking about?

931
00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.030
I don't know,
man.
I don't know.
I see potential in them.
I mean,

932
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:48.250
it all depends on the knowledge.
That's,
that's what I was going,

933
00:56:48.251 --> 00:56:49.030
just going to say.

934
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:52.510
It all depends on how much damage he got through those Chandler fights and

935
00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:56.920
fighting in Japan forever.
Set some hard fights,
some really crazy,
crazy wars.

936
00:56:56.921 --> 00:57:01.690
He's a wild motherfucker.
I love watching him fight.
Me Too.
I love it,
man.
Yeah,

937
00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:03.430
he's wild.
Great.
But what you know,

938
00:57:03.431 --> 00:57:06.310
you know as well as I know when you have a wild style like that,

939
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:11.020
there's only so much fucking area on the board.
See that?
Yeah.

940
00:57:11.021 --> 00:57:15.160
The Michael Chan,
the feds,
the higher level where the,
the pros pros go,
okay,

941
00:57:15.161 --> 00:57:19.570
your wild check this out.
Yeah.
Well just you open yourself up,
you know,

942
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:22.030
and it makes it super exciting.
I mean,

943
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:26.080
we all know those guys who just go to a war at the beginning of every fucking

944
00:57:26.081 --> 00:57:30.380
round just,
and they're super exciting to watch.
They're a fan favorite.
Yep.

945
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:32.500
And the next thing you know,
two years down the road,

946
00:57:32.501 --> 00:57:36.010
you're fucking three and six sitting at home watching these guys who were

947
00:57:36.011 --> 00:57:39.580
winning by wrestling and being smart and you can win that way.

948
00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:40.690
That's what's kind of crazy.

949
00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:43.270
Like sometimes you can win that way and when you win that way,

950
00:57:43.271 --> 00:57:47.710
it's wild to watch.
So it's like no one,
it's,
if you win that way,

951
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:48.580
you did the right thing.

952
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:53.410
But if you want to look at it as a long term proposition,
can't fight that way.

953
00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:57.580
You can't fight that way.
There's no way the longterm position is.
Yes.

954
00:57:57.610 --> 00:57:58.900
Linda Garcia is a good example,

955
00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:01.720
but you got to remember that the amount I'll takes on your brain.
Yeah.

956
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:04.690
Leonard was just a wild mother fucker.
So fun to watch.
So down.

957
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:09.470
This one's going to be wild.
Fuck yeah,
it is.
How do you say buck quotes?

958
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:13.660
How do you say his name?
Let's just call him Yan.
Let's do this.
Yan.

959
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.530
Yan,
let's talk like when I answer the barber said,

960
00:58:16.531 --> 00:58:18.250
can I just get that chuck went to,

961
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:23.000
is there any way can just give me the truck l Yan Brockovich.

962
00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:27.010
Damn.
Yawns beat some good guys,
man.

963
00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:31.480
You gotta remember he beat that Latifi your mare.
Latifi has Manoa fought since.

964
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:34.120
Uh,
he fucked Gustafson.
Nope,
this is first fight.

965
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.300
So He's been working a lot of stuff.
Ooh.
Eaten at Gerard.

966
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:41.230
Jab by Jan.
Hard Jab.
Need a few more.

967
00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:45.310
Those on to hometowns.
It's fought here before.
I don't know,
man.

968
00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:47.050
I liked his chances,
although he's done a dog.

969
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:52.150
A good fucking job was one of the most underrated weapons,
man.
And the UFC.

970
00:58:52.151 --> 00:58:56.590
I think it's still the most underutilized tool.
Even more than kicked.

971
00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:00.130
Yeah.
I think kicks are definitely under utilized as well.
But man,

972
00:59:00.131 --> 00:59:03.010
there's something about a jab.
It's so quick and effective.
Look at Musashi,

973
00:59:03.011 --> 00:59:07.090
saucy look at GSP.
Yeah.
If you've got a real check jobs,
you can,

974
00:59:07.091 --> 00:59:09.430
you can really disrupted guys striking.

975
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:13.870
Now would you say yens stiff?
Who that no thanks.

976
00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:17.250
I liked the waste throwing that jab man.
I love the Jab.
I liked the jab.

977
00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:21.950
Jimmy's a little more loose.
Got Man.
What?
Left talk.
That was pretty,

978
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:25.070
that left hook to the liver was nice.

979
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:30.320
Ooh,
that's the thing about Manoa man.

980
00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:34.560
The amount of impact he puts on Shit,
you know,
super explosive.

981
00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:38.200
Very exciting to watch.
Motherfucker can pop.

982
00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:42.050
Like you said though,
you get to those higher levels,
man.
Ooh,
look at that.

983
00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:46.400
Of the body.
Yeah.
I mean look,
Gustafson got them.
Uh,
that was a good fight.

984
00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:49.840
Gustafson showed what he's made of in that fight.
This is a Gustafson,

985
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.580
Anthony Rumble Johnson stuff going back and forth on Twitter was um,

986
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:56.420
the headbutt well,
no,
it wasn't even that.

987
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:57.920
A lot of people have brought that up though.

988
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:03.100
You absolutely positive that it was a headbutt when you watch the tape?
Yes.
Yeah.

989
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:06.200
I want to watch it again.
Everybody seems like them to fight again though.

990
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:08.150
It seemed to me like it would just definitely a head,

991
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:09.950
but that's what it seemed like.
But I'm still,

992
01:00:09.951 --> 01:00:13.000
I would like to watch it again before you,
I would say you know,

993
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:14.270
oh it was a headbutt.

994
01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:17.780
It was one of those ones where he's throwing the right hand at the same time,

995
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:22.370
so I don't know what landed first if and when you watch the tape in slow motion,

996
01:00:22.371 --> 01:00:25.280
it looked like the head doesn't have their way.
He beat him.

997
01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.070
I don't give a shit in the right hand.
Yeah,

998
01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:30.260
and the right hand did land behind the head.
It did land.

999
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:35.060
This is a question of which one fucked him up first the head,

1000
01:00:35.061 --> 01:00:38.990
but definitely if he did crack into them,
which I believe he probably did.

1001
01:00:38.991 --> 01:00:41.960
It looks like from the angle,
it's not one of those definite ones,
you know,

1002
01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:45.920
we could see absolutely side on.
Have you seen the heads collide?

1003
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.680
Have you seen it?
Yeah,
it's Daddy.
Good.
Devin definitely head,

1004
01:00:48.681 --> 01:00:49.760
but we'll watch it again.

1005
01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:53.270
You're Alexander said he wanted to retire after that fight.
Yeah.
Hey man,

1006
01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:57.240
it's tough loss in front of your hometown home country.
Like that.
Tough love.

1007
01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:01.130
I can't wait to see him in clover fight next.
That's a good fight.
Great fight.

1008
01:01:01.131 --> 01:01:04.550
The good fight and both guys need it.
And Glover is,
you know,

1009
01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:09.551
I usually walked around like 230240220 that's good to 20 right now.

1010
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:14.140
Well he realized in that last fight that he just didn't have the gas tank to go

1011
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:18.890
to deal with Phil Davis and he also trained in like Connecticut in a garage.

1012
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:24.460
Yeah.
It's,
I think that's all he had available,
is it?

1013
01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.560
Yeah.
He had to stay here.
Stay in town.

1014
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.340
Really one for some reason I'm thinking about it had something to do with family

1015
01:01:30.341 --> 01:01:33.020
or it makes sense.
Yeah.
I think that was the story behind it.

1016
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.490
So he put together his own crew down there of good guys.
But you know what man?

1017
01:01:37.491 --> 01:01:38.324
I mean,
how many do,

1018
01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:41.990
I don't have to tell you how many dudes don't have someone managing the
training.

1019
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:45.590
How many dudes don't have someone who's like a Mark Henry type dude.

1020
01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:50.480
96% of the 96% I think that's the right,
the,
the,
the main,

1021
01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:52.730
the main event.
And this Gabriel Gonzaga,

1022
01:01:52.731 --> 01:01:56.660
a guy who just has trained out of 10 yeah,
team link.

1023
01:01:56.661 --> 01:02:00.360
He's the fucking link.
He's the biggest dog in the gym for sure.

1024
01:02:00.361 --> 01:02:01.340
Knows the potential.

1025
01:02:01.341 --> 01:02:04.520
He could have had it if he would have went to Greg Jackson's or American top

1026
01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:08.590
team.
I agree.
He stays in Boston.
Well,
he's got a family and you teach,

1027
01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:12.750
get all that convenience.
But yeah,
I know what you're saying.
Well,

1028
01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.590
you know what man,
when Randy coture beat him,
he beat,

1029
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:20.010
he beat him when he was in his total prime.
You know,
that was when Gonzaga

1030
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:25.010
<v 3>was in his prime and Randy just took it to him.</v>

1031
01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.120
Even Gonzaga has prime's a fucking beast beast and knocking a lot of dudes out.

1032
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:34.560
He's scared us.
I've ever been for a fight.
Hands down.
I was so scared.

1033
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:38.520
Really terrified.
Mile.
Just because of the power,

1034
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:42.300
the power world champion Jujitsu,
you know,

1035
01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:46.560
he's knocked out some fucking mods,
cro cop.
He's been in there against the best.

1036
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:51.540
The Cro cop knock was terrifying.
That was the scariest I've ever been.
Wow.

1037
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.700
I wish I could find that again.
I've gotta be honest for Real,

1038
01:02:55.701 --> 01:02:56.820
so I'm not scared anymore.

1039
01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.080
Do you think that's just because you've had so many experiences?
Yes.
And I in,

1040
01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:03.780
in the training room,
I go against scary dudes all the time.

1041
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.300
So when I fight I'm not as scared.
It's not good man.

1042
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:11.120
There's nothing like that fear of God and you to make you wow.
Yeah.

1043
01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:14.250
I see what you're saying.
It becomes almost too confident or too comfortable.

1044
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:17.880
Yeah.
I've been too comfortable.
Daigo Chimi man was thrown some nasty kicks.

1045
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:21.540
Dude is a lot of good power behind those kicks.
That was a good round.

1046
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:25.350
Give it to Jimmy.
Yeah,

1047
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:29.100
I hear what you're saying about Gonzaga God damn talented,
Huh?

1048
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:32.670
Fuck what?
And he's,
he's really worked on his boxing,

1049
01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:35.250
his last few fights and I think that could be a really interesting aspect in

1050
01:03:35.251 --> 01:03:39.570
this fight.
No,
take them down some middle.
My man,

1051
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:44.160
he had some Gonzaga on top.
You some of the best Jujitsu in the UFC.
Man.

1052
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:48.480
Why do you think he abandoned that and just decided to bang?

1053
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:49.740
You think it was cause of the wrestlers

1054
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.540
now he took Shane Carwyn down if you're Merrill that he's kind of whipping

1055
01:03:54.541 --> 01:03:58.950
Shane's s yeah,
it was 40 seconds,
but he took chain down,
rock them,

1056
01:03:58.951 --> 01:04:02.910
took them down.
The Shane got up and said,
Oh cool story.
Boom,
Jab,
knockout.
Well,

1057
01:04:02.911 --> 01:04:04.100
he got a little careless.

1058
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:09.110
He had shaved her and he got careless and he ran into a short punch that just

1059
01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:13.320
kicked the fucking generator down the street.
I was like,
oh my God.

1060
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:19.950
It was a generator tumbling down the street with a cord following,

1061
01:04:19.951 --> 01:04:22.860
borrow.
That's what happened to his brain with that right hand.

1062
01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:26.310
And I also think Gonzaga has a mental issue with cardio.

1063
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:29.910
So when you want to grapple wrestle guys,
especially in the UFC at this point,

1064
01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.720
it's going to take a lot of energy.
A lot of energy.
Man,

1065
01:04:33.721 --> 01:04:35.460
I think he's worried about that dude chain.

1066
01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:39.720
Carmen is probably the last guy you want to get hit with a short punch from

1067
01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:44.490
ever,
ever in the history of fighting the case.
Fucking,

1068
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:48.420
they don't make them like Shit,
man.
They still build on that fucker.

1069
01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.310
It's just so ridiculous.

1070
01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:55.140
So much power and pretty loose with his fucking hands.
Fuck yeah.

1071
01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:59.610
Shane was an athletic that Frank Mir,
Kale.
Jesus fucking,
I'll never forget that.

1072
01:04:59.611 --> 01:05:03.710
Frank Mirs corns going,
God,
he's not doing shit here.
Just rest.
I'm like Ras.

1073
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.070
It's an under hook.

1074
01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:10.071
He has an under hook and he's smashing uppercuts through with fucking for Roche.

1075
01:05:10.861 --> 01:05:11.910
This intention,

1076
01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:15.810
there was some of the best striking from the clinch and the heavyweight division

1077
01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:19.990
I've ever seen that one fight.
I don't think there's no,

1078
01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:23.380
I don't think there's any other heavyweight who can hit like Shane from an under

1079
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.920
hook that would that much power.
He named someone who's not in new out like that.

1080
01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:30.400
No,
he hits you so fucking hard and he's fast and loose.

1081
01:05:30.401 --> 01:05:34.210
Even for a big giant to leverage.
Yeah,
he and he throws perfect punches.

1082
01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:37.430
I mean those are perfect power punches.
All Shane did his box.
I see.

1083
01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.490
I think his deal,
Shane's deal,

1084
01:05:39.491 --> 01:05:43.300
unfortunately in the UFC will always have been the injuries that he sustained

1085
01:05:43.301 --> 01:05:48.160
before he got to the UFC.
100% it's too bad because he was a real goddamn freak.

1086
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:52.780
A real freak.
Best I've ever seen.
I've seen a lot of guys,
Shane,
in his prime,

1087
01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:56.050
when he's getting ready for a new Gonzaga is the best fighter I've ever seen.

1088
01:05:56.170 --> 01:06:00.190
We've seen a lot of dudes,
man,
that's strong words.
God Damn Dude,

1089
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.200
that's strong words.
Oh,
and he's a fucking engineer.
Shit.
Hell yeah.

1090
01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:09.040
Smarter Shit.
He's like a fucking thick professor x man.

1091
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:10.900
When I hear about a dude like that,
it's,
you know,

1092
01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:14.770
the back issues just ultimately ended it and you think about all the hits that

1093
01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:18.400
he probably took and football and if you could erase those and see a guy like

1094
01:06:18.401 --> 01:06:22.840
that compete without coming in already fucked up in a certain extent and

1095
01:06:22.841 --> 01:06:26.730
wrestling mill to wrestling.
He said that took a lot out of them too,
man.
Yeah.

1096
01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:29.590
Got To imagine who wrestled these big giant motherfuckers.

1097
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:34.660
What do you think of Todd Duffy?
Frank Mir.
Todd Duffy.
He's a beast.
Man,

1098
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:38.500
Todd Todd Duffy throw some fucking heat,
too hot.
Duffy's a beast.

1099
01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:40.960
Todd Duffy and I were trading partners for awhile.
I like Todd.

1100
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:45.590
Todd's biggest problem has always been himself.
His mind,
if,

1101
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.880
if he's tentative against frank,
he's going to get destroyed.

1102
01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:51.400
If Todd Duffy performs like he doesn't,
the training room,

1103
01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:55.090
Todd Duffy is probably going to be fighting for a title and next year.
Wow.

1104
01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.590
Strong,
strong.
Whereas I also,
I also exaggerate everybody.
No,

1105
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:03.460
for real.
So anyone who's ever trained with Todd asked DC,
asked Kane,

1106
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:07.510
he's been at a k ass.
Everyone down in Florida,
h a t.
T,

1107
01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.450
he's been in Denver,
he's been to fucking every gym in America.

1108
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:14.620
But if Todd performs like doesn't train room,
he's a fucking nightmare.

1109
01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:18.370
But when you see him in the AUC,
gun's just not there yet.
I Harry a man,

1110
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:22.660
that makes sense.
You know,
um,
if you look at some of his finest moments,
he,
uh,

1111
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:24.730
the Anthony Hamilton fight,
Goddamn,

1112
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:28.640
he throws some fucking fast power punches still for sure.
But at the same,

1113
01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.230
Hamilton's not going to fucking,
you know Anthony Hamilton's a big boy too,

1114
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.700
that those were Chris Punches.
Yeah,
they were straight down the pipe.
Yeah.

1115
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:40.810
Anthony's just aid them.
Which you can't do at heavyweight.
Well,
Frank Mir,

1116
01:07:40.811 --> 01:07:43.930
how about that Fucking Jab,
left hook.
He landed on look,

1117
01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:48.130
fucking Lou nasty look loose.
I,
there's never been a fight.

1118
01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:50.920
That frank spot besides Shane Collin,
I don't root for Frank Mir.

1119
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:54.400
What he's done for the sport.
I root for him.
Every single fos stats.

1120
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:57.350
Now he's fighting traditional.
He used to be southpaw.

1121
01:07:57.370 --> 01:08:02.070
Traditionally he threw that Faint Jab,
left hook,
knock,
big foot out.
Big quotes.

1122
01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.480
A fucking nightmare man.
Do you wonder though?
I mean,

1123
01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:08.350
big foot went down pretty quick against our Lawsky and he went down pretty quick

1124
01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:11.500
against Frank Mir and we know for a fact that big foot,

1125
01:08:11.501 --> 01:08:16.130
if anybody needs testosterone replacement therapy,
it's foot.
I agree.
Big Foot

1126
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.010
<v 0>has a legit like tumor on his pituitary gland.</v>

1127
01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:23.180
Apparently according to what the interviews that he's done,

1128
01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:26.750
he would have to get surgery and he's going to eventually get surgery to have it

1129
01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:31.160
removed.
You know,
but his testosterone is not like normal persons.

1130
01:08:31.161 --> 01:08:32.450
You can't find the UFC then man,

1131
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:35.540
I hate to be shitty about it because I'm a big foot.
He's one of the nicest guys.

1132
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:38.060
These what do you require that and you can't find the UFC.

1133
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.640
Right and because I want the same shit.
You're taking that right.

1134
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:42.710
That's a good point.
That's good.
I need a bigger head.

1135
01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:47.160
Give me the same shit you're taking,
but you would have to if you,
you would,

1136
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.400
if you were going to do that,
if you're going to let people do it,

1137
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:53.240
you would have to be monitoring them all times the day to make sure they're not

1138
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:56.630
putting superhuman levels in and then everybody would have like a level of

1139
01:08:56.631 --> 01:08:59.840
testosterone they're allowed to achieve.
Like you never going to happen.

1140
01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:02.010
Maybe you wear a fucking Iwatch.
Yeah,
right.

1141
01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.330
You were reports back to the UFC had checks in every day.

1142
01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.040
I mean that's not outside the realm of possibility.

1143
01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:09.410
They have watches and tell your fucking heartbeat now.
True.

1144
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:10.580
It's kind of a good idea.

1145
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.890
If they could figure out a way to test your testosterone.

1146
01:09:12.891 --> 01:09:16.940
Maybe just point your camera at your Dick every day and it would know just by

1147
01:09:16.941 --> 01:09:20.210
the way to Dick's moving and then your testosterone goes up in a real high,

1148
01:09:20.211 --> 01:09:23.180
right?
Like if I'm a lady's man just destroying chicks,
I'm like,

1149
01:09:23.181 --> 01:09:26.420
God damn shops testosterone was like nine times.
Hi This Day.

1150
01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:28.460
You know what I'm saying?
Right.
That could be,
yeah.

1151
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:32.270
If you could be around a bunch of pretty ladies,
man,
he body gears up for war.

1152
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:36.020
I'm in La.
Someone in Idaho's probably not the same.
You know?

1153
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.620
You know they say that that's true that men around attractive women,

1154
01:09:39.621 --> 01:09:44.000
like literally their bodies produced 100% you know what else?

1155
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:46.880
Engines like a rumbling engine,

1156
01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:49.990
like a v eight like you're American for sure.

1157
01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:53.380
For whatever reason that makes your body produce more testosterone.

1158
01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:57.710
They have no idea why,
because it sounds like a fucking dragon man

1159
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:05.210
machine
and I don't mean war machine.
The fighter.

1160
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.660
Yeah,
definitely not.
Yeah,
it's crazy.

1161
01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:12.020
When you think about the things that actually make your body produce more

1162
01:10:12.021 --> 01:10:16.130
hormone,
chicks and cars,
man,
what else?
What else?

1163
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:19.400
Isn't it funny though that you're criticized for being a,

1164
01:10:19.401 --> 01:10:23.300
a foolish person if you enjoy hot chicks and cars?
Yeah.
Oh,

1165
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:26.570
such a meathead new flu.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

1166
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.550
I'm sorry to my fucking DNA to love big ass titties and Porsche's by bat.

1167
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:35.360
Yeah.
You're sorry that you enjoy some of the most fun things ever.

1168
01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:39.470
I'm sorry because it makes you dumb.
Like there cannot be one without the other.

1169
01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.490
No,
man,
I'm here.
What's going on here?
Why?
How come they have began the wrong yet?

1170
01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:49.660
Doo,
Doo,
Doo doo too powerful UK.

1171
01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:57.590
Here we go.
Round two,
three,
three.
Did I say too?

1172
01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:01.160
Yeah,
we didn't even talk about the second round.
We just talked about titties,

1173
01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:06.890
kitties and why we love him not to judge us.
Jeez,
man.

1174
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:12.170
Yeah.
It's funny that certain things are thought of to be,
uh,
for fools,

1175
01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.070
but PR cool cars are one of them.

1176
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.500
<v 3>For whatever reason you,
you never,</v>

1177
01:11:16.501 --> 01:11:19.790
you never going to see like a science professor that drives a sick that now it's

1178
01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:20.693
weird,

1179
01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:25.420
but seek vet and just have a girlfriend with a blowout ass if you don't try it.

1180
01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.680
I mean,
Neil degrasse Tyson's is probably the closest,

1181
01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:33.750
but you'd have to like put on a mask and a corvette,
you know,

1182
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.920
if some people wouldn't take him seriously if he was balling and a sweet

1183
01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:38.731
corvette.
Yeah.

1184
01:11:38.731 --> 01:11:42.110
There's no college professors out there with Ferrari's and girlfriends is big.

1185
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:46.200
Is Einstein was allowed motherfucker.
He was like a rock star.

1186
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:50.880
He that was pre Twitter.
Yeah.
Before we got judged by everyone.

1187
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:55.830
He married,
he married his cousin.
That's pretty gangster.
It's pretty weird.

1188
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:59.330
If he had,
he had,
he had a first marriage,
had a couple kids,

1189
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.980
wasn't that great of a father according to this documentary.

1190
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:05.910
And then ended up marrying his cousin and she became like his manager too.

1191
01:12:05.911 --> 01:12:07.830
And he was allowed Damien,

1192
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:12.600
he was allowed to see anybody he wanted,
like he,

1193
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.060
and she was cool with it.
Sounds awesome.
That's why he's the smartest guy.

1194
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.570
Has his cousin looked like she,
she,
she loved them.
She was schlubby down.

1195
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:24.720
She loved her.
They just made a deal.
But they were,
they made a deal.

1196
01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:29.310
So the deal was when girls,
um,
would come over,

1197
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:34.290
they'd have to bring her chocolate.
That was a requirement.
It chocolates,

1198
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:34.921
chocolates.

1199
01:12:34.921 --> 01:12:38.100
Now we will suck your man's Dick now and then we'll jump in the car and

1200
01:12:38.101 --> 01:12:42.900
disappear for a couple of days.
Does a good deal.
Einstein was a mad player.

1201
01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:48.000
Damn.
Damn.
I did not know.
Yeah.
Jimmy Manawan.
I had no idea it was a rockstar.

1202
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.370
I like him even more.
I hate him even more.

1203
01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.840
<v 0>Yeah,
you can't,
you know.
Oh,
Lou had kik.
Um,
you know,</v>

1204
01:13:01.841 --> 01:13:05.560
who's allowed to that are sort of scientists?
Well,
they're not scientists,

1205
01:13:05.561 --> 01:13:07.630
but they're super geniuses.

1206
01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:12.580
They're allowed to get those kind of cars is like video game designers.

1207
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:16.600
True.
Those super geniuses like the John Carmack type characters.

1208
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:21.130
You know what that guy does in his spare time?
Oh,
nothing just makes rockets.

1209
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:26.380
Really.
Yeah.
It makes his own sockets.
Yeah.
He's the,
the,
the lead software guy.

1210
01:13:26.381 --> 01:13:27.610
The,
the lead designer.

1211
01:13:27.611 --> 01:13:32.611
Whatever the lead computer genius at a quake id a it game creek.

1212
01:13:34.471 --> 01:13:38.320
I don't know what the actual name of the studio.
It's just aid.
But uh,

1213
01:13:38.321 --> 01:13:43.180
they created doom.
They created quake one,
quake two,
quake three quake.

1214
01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.970
Uh,
yeah,
they,
they,

1215
01:13:45.971 --> 01:13:49.900
they made a bunch of fucking crazy games that John Carmack guy in his spare
time,

1216
01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:54.670
he turbo charges Ferrari's.
He takes a fraud.
Right?
It's like not strong enough.

1217
01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:59.050
Have a solution and he bolts gigantic turbocharges to Ferrari.

1218
01:13:59.051 --> 01:14:01.960
You're looking dude too.
It's not a bad looking guy.
Really.
Yeah.

1219
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:06.640
He's does judo to share judo.
Jujitsu.
You live in La.
I only live down in Texas.

1220
01:14:06.641 --> 01:14:10.840
He said he's a bad motherfucker.
He's a legit super genius.
Like I,
you know,

1221
01:14:10.841 --> 01:14:14.320
I have dull mind as it were,
but when I talked to like legit super geniuses,

1222
01:14:14.321 --> 01:14:16.840
I'm usually okay.
Like I can talk to them about this,

1223
01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.800
but when I'm with Carmax I'm like,
don't make mistake.
Stay on road

1224
01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:27.670
nervous.
Say the wrong word.
Don't talk about shit.
You don't know.

1225
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:33.820
Stay in your life.
Don't pretend
standing fucking lane.

1226
01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.930
Like if you're on a motorcycle and you're following a guy who was a motorcycle

1227
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:40.360
racer and you're trying to keep up with them and you know,

1228
01:14:40.361 --> 01:14:43.380
you shouldn't be driving this fast and just don't pop wheelies.

1229
01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:47.560
She'll not student and ask questions.
Yeah,
man,
that's question.
Yes,
absolutely.

1230
01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:50.470
I'm trying to make statements.
Well,
he's just,
he would talk about programming.

1231
01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:53.890
We would talk about code and coding.
How old is Karmic?

1232
01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:58.780
It's a good question.
Is he like a Doogie Howser kid?
Genius.

1233
01:14:58.781 --> 01:15:01.300
He's like 40 now because he quit.

1234
01:15:01.301 --> 01:15:04.330
His quake has been around for a long time.
I mean,

1235
01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:08.830
they created quake I think in the early nineties I don't remember what year it

1236
01:15:08.831 --> 01:15:13.810
was.
Would you rather be a super athlete like Michael Jordan or straight fucking

1237
01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:16.600
genius,
like an Einstein or your boy?
They see,

1238
01:15:16.601 --> 01:15:18.280
I don't think they're mutually exclusive.

1239
01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:21.220
I think that the only way really genetically,

1240
01:15:21.221 --> 01:15:22.360
I don't think they're mutually exclusive.

1241
01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:26.140
I think it's very possible that you can get a guy who has a physical talents of

1242
01:15:26.141 --> 01:15:30.940
Michael Jordan and has an insanely powerful brain.
It's totally possible.
However,

1243
01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:35.620
both not.
It's not true and the history look,
it's,
it's just,
it's possible.

1244
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:36.760
But the thing is,

1245
01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:41.590
in order to have that much knowledge in your head and not much data,

1246
01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.680
I can mean you're not going to be in a jam and you never gonna reach that level.

1247
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:48.490
He,
it'll just be one or the other.
In terms of what you focus your attention on,

1248
01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:52.840
but in terms of having the brain that has the capacity to reach like super

1249
01:15:52.841 --> 01:15:55.780
genius levels,
I don't think they're mutually exclusive.
We just,

1250
01:15:55.781 --> 01:16:00.640
I'm just guessing,
but I don't take the hundred smartest guys in the world.

1251
01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:03.460
Oh,
not very good at Jimmy Manoa going,

1252
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:06.310
I don't think they would look like you can take the hundred smartest guys in the

1253
01:16:06.311 --> 01:16:08.440
world.
They looked like Mr Barren,
low,
low hit.

1254
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:12.350
They looked like Mr. Burns like shit.
Oh,
it wasn't that.

1255
01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:13.300
That was the end of the fight.

1256
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.910
I thought it was a low shot that there were separating them.
That was,

1257
01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:19.990
I think that one's going to decision young black,
which is a tough motherfucker.

1258
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.863
That's his name.
Right,

1259
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:27.700
is going to be tough for Jimmy to get a decision when in John's hometown.

1260
01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:31.640
I think that UFC probably brought Polish commissions one.

1261
01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:32.690
Is it a Polish commission?

1262
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:34.760
I would imagine because they have big promotions out there.

1263
01:16:34.761 --> 01:16:39.020
Was it a k something that's a big promotion.
That yon was a previous champ of,

1264
01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:44.660
how'd he say?
Bellaco which block of Itch?
The lockup,
which is tough as fuck dude,

1265
01:16:44.661 --> 01:16:47.420
that guy can take a beating.
That was a good fight.

1266
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:53.950
He's going to feel that one tomorrow
as is Manoa.
Who bed?
Yeah.

1267
01:16:53.951 --> 01:16:54.920
Not too bad.
No,

1268
01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:58.540
but I mean a lot of shots to the body from Manoa throws those nasty niece.

1269
01:16:58.541 --> 01:16:59.374
The body man.

1270
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:06.210
We were watching the sac around close enough.

1271
01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:11.630
We were talking all kinds of shit about booties,
mustangs and Shit and geniuses.

1272
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:16.910
Corvettes that are lasar that Bob was our guy.
Remember that guy?

1273
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:20.480
Yeah.
That guy had a corvette that was hydrogen powered.

1274
01:17:20.481 --> 01:17:22.560
He made it hydrogen powered him.

1275
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:26.450
He took a corvette and converted the engine to run on hydrogen.

1276
01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.020
What a crazy story is because because of either way,

1277
01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:33.650
what he saying is,
uh,
an incredible story.

1278
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.760
Either he's telling the truth or if he's lying,
he's one of the greatest actors.

1279
01:17:37.761 --> 01:17:39.320
Cause he's so smart.
He's,

1280
01:17:39.670 --> 01:17:42.620
you got to be able to fake some genius shit and have people,

1281
01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:46.580
do you know about it?
No.
Eddie,
explain and tell them what problems are.

1282
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:48.470
You're better at explaining that shit than I am.

1283
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:53.390
What's Bob Dunn bobblehead czar was a former scientist according to him was a

1284
01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:54.200
former scientist.

1285
01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:59.200
He worked at area 51 they brought him in because he was a scientist and because

1286
01:17:59.451 --> 01:18:01.280
he knew a lot about propulsion,

1287
01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:05.230
propulsion systems and and theoretical propulsion systems.
He's like,

1288
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:06.860
I guess he's a physicist or something like that.

1289
01:18:06.861 --> 01:18:10.730
I don't know what is his background as far as education because it's in dispute

1290
01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:15.050
as a lot of people that say that he fudged is I say bullshit.
Who knows?
However,

1291
01:18:15.051 --> 01:18:20.051
this guy says that he was working in area 51 and he was working on something.

1292
01:18:20.691 --> 01:18:23.780
They brought him in to back engineer a Ufo.

1293
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:27.320
They brought him in and they took him to some,
this is him right here.

1294
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:32.390
They took him into some hanger that has,
yeah,
he Matt magic and,

1295
01:18:32.391 --> 01:18:33.620
well dude,
it's not about that.

1296
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:38.830
What I'm saying is this dude was working on what they were explaining to him,

1297
01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:39.800
nothing,

1298
01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.630
but what he believed over time was that what he was working on was back

1299
01:18:44.631 --> 01:18:48.770
engineering a Ufo from another world.
Damn.
Do you believe him?

1300
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:54.040
He has skeptical hit on most convincing of all the people that have ever heard

1301
01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:58.190
discussed these.
That's really the most convincing.
Is it all down?

1302
01:18:58.191 --> 01:19:00.530
He doesn't antigravity and how it works and everything.

1303
01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:05.210
He doesn't seem like an idiot at all.
He definitely seems like a fucking very,

1304
01:19:05.211 --> 01:19:06.710
very,
very intelligent dude.

1305
01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.920
He doesn't seem like he's lying because he wrote lots of books.
No,

1306
01:19:09.921 --> 01:19:11.750
I don't believe so.
I don't know how many books he's wrote,

1307
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:15.390
but I'm too dumb to know whether or not he stupid too.
I don't know.

1308
01:19:15.391 --> 01:19:18.650
And you know what I mean?
Like I'm too dumb.
Like he sounds right,

1309
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.560
but it could be like some martial arts guy that's talking all kinds of mad

1310
01:19:21.561 --> 01:19:23.120
nonsense.
What his,

1311
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:27.340
you know his Ci Gong is going to do to you if you get near him and if you're
not,

1312
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:32.870
my friend knows a guy with a cheat gone fucking it's on your chest mad.

1313
01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.690
That's where we're at right now.
There's guys that believe that.
So,

1314
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:38.510
and if someone speaks well enough,

1315
01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:41.450
we sort of like assume they know what the fuck they're talking about.

1316
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:44.210
And I listened to him talk and he sounds like he knows what the fuck he's

1317
01:19:44.211 --> 01:19:47.390
talking about.
It's a very compelling story.
Money off saying any of this.

1318
01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:52.130
I'm sure he has.
I would imagine you,
if you really want to get into it,

1319
01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:56.870
you'd have to Google it because I haven't really read about it and about seven

1320
01:19:56.871 --> 01:19:59.150
or eight years,
I kind of put it behind me.

1321
01:19:59.151 --> 01:20:02.720
I kind of decided somewhere along the line there was no fruit in this pursuit

1322
01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.600
because they couldn't figure it out whether or not he had lied about his

1323
01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:06.860
educational background.

1324
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:11.340
They couldn't figure out whether or not he had actually worked for the

1325
01:20:11.341 --> 01:20:12.960
government.
But this shit.
Right.

1326
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.640
Well they found out that he did work for one of the labs that he said he worked

1327
01:20:17.641 --> 01:20:22.530
for.
He worked for like Los Alamos.
They did find out that that was true.

1328
01:20:22.531 --> 01:20:26.010
So how the fuck did he get that job if you didn't have like a super high level

1329
01:20:26.011 --> 01:20:26.521
education,

1330
01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:28.670
but who knows what the fuck he was doing there when he was working there?

1331
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:33.720
People that are like real scientists have a lot of doubts about all the shit

1332
01:20:33.721 --> 01:20:37.650
that he said.
That's pretty much enough for me,
but if I just want to have fun,

1333
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.170
I want to pretend that tomorrow if I want to pretend,

1334
01:20:41.171 --> 01:20:45.120
because it is fun to pretend there's,
there's so much,

1335
01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:50.010
there's so much footage of him being interviewed and explaining how it all
works.

1336
01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:53.100
He's an amazing actor.
He's full of Shit.

1337
01:20:53.101 --> 01:20:56.730
I'm just too stupid to understand it easily be full of shit,
but fuck,

1338
01:20:56.731 --> 01:20:58.980
this guy's good.
He's super smart.

1339
01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:01.980
It sounds like he knows what he's talking about when it,

1340
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:04.230
when he's discussing antigravity but,

1341
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:06.810
but when you call these other scientists coming out and being like,

1342
01:21:06.811 --> 01:21:11.640
this dude's full of shit.
Well when I say that also be Freeman.
He,
yeah,

1343
01:21:11.641 --> 01:21:15.300
he's probably a bit of a hater buddy.
Make some good points,
man.
You can't.

1344
01:21:15.301 --> 01:21:19.600
The guy's got to produce,
when you say you graduated from,
fill in the blank,
MIT,

1345
01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:22.020
whatever it is,
you should be able to display a degree.

1346
01:21:22.021 --> 01:21:24.510
Do you have a degree or you are in their records and if you're not in their

1347
01:21:24.511 --> 01:21:26.940
records and if you can't display a degree,
you never got a degree,

1348
01:21:26.941 --> 01:21:31.590
then I have to dispute everything you've said agree degree.

1349
01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:33.990
But is it possible that,

1350
01:21:33.991 --> 01:21:36.000
especially we're talking about something a long time ago,

1351
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:40.090
is it possible that someone could go back to the records at that school in,

1352
01:21:40.091 --> 01:21:42.270
scrub him from the records?
Come on.

1353
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:45.990
Here's why it's not possible yearbooks.
True.

1354
01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:50.040
Someone will like a yearbook,
wouldn't one of just his classmates were like,
yeah,

1355
01:21:50.041 --> 01:21:53.090
I was in class with them.
Yeah.
So when we come out back I was in class stuff.

1356
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:54.000
Fucking doors.
Yeah.

1357
01:21:54.001 --> 01:21:57.300
Well he should be able to name his professors should be able to can't.
Huh?

1358
01:21:57.390 --> 01:22:00.810
I don't know.
I don't know.
You know from one I'll share.
Yeah.

1359
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:04.110
From what I have read,
I would say he hasn't,

1360
01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:07.620
but who knows how much of what I've read is the truth or what Eddie was saying.

1361
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:09.270
Cause I know five graduate from Harvard,

1362
01:22:09.271 --> 01:22:11.280
I have a fucking Harvard shirt on right now.

1363
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:13.290
You guys would hear about it nonstop.

1364
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.550
Do you ever hear the lies of slessinger story about Yale?
No.

1365
01:22:17.551 --> 01:22:21.960
She's a friend of mine though.
Google it.
Eliza slash.
Manager.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1366
01:22:21.961 --> 01:22:26.100
It's not bad for her.
It's she dated this guy that was pretending.

1367
01:22:26.101 --> 01:22:28.560
He's telling me the story on the podcast,
the shit.

1368
01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:32.410
She got catfished and the dude said he is from Yale.
Dot.
Just catfish.

1369
01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:35.370
Like this dude made up a story about his mom having cancer.

1370
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:39.540
This dude made up his job.
He made up his house,

1371
01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:44.370
made up that he was rich when he's really like $100,000 in debt.

1372
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.850
He wasn't even at broke.
He made a Facebook profile.

1373
01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:50.220
I don't know what it really was.
Hey,
McCafe is,

1374
01:22:50.221 --> 01:22:53.340
he's just a fucking compulsive liar and then you got a credit card and take her

1375
01:22:53.341 --> 01:22:56.900
out to fancy dinners and shit.
Be racked up all this money on a credit card.

1376
01:22:56.950 --> 01:23:01.650
We didn't have the money,
dude.
He was a on an airplane with her guys.
A heroin.

1377
01:23:01.651 --> 01:23:05.710
My book.
Just kidding.
Was like,
well,

1378
01:23:05.711 --> 01:23:09.010
she's not dumb,
which is really weird.
She's a sharp girl.
Well,

1379
01:23:09.011 --> 01:23:12.250
that's what's really weird about it.
It's like,
how did you get caught with this?

1380
01:23:12.251 --> 01:23:16.390
Like how did you,
I mean,
I guess you don't mean,
this seems like so many lies,

1381
01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.430
so I could do,
you didn't get tripped up anywhere.
I mean,

1382
01:23:18.431 --> 01:23:21.580
what was he telling the truth about?
You know,
she said,

1383
01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:25.600
she said though he would lie about his mom being sick or nine and so she didn't

1384
01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:28.590
want to get too into it.
So it was almost a wall,
you know,

1385
01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.720
like you don't want to dive into someone's mom dying.
Right.

1386
01:23:31.721 --> 01:23:34.540
But the guy was smart,
but people who were full of shit are they,

1387
01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.750
they're full of shit.
I mean,
how good was this guy in regular conversation?

1388
01:23:37.890 --> 01:23:41.950
Must be a great Ralf Tori Rafael,
Tory,

1389
01:23:41.951 --> 01:23:46.780
Eddie Bravo and I both have a story about a guy that was completely full of
shit.

1390
01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:51.610
He was a fake black belt.
It's awesome of total fake black belt.

1391
01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:56.560
And when Eddie first introduced me to him,
he was a reporter for websites.

1392
01:23:56.561 --> 01:23:58.000
He was going and doing these,
uh,

1393
01:23:58.001 --> 01:24:02.140
the early MMA reporting and he would do like Gonzo journalist questions.

1394
01:24:02.141 --> 01:24:05.290
I think they were describing it as like he would ask dude's if they like fucking

1395
01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:08.080
girls on the butt,
like weird,
weird,
weird questions.

1396
01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.490
And he was telling everybody that he was a black belt in Jujitsu and then Eddie

1397
01:24:12.491 --> 01:24:14.730
rolled with them and Eddie was like,
Oh man,
I don't know.

1398
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:19.390
Maybe it was just like going really lie still.
And he was smart.

1399
01:24:19.391 --> 01:24:21.480
He was smart.
He,
he said that,
uh,

1400
01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:26.270
he was half Brazilian and half Italian and his dad is Brazilian,
was a,

1401
01:24:26.271 --> 01:24:30.520
a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and that he knew all the old guys,

1402
01:24:30.521 --> 01:24:34.210
but he came from the judo side.
So he was smart.
He said we were more judo guys.

1403
01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.110
We were old school Jujitsu than my dad gave me a black belt when I was 18 or

1404
01:24:38.111 --> 01:24:42.160
whatever.
And we're not as good as like nowadays,
Jujitsu,
so complex.

1405
01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:43.300
And so we evolved.
We're not that gun,

1406
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:46.330
I'll admit that because he's just flat valuable.
I'm a black belt,

1407
01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:50.800
but I'm old school black belt.
So he wasn't,
he was smart.
So believable.

1408
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:53.830
I bet he was so nervous when you have to roll with you.
Do you roll them to Joe?

1409
01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:56.920
No,
I never rolled them.
I wasn't really good friends with them.
Eddie was not,

1410
01:24:56.921 --> 01:24:59.470
I mean you weren't even good friends though,
but I only hung out with him.

1411
01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:04.430
We worked together on what he was a writer for.
Um,

1412
01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:08.200
the underground.
He was like the rider yet for the EEG.

1413
01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:11.220
And he was always at shows that I would commentate like king of the cage.

1414
01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:14.710
I still ride for him.
No jail.
He's in jail for murder.

1415
01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:17.740
This is where it gets really,
really escalated.
Oh Dude,

1416
01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:22.210
this is where it gets really crazy.
Uh,
so I'll take you back to when Eddie,

1417
01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:25.660
Eddie exposed him and Eddie,
we were driving back from like,

1418
01:25:25.661 --> 01:25:28.530
what was it like King of the cage?
What were you driving back from some,

1419
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:32.720
one of those MMA fights way out in the middle of nowhere.
It was,

1420
01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:37.450
it wasn't that I exposed him.
Yeah,
he was all ready to explode.

1421
01:25:37.451 --> 01:25:38.960
That was the last one.
You know,

1422
01:25:38.961 --> 01:25:42.940
dudes pulled me to the side and said this and that.
And,
and uh,

1423
01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.220
I mean in a phone call to his face.
Yes.
You mean you,

1424
01:25:48.221 --> 01:25:52.180
you basically,
you,
you,
you confronted him.
Yes.

1425
01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:56.470
It was pretty intense,
but it was a pretty intense call.
We were driving.

1426
01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:01.630
I was driving and Eddie was right next to me.
I was like,
Oh shit.
Yukon Denali.

1427
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:07.550
Really remember the conversation?
I barely remember.
I was like,
Oh shit.

1428
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.950
Oh Shit.
Yeah.
You were going to do dude,
stop lying to me.

1429
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:17.030
Stop lying to me.
Really?
You weren't not a black belt in Jujitsu?
Did he admit it?

1430
01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:21.500
Dude,
you are.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
You're a fucking liar.

1431
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:26.480
You're lying.
You're lying.
You're lying.
You're not a black belt in Jujitsu.

1432
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.260
Do you know how crazy it is?
And you tell me you were a black belt in Jujitsu.

1433
01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.170
I cannot let Eddie Bravo.
He was,
it was,
it was pretty crazy.

1434
01:26:33.171 --> 01:26:35.330
And you could hear him like stammering and stuff

1435
01:26:38.210 --> 01:26:39.800
for sure.
Put that on speaker phone.

1436
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:43.800
I wish I could remember all the shit that you said,
but you broke it down and in,

1437
01:26:43.801 --> 01:26:48.380
in an undeniable way.
Then he killed a guy.
You're a crazy person.

1438
01:26:48.630 --> 01:26:52.250
Then when Robert Killed Eddie Bravo cuts and got off,
okay.
He cuts him off.

1439
01:26:52.251 --> 01:26:55.340
And then our friend Gerald a street bet.

1440
01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.160
Who was Eddie's first black belt,
right?
No,

1441
01:26:58.190 --> 01:27:01.170
Danny probit ghosts was your first black belt?
When was,
uh,
he was my,

1442
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:05.960
Gerald [inaudible] was my first,
uh,
before I even had a school.

1443
01:27:05.961 --> 01:27:10.961
He was my first student that did MMA before there was no thought of 10 planet.

1444
01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:14.280
I was just showing jailed street Vincent Jujitsu.

1445
01:27:14.290 --> 01:27:17.060
I was compensated for King of the cage and that's how I met Gerald.
He was,

1446
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:22.280
he was Rafael student.
Crazy.
Okay.

1447
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:27.110
So Eddie comes and teaches them some real shit,
has a bunch of real fights.
Um,

1448
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:32.210
he gets contacted by this guy cause he,

1449
01:27:32.211 --> 01:27:36.650
the guy wants him to kill his girlfriend's husband.

1450
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:38.950
He tells Gerald he wants me to kill his girlfriend's husband,

1451
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.520
was going to give him a certain amount of money.
And Cheryl's like,
what the fuck?

1452
01:27:41.521 --> 01:27:45.920
So Gerald goes to the cops.
No,
Jared goes to the cups after he killed himself,

1453
01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:47.720
the guy killed himself,
choked him,

1454
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:50.810
apparently like had him come meet him at the gym.
Choked him to death,

1455
01:27:50.811 --> 01:27:55.220
killed him and then was seen driving around in his car.
What a dumb ass dude.

1456
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:59.840
It's crazy.
It was driving around in homeboys car.
I don't think so.

1457
01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:02.550
You don't have to be to know how to rear naked choke somebody.
You know,

1458
01:28:02.551 --> 01:28:06.050
you sneak up behind some fucking fat ass who doesn't work out at all and you get

1459
01:28:06.051 --> 01:28:06.770
a hold of his neck.

1460
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:11.420
I mean he wasn't like completely inept as a martial artist.

1461
01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:13.730
He know.
He was like a kind of an amateur martial artists.

1462
01:28:13.731 --> 01:28:17.180
Like there's some videos of him throwing a spinning back kick on a pad.

1463
01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.170
They're kind of hilarious.
It's kind of hilarious.
It really is.
Like,

1464
01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:25.600
you know you getting a hold of Dunkin and teaching Dunkin suspending back kicks

1465
01:28:25.601 --> 01:28:28.580
for a couple of weeks and then having them hit the pad.
It's fucking,

1466
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:32.630
it's fucking but positive.
It's weird is this guy's been lying the whole time.

1467
01:28:32.631 --> 01:28:36.680
Then he kills the guy.
This is where it gets crazy.
He kills the guy.

1468
01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:40.850
And then he gives Gerald burry.
Before that though,
before that,

1469
01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.860
before the murder,
he set up a fake fight and king of the cage.
Oh,
that's right.

1470
01:28:45.861 --> 01:28:49.670
Yeah,
against his big Samoan guy.
It was totally fake.
And he,
they,

1471
01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.710
they kept their mouth shut.
They made it happen.

1472
01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:56.980
So he ends up getting this big giant Samoan guy like the shittiest neba cause I

1473
01:28:57.651 --> 01:29:00.590
couldn't be bothered.
It's like that.
And the guy starts tapping anyone.
So,

1474
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:02.200
and fight was his comeback

1475
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.470
<v 3>fight.
He told everybody he was 14.
I know in MMA,</v>

1476
01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:07.860
but there were all undocumented fight.
He was,
he was doing,

1477
01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:12.870
I commentated that fight and I was saying,
hit Rafael Torah returns to MMA to,

1478
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:15.840
uh,
um,
to defend is undefeated record.

1479
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.500
I'll take it to the next level.
Everybody do.
He wasn't 14 though.

1480
01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:24.240
He never fought ever.
I'll take it to the next one.
That's awesome.

1481
01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:25.890
I'll take you to the next level.

1482
01:29:26.250 --> 01:29:31.250
He had a friend drive him out to the woods and he brought with him a giant

1483
01:29:31.591 --> 01:29:35.010
duffle bag.
Okay.
He told his friend,
drive me out to the woods.

1484
01:29:35.011 --> 01:29:38.610
I want about to compete in a no rules Kuma [inaudible] you know,

1485
01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.000
if I win I'm going to make a lot of mine or come back with the first place.

1486
01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:44.850
And this is Lauren again because it's true story.
Yeah,
sure.

1487
01:29:44.851 --> 01:29:47.160
So he says to do come back tomorrow.
Okay.

1488
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:51.510
This was a newspaper journalist,
a newspaper writer.

1489
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:55.470
He took the local guy and he said,
Roger knows,
because I haven't told anybody,

1490
01:29:55.471 --> 01:29:58.330
but I'm going to go in the woods,
there's going to be this cool tech.

1491
01:29:58.710 --> 01:30:03.390
What's wrong?
He goes,
but I need you.
I want you to write the story on this,

1492
01:30:03.391 --> 01:30:06.450
but you're going to drop me off like I can't show you where it's going to be.

1493
01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.030
So the dude,

1494
01:30:09.090 --> 01:30:13.230
the newspaper writer drops him off like in the middle of nowhere in the woods

1495
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:15.540
and he says,
come back from me in two days.
Right.

1496
01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:21.570
And the guy had a big duffle bag with him.
Right.
It was something long in it.

1497
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.420
Right.
So the guy comes back two days later and picks him up.

1498
01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.790
So he was like camping out there.
Right.
He had like camp in a criminal.

1499
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.000
He came up and then he had this giant trophy says I won the Cooma town.

1500
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.700
Oh my God.
That motherfucker packed a joke.
So,

1501
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:39.600
so what does the writer do naturally?
He writes a story on it.

1502
01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:42.990
He takes that story,
frames it,
and put the,
puts it up out of school.

1503
01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:47.790
Five bananas proof.
So,
but it happened.
It was in the newspaper.

1504
01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:51.350
That's so God damn crazy.
He's a genius.

1505
01:30:51.351 --> 01:30:56.010
And she got a legit fighter coming out right now.
He's cop,
the Cro Cop Scott,

1506
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:58.710
a raw,
a lot of redness on his nose.
First of all,
we don't know.

1507
01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:03.630
He didn't go to a Kuma tag.
Oh No,
no.
It is evidence that we do,
but we do.

1508
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:06.780
So let me wrap this story up real quick.
So,
uh,

1509
01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:11.670
Gerald calls me and tells me that the guy gave him the gun or some point that I

1510
01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:15.570
forget what the conversation was.
I was like,
what?
Huh?
Jesus fucking Christ.

1511
01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:20.840
And then Gerald gets ahold of the cops.
And apparently they were,
they were,
uh,

1512
01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.960
tapping his phone.

1513
01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:26.490
So the cops called me and they want to know what I know about the murder.

1514
01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:29.460
And I explained to him,
I go,
look,
I know almost nothing.

1515
01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:32.580
What I know is what you know Gerald told me cause the guy was,

1516
01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:36.300
they were listening in on our conversation so to say what I know is what Gerald

1517
01:31:36.301 --> 01:31:39.600
told,
I told him everything.
I know what Gerald told me.
The guy's a crazy liar.

1518
01:31:39.601 --> 01:31:42.720
He's a fake black belt.
I don't know if he really killed the guy or not.

1519
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:46.110
Like it's very conceivable and this guy is so fucking crazy.

1520
01:31:46.111 --> 01:31:49.760
He made that up to you.
Might not even killed somebody at this point.

1521
01:31:49.761 --> 01:31:53.970
At least I think this is pretty much proven.
Betty killed the guy now.
Fuck.

1522
01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:58.710
But so he's got involved in it.
Two minutes of don't bring me to court.
Come on.

1523
01:31:58.711 --> 01:32:00.010
Don't bring me to court.
Cause I met

1524
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:01.540
<v 0>Rafael Toria at Eddie's house.</v>

1525
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:05.231
Don't drag me.

1526
01:32:05.231 --> 01:32:09.700
And then it gets even darker because Gerald killed somebody one day sake.

1527
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:13.900
Smelled killed somebody like a year ago in a traffic related incident,

1528
01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:19.230
some guy and him were having some road rage incident and it got physical.

1529
01:32:19.241 --> 01:32:22.930
Gerald was actually on the phone with nine one one and he fucking shot this dude

1530
01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:28.450
and now he's in jail and he's on trial right now to Gerald.

1531
01:32:28.451 --> 01:32:32.680
Some guy tried to run them off the road.
Some guy was drunk.
Joe Wasn't drunk.

1532
01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:34.810
I mean the guy that was shot was drunk.

1533
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:37.870
He rammed him like he stopped his car,

1534
01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.050
pulled it in reverse and random like they were having like some road rage

1535
01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:45.060
incident and that guy was drunk.
General gets out of his car.
He had,

1536
01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:46.570
he lives in Oregon,
he has a rifle,

1537
01:32:46.571 --> 01:32:50.980
he has his rifle and the guy's talking shit and he's coming form and Gerald

1538
01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:54.910
start,
he's like on the other side of the car and calling nine one one he said,

1539
01:32:55.190 --> 01:32:58.030
you know,
don't get near me dude.
I'm calling nine one one don't get near me.

1540
01:32:58.210 --> 01:33:02.040
The guys talking shit.
The guy came to him and Gerald thought he,

1541
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:05.410
he had a gun too and he pulled it out and he shot him.
God does that.

1542
01:33:05.411 --> 01:33:08.590
What Gerald told you?
Yeah,
that's what he told you.
That was a conversation.

1543
01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:11.790
That is,
it is self to Hololens.

1544
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:17.110
Exactly how the guy was drunk.
He runs them off the road,
he rammed him.

1545
01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.740
That's all you need.
He gets out with his gun,
gone.
What the fuck?

1546
01:33:20.741 --> 01:33:24.700
This guy is nuts.
The guys coming for him.
He was drunk.
Gerald shot him.

1547
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:29.060
He was on nine,
nine one one saying I've got this crazy guy who's a who,

1548
01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.440
who just tried to run me off the road.
I'm standing right here,
you know.

1549
01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:35.950
And the guy kept coming to go stand back seeing people that boom two people are

1550
01:33:35.951 --> 01:33:40.951
basing the possibility that Gerald might have been more of an instigator based

1551
01:33:41.951 --> 01:33:43.780
on some of the things that he wrote on Facebook.

1552
01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:47.470
Apparently he had written something about like get out of my way when you're on

1553
01:33:47.471 --> 01:33:51.910
the road or something about some and had been involved in some other sort of

1554
01:33:51.911 --> 01:33:55.420
road rage type incident but,
but who the fuck knows Matt?

1555
01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:59.470
And also we have to deal with the fact that Gerald we know for a fact

1556
01:33:59.530 --> 01:34:03.970
experienced a lot of action overseas.
Oh really?

1557
01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:04.940
Served on any,

1558
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:10.210
came back and did some tours for like one of those.
Um,
it's tough.

1559
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:14.390
Uh,
you know,
when they call them contractors all like Blackwater Shit.
Yeah.

1560
01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:19.390
Did a common dose to finance his,
um,
to finances gym.

1561
01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:24.190
Fuck man.
You know,
so there's that and that's undeniable,
man.
That's,

1562
01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.260
that fucks with a person's head.

1563
01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.900
And when you're thinking about a person in,
in,

1564
01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:33.700
in an aggressive type situation,
and you've been in war before,

1565
01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:36.370
you're used to people trying to kill you and you've got to kill them first.

1566
01:34:36.371 --> 01:34:39.000
And Gerald is in a different place.
He's in a different place.

1567
01:34:39.001 --> 01:34:41.860
In the average person,
the average person that says,
you know,
hey,

1568
01:34:41.861 --> 01:34:46.420
you can't consider the fact that he was in the war and he had PTSD.

1569
01:34:46.421 --> 01:34:50.800
That doesn't little shit.
That does mean something.
100% should be like,

1570
01:34:50.801 --> 01:34:54.010
listen man,
he's under a different set of rules to,

1571
01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:58.280
there's some people that there's big misconceptions about martial

1572
01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.200
<v 5>artists that a true martial artist would have not used the gun,</v>

1573
01:35:03.201 --> 01:35:06.260
would have used his martial arts to handle the situation.

1574
01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:10.970
But that's all bullshit.
The more martial arts you,
you learn,
the more you know,

1575
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:12.740
you need a goddamn gunning your house.

1576
01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:17.660
You need some guns because you're your martial arts.
The more you learn it,

1577
01:35:17.661 --> 01:35:20.720
you realize that's last resort.
When it's a life and death situation.

1578
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:24.080
If it's an a sport or you know,
a controlled environment,
that's one thing.

1579
01:35:24.081 --> 01:35:27.350
But you know a general thought the guy had a gun.

1580
01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:30.110
The guy tried to run him off the road.
He's got a gun.

1581
01:35:30.111 --> 01:35:34.230
You're not going to drop your gun and double leg of them and try to arm on hell.

1582
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:37.020
No,
no.
Yeah.
It's tough,
man.
It's lots.
How the story,

1583
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:42.090
if I have a gun and there's some crazy shit going down,
guys drunk,
I'm a monster,

1584
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:46.610
I'm going to shoot the me.
No rear naked choke.

1585
01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:51.650
Who knows if this guy has a gun you don't know.
So that's tough.

1586
01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:53.810
If that's exactly how it went down.

1587
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:58.130
I agree with you 100% obviously I'm not questioning anything,

1588
01:35:58.131 --> 01:36:01.720
but I was not there so I don't know.
No,
I do not know he was on,

1589
01:36:01.890 --> 01:36:04.550
he was on nine one one when this happened and stuff.

1590
01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:09.470
He was already in the situation before the shot.
The shot is actually,
it's tough.

1591
01:36:09.471 --> 01:36:14.390
Con on nine one one call.
So
that's a crazy case.

1592
01:36:14.391 --> 01:36:16.220
Then why was the,
why did they have him in jail?

1593
01:36:16.221 --> 01:36:21.221
Still there if that's exactly how it was happening and if he really deal with a

1594
01:36:21.370 --> 01:36:24.380
madman as a veteran,
you think they'd show him a little leeway?

1595
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:28.640
Because I was a veteran.
Another,
there's history of pass road rage,

1596
01:36:28.730 --> 01:36:31.570
but that has nothing to do with this just because you have a history of past

1597
01:36:31.571 --> 01:36:36.180
road rage,
you know?
Depends if he's shot like six motherfucker previous exact,

1598
01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:38.060
then we have a problem.
It'd be shooting people.
Yes,

1599
01:36:38.061 --> 01:36:40.830
but there are no damn 30 fibers.

1600
01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:45.620
40 wow.
All right.
This is it.

1601
01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:48.920
The main event,
ladies and gentlemen,
main event,

1602
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:52.880
the fucked up shit as they got them in solitary confinement this whole time.

1603
01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:56.060
It's already over a year and a trial don't start till January and he's in

1604
01:36:56.061 --> 01:37:00.680
solitary.
It's fucking bullshit.
Man.
Here in Hernandez murdered like 19 why?

1605
01:37:01.130 --> 01:37:05.550
Why did they put him in solitary?
They're fucking,
they're just railroading him,

1606
01:37:05.551 --> 01:37:08.570
man.
Why do they get to that?
Something has to be going on.

1607
01:37:08.571 --> 01:37:10.010
We have to be missing a piece of the story.

1608
01:37:10.011 --> 01:37:13.920
I feel like you'd see in this fucked over.
So they're trying to say that,
uh,

1609
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:17.530
there's uh,
that he has,
you know,
people have said he's,

1610
01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:19.370
he's been involved in road rage or fall.

1611
01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:22.280
I don't know if it's like documented officially,

1612
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:26.270
but as something to do with that.
But that has nothing to do with this situation.

1613
01:37:26.271 --> 01:37:30.590
It's tough,
man.
That dude was drunk.
The guy that got killed,
he was wasted.

1614
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:36.440
Gerald was not drunk,
was not wasted.
He was coming from the supermarket.

1615
01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:38.660
These are all facts,
but you just add them on nine.

1616
01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:40.790
He had them on nine one one he was talking,

1617
01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:44.090
he was on nine one one tell him the guy to back off,
back off.
He's,

1618
01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:48.470
he keeps walking towards his back off and then he popped him.
Jesus Christ.

1619
01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:52.600
It's on the,
it's on the record.
So they're fucking a man.
They're,

1620
01:37:52.601 --> 01:37:55.830
they're totally fucking him.
He's in solitary.

1621
01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.840
<v 3>I feel like we're missing a piece of the story.
Who knows?
We don't know.
We don't,</v>

1622
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:03.540
we don't know.
Get fucked.
And I agree that does happen.

1623
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.640
Some people just have fact and he's getting fucked.

1624
01:38:05.641 --> 01:38:08.630
This a cro captain's og isn't go two ways.
It's either,

1625
01:38:08.631 --> 01:38:10.740
it'd be one of the saddest things we've ever watched,

1626
01:38:10.741 --> 01:38:13.920
or it can be a fucking classic.
Well,

1627
01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:17.700
you got to think that Miraco wants that wind back.
That was,

1628
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:20.190
that was one that probably haunts him.
That was his,

1629
01:38:20.191 --> 01:38:24.900
a big fight in the UFC is second.
Second event,
right.

1630
01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:29.010
Eddie Sanchez was his first fight and then he fought Gonzaga is for a title shot

1631
01:38:29.011 --> 01:38:32.190
to one of those in your kind of shot.
Damn,

1632
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:36.780
that's crazy.
As Randy was a few merit,
Randy was Kate's side and he was like,
man,

1633
01:38:36.781 --> 01:38:40.500
I'd rather fight Cro,
cop Gabriel Gonzaga's to well rounded,
if you remember that.

1634
01:38:40.650 --> 01:38:43.970
Wow.
Golden Dog.

1635
01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.360
You know what,
man,
there's something about Gonzaga when he walks on the scale,

1636
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:49.640
you know when I do the Wayans yeah,

1637
01:38:49.770 --> 01:38:53.160
he sounds different than everybody else really sounds like he's made out of

1638
01:38:53.170 --> 01:38:57.090
stone.
Like when he walks,
it's like,
don't tell you what man.

1639
01:38:57.091 --> 01:39:02.091
I fought both of them and Mirko Cro cop is the strongest guy I've ever fought.

1640
01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:07.140
Bar none.
Not even close.
Wow.
He was like a fucking like Shane Carwyn strong.

1641
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:11.450
Even even more so like shaking can kind of move.
Boom pop.

1642
01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:15.330
It was like moving like the thing from fantastic for,
he was like,

1643
01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:19.650
it's like cro cop was made of straight rocks.
Jesus Christ.
Really?

1644
01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:22.560
I've heard people say the same thing about Dan Henderson but cro cop.
Yeah.

1645
01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:25.680
Listen,
I fought a roid it up fucking Lavar Johnson.

1646
01:39:25.681 --> 01:39:28.650
He was nowhere near as strong as try and give it a try given

1647
01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:35.130
Dan Henderson a back rub.
You break your hand.
I bet he will.

1648
01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:39.210
Harrison's made out a would do it the same as Susan.
She says it's just a beast.

1649
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.770
He's made out of wood.
He didn't make a cro cop was due.
Do Strong.

1650
01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.660
That's interesting man.
Crazy right.

1651
01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:49.380
He developed a lot of really good takedown defense in pride.

1652
01:39:49.410 --> 01:39:51.300
If you look at his first fights in pride,

1653
01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:54.150
like the first fight with Vandelay when they had those red handed Fulbright

1654
01:39:54.151 --> 01:39:58.950
hands.
Well cause I just tight enough his boxing a lot man.
Yeah,
he has,

1655
01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:01.080
well you got to remember too,

1656
01:40:01.081 --> 01:40:06.081
is cro cop early in his career he flew out for doom before for doom was really

1657
01:40:06.091 --> 01:40:09.840
anything to work on his grappling.
Yeah.
That was his grappling coach.
Oh,

1658
01:40:09.841 --> 01:40:12.660
we tagged them.
Hit Man.
That right hands finding a home.
That's not good.

1659
01:40:12.661 --> 01:40:17.650
What do you think about this fight if you had a gas before it started?
Uh,

1660
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:20.010
I never pick against girl cop man.
He's one of my heroes,

1661
01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:25.610
but objectively analytical Gonzaga has been fighting in the UFC for a lot

1662
01:40:26.731 --> 01:40:28.770
longer,
higher,
higher level Cro.

1663
01:40:28.771 --> 01:40:32.820
Cop really hasn't come is looking very fast here too.

1664
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:36.960
Does that double right hand?
It just seems like cro cop over his last few fights.

1665
01:40:36.961 --> 01:40:40.620
He just,
he doesn't pull the trigger.
He just,
he's coming,

1666
01:40:40.621 --> 01:40:44.800
he's coming off two wins against a ichi.
Obviously that was in Jamaica,
but he,

1667
01:40:44.801 --> 01:40:47.910
she is much smaller than him to eat.
She shorter each.

1668
01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:51.900
She's every bit of 260 pounds.
Why?
She's of judo,

1669
01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:54.780
gold medalist I with [inaudible]

1670
01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:57.880
<v 0>62 63 60 I think he,</v>

1671
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:02.410
he might when he's in crazy shape cut down to 45 that's insane.

1672
01:41:02.411 --> 01:41:05.570
I had no idea.
I thought he was about 205 fuck no,
he,

1673
01:41:05.571 --> 01:41:09.130
she is deck.
That's crazy.
Super Thick.

1674
01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:14.350
And for him to be ICI twice on a toughie.
She is man.
He's a fucking monster.

1675
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.480
Good kick to the body.
Bygones og.

1676
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:18.420
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1677
01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:20.020
<v 0>Morocco is not pulling the trigger of that much.</v>

1678
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:23.130
There's an extra kick cause he doesn't want to get taken down.

1679
01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:25.410
He knows if he gets taken down.
He's in big trouble.

1680
01:41:25.411 --> 01:41:28.380
Some of the best takedown defense ever in the UFC.
I what'd they say?

1681
01:41:28.381 --> 01:41:29.850
He's forethought.
Time heavyweights.
I think

1682
01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:36.320
I tried taking Gonzaga and I tried double again.
My face hit the ground so fast.

1683
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:41.510
He's sprawled every bit of fucking whatever it is to 60 on my little neck.

1684
01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:47.240
Oops.
A bit tentative and go and toggle.
It keeps doing that.

1685
01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:51.410
That lunging double right hand cro,
cop.
Just look at the clock.
That's a bad sign,

1686
01:41:51.411 --> 01:41:53.630
man.
We're fucking two 30 into it.
Well,

1687
01:41:53.631 --> 01:41:56.850
maybe he had a plan of waiting until the round before you open,

1688
01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:00.140
you don't think his corner could speak in Croatia.
Jesus.
There's deep,
deep,

1689
01:42:00.141 --> 01:42:04.290
deep double who he's going to pass.
Half it.
Guardia Cro,

1690
01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:08.540
cop's guard retention is pretty good.
It's not that he is very good defenseman.

1691
01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.910
Yeah,
it's not that bad.
But this is motherfuckers heavy.

1692
01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:14.780
Oh Elliot heavy and a world champ.
Yeah.
World Champ.

1693
01:42:15.110 --> 01:42:20.040
[inaudible] black belt.
Legit black elite and you can get guns.

1694
01:42:20.041 --> 01:42:23.630
I get down from his back.
He's not such a threat but on top man.
That's his game.

1695
01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:27.620
Yeah,
he's got a lock down and look at this.
We have a strong control.

1696
01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:32.450
Can't get out of that fucking half card.
Huh?
It's got gotta be careful.

1697
01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.570
The explosion is still there.
This is trouble,
man.

1698
01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:39.080
Cro Cop has always been like real explosive,
crazy explosive.

1699
01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.610
I'm going to have a cro,

1700
01:42:42.611 --> 01:42:47.200
cop and garden and got his feet on my hip and they couldn't get any worse.

1701
01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.340
Good luck.
And this is what he's worried about too is the elbows.

1702
01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:54.370
He was talking about this,
that that was the big difference in the first fight.

1703
01:42:54.371 --> 01:42:58.210
And he said that MMA probably should get rid of elbows because it causes a lot

1704
01:42:58.211 --> 01:43:02.320
of blood and people don't want to see blood and focus less on the ground.

1705
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:05.320
I thought that was crazy and ridiculous.
That didn't make any sense at all.

1706
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:11.740
It was a damn look at that.
It was always not show you how he's tapping.

1707
01:43:11.741 --> 01:43:14.530
He's happy.
He's tapping these tablets.
Not yet.

1708
01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:17.790
Dad's ran tab as he went down to,

1709
01:43:18.190 --> 01:43:22.530
he looked like he was tapped scrambles.
Oh Hey.

1710
01:43:22.531 --> 01:43:25.840
Maker in the guard.
I thought he was tapping.
I couldn't see his hand,

1711
01:43:26.410 --> 01:43:28.540
but it looked like he was reaching for it like right away.

1712
01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:30.580
That was a bad position.
I was nasty.

1713
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:35.440
That was a funky angle on TV.
I want to see that against Gonzaga.

1714
01:43:35.530 --> 01:43:37.900
Using this grappling.
He's gonna be tough to beat,
man.

1715
01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:43.100
I'm impressed with the cro cop recovering back to full guard.
If he asked me,
he,

1716
01:43:43.210 --> 01:43:46.260
I agree.
He was mounted and now he's on a mountain anymore.
Yup.

1717
01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:50.970
And he almost got his laptop sign that he could do.
He could recover,
uh,

1718
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:53.300
he can to bump him off the mountain.
Several Times.

1719
01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:57.470
I've worked with for doom and dean lister for years for a long,

1720
01:43:57.471 --> 01:44:01.340
long time and his defense going to be solid.
Yeah.
He's,
he's well trained.

1721
01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.410
He's not easy to get to a summit man.

1722
01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:08.230
He's just not at the level where he can attack now.

1723
01:44:08.490 --> 01:44:11.390
[inaudible] I don't think he wants to be either.
Well against this guy.

1724
01:44:11.391 --> 01:44:14.960
He went for that heel hook man,
that's pretty nasty tab random into member.

1725
01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.100
He got back in the does I?

1726
01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.260
I think when cro cop goes in the fight,

1727
01:44:21.261 --> 01:44:24.530
that's the least of his concerns is submitting somebody that was the second

1728
01:44:24.531 --> 01:44:26.910
fight after random and Kayla,
I remember that shit.
Yeah,

1729
01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:31.960
it's Christ Randleman lunged in and Christ on my days man,

1730
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:33.703
they were crazy.

1731
01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:37.640
I don't know if we'll ever see banners fighting and then there were wild man and

1732
01:44:37.641 --> 01:44:39.070
you know what is one of them wild plants.

1733
01:44:39.170 --> 01:44:42.740
He didn't know who the fuck is going to fight until about a week out.
Yeah.

1734
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:45.740
It's like,
oh sweet man.
They were constantly adding,

1735
01:44:45.741 --> 01:44:47.210
it was like an ice house show and just

1736
01:44:49.050 --> 01:44:51.290
they were constantly adding fighters.

1737
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:54.140
Like I put together those ice house shows like four days out.

1738
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:57.200
How cool would those days where you had two giant,

1739
01:44:57.230 --> 01:44:59.900
the Jit Evan Bayh organizations for the fans?

1740
01:44:59.930 --> 01:45:02.000
It was the ultimate went back and pretty amazing.

1741
01:45:02.001 --> 01:45:06.890
He left see this knee then pride steps over.
Oh,

1742
01:45:06.891 --> 01:45:07.724
right there.

1743
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:10.650
<v 6>Cro Cop for a second.
We did a good job.</v>

1744
01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:12.250
<v 0>Oh No.
He wasn't looking to tap at all.</v>

1745
01:45:12.251 --> 01:45:14.350
He was looking to get that arm onto the leg.
Yeah.

1746
01:45:16.770 --> 01:45:17.603
<v 6>Damn.</v>

1747
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:23.440
<v 0>It wasn't as threatening as I thought it was in the scramble.
Pretty wild,</v>

1748
01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:27.410
but it wasn't as close as any guy is.
Cardio issues between these two.

1749
01:45:27.411 --> 01:45:30.620
It's Gonzaga.
He's always had some issues when he thinks later in the rounds.

1750
01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:34.700
Do you think that's because of training a team link and not training at like att

1751
01:45:34.701 --> 01:45:36.140
or something like that?
I didn't push enough.

1752
01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:39.170
Probably like when you're always a bully,
when you're on top,

1753
01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.720
it's easy to go three rounds,
try being on bottom,

1754
01:45:41.721 --> 01:45:44.810
getting the worst case scenario,
you know,
getting bad positions.
Right,

1755
01:45:44.811 --> 01:45:48.980
and you got to get used to moving in those positions,
whereas you're not tired.

1756
01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:49.873
Right.

1757
01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:54.080
[inaudible] you're developing technique and you're developing endurance when

1758
01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:56.230
you're moving in those positions when you're tired.
Yeah.

1759
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:59.270
And that's something that people kind of don't know until they get in there and

1760
01:45:59.271 --> 01:46:01.010
do it and you're not going to panic.

1761
01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:05.600
Like I'm sure cro crop was in mount during camp.
He didn't panic down there.

1762
01:46:05.601 --> 01:46:08.240
He got out of it.
Got Back to guard.
Yeah.

1763
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:12.180
But if guns are going to get him to the ground like that again,
yeah,

1764
01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:16.730
he's in trouble.
Yeah.
It's interesting man.
You got to,
he is one of those,

1765
01:46:16.731 --> 01:46:18.380
I mean we're watching him in the main event right now,

1766
01:46:18.381 --> 01:46:21.020
so obviously everything's going well,
but he's one of those guys.

1767
01:46:21.021 --> 01:46:24.470
You got to wonder what if he did go to Jackson's?
What if he did?

1768
01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:27.490
That's what I'm saying,
man.
What if he did when he was with his skill set?

1769
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:31.760
Really good.
He is with stand up.
Woo Dr under that cap.
Beautiful.

1770
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:34.030
Oh good luck.
Nice knee to the body.

1771
01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.930
You're not taking him down against the case on dude nasty and you're not taking

1772
01:46:36.931 --> 01:46:39.830
him down against the cage where that one goes to the junk.
Yeah.
Hit Him.
Right.

1773
01:46:39.831 --> 01:46:43.220
And that Croak up there.
Do you remember the one with check Congo or was that one

1774
01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:49.010
that was attack against decks but really it was an assault on

1775
01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:54.870
<v 2>Kokagni inside the cage is not happening.
You got taken down the open man.</v>

1776
01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.160
That was our game plan.

1777
01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:05.940
God,
I just don't like Cro cop complex.

1778
01:47:05.941 --> 01:47:08.110
So he's just going to eat a right hand at any second.

1779
01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:12.780
He could double right hand is which Gonzaga is Wu missed again.
No.

1780
01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:15.240
And I liked about Gonzaga's leg attack was a,

1781
01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:18.520
he was completely safe from being punched.
That was an angle.

1782
01:47:18.521 --> 01:47:21.400
He jumped on that foot and that was a safe position.
Yeah.

1783
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:25.000
If he would have cranked it a little better or had a better angle at it.

1784
01:47:25.001 --> 01:47:28.360
Cause usually you see when guys go for leg locks or knee bars,

1785
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:31.180
they're usually eating punches.
It all depends on the angle.

1786
01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:34.630
Especially if you shoot up for a leg lock and the guy's still standing.

1787
01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:38.870
If you can get to be a strong base,
look at this.
Boom.
Oh Damn.
Beautiful.

1788
01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:40.600
Look strong.
God Damn

1789
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:44.330
tested the flexibility.
Right.

1790
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:46.430
<v 6>So is this been something that we've got this all down.</v>

1791
01:47:47.150 --> 01:47:50.420
<v 2>That's an old school move.
They're making you do the splits.
Yeah.</v>

1792
01:47:50.421 --> 01:47:54.590
Super old school.
Just lift that leg up like it wasn't shit.
Right.

1793
01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:57.950
Just fucking get out of here.
The fuck out it.

1794
01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:59.930
It's so fucking strong.

1795
01:47:59.931 --> 01:48:03.960
Man is a beast and in this top was ish

1796
01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:06.173
<v 6>financially</v>

1797
01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.500
<v 2>cause the cro cop even laying under there,</v>

1798
01:48:09.501 --> 01:48:12.710
it's got to hate those fucking body shots he's going for.
That

1799
01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:15.140
<v 6>broke up.
Did a good job</v>

1800
01:48:15.690 --> 01:48:20.400
<v 2>for sure.
Go for the finish though again,
cause me as much as five rounds,</v>

1801
01:48:20.401 --> 01:48:23.490
25 minutes.
Good pressure on the mouth.

1802
01:48:23.491 --> 01:48:26.770
He can't breathe for shivering when I'm out.
Yeah,
he's can't breathe for shit.

1803
01:48:26.890 --> 01:48:29.700
What Cro cop does mean?
He hangs on,
hangs on,
you go to posture up.

1804
01:48:29.701 --> 01:48:33.810
He gets the fuck out.
But Gonzaga is fucking heavy.

1805
01:48:34.810 --> 01:48:38.340
Follow my friend blue gala punching himself.

1806
01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:41.280
So that must've been a big part of his strategy.

1807
01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:43.740
He must have knew he would be here.
I would attack that leg,

1808
01:48:43.741 --> 01:48:45.960
try and get a better position.
Not Ban,

1809
01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:51.150
but still Gonzaga tough to shake can be tough on top.

1810
01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:56.580
And he also knows that he's robbing Mirko of his vitality every time he smashes

1811
01:48:56.581 --> 01:48:59.070
his face like that.
Yup.
Club coverages.
Ale Hall.

1812
01:48:59.190 --> 01:49:01.290
Plus if you're Jitsu world champion,
this is,

1813
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:06.240
you know this is a walk in the park being on top position here.
Yup.
Yup,
Yup.

1814
01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:09.640
And then you just get them out of that transition man.

1815
01:49:09.641 --> 01:49:12.810
The exact same path to the mountain is so slick with it.

1816
01:49:12.811 --> 01:49:15.990
Two men see how there's no air there.
Grape vines,
the legs.
It was like,

1817
01:49:15.991 --> 01:49:17.850
I don't even need to bother it.
Side control.

1818
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:19.800
I go right to the mouth on this dude.

1819
01:49:20.130 --> 01:49:24.660
Do you see how there was no air in his transition,
which is super snows.
Oh God.

1820
01:49:24.661 --> 01:49:27.090
It's artistic now.
If your cro cop,

1821
01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:31.590
you can only get mounted so many times because he explodes to get out of it.

1822
01:49:31.591 --> 01:49:34.110
Yeah man,
it's a lot of gas to help to burn.
Huh?

1823
01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:37.290
To get a 265 pounds world champ off.

1824
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:41.610
He was going to be tough and as hoists grace who would always say he's cooking

1825
01:49:41.611 --> 01:49:42.690
on right now.
You know,

1826
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:46.440
by wearing them out like this before he sure don't sign up.

1827
01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:48.070
I ain't gonna lie this mound.
I hate

1828
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:51.900
<v 0>when guys on the bottom of Mt.
Try to punch.
Do fucker you zoom out.</v>

1829
01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:54.630
Look at this God damn mouth.
Well,
the striker though,
dude,

1830
01:49:54.631 --> 01:49:57.880
they feel like any time they have a chance to pop your chin.

1831
01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:01.390
I dude knock the guy out from the mountain.
The for Japan knocked him out cold.

1832
01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:04.570
Well,
how about you?
Why a hall knocked a dude out from his guard.

1833
01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:07.230
Remember that on the show who we are.

1834
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:11.180
This right Zaga trying to set up the,
was he chatting up an arm?

1835
01:50:11.181 --> 01:50:15.310
Warm water in an arm bar.
It's a good move.

1836
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:19.420
He's a beast,
dude.
He is.
He gets us to shave his back,

1837
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:21.880
look at it and he's looking for the um,
no,

1838
01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:24.880
it's still there looking for the Americana.
Oh,

1839
01:50:24.881 --> 01:50:28.870
a little blood on the Gonzaga's head.
Where's that coming from?
Boom.
Good at.

1840
01:50:28.871 --> 01:50:33.370
Oh Jesus.
Boom.

1841
01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:37.650
Great Elbow.
You know,
it's interesting that Cro cop was who?
This company,

1842
01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:40.360
it's interesting that you sent him a triangle that cro,

1843
01:50:40.450 --> 01:50:41.890
cro cop was talking about.

1844
01:50:41.891 --> 01:50:44.610
I didn't like the cuts because he didn't like the blood from the nurses.

1845
01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:48.250
What's fucking up?
It's getting them.
Boom,
boom.
Transition.
What?

1846
01:50:48.251 --> 01:50:52.150
Control by Gonzaga.
Look at them.
Fucking ferocious out.
Oh Man.

1847
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:54.070
Got Some ferocious control

1848
01:50:55.810 --> 01:51:00.070
that that is exactly what cro cop was saying that he thinks needs to change

1849
01:51:00.071 --> 01:51:04.900
about MMA and the elbows.
Gonzaga.
Oh,
I know what you don't like,

1850
01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.570
man.
It's a bad cut,

1851
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:11.620
but the only type of person that says that about grappling and elbows is a type

1852
01:51:11.621 --> 01:51:14.590
of person that doesn't want to get that happened to them.

1853
01:51:15.130 --> 01:51:17.320
As far as like him being able to do it to someone.

1854
01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:20.020
Of course anybody would want to be able to do it.
That was his game.

1855
01:51:20.021 --> 01:51:22.590
He'd be all about it.
Damn.
That'd be cool with that.
Beautiful.

1856
01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:27.220
Somebody before him,
fuck him up from the Mount Cro cop,
Pat Barry,

1857
01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:30.970
he mounted mounted and his back.
Then I just take down and they choked.

1858
01:51:30.971 --> 01:51:33.370
Pat Barry with one arm.
He kicked out the leg.

1859
01:51:33.371 --> 01:51:36.940
Did he kick out the right leg or he kicked out the left leg?
He tripped him.

1860
01:51:37.210 --> 01:51:37.960
He picked it up,

1861
01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:42.280
then tripped up the loving eyes looking at this ferocious crown and pound,

1862
01:51:42.490 --> 01:51:46.630
just nasty controller.
This boom.
That was the one that caught him open.

1863
01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:51.610
Dude,
the control console I had once he gets on top,
man,

1864
01:51:51.611 --> 01:51:56.440
that's nasty control of Cro.
Cop were to lose this fight.
Thank you.

1865
01:51:56.441 --> 01:52:01.300
Fight to get in the UFC.
That's a good question.
I mean,

1866
01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:06.340
they love him.
He's still a star.
He's still a legend.
He still,

1867
01:52:06.341 --> 01:52:10.820
you know,
like one of the most important guys in the history of MMA ever.

1868
01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:16.150
He's my favorite fighter of all time point.
Does the FCC in Hawaii.
We're good.

1869
01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:20.590
Well,
he definitely is not going to fight the Gonzaga next unless he beats him.

1870
01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:22.870
I mean if he kaos him right here,
we stopped talking.

1871
01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:27.460
If you fucking head kicks Gonzaga right here,
we stopped talking.
He's a great,

1872
01:52:27.490 --> 01:52:31.300
he's a great guy for the UFC to open new markets in Europe,
right?

1873
01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:36.010
You want him to have a UFC and the Ukraine or something.
Boom.
Open up a headline.

1874
01:52:36.011 --> 01:52:38.280
It would cro cop.
He's still got a few fights left him.

1875
01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:41.440
Well if he wants a fight again in Croatia,
even if he's not the main event,

1876
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:45.380
they'll still sell them.
Mother fucker out sell out.
He's a national hero.

1877
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:50.180
<v 3>He's a goddamn national hero over there and like we said,
undeniable.</v>

1878
01:52:50.210 --> 01:52:54.830
One of the legends of the game called soccer with the big takedown defense.

1879
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:57.740
Kokab perhaps a little confidential.

1880
01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:06.480
He's just looking at a jab though.
Not too many left hands.
No Man.

1881
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:09.920
You've got to see him open up with that kick.
Maybe even to the body.

1882
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:12.600
Gonzaga gets right hand happy though.
Hmm.

1883
01:53:18.130 --> 01:53:19.040
<v 6>Older and slower</v>

1884
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:24.360
<v 3>I can talk is slowing down.
Yeah,
it's tough.
Third round man.</v>

1885
01:53:24.361 --> 01:53:29.010
He put a lot of pressure on him.
Mount.
Yeah.
Held them down.
Beat on him.

1886
01:53:29.011 --> 01:53:32.730
But he definitely took a way less damage.
So

1887
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:38.570
if he's tired right here too to fees tired,
I could see cro cop one in this.

1888
01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:42.050
You never know.
You never know what,
three minutes ago,

1889
01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:45.710
you'd never know any crazy shit to go and you've got two more rounds,
bro.

1890
01:53:45.711 --> 01:53:49.340
You got to remember it's five.
That's right.
I just got so excited

1891
01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:55.070
and he's failed last to take the attempts having worked.
I'm telling you,
man,

1892
01:53:55.130 --> 01:53:58.650
against the cage.
Save Your fucking energy.
Don't do it.
This is all kosher.

1893
01:53:58.910 --> 01:54:03.350
This is his game,
man.
He fucked me up against the cage.

1894
01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:08.090
Need to the body.
Buggles og while he had his back on the cro cop.

1895
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:13.550
Oh.
Oh look at this second wave.
Better apps fail to the CRO.

1896
01:54:13.551 --> 01:54:15.620
Cops have been way better.
He's looking way better.

1897
01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:20.390
That was a good scramble right there.
Oh,
good.
Left hand by Cro cop.
Oh,

1898
01:54:20.391 --> 01:54:25.100
another one cop.
Oh,
did he rocked him.
Gone.
Soccer's her shit.
Upper cut.

1899
01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:27.140
Yo,
come on

1900
01:54:30.570 --> 01:54:34.310
strong with Ganzaga.
He can't hit dude.
Oh,
we got hit again.

1901
01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:39.640
He should know.
He should let her know.
Don't shit.
Holy Shit.

1902
01:54:39.641 --> 01:54:44.000
I have stood over him like a horse dance and punchy.
Got on his knees.

1903
01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:47.150
Especially with the GC guy like this.
He's going to fucking chill.

1904
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:52.220
He's got a pos.
Holy Shit.
What a turnaround.
Great turnaround.

1905
01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:55.530
What God damn turn around.

1906
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:58.040
Even if this was only a three round with two minutes ago,

1907
01:54:58.041 --> 01:55:00.980
you could still finish them here.
Oh Shit.
Big Album.

1908
01:55:00.981 --> 01:55:02.370
I'm at those elbows to the car

1909
01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:08.120
and you got to think this is a real striker.
Throwing it from tight quarters.

1910
01:55:08.121 --> 01:55:09.440
He might not be able to use his body,

1911
01:55:09.441 --> 01:55:13.490
but guaranteed he generates way more power than the average person inaccuracy.

1912
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:17.870
Oh,
those are some,
those are,
oh shit.

1913
01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:22.640
Oh Shit.
Oh goodness.
Oh,
what a goddamn turn around.

1914
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:25.760
Holy Shit.
Those are for one.
It's fuck.

1915
01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:31.400
Oh,
go cro cop.

1916
01:55:31.401 --> 01:55:36.020
He's a Pega tonight.
We got to,
Holy Shit.

1917
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:39.500
Holy Shit.
What a destruction.
Dot.

1918
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:44.430
That was some of the best elbows from the guard ever.
Ever,
ever,

1919
01:55:44.431 --> 01:55:46.230
ever,
ever.
That's what he should be.

1920
01:55:46.231 --> 01:55:49.700
He shouldn't be taking this down and staying in their guard.
Holy Shit.

1921
01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.990
That's when the fire comes.
How ironic is it that grappling and elbows,

1922
01:55:54.991 --> 01:55:56.250
it wouldn't won him the fight.

1923
01:55:56.270 --> 01:56:00.510
That's always complaining about how crazy we were just talking about that.

1924
01:56:00.511 --> 01:56:02.970
Would you put any money off?
You said,
hey cro,
cop's going to take,

1925
01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:06.210
he's gonna get his guard and elbow.
The Shit.

1926
01:56:06.211 --> 01:56:10.380
I'm just getting started with an elbow to elbow,
elbow and tight.

1927
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:15.070
Local time gets hurt,
right?
They're just trying to hang on.
Watch this.
Boom.

1928
01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:19.050
Oh,
that was ferocious.
And then another one.
Oh Dude.

1929
01:56:19.051 --> 01:56:21.450
Miraco can throw some goddamn elbows.

1930
01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:28.020
Did he shattered my nose like that.
Oh my God.
Look at this hammer,

1931
01:56:28.050 --> 01:56:30.990
hammer,
hammer,
boom,
boom,
boom.

1932
01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:35.850
What a fucking turnaround.
But we got to see some of those elbows to the guard.

1933
01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:40.890
Mirko Cro.
Cop has hard.
Fuck what heart?
They're good tag is still down.

1934
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:44.940
His face pretty jacked up.
That's his new spark.
This new spot is in the garden.

1935
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:47.490
What?
Don't fucking hard to come back from that.

1936
01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.290
What a great win for murder.
Ooh.
Look at how the sport has evolved.

1937
01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:58.170
Where the best place for the best striker ever to be is in the guard.

1938
01:56:58.171 --> 01:57:01.530
Thrown those strikes in the guard,
throwing those goddamn strikes.

1939
01:57:01.650 --> 01:57:04.650
That's where he needs to be.
Well,
you think about it on the ground.

1940
01:57:04.651 --> 01:57:08.480
He can generate power and real short areas.
It's evolved into this accurate,

1941
01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:12.960
smart Coleman and saying,
it comes back to Mark Coleman,
the wrestler,
right?

1942
01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:16.680
It all comes back to him.
Wow.
That was incredible.

1943
01:57:16.681 --> 01:57:21.360
Shoguns ice stumbling in the back.
He's still not right,
man.
That was incredible.

1944
01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:26.100
I would,
this is the only guy I would,
I would never instruct to pass the guard.

1945
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:29.310
The guard

1946
01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:33.360
a real wow,

1947
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:38.130
that's a scar you can wear for life with a big victory for cold Cro.

1948
01:57:38.131 --> 01:57:42.150
Cop would,
uh,
well now they're one on one.
Do they do it again?
The trilogies,

1949
01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:45.120
they might.
They very well might.
They very well more.

1950
01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:48.600
That's three in a row for Gonzaga.
Does he get cut?
What does he say?
Hold on.

1951
01:57:50.490 --> 01:57:52.210
<v 7>What does it feel like to get the Great Suhardi?</v>

1952
01:58:01.770 --> 01:58:03.460
But boy

1953
01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:07.610
is it going to keep was pure luck.

1954
01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:15.093
<v 3>No translator.</v>

1955
01:58:15.150 --> 01:58:17.520
<v 7>I feel great.
It was,
I was stopped there.</v>

1956
01:58:17.570 --> 01:58:22.420
There was five rounds and fuck the bus and we made the plan is still rounds.

1957
01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:24.120
Two rounds in the ring of Louis.

1958
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.990
Just stay calm and to be believed.
Really.

1959
01:58:27.991 --> 01:58:31.530
We believe that they're a go forward.
You'll be doing

1960
01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:34.313
those elbows,

1961
01:58:35.410 --> 01:58:39.610
<v 3>those,
Oh,
we'll get that nice uppercut to amazing.
Oh my God.
Boom,</v>

1962
01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:41.440
boom,

1963
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.550
<v 0>boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.</v>

1964
01:58:50.670 --> 01:58:53.560
<v 7>Of course.
Have you taught,</v>

1965
01:58:56.330 --> 01:58:57.160
<v 0>wow</v>

1966
01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:58.420
<v 7>for me to be calling y'all fight.</v>

1967
01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:00.760
<v 0>He's such a bad mother fucker.
Would it be?</v>

1968
01:59:00.761 --> 01:59:02.640
Just goes on a tear on everyone who beat him.

1969
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:05.810
<v 7>What comes next thing I want to do is take a shower and you gotta go ahead and</v>

1970
01:59:05.811 --> 01:59:10.190
call in about an hour and a half times,
puts it not playing.

1971
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:13.010
<v 0>Do you mind turning the week?</v>

1972
01:59:14.770 --> 01:59:18.010
<v 7>Maybe one or two weeks?
Yeah,</v>

1973
01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:22.030
<v 0>maybe one or two weeks.
I'll take a rest and train again.
Monster.</v>

1974
01:59:23.710 --> 01:59:27.070
Now,
if anybody had ever told him to retire after his losses,

1975
01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:29.980
you know he would have missed out on this glory.
Right?
Right.

1976
01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:31.690
That's why he can't retire Joe.

1977
01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:36.960
But what do you think is the balance between a god like this who is just going

1978
01:59:38.171 --> 01:59:43.171
to press on and still at times like tonight be spectacularly successful?

1979
01:59:44.230 --> 01:59:48.640
Or a guy like Jamie Varner who says,
you know what,
I think it's over,

1980
01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:52.840
but a guy like cro cop,
what's left for him to do?
That's true.
What's left?
Well,

1981
01:59:52.841 --> 01:59:57.550
he obviously love this as much as anything in life and this moment right now is

1982
01:59:57.551 --> 02:00:01.750
going to be like one of the greatest moments I've ever,
ever remember.

1983
02:00:01.751 --> 02:00:06.670
And he overcame a dude on the serious adversity.
He overcame,
said,

1984
02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:10.990
look at that son.
Best ever most finishes in UFC pride,

1985
02:00:10.991 --> 02:00:15.520
WEC in strike force ever.
22 Vandelay right on his tail.

1986
02:00:15.970 --> 02:00:20.590
Anderson behind that Shogun back in the day 16 wow.

1987
02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:25.300
That's nuts man.
All pride guys.
That's not what a legend that guy is.

1988
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:29.410
You go back to his highlight reel and pride though.
None best.
No,

1989
02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:33.610
no one had a better highlight reel of finishes that kick to the body on heath

1990
02:00:33.611 --> 02:00:35.470
herring who showed it on this podcast before,

1991
02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:39.570
but it was like he went halfway into his body with that round thing.
Insane man.

1992
02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:42.100
Do you think about the guys he's beat?
Especially in their prime.

1993
02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:43.750
He'd beat Josh Barnett twice.

1994
02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:48.980
Beat Mark Hunt Wanderlei he lost a fade or steel man.

1995
02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:54.130
You have to guy decision.
He lost to a,
he lost two men,
a Toro,

1996
02:00:54.131 --> 02:00:58.840
but Minataro had the best chin in the world at the time and Cro.

1997
02:00:58.841 --> 02:01:01.330
Cop hit him with everything but the kitchen sink and the head kicked him at the

1998
02:01:01.331 --> 02:01:03.690
end of the first round and when the,

1999
02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:07.570
when the round ended Nogueira thought for a second that they had stopped the

2000
02:01:07.571 --> 02:01:10.420
fight to stop the fight.
They're like,
no,
it's the end of the ride.
It's like okay,

2001
02:01:10.450 --> 02:01:12.380
cool.
Went out in the second round,
took them down and arm bar.

2002
02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:16.420
I think those were the golden years of MMA.
I don't think we'll ever get it back.

2003
02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:17.980
Why don't know about that.
Honestly,

2004
02:01:17.981 --> 02:01:21.760
I think everybody always feels like the time that was passed was the great time.

2005
02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:25.900
But I think the time we're looking at right now with the exception of a few

2006
02:01:25.901 --> 02:01:29.100
divisions is so much higher level than we've ever seen before.

2007
02:01:29.101 --> 02:01:32.590
I think it's higher level.
It's just not the same.
What's the thing?
It's too much.

2008
02:01:32.591 --> 02:01:34.780
I think it's too saturated.
There was also a new thing.

2009
02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:40.070
Anytime there's new shit,
the old shit always looks better.
Like

2010
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:43.250
<v 2>what's it like when it's with music?
With everything.
Like you could say,</v>

2011
02:01:43.251 --> 02:01:47.600
oh I like early iron main Reich,
early Motley Crue.
I don't like the new album,

2012
02:01:47.601 --> 02:01:50.930
which would be 1988 that would be new.
But now 20 years later,

2013
02:01:51.110 --> 02:01:53.810
that new album that came out in 1988 is,

2014
02:01:53.811 --> 02:01:55.880
that's an old album and that's a classic now.

2015
02:01:55.881 --> 02:02:00.350
And it wasn't classic back then with Joe with Joe is right now we're going to

2016
02:02:00.351 --> 02:02:04.310
look back in 20 years at this point and say Holy Shit,

2017
02:02:04.610 --> 02:02:07.250
look at all these big muscles.
I don't think so.
I cause I,

2018
02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:11.000
cause now if you want to be a fighter,
you can do it.
There's a way to do it.

2019
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:14.870
When they were fighting,
it was like what the fuck?
How the fuck did we get?

2020
02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:19.420
How do we make this happen?
And these are legends now you have,
so now you know,

2021
02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:20.181
I hate to be Shitty,

2022
02:02:20.181 --> 02:02:23.090
but you have some kids come off the ultimate fighter or some girls who were

2023
02:02:23.150 --> 02:02:27.530
three.
No.
And then on the big stage,
these guys lost their fucking,

2024
02:02:27.531 --> 02:02:32.090
this rod role they play,
they play these kids these days.
It's not like,

2025
02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:37.400
it's not like Boston,
Black Sabbath.
No.
You know what I'll say?
I'll say hi,

2026
02:02:37.401 --> 02:02:39.200
make slash Jane's time right now.

2027
02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:44.510
I guess you look at the level of experience and competition in those pride

2028
02:02:44.511 --> 02:02:47.360
tournaments.
It's a higher level than we've ever been at.

2029
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:50.000
I think the level is way higher now.

2030
02:02:50.001 --> 02:02:53.900
I think back then you had three guys that could strike really good and you

2031
02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:57.050
remember Bj was the only guy that could box in the night and the and the

2032
02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.390
lightweight division.
Now everybody in the prelims are,

2033
02:02:59.450 --> 02:03:00.650
they're all good strikers now.

2034
02:03:00.651 --> 02:03:05.570
It's like true levels for well rounded guy like it used to be that only a couple

2035
02:03:05.571 --> 02:03:09.860
of guys had professional footwork,
but now anybody in the prelims,

2036
02:03:10.130 --> 02:03:13.610
you can't get into the UFC unless you have professional footwork now nowadays.

2037
02:03:13.610 --> 02:03:14.870
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

2038
02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:19.010
You can't be half assed and now everyone is also incorporating a lot of that,

2039
02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:22.940
what they call neo footwork that Dominick Cruz,
Tj Dillashaw.

2040
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.420
That's the next level.
Hyper evolve.
That's next level stuff,

2041
02:03:26.421 --> 02:03:30.800
but I see what you're saying.
It's pride.
It's like led Zepplin and all that shit.

2042
02:03:30.990 --> 02:03:35.360
But you know what a see led Zeppelin outside of the plagiarism accusations that

2043
02:03:35.361 --> 02:03:36.260
are pretty significant.

2044
02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:39.710
You just put that all aside and just look at the finished product.
God Damn,

2045
02:03:39.711 --> 02:03:41.840
I don't think there's anybody today that can fuck with them.

2046
02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:46.220
They had some goddamned songs that were just so insanely good,

2047
02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.840
so insanely good.
I mean,
you heard imagine dragons,
there's different,

2048
02:03:51.230 --> 02:03:53.890
I mean everybody's,
we're all have know what that is.
There's,

2049
02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:56.560
there's different and there's equal.
You know,

2050
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:59.660
there's a lot of bands that I think are on that level,
but I just,
there's like,

2051
02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:02.300
hold on a love.
I don't think there's a song that's ever been better.

2052
02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:05.960
There's different songs,
there's awesome songs that are equally awesome,

2053
02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:08.600
but there's none better.
That's just like one of the all time greats.

2054
02:04:08.601 --> 02:04:10.700
It's up there with Voodoo child.
Kendricks to me,

2055
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:15.790
and going back to think of when cro cop was fighting Vandelay Mark Hunt fucking

2056
02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:21.560
Josh Barnett,
God Dak and find out about these guys.

2057
02:04:21.561 --> 02:04:26.510
He fought and then Josh Barnett and the same night,
same night,
Theo much weight.

2058
02:04:26.511 --> 02:04:30.770
He gave it to mark.
Oh yeah,
mark these and these are in their prime.

2059
02:04:30.771 --> 02:04:33.920
These are some of the best that have ever done it.
And he's beating him.

2060
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:39.090
We'll say nine.
How good was Goddamn fade or back?
Cause he was down cro cop.

2061
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:43.470
That was essentially a kickboxing pout when cro cop was at his very best.

2062
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:45.900
He hit him too,
man.
He fucked his nose out.
Who?

2063
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:48.780
Even with some hard shots and fade or kept walking him down.

2064
02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:51.720
Pharaoh was chasing him down the whole fight.
He kept him on the heel,

2065
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:55.710
kept him on his back foot all the time.
It's tough,
man.
Kept him backing up.

2066
02:04:56.010 --> 02:04:57.210
Really interesting man.

2067
02:04:57.510 --> 02:05:01.440
That's how God damn good federal was in his prime when he was in his prime.

2068
02:05:01.650 --> 02:05:05.520
The game just changes.
It's like basketball.
Like you look at basketball off the,

2069
02:05:05.521 --> 02:05:07.740
I don't know,
you guys aren't huge.
Basketball fans really get basketball.

2070
02:05:07.741 --> 02:05:11.610
Like Lebron liked the games change where it's kind of like a Fufu lead now.

2071
02:05:11.730 --> 02:05:15.180
Well when Michael Jordan,
the bulls were there,
it was a different time.
Man.

2072
02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:18.570
Basketball was better reads is never going to be as good as that.
Never.

2073
02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:19.920
How can he say that though?

2074
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:21.810
Athletes getting better all the time and getting better,

2075
02:05:21.811 --> 02:05:23.640
but the game's changed because it's all about offense,

2076
02:05:23.641 --> 02:05:26.220
so that really no one plays defense really anymore.

2077
02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:27.900
It's all about the dunk and stuff like that,

2078
02:05:27.901 --> 02:05:32.070
but no one is preventing them from like 20 years ago to they're saying the exact

2079
02:05:32.071 --> 02:05:33.660
same thing.
Maybe I'm old school.

2080
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:38.130
Are you old school Jordan and a Prime Mirko Cro,

2081
02:05:38.131 --> 02:05:40.500
cop time,
Mason legends.

2082
02:05:41.090 --> 02:05:44.280
Over time we're going to look back at Lebron and they say the same thing.
Yeah.

2083
02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:45.630
Well you maybe,

2084
02:05:45.630 --> 02:05:49.380
maybe he might not ever win as many championships as Michael Jordan,

2085
02:05:49.381 --> 02:05:52.590
but already right now you got to put them in the same class as Michael Jordan.

2086
02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:55.510
You were ready to limit Lebron come on you.

2087
02:05:55.530 --> 02:05:58.710
I think in the same class and a guy like mighty mouse.

2088
02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:00.450
There's never been a dude like mighty mouse.

2089
02:06:00.451 --> 02:06:03.960
People don't appreciate it because he weighs 125 pounds.
True,

2090
02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:07.830
but God damn mighty mouse is good.
He's so fucking,
he's so fucking,

2091
02:06:07.831 --> 02:06:12.570
he's so fucking no one cares that it's hard because he's fighting little dudes

2092
02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:17.370
and they're all 125 pounds and people don't appreciate it just from like the

2093
02:06:17.550 --> 02:06:19.140
human being perspective.
Cause first of all,

2094
02:06:19.141 --> 02:06:22.380
they don't have to fight gravity as hard.
They can move faster.
I got to like you,

2095
02:06:23.070 --> 02:06:25.590
if there was a guy like you that could move like mighty mouse,

2096
02:06:25.930 --> 02:06:28.950
they would have sports scientists come in and try to figure out what the fuck

2097
02:06:28.951 --> 02:06:32.780
you're doing.
You know,
if you,
if you were doing something like unusual,

2098
02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:34.680
your training methods,
everyone would start doing it.

2099
02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:37.290
If you could move like mighty mouse,
do you a heavyweight?
Everybody would do it.

2100
02:06:37.291 --> 02:06:41.500
You're right.
I agree.
I uh,
Kenny Florian told me that a DC was,

2101
02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:46.200
was going out one night and this was in Vegas and he sees mighty mouse talk to

2102
02:06:46.210 --> 02:06:49.530
the bouncer.
Like,
Bro,
let me in dcs,
like my man,

2103
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:54.570
this is the world champion of the UFC.
And the guy was like,
really?
Yes.

2104
02:06:54.970 --> 02:06:59.250
You know,
he got him in.
That's fucking mighty mouse,
man.
It's insane.

2105
02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:02.910
It's just those lighter weight classes you will,
a lot of people don't know.

2106
02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:06.840
It's unfortunate,
but if you look at it from like the technique perspective,

2107
02:07:06.841 --> 02:07:09.840
like I always say that if you want to emulate somebody,
he's the dude.

2108
02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:13.140
He does everything perfect.
If you're around the game,
you appreciate it.

2109
02:07:13.141 --> 02:07:16.530
If you're a casual fan,
you don't give a fuck about the little guys.
Well,

2110
02:07:16.531 --> 02:07:19.910
he knocked out Benevidez,
which in my opinion was unbelievably,

2111
02:07:19.930 --> 02:07:21.710
nobody ever did that.
Benevidez is a monster.

2112
02:07:21.711 --> 02:07:24.870
He's a stud and he cracked him with one punch you to heal.

2113
02:07:24.930 --> 02:07:27.240
You need someone that's going to buy greyhound like another.

2114
02:07:27.241 --> 02:07:31.020
Conor Mcgregor at one 25 th all was it.
Person knows his shit.

2115
02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:33.390
Although don't get me wrong,
all it has in the last nine years,

2116
02:07:33.391 --> 02:07:34.710
he's a fucking monster.

2117
02:07:34.890 --> 02:07:37.610
He's never been bigger now that he's going to fight Conor,
it's true.

2118
02:07:37.610 --> 02:07:39.340
It's the best thing that ever happened to all those.
Connor,

2119
02:07:39.370 --> 02:07:42.970
it's hard though to deal with the disrespect and all the stuff that he does to

2120
02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:45.520
them.
I think it to me trouble.
I think it's to me trouble.

2121
02:07:45.521 --> 02:07:48.550
I think you're going to get a fucking nasty Aldo man.
Oh,

2122
02:07:48.551 --> 02:07:50.680
you're definitely gonna get a nasty.
Although the question is,

2123
02:07:50.681 --> 02:07:55.150
is going to have the stamina to do that for more than one or two rounds fight.

2124
02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:59.620
That's true.
But Aldo,
while he hurt Mendez at the end of a,

2125
02:07:59.621 --> 02:08:03.300
was it the end of the first,
when the bell,
the second,
second,
yeah.

2126
02:08:03.570 --> 02:08:07.480
And a Mendez tagged him,
but then,
uh,
into the,
the third,

2127
02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:12.190
fourth and fifth rounds,
he wound up winning a decision and he wound up,

2128
02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:15.760
uh,
beating Mendez.
But that was probably the best anybody had looked against.

2129
02:08:15.761 --> 02:08:18.970
Aldo.
It was the first time anybody ever cracked all the good men dancing.

2130
02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:23.080
He's very good.
Listen,
I love Connor.
Connor's my man.

2131
02:08:23.081 --> 02:08:26.470
But Connor Mendez isn't a good fight for Conor.
Well,

2132
02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:29.200
it's interesting because he's such a fucking powerful wrestling,

2133
02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:32.980
so God damn fast and it's the one thing we haven't seen is the powerful
wrestler.

2134
02:08:32.981 --> 02:08:36.790
But then you look at what he does,
alumnus,
he puts dude's away with his hands.

2135
02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:40.030
He's fast as fuck.
Dude.
There's no one more powerful than Mendez.

2136
02:08:40.031 --> 02:08:40.990
He's such a stud.

2137
02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:45.400
Just start I favor was saying Mendez is the biggest freak in the gym and to see

2138
02:08:45.401 --> 02:08:49.780
all take his best and still win.
Everyone was like Jesus.
Jesus.

2139
02:08:50.170 --> 02:08:52.720
Well Mcgregor is even bigger than him.

2140
02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:57.110
He's longer big boy and he throws some nasty left hands.
Man,
I asked,
he left.

2141
02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:00.880
It's a lot of weight behind it and if he can get one off and if he can really

2142
02:09:00.881 --> 02:09:05.200
impose that,
like his psychological game is fucking strong.

2143
02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:08.460
He believes in him.
Psalm and Ali,
Sonny Liston strong.
I agree.
It's,

2144
02:09:08.461 --> 02:09:10.840
it's strong in a weird way.
Like you see no cracks in it.

2145
02:09:10.841 --> 02:09:13.360
He doesn't ever back off.
It doesn't ever say anything stupid.

2146
02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:15.550
I'm rooting for Connor.
You know,
he never does it ever say,

2147
02:09:15.551 --> 02:09:17.140
I'm going to beat you into a living death.

2148
02:09:17.530 --> 02:09:20.490
Remember that Ken shamrock and Tito Ortiz,
come on,
man.

2149
02:09:21.250 --> 02:09:24.550
He never falters with his shit talking game.
It's so powerful.

2150
02:09:24.551 --> 02:09:27.280
It makes you deny who you are,
I think.

2151
02:09:27.281 --> 02:09:31.000
I think it's better for the sport if Connor wins.
I don't know about all that.

2152
02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:34.210
I don't know about all I do.
I don't.
I think if kind of loses,

2153
02:09:34.211 --> 02:09:36.490
maybe it's good for the sport.
Oh I disagree.

2154
02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:38.890
Why I need that fucking pink elephant in the room.

2155
02:09:38.891 --> 02:09:42.580
But what if it's all gray elephant?
What?
It's at a wild good fight.
Okay.

2156
02:09:42.610 --> 02:09:44.210
Then what do you do with comment?
Let's say he loses.

2157
02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:47.450
What do you do with it or you rematch?
Well,

2158
02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:49.600
did you just hear your head lighting the rest of the division?

2159
02:09:49.601 --> 02:09:52.090
Think about this division right now.
You've got Frankie Edgar's about to fight.

2160
02:09:52.091 --> 02:09:55.170
Your rider won't match up for Connor.
Either one of those guys.

2161
02:09:55.210 --> 02:09:59.220
Either one cause they can wrestle their fucking ass off your Riaa favor.

2162
02:09:59.221 --> 02:10:00.280
It would be interesting.

2163
02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:03.320
Be interesting cause we really haven't seen him at one 45 in a few years.

2164
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:04.030
It's true.

2165
02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:08.290
He might be better at one 45 you might be better with not cutting such an

2166
02:10:08.291 --> 02:10:10.960
extreme amount of weight.
I mean there's a reason why he's taking this fight.

2167
02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:15.260
Yeah,
I know.
I don't think that's a,
you know a,

2168
02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:18.520
an excursion into one 45 but we didn't expect that.

2169
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:21.160
Nobody expect that he's in the hunt at one 35 for the title,

2170
02:10:21.161 --> 02:10:22.690
but he doesn't want to fight it.
There's one way of teaching.

2171
02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:23.920
It's very interesting,

2172
02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:28.360
very interesting in Connor's big enough where he can do super fights against

2173
02:10:28.361 --> 02:10:33.160
Pedis or oh yeah,
yeah.
Well,
and then you know,

2174
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.040
there's a lot of guys

2175
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.750
<v 5>at one 55 that we'd love to fight him.</v>

2176
02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:39.200
It was a lot of guys that entire UFC once fight Conor what he brings to the

2177
02:10:39.201 --> 02:10:42.590
table,
all of them want to fight him.
Well if his best matchup,

2178
02:10:42.610 --> 02:10:45.650
which this is fucking insane to say,
but just style wise,
all those,

2179
02:10:45.651 --> 02:10:48.140
the best matchup in the top five form after that,
man,

2180
02:10:48.141 --> 02:10:52.160
it's trouble because we're talking about grapplers what's going to be

2181
02:10:52.161 --> 02:10:54.500
interesting to see if he could hang with all those standing?
I mean he clipped,

2182
02:10:54.501 --> 02:10:57.860
Pour,
Yay.
Early in the fight.
He did hurt him,
no doubt about it,

2183
02:10:57.861 --> 02:11:02.180
but we didn't get to see an exchange.
You know,
one thing about Connor that the,

2184
02:11:02.181 --> 02:11:06.650
I feel that,
uh,
grapplers there's a really,

2185
02:11:06.651 --> 02:11:11.651
really good sign and I saw it firsthand that he has the mentality to get really,

2186
02:11:12.261 --> 02:11:14.560
really good at Jujitsu.
That,
and I'll tell you why.
Uh,

2187
02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:19.220
I'm teaching class one fucking day,
maybe six months ago,
maybe eight months ago.

2188
02:11:19.730 --> 02:11:22.640
And,
uh,
I'm looking over at the bag and the corner,

2189
02:11:22.641 --> 02:11:26.850
someone's punching a bag in the corner and I'm teaching class and I look over,

2190
02:11:26.851 --> 02:11:30.650
I'm like,
I said,
fucking Conor McGregor hitting the bag in my jam.

2191
02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:35.500
So I walk over and like,
hey dude,
the first time I ever met him said,
hey dude,

2192
02:11:35.501 --> 02:11:38.420
what's that?
What the fuck are you doing here?
He goes,
Oh mate,
you know,

2193
02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:43.520
that'll say,
mate,
Australia.
Okay,
well I can't do an Irish accent,

2194
02:11:43.550 --> 02:11:48.470
but I can't do any accents.
But he,
uh,
we said,
hey,
what's up?
You know,

2195
02:11:48.471 --> 02:11:51.770
and told them I'm a fan and all that shit.
And I said,
Hey,
I'm just teaching,

2196
02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:54.200
you know?
And he goes,
okay,
I'm just,
I just needed a bag to hit.

2197
02:11:54.201 --> 02:11:56.300
I was down the street at hotel doing UFC shit.

2198
02:11:56.750 --> 02:12:01.750
So I go back to class within three minutes he shows up on the mat and just says,

2199
02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:05.330
where are your best guys?
And I said,
okay.

2200
02:12:05.331 --> 02:12:07.360
So I hooked him up with my best guys and,

2201
02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:12.610
and he just kept wanting to go with all my best guys.
That's amazing.
Nobody dies.

2202
02:12:13.770 --> 02:12:16.520
No UFC guys do that.
No UFC guys do that.

2203
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:19.430
There's a lot of hardcore grapplers and that's what they do.

2204
02:12:19.431 --> 02:12:22.220
And they go from gym to gym and trying to get different looks.

2205
02:12:22.221 --> 02:12:26.000
Guys are looking for the best competition.
Just looking for wars,

2206
02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:28.050
looking for different style matchups cause you're,

2207
02:12:28.130 --> 02:12:31.310
you're trying to have the same guy all the time.
That's not good.
There's a,

2208
02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:34.730
there's a 200 styles out there and you're training with three styles every day.

2209
02:12:34.731 --> 02:12:37.040
You're turning the two styles every day.
Four styles.

2210
02:12:37.130 --> 02:12:40.850
You need big giant classes where there's so many different,

2211
02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:46.670
there's so many in grappling.
It's endless.
You Connor's a brown belt.
Yeah.

2212
02:12:46.970 --> 02:12:49.040
So he showed up,
he showed up.
And you know what,

2213
02:12:49.190 --> 02:12:53.720
he that showed me that he has the mentality to,

2214
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:58.750
he's not afraid to grapple and train and work with whoever on the ground to

2215
02:12:59.061 --> 02:13:03.380
improve his grappling.
That's huge.
So from that point I thought,
you know what,

2216
02:13:03.381 --> 02:13:06.550
that's why he's good.
I agree.
That's why,
cause he's always on her face looking.

2217
02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:09.400
Do we evolve fan as well?
I'm thinking,

2218
02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:11.210
I mean he's definitely an extraordinary human being.

2219
02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:14.570
I've never had a famous UFC fighter ever do that.
They,
they,

2220
02:13:14.571 --> 02:13:19.550
a lot of them come by and say hi and they said they stand on the cage and they

2221
02:13:19.551 --> 02:13:21.500
look in and a couple of train.

2222
02:13:21.501 --> 02:13:24.890
But when it came down to Raleigh and they didn't want to roll famous UFC

2223
02:13:24.891 --> 02:13:29.360
fighters,
generally I,
I understand where they're coming from.
They're famous.

2224
02:13:29.690 --> 02:13:31.980
They train,
they train in some where they don't,
they don't know

2225
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.640
<v 2>the guys and you know there's going to be cameras out and maybe he gets tapped</v>

2226
02:13:35.641 --> 02:13:37.680
out by a blue belt and then someone goes on the Internet and go,

2227
02:13:37.681 --> 02:13:42.681
I just tapped out fucking dad off from the UFC guys in the UFC dental Wonka shit

2228
02:13:43.171 --> 02:13:46.050
that they don't want to get hurt though either because there's gyms you I've

2229
02:13:46.051 --> 02:13:49.920
been to where I'll go with tough guys like you know,
some black belt,

2230
02:13:49.921 --> 02:13:51.720
some brown belts and then they're,

2231
02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:55.680
they're studs in the corner waiting for me to get tired.
It's like,
Oh last round,

2232
02:13:55.681 --> 02:13:57.420
let's go.
And then you ended up getting hurt.

2233
02:13:57.750 --> 02:14:01.470
He had this weird thing that people do when they said that they're worried about

2234
02:14:01.471 --> 02:14:04.950
getting hurt unless they have not telling him a fight coming like next week or

2235
02:14:04.951 --> 02:14:07.440
two weeks.
Then you don't grab hard cause you don't want to get hurt.

2236
02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:10.670
But I think they don't want to get tapped.
Yeah,
I think it's both.

2237
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:12.900
I think he's supposed,
I think it's ego and they don't want to get hurt,

2238
02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:13.651
but it is gross.

2239
02:14:13.651 --> 02:14:17.070
When you see dudes sitting out and waiting for you to get tired and then they

2240
02:14:17.071 --> 02:14:21.420
ask you to roll,
like you just sat out,
man,
you didn't even enroll.

2241
02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.490
Are you trying to cheat cheating?

2242
02:14:23.491 --> 02:14:26.050
You're trying to catch someone who just ran the marathon and ask him to race.

2243
02:14:26.051 --> 02:14:28.770
Yeah,
it's weird man.
If there's guys that,
uh,

2244
02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:33.090
there's guys that all they do is leg locks.
I can see a guy saying,
hey,

2245
02:14:33.091 --> 02:14:34.720
I don't want to get my legs hurt.
You know,

2246
02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:37.490
because people believe that people believe that.
You know,

2247
02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:39.510
you go against the guy that's going to attack your legs,

2248
02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:42.760
you're going to get hurt.
I believe that shit I don't believe in anymore.
But um,

2249
02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:46.980
I could understand that guys,
there's dudes that are led glock assassins.

2250
02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:49.590
I knows also certain dudes who are hurt dudes.
We know that

2251
02:14:51.150 --> 02:14:54.720
they don't give a fuck.
Well that's Tokyo thing.
That's the hardest thing.

2252
02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:59.730
They talk about that even in the gym they had a problem with him like more than

2253
02:14:59.731 --> 02:15:01.590
one gym.
You can only train with his brother,

2254
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:04.770
but he can only really train with his brother because if it goes with anyone

2255
02:15:04.771 --> 02:15:07.830
else,
he just doesn't know how to turn it off.
It's fucking ripping limbs off.

2256
02:15:07.831 --> 02:15:10.110
She's just cries,
roll with mayhem.

2257
02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:14.270
He rolls mayhem and may him tapped and he released.
But he,
uh,
if there's a,

2258
02:15:14.290 --> 02:15:17.190
just to see that it was a video of it online.
It said a while ago.

2259
02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:19.590
It was in Brazil back in the day.
He got him in a heel hook.

2260
02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:24.690
I think he got his back.
If I remember.
I forgot.
Maybe an arm bar or forget.

2261
02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:27.480
Um,
it was,
it wasn't a heal hook though.
He got them in a few things.

2262
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:31.140
I think it's a combination of both though.
Eddie.
Ego,
Ego,

2263
02:15:31.141 --> 02:15:34.680
100% sure if there's a fight coming 100%.
You don't want to get hurt.

2264
02:15:35.250 --> 02:15:37.140
There's all this money for sure.
For sure.

2265
02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:39.740
But they're worried about being embarrassed.
Yeah.

2266
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:43.170
I just want some guys never get caught up.
That's why I bring up Connor.

2267
02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:46.860
That's rare.
That's rare,
congressman man,
I'm telling you,

2268
02:15:46.861 --> 02:15:49.080
that dude is special man.
He wins this fight or not.

2269
02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:54.210
That gives me a long ways in life.
Just a dude.
He almost retired two years ago.

2270
02:15:54.211 --> 02:15:58.230
I know he was,
he had a friend that couldn't find anymore.

2271
02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:01.320
He had a friend.
Apparently he had been injured so much in fighting.

2272
02:16:01.321 --> 02:16:06.110
Then he was done and you know,
he was thinking like,
what am I doing?
Uh,

2273
02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:06.953
I think I'm done.

2274
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:11.990
And he actually didn't show up for his boxing classes and he was teaching a

2275
02:16:12.211 --> 02:16:14.610
boxing class.
It didn't show up for like six days or something like that.

2276
02:16:14.611 --> 02:16:17.760
And then finally his manager calls him out two weeks,
two weeks,
two weeks.

2277
02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:20.670
So the manager calls him up and his manager says,
Hey,

2278
02:16:20.850 --> 02:16:24.540
do you want to find the UFC?
And he's like,
Oh shit.
Here we go.

2279
02:16:24.570 --> 02:16:28.950
And he just decided to go full on into it.
Just went crazy right along into it.

2280
02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:33.960
He's really into not sparring with striking is really into that like working on

2281
02:16:34.901 --> 02:16:38.920
technique more than very smart.
Anything Super Smart,
very answered.

2282
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:42.910
Jamie Varner was saying is that area into knots when they trim does the same

2283
02:16:42.911 --> 02:16:45.120
thing too.
When when Metro and first told me that,
I was like,

2284
02:16:45.510 --> 02:16:48.670
because metro has a weird,
Mitchell is very smart,
but he's a weird dude.

2285
02:16:48.671 --> 02:16:51.340
He's different.
He goes,
I don't spar man.
I just kind of,

2286
02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:55.200
I get to the close and I bring it back.
He goes,
all you know will spark.

2287
02:16:55.201 --> 02:16:59.320
You can hit me but I'm not going to hit you.
Why?
He doesn't want to do it.

2288
02:16:59.860 --> 02:17:03.660
That's weird material and doesn't spark fuego.
It's mark and he's on a terrace,

2289
02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:07.270
a working well.
I think there's a lot of those tie guys do that.

2290
02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:11.410
That's a big thing in Moitai like John Wayne par was talking about that when he

2291
02:17:11.411 --> 02:17:15.940
did the podcast that they play all the time.
Dwayne Dwayne is the same way,
man.

2292
02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:19.690
Well Dwayne has a whole system worked out.
Wayne is a fascinating cat.

2293
02:17:20.050 --> 02:17:23.530
He has a whole system worked out as far as getting people comfortable with

2294
02:17:23.531 --> 02:17:26.650
striking and like where he takes you into it step by step.

2295
02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:30.550
I would love to have him explain it.
I don't know.
Actually if he'd be willing to,

2296
02:17:30.551 --> 02:17:34.510
maybe it's this trade secret,
the whole belt system.
He has a whole belt system.

2297
02:17:34.630 --> 02:17:38.350
He's very smart dude.
When it comes to striking,
I was really,

2298
02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:42.580
really impressed when I saw him working with Tj.
Yeah,
I was really impressed.

2299
02:17:42.970 --> 02:17:47.560
I was like,
wow,
like w w Dwayne Bang Ludwig.
It's on some next level shit.

2300
02:17:47.561 --> 02:17:48.880
We don't have to striking coaching.

2301
02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:51.460
The thing is with strike and it's an ego thing too,

2302
02:17:51.461 --> 02:17:55.570
but we see it then NFL guys and especially in college too at these big college

2303
02:17:55.571 --> 02:17:59.320
and the NFL guys used to hit four times a week and kill each other four times a

2304
02:17:59.321 --> 02:18:01.750
week and then some coaches like,
well this,
this isn't smart.

2305
02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:03.970
The guys aren't getting to the game.
They look like shit in the game.

2306
02:18:04.210 --> 02:18:06.790
So then schools like Michigan and Ohio state,

2307
02:18:06.791 --> 02:18:10.510
they pulled it back and then they were successful.
Then everyone followed them.

2308
02:18:10.750 --> 02:18:13.030
Well now we see it in the UFC where,
listen,

2309
02:18:13.031 --> 02:18:16.360
you don't get to the UFC without being tough.
You're tough,
man.

2310
02:18:16.361 --> 02:18:19.580
There's no need to do these gym battles and take it out of here.

2311
02:18:19.581 --> 02:18:21.880
You're not getting paid exactly what Jamie Varner was saying.

2312
02:18:21.881 --> 02:18:25.450
Those are his exact words.
I haven't listened to a word.
Jamie Varner says,

2313
02:18:25.570 --> 02:18:28.600
I love Jamie Varna.
He's,
he's a great guy,
but I haven't listened to it.

2314
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:32.470
I believe you don't need to do it in the,
in the gym,
man.
Yeah.
It's,
um,

2315
02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:36.190
there needs to be some sort of protocol established for training and like an

2316
02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:37.540
Istat like a real,

2317
02:18:37.860 --> 02:18:41.230
like a consensus protocol when it comes to contact.

2318
02:18:41.350 --> 02:18:44.350
Like how much contact should you have or even what's happening out of the camp

2319
02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:47.050
wouldn't happen at of camp.
There's a protocol for an eight week camp.

2320
02:18:47.051 --> 02:18:48.400
You're gonna spar in these days.

2321
02:18:48.550 --> 02:18:52.990
You can do this and it's just the way it should be and it's down to a tee.

2322
02:18:52.991 --> 02:18:54.370
What if someone figured that out?

2323
02:18:54.850 --> 02:18:57.560
Would that be the way your nutritionist is figured out?
Your Diet?
Yes.

2324
02:18:57.670 --> 02:19:01.720
Have that for your whole system.
Everything you do,
isn't that what they do?

2325
02:19:01.950 --> 02:19:06.400
Some places?
Well,
team take down.
I guarantee you mark Lehman does shit like that.

2326
02:19:06.430 --> 02:19:09.020
Mark Layman does that and it works for Johnny Hendricks.
Right.

2327
02:19:09.190 --> 02:19:12.160
You know what I'm saying?
Right?
Well he knows Johnny Hendricks,
Jonny very well.

2328
02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:17.270
Yeah.
I'm trying to know what that means.
Take his
finger and somebody's,

2329
02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:22.030
Hey Brendan.
All it take is figuring out,
okay,
uh,
there's,
uh,
what,

2330
02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:23.980
where are you going to put your wrestling during the week?

2331
02:19:23.981 --> 02:19:27.350
Where are you gonna pick your striking?
Everyone does that.
Everyone does that.

2332
02:19:27.510 --> 02:19:31.850
She's talking about,
but where is it overtraining?
When should you spar?
Yeah.

2333
02:19:31.851 --> 02:19:36.020
That include that too.
Yeah.
Sparring Day.
Wrestled this day.
I'm with you.

2334
02:19:36.021 --> 02:19:38.930
But to where it's the most efficient.
Yeah.
Now I'm smart.

2335
02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:41.180
I was sparring when I get ready for trash round.

2336
02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:45.260
I was sparring fucking hard twice a week at black house.

2337
02:19:45.290 --> 02:19:49.160
Fucking hard man.
You know what I'm saying?
You think that's a bad idea?
Bad idea.

2338
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.710
Bad idea.

2339
02:19:49.710 --> 02:19:52.850
And you said this also about your Ben Rothwell fight sparring with Carlin.

2340
02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:57.890
I got knocked out before the Ben Rothwell fight by Carlin left Hook and how far

2341
02:19:57.891 --> 02:20:00.560
out?
Uh,

2342
02:20:00.890 --> 02:20:05.540
before I fought Nogueira Carwyn rocked me so bad.

2343
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:10.190
Two weeks before ou in front of everyone.
And then we're on the ground.

2344
02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:14.840
Let me tell this story.
I'm getting ready.
We,
we do an open gym in Denver.
Hey,

2345
02:20:14.841 --> 02:20:18.770
come check out local fucking Guy Brendan Schaub in Denver Getting Ready to
fight.

2346
02:20:18.771 --> 02:20:23.600
No.
Garren Brazil like an asshole.
We invite family.
Everyone's like rocky too.
Yes.

2347
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:26.420
I haven't seen Shane and he's helped me.
Nothing.
This camp.

2348
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:30.230
Shane's on a boat an hour away.
My coach goes,
Bro,

2349
02:20:30.231 --> 02:20:33.740
you're supposed to be here showing us.
Ah Shit.
It's Saturday.
Who?
Gay Man?

2350
02:20:33.741 --> 02:20:36.690
He's Brendan's banking.
Any there's fucking,
everyone here goes uh,

2351
02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:41.660
gimme a second hour fucking shade.
Smells like sunscreen.

2352
02:20:41.790 --> 02:20:45.230
Sun Burnt to stall.
Shitty because who has gloves?

2353
02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:50.180
Gets gloves on I think at like cutoff Jean shorts and a fucking van Halen
shirts.

2354
02:20:50.810 --> 02:20:55.550
Just some daisy dukes and hail.
This literally literally tells us,
tells his son,

2355
02:20:55.551 --> 02:20:59.690
he's like,
just wait over there.
I'm like,
I'm going to fucking destroy this.
Heck,

2356
02:20:59.691 --> 02:21:03.200
what the fuck you doing Shane?
He's like,
you ready?
Cracks next assigned like,

2357
02:21:03.201 --> 02:21:04.034
yeah,

2358
02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:08.900
just fucking jumped out at me like a fucking great white shark.

2359
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:12.920
Left Hook.
Boom.
I'm like,
whoa.
It reminds you.

2360
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:15.740
All my family and friends were like,
oh my God,
she's gonna kill shot.

2361
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:20.300
Shane's on top ground and pounding.
I dropped you off.
He drives me.
I come to,

2362
02:21:20.301 --> 02:21:25.130
I go,
what the fuck are you doing?
He goes,
sorry bro.
Here,
get up,

2363
02:21:25.131 --> 02:21:29.570
get up and then take me down.
I'm like,
no,
this isn't doe Wu.
I'm like,
stop.

2364
02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:33.950
Stop.
My told my coach,
I'm like,
I'm fucking rocked man.
And then I find Nogueira.

2365
02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:38.510
Wow.
And he knew that you were about to have a fight.
That shit.

2366
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:42.500
Super old school man.
Shit,
shame.
No one made me more tougher than chain.

2367
02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:46.820
No one gave me more head trauma then champion Jesus Christ.
Love that.

2368
02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:51.650
So the Rothwell fight,
how far out was it again?
Two weeks.

2369
02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:55.760
Cause then that's really when I,
when I was in Denver that last,

2370
02:21:55.761 --> 02:21:59.060
the two weeks out was when we went balls to the wall where it was me,
Shane,

2371
02:21:59.061 --> 02:22:02.600
only three rounds and it was weird trying to knock each other out and you know

2372
02:22:02.601 --> 02:22:06.380
what we do?
The coach would go 30 seconds,
the entire gym,

2373
02:22:06.381 --> 02:22:09.610
which shut the fuck down and watch me and Shank is 30 seconds,

2374
02:22:09.611 --> 02:22:13.280
minute technique out the window.
Plant your feet and punched her in the face.

2375
02:22:13.310 --> 02:22:16.790
Oh my God.
That's what I would do and I used to bank on it.
People are like,
Oh,

2376
02:22:16.791 --> 02:22:19.550
you're the best shot.
That was so cool.
I'm like,
yeah,
thanks man.

2377
02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:23.480
Why used to bank on that?
That was like my things like,
yeah,
shop,

2378
02:22:23.481 --> 02:22:28.350
go toe to toe with Darwin.
Man is so cool.
Bad idea,
man.

2379
02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:31.050
And I'd go in the bathroom,
throw up,
I'd get in my car.

2380
02:22:31.051 --> 02:22:35.430
I went know how to drive home.
Oh my God.
Jamie tells me the same thing.
Call me.

2381
02:22:35.431 --> 02:22:37.470
That was amazing,
brother.
I'm fucked up.

2382
02:22:40.110 --> 02:22:44.580
True story,
man.
Some Cheech and Chong.
I know,

2383
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:48.900
Dude.
It's like,
dude,
where's my car?
Oh my gosh,
crazy.

2384
02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:53.130
So crazy.
When I think back on it now,
I'd be like,
no,
like get the fuck out.

2385
02:22:53.131 --> 02:22:55.530
Or like when I was getting ready for camp at Black House,

2386
02:22:55.531 --> 02:22:58.940
they do this thing where they do rounds and you have to leave your foot in.

2387
02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:00.390
They put three cones out,

2388
02:23:00.391 --> 02:23:03.990
you have to leave your foot in the cone and then spar guys just to work on,

2389
02:23:03.991 --> 02:23:07.710
you know,
staying in the pocket moving and I was just getting started man.

2390
02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:12.780
And they were doing like 12 rounds.
I did,
I did like six.

2391
02:23:12.810 --> 02:23:16.060
Did you rotate guys are just,
yeah,
you'd rotate guys.
Oh my.

2392
02:23:16.180 --> 02:23:17.970
And I did like six and then I was like,
dude,

2393
02:23:17.971 --> 02:23:21.190
I'm taking some shots here and this is an older,
you know,
big brown.

2394
02:23:21.191 --> 02:23:25.410
And I was like I'm good man.
I'm like I wish I was that smart when I was young.

2395
02:23:27.850 --> 02:23:30.760
<v 0>Different people have different systems as far as teaching people how to strike</v>

2396
02:23:30.761 --> 02:23:34.420
and moving in like certain positions every time.

2397
02:23:34.450 --> 02:23:38.110
Time and time again when you watch like the really high level kickboxers from

2398
02:23:38.111 --> 02:23:40.900
Holland,
they all have like a very systematic approach.

2399
02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:45.330
Like I'd love to get you to sit down with a or to train rather with rob came in,

2400
02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:47.770
rob came in was a real interesting guy when it comes to that stuff.

2401
02:23:47.980 --> 02:23:51.430
He's got a system and he teaches a system of it a lot.

2402
02:23:51.431 --> 02:23:55.960
Like a lot of people teach a Jujitsu system now is complex is like your system

2403
02:23:55.961 --> 02:24:00.250
because your system is just infinite number of moves and positions,
but,

2404
02:24:00.360 --> 02:24:04.180
and had like a deep,
deep knowledge of that Dutch style kickboxing.

2405
02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:07.540
So he's a heavyweight and he's trained.
He's a bitch.
He's a big fella.
Um,

2406
02:24:07.750 --> 02:24:11.640
I don't know if he's technically he's over 205 pounds.
I mean,
he's a bigot.

2407
02:24:11.650 --> 02:24:13.750
He's a big fella,
but he's a bad motherfucker.

2408
02:24:13.751 --> 02:24:17.000
Rob came and if you go back and watch the highlight reel ever.
Yeah,

2409
02:24:17.050 --> 02:24:21.440
he was tremendous.
His technique was spectacular in Santa Monica right here.

2410
02:24:21.460 --> 02:24:25.300
Now I think he's staying in Topanga and he's here now.
He's in town.
Um,

2411
02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:28.720
what a great guy too.
Just a sweetheart of a guy.
But he's a,

2412
02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:32.940
he's interesting because he like,
he was responsible for a lot of,
uh,

2413
02:24:33.010 --> 02:24:36.460
Brandon Vera's early success.
That's right.
That's why I know the name.
Yeah.

2414
02:24:36.461 --> 02:24:40.320
He was working with Brendan Vera early in his career and uh,

2415
02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:45.070
whether or not that's why Brendan was so successful.
It's up to debate,
you know,

2416
02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:48.330
but he was doing really well back then when he was with Cayman.
Um,

2417
02:24:48.370 --> 02:24:50.710
I mean that's when he beat prank me or it's when he beat,

2418
02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:55.630
he beat a lot of guys got silver.
Silver heavyweight story was sober.

2419
02:24:56.140 --> 02:24:58.740
Was that who it was?
Did it get to you and him?
Can you teach them?

2420
02:24:58.750 --> 02:25:03.430
That's it's the w who did he head kick?
Kao He had cacao.
Justin Eilers.

2421
02:25:03.610 --> 02:25:07.890
Justin.
Yeah,
Justin,
Heather's.
And then he uh,
need Frank Mir.

2422
02:25:07.891 --> 02:25:11.140
Remember that's when it's right for them.
And then he got on the mic.

2423
02:25:11.141 --> 02:25:14.440
It was like going to be the first five ever heavyweight light heavyweight.
Yeah.

2424
02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:18.550
He looked good back then.
He was an ass look good.
And that's those,

2425
02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:23.020
the rob came in days d related or not related,
I don't know.
And then there was,

2426
02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:24.100
but there was also,
when

2427
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:26.680
<v 2>you talk about him,
you've got to talk about,
he had a contract dispute,</v>

2428
02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:30.480
so he's out for a long time.
There was a contract dispute with the UFC came back.

2429
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:33.040
A lot of pressure on him didn't perform that well when it came back.

2430
02:25:33.580 --> 02:25:37.600
That taking that downtime off contract disputes to that's talking fuck with your

2431
02:25:37.601 --> 02:25:42.080
head man.
I think he's still fighting in one FC.
Yeah,
he is.
Yeah,
he is.

2432
02:25:42.081 --> 02:25:46.060
He's a heavyweight heavyweight again.
Yeah.
He said,
fuck this diet.
Yeah.

2433
02:25:46.061 --> 02:25:47.320
Well especially one FC.

2434
02:25:47.321 --> 02:25:50.500
I don't know what sort of Mexican synced up with supplements they,
uh,

2435
02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:54.210
they test for.
Yeah.
I don't either.
Do they have the full menu of Mexicans,

2436
02:25:54.730 --> 02:25:59.710
Mexican supplements?
That's trouble fighting a brand and very on anything.
Well,

2437
02:25:59.711 --> 02:26:03.060
a lot of these guys,
they say like,
you know,
let them take it.
Why not,
you know,

2438
02:26:03.130 --> 02:26:05.950
have an organization where they do take it.
Let's see what happens.
You know,

2439
02:26:05.951 --> 02:26:09.460
if you've got international fighters at fight over there to say,
Hey,

2440
02:26:09.461 --> 02:26:12.390
this is the pride of Asia,
this is how it goes.
We're not,

2441
02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:14.940
we're not going to test it for steroids.
We don't have to over here.

2442
02:26:15.350 --> 02:26:20.110
There's one FC test.
I don't know.
I have no idea,
frankly,
the big dog over.
Yeah,

2443
02:26:20.111 --> 02:26:24.190
right.
He's running it.
Yeah,
he's running it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's ask,

2444
02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:27.460
does one FC test for starts?
What do you,
what do you think I'm going to say?
No,

2445
02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:29.590
I say no to fuck.
No,

2446
02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:34.240
he's not mean anything outside of the United States.
I,

2447
02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:35.650
I'm always sketchy about men.

2448
02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:37.550
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2449
02:26:37.550 --> 02:26:40.600
<v 2>All right.
Let's see.
It doesn't want to just give a fuck.
It's</v>

2450
02:26:43.210 --> 02:26:45.130
due to

2451
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:52.520
steroid use in American football.
Why is it thing to go too many?
The meds?
Yeah.

2452
02:26:52.521 --> 02:26:57.140
Is that it?
You got to get on Twitter for that.
You think so?

2453
02:26:57.170 --> 02:27:01.850
You think you got to just ask people someone texts rich Franklin,

2454
02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:04.040
does he really going to tell Scott?
I know on Twitter,

2455
02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:07.250
do they test your steroids at one?
Is it the number one?

2456
02:27:07.310 --> 02:27:11.960
Is it one number one FC or zero n?
E.
F says,

2457
02:27:11.961 --> 02:27:12.794
try this.

2458
02:27:13.450 --> 02:27:14.020
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2459
02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:18.880
<v 2>No one FC champion versus champion been Astrin bitches in beauty,</v>

2460
02:27:18.881 --> 02:27:23.490
so doesn't say,
I dunno.
Oh,

2461
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:28.200
drug tests were clean.
Okay.
That means they have a drug test,
one of see it,

2462
02:27:28.290 --> 02:27:32.030
but pride used to say that now in dare you probably like,
no,

2463
02:27:32.050 --> 02:27:35.980
we're good bots upset.
Yeah,
we're good.
Everybody's fine there.
That is an art.

2464
02:27:35.981 --> 02:27:39.340
George Oliveira is it?
Yeah.
He fought for them for a while.
For one I've seen.

2465
02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:40.270
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2466
02:27:40.270 --> 02:27:41.920
<v 2>I didn't know that.
Yeah.</v>

2467
02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:42.960
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2468
02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:45.600
<v 2>What do you mean?
Which George Oliveira you talking about from legends?</v>

2469
02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:48.390
I think it's him,
isn't it?
First of all?
Well,

2470
02:27:48.391 --> 02:27:51.930
it's his drug tests were clean stain that George Valera tested positive for

2471
02:27:51.931 --> 02:27:54.330
steroids.
How dare that.
Let's check.

2472
02:28:00.290 --> 02:28:03.950
Like I said,
ma'am,
anything outside the United States makes me skeptical.
Hippo.

2473
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:06.860
Skeptical Hippo.
Whether you're seen that meme,

2474
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.200
it's a skeptical with just sketchy eyes.

2475
02:28:10.250 --> 02:28:14.300
No skeptical hippo.
Yeah.
It's a funny meme.

2476
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:16.880
Have you seen it?
Oh,
this is a different God.

2477
02:28:16.910 --> 02:28:20.780
That's the George Oliveira that tested positive in the Ryan laflair fight.

2478
02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:21.620
That's a different,

2479
02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:26.360
that's the guy who fought Ryan Laflair in the UFC rates recently,

2480
02:28:30.100 --> 02:28:32.570
right?
I'm not,
he didn't fight.
Ryan will flare.

2481
02:28:32.571 --> 02:28:35.800
He fought in the Rhino for undercard.
Excuse me.
We're flying a little flair.

2482
02:28:35.801 --> 02:28:40.690
Fought a Damien Maia.
Oh,
Damien Maia.
Maia look great.

2483
02:28:40.691 --> 02:28:45.630
Right?
[inaudible] tough.
This is our buddy.
That's our buddy.
Allavara

2484
02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:51.620
skeptical.
Hippo is skeptical.
There it is.
So Nice.

2485
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:53.950
That's my face when you ask if they do steroids.

2486
02:28:55.790 --> 02:28:56.623
<v 4>George Oliver.</v>

2487
02:28:57.220 --> 02:29:00.160
<v 5>That's all I know.
That guy.
I've trained with that guy.</v>

2488
02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:05.190
<v 2>Right.
So there's more that obviously there's more than one.
George Oliveira wait,</v>

2489
02:29:05.191 --> 02:29:09.530
he's not your friend?
No,
that guy is,
that guy is our friend.
He trains,
he trains.

2490
02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:14.250
Yeah.
From legend.
Right.
Legends MMA was,
um,
back in the day.
It was a fun place,

2491
02:29:14.251 --> 02:29:16.560
man.
I went there,
I bought a tee shirt.

2492
02:29:16.561 --> 02:29:19.650
I came to La with a buddy and I at the time wasn't fine.

2493
02:29:19.651 --> 02:29:22.770
I went to legends just because Randy couture on,
I bought a tee shirt,

2494
02:29:22.771 --> 02:29:26.580
like a fan boy ward around.
Awesome.
Hey,

2495
02:29:26.581 --> 02:29:31.410
let's watch that fight.
If we can,
let's see if we can watch that.
Um,
Quinta.

2496
02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:35.490
Yeah,
the ally quantified or um,
that was the one that we wanted to watch.

2497
02:29:35.550 --> 02:29:38.610
And the other one that we wanted to watch was the,
uh,
the Kao,

2498
02:29:38.611 --> 02:29:42.060
the Gustafson Anthony Johnson red button.
We'll watch that first.

2499
02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:43.290
Go Take a pee young man.

2500
02:29:43.370 --> 02:29:47.450
<v 5>Yes sir.
Hey,
uh,
if we have time,
I would,</v>

2501
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:52.060
I would love your opinion on Kathy lungs.
Highlight rail.
Oh,

2502
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.620
she's dope.

2503
02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:53.980
<v 2>Do Right.
I've seen her fight before.</v>

2504
02:29:54.130 --> 02:29:57.500
She was one of those American kickboxers from back in the day.
Right.

2505
02:29:57.580 --> 02:30:02.440
<v 5>She moved.
Yeah.
Well,
very well.
Yeah.
She,
uh,
she was bad ass dude.</v>

2506
02:30:02.490 --> 02:30:05.170
She was bad ass.
She wants to fight.
Does she?
Yeah.

2507
02:30:05.171 --> 02:30:06.910
She's trying to get a fight right now.
Catholic.

2508
02:30:06.911 --> 02:30:11.050
She's just for the 51 and she's in great shifty one.
She's in great shape.

2509
02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:15.460
I see her twice a week and my gym,
she's in great shape.
Wow.
Yeah.

2510
02:30:15.461 --> 02:30:20.350
She's trying to get a fight,
but that's amazing.
51 Invictus should look into her.

2511
02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:22.810
Kathy,
Kathy Law and can still strike.

2512
02:30:22.811 --> 02:30:27.811
She's still down ass and her and she's got a decent defensive Jujitsu.

2513
02:30:28.170 --> 02:30:32.290
She can,
she actually fought MMA like two,
three years ago and while she really,

2514
02:30:32.291 --> 02:30:35.680
yeah,
she fought in,
Ooh.
What show is that?

2515
02:30:36.220 --> 02:30:39.850
That's up on youtube too.
Um,
she won.

2516
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:44.230
She was 49 and she won.
Wow.
That's amazing.

2517
02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:48.670
She really wants to fight.
She is vicious.
Really?
Yeah.

2518
02:30:48.671 --> 02:30:53.560
She's 51 and she wants to fight like now.
This is hard.

2519
02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:56.710
It's like,
I guess promoters are worried about her age.

2520
02:30:57.370 --> 02:31:00.270
<v 2>Yeah.
It's hard to sell that man.
It's hard to sell that,</v>

2521
02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:03.130
<v 5>but when you look at her highlight reel dude,
you're like,
oh shit,</v>

2522
02:31:03.131 --> 02:31:04.730
she could probably pull it off.
I think

2523
02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:08.500
<v 2>well today are more worried about people getting hurt that are older than ever</v>

2524
02:31:08.501 --> 02:31:09.610
before,
you know?

2525
02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:11.260
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2526
02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:14.490
<v 2>Well LIGO would,
cro cop just did shit.
How old is Cro cop?
40,</v>

2527
02:31:15.300 --> 02:31:18.150
40 and our hard 40,
uh,
40,

2528
02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:22.950
you know of a who has been fighting top level competition for a long time,

2529
02:31:24.570 --> 02:31:28.560
you know,
in and out of the gym.
I don't think it's on,
um,

2530
02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:33.840
they don't have it on Cypass goddammit too.
So he,
I don't know.
Is it a,

2531
02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:38.520
is it a Fox fight?
Yeah,
it is a fun site.
Maybe it doesn't get on fight pass.

2532
02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:42.270
Cause that makes sense.
Yeah.

2533
02:31:42.271 --> 02:31:45.030
It doesn't appear to be in the library and listen,
I'm retarded.

2534
02:31:45.031 --> 02:31:47.580
Which is possible.
You can't find it.

2535
02:31:49.890 --> 02:31:54.020
I'm Anthony Johnson.
You should be able to not know.

2536
02:31:54.021 --> 02:31:57.240
That's what I'm looking for.
I'm not bad.
That be sharp graphic down there.

2537
02:31:57.241 --> 02:32:00.180
We'd Lavar Johnson.
Nice.
Pretty Young.
Anaconda.

2538
02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:02.780
Pulpa let's try,
um,

2539
02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:06.600
let's see if we can find the outlier quantified here.

2540
02:32:07.630 --> 02:32:08.050
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

2541
02:32:08.050 --> 02:32:10.540
<v 2>I think if it's not,
I think I have it on direct TV.</v>

2542
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:17.310
I think I saved those here.
Let's see.

2543
02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:21.270
I Quinta versus Ross Pearson.
That's a good fight.

2544
02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:22.990
All right.
Quinn.

2545
02:32:25.410 --> 02:32:26.300
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

2546
02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:32.050
<v 2>Doesn't seem to be on here either.
I couldn't tell him.</v>

2547
02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:36.990
Ask Dow.
Come on bitch.
Uh,

2548
02:32:37.480 --> 02:32:41.880
it doesn't look the that's on there man.
I mean,
can you get the uh,

2549
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:46.980
God,
then you get into some weird shit.
I was going to say,
you can get the replay.

2550
02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:50.670
There it is there.
It's not on fight.
Pass somewhere else.
Okay,
cool.

2551
02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:54.590
Go full screen on that shit son.
Don't be scared.
Here it is.
What does it on?

2552
02:32:54.610 --> 02:32:59.130
This is something illegal.
We legally streaming right now.
Maybe.
Dammit.
Dammit.

2553
02:32:59.131 --> 02:33:02.400
Jamie,
you're going to get us in trouble.
We're going to watch this.

2554
02:33:02.401 --> 02:33:06.210
A fight to see how clearly you're sure we could find just the highlight

2555
02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:10.630
[inaudible] video two.
Is it choppy?
I can find that.
Sure.
We can find the,
yeah,

2556
02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:14.630
the highlight.
Did you use that new component and have a chance to figure it?
Oh,

2557
02:33:14.650 --> 02:33:17.460
okay.
Let's just see it for a second.
Yeah.

2558
02:33:17.461 --> 02:33:20.220
You know what it does to be too choppy to be able to distinguish whether or not

2559
02:33:20.221 --> 02:33:22.210
I was a headbutt.
Sure you can get a slut.
How come?

2560
02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:26.350
It's okay when you're on a short screen like that.
It's not working.

2561
02:33:27.250 --> 02:33:32.220
Oh really?
I was trying to catch up.
So it's like a video card thing.
Yeah.
Wow.

2562
02:33:32.940 --> 02:33:36.180
And that's what that little components for you make it better.
Yeah.
Okay.

2563
02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:36.991
Oh this is,

2564
02:33:36.991 --> 02:33:41.991
so this is post k o w we're going to have to take it to the moment he gets hurt.

2565
02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:45.360
There's a fight.
I haven't seen him.
I was on a plane when this really?
Yeah.

2566
02:33:45.361 --> 02:33:47.980
You got to take ticket way back before that Jamie.
Way Back,

2567
02:33:49.050 --> 02:33:49.890
like right about there,

2568
02:33:52.940 --> 02:33:54.200
like right about where the cursor was.

2569
02:33:55.480 --> 02:34:00.230
Need to go further back because he heard him and then he'd stalked him down for

2570
02:34:01.370 --> 02:34:02.900
a while.
Here it is.

2571
02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:08.360
Look to the uses of this means a fight is already,
oh,
that's the pope to the eye.

2572
02:34:08.390 --> 02:34:11.420
Okay,
so this is the start up after the poke the eye.
Here we go.

2573
02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:17.830
Boom.
That's it.
That's it.
That's what did it.
Yeah.
It's a right as well,
man.

2574
02:34:17.831 --> 02:34:20.280
It's a Ha.
What does he need to see?
The slow motion man?
Yup.

2575
02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:23.050
I think Anthony was going to win this fight anyways,

2576
02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:26.650
whether that headbutt happened up,
but in this certain case,
the headbutts what?

2577
02:34:26.651 --> 02:34:29.380
Fucking destroyed Alexander's.
Okay,

2578
02:34:29.381 --> 02:34:32.170
so tell me what you think him versus John John's.
What happens?

2579
02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:34.330
John's reaches too much.
John.

2580
02:34:34.331 --> 02:34:36.940
We'll take them down and the inside leg trip where I'm out,

2581
02:34:36.970 --> 02:34:41.970
elbows from the guard might submit them or TKM I think it goes three rounds.

2582
02:34:42.250 --> 02:34:46.510
Wow.
Strong words.
And I'm a,
and I'm a fan of Anthony.

2583
02:34:46.570 --> 02:34:51.070
I like Anthony.
He's a fucking nightmare.
Boom,
boom.
It's interesting,

2584
02:34:51.071 --> 02:34:53.140
but every fight John,
like here's the guy,

2585
02:34:53.141 --> 02:34:55.960
here's the guy who's going to beat him very is wrong.

2586
02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:00.310
Well how long can rumble do this?
Like how long can he fight like this?

2587
02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:02.380
Like this is extreme pace.

2588
02:35:02.381 --> 02:35:05.650
He's putting on Augusta sentence like he's gambling and he's gonna Finish

2589
02:35:05.650 --> 02:35:08.010
Gustafson,
you know?
I mean,
he's going full out.
I'm,

2590
02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:12.580
and he's got them hurt real bad and it worked here.
Yeah.
If a guy can recover,

2591
02:35:12.581 --> 02:35:15.270
get to guard or something.
If a guy can't keep from getting hit will do,

2592
02:35:15.271 --> 02:35:17.230
but Jesus Christ or something nasty man.

2593
02:35:17.231 --> 02:35:21.700
If a guy can keep from getting tagged by him and can take him into the third,

2594
02:35:21.701 --> 02:35:24.490
fourth and fifth rounds,
what does that look like?
Well,

2595
02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:27.430
against Phil Davis Look Pretty fucking scary.

2596
02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:30.460
He looks scary in the second and he looks scary and the third,

2597
02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:35.640
but there was Phil Davis who doesn't present as many striking dangers as Jon

2598
02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:36.370
Jones.

2599
02:35:36.370 --> 02:35:40.990
You gotta remember Jon Jones dismantled [inaudible] feet towards very similar to

2600
02:35:40.991 --> 02:35:45.430
Anthony Johnson when with John fought him.
He was explosive.
Is Fuck powerful.

2601
02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:48.310
Remember that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You gotta come that arm bar,

2602
02:35:48.311 --> 02:35:53.050
but he ended up submitting but Vittorio considerably smaller.
Not at the time.

2603
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:56.350
Think About v toward roid it the fuck to the gills.
Yeah.

2604
02:35:56.351 --> 02:35:59.410
I mean he weighed two a five but he's a different two oh five in this fucking

2605
02:35:59.411 --> 02:36:04.270
guy,
man.
Oh Lord.
Let me see that again.
Say that again.
That was,

2606
02:36:04.810 --> 02:36:08.530
that was interesting.
Notice headlands,
that lands,

2607
02:36:08.830 --> 02:36:13.530
I got to see it from the other angle me to look like with a headbutt.
It didn't.

2608
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:16.540
No.
Okay.
Let's see it again.
Here we go.
We're going to see it right here.

2609
02:36:16.570 --> 02:36:21.520
Watch this.
Oh Dude,
that's a right hand.
Let me see one more time.
One more time.

2610
02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.910
See,
that's what I'm saying.
It seems so that angle's rough.

2611
02:36:25.450 --> 02:36:28.450
Let me say it one more time and then he seemed all right after that he was

2612
02:36:28.451 --> 02:36:30.400
moving around and Dan is pretty fucked up.

2613
02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:34.940
I felt so bad for you.
We go one more time.

2614
02:36:37.490 --> 02:36:42.380
One more time is the kick.
Bam.
Dude.
I think the head didn't hit.

2615
02:36:42.381 --> 02:36:46.820
I think they are crazy.
It's hard to do a better angle because that right hand,

2616
02:36:46.850 --> 02:36:51.110
not this one.
This one.
It looks like it landed.
Hits the shoulder to shoulder.

2617
02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:54.680
It doesn't man.
That ain't cool.
It does.
It looks like Tony more time.

2618
02:36:54.681 --> 02:36:59.030
If you can't turn the other view going back to the same spot caught back up.

2619
02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:01.280
He got headbutted.
That would be check it out again.

2620
02:37:01.310 --> 02:37:05.870
You'd be able to see the impact was no think the head goes to the left and the

2621
02:37:05.871 --> 02:37:08.240
right hand lands.
You might've bumped heads at the same time.

2622
02:37:08.241 --> 02:37:12.080
That was just awesome.
It would be us as a bad angle.
See that there was no,

2623
02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:14.690
you would see the impact.

2624
02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:18.260
The other you can tell though when we get this approved or film

2625
02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:21.890
could have hit him,
could have hit him on the right eyebrow.

2626
02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:27.400
Can't you type it on youtube or something for me cause they give you different

2627
02:37:27.921 --> 02:37:31.530
angles.
Here it is.
One more time.
Boom.

2628
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:34.920
He could be handling it that hard to do that.
Could

2629
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:39.230
you take it landed that hard?
Look how fucking Hardee's throwing it.

2630
02:37:39.231 --> 02:37:42.620
He's throwing his whole body into it.
His back comes off bad.
The other one,

2631
02:37:42.621 --> 02:37:46.130
it does fail it one more time.
Let's say it one more time from that other angle.

2632
02:37:46.190 --> 02:37:48.390
I'm telling you if we can just pull some bullshit,

2633
02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:51.600
he get another angle on youtube.
One more time that worry about it.

2634
02:37:51.610 --> 02:37:55.460
It's like some kid in the crowd.
He didn't throw this right hand hard.
It's crazy.

2635
02:37:55.461 --> 02:37:59.210
Watch this right here.
Doesn't look hard.
Wham.
Are you kidding me right there.

2636
02:37:59.211 --> 02:38:03.140
It doesn't.
Oh you're so crazy.
He throws everything into that punch right here.

2637
02:38:03.141 --> 02:38:07.150
It looks like.
What's his face?
See it again.
Pack it up,
Ryan,

2638
02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:10.880
through his it up again on the clavicle,
dude,
Bro.
Sis,
I'm telling you,

2639
02:38:10.881 --> 02:38:14.000
there's one more thing on youtube on the other side.
This right hand,

2640
02:38:14.390 --> 02:38:16.730
the idea that he's not throwing that hard is so crazy.

2641
02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:19.260
I think it landed right here.

2642
02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:24.190
It didn't land in the face and hits his face and then it hits the clouds looking

2643
02:38:24.191 --> 02:38:28.280
at hit his face right here.
It does.
This right here.
It doesn't.
The head hit dude,

2644
02:38:28.281 --> 02:38:32.090
that hit his fucking chasely.
It hit his fucking chicken then.
Oh,

2645
02:38:32.091 --> 02:38:35.240
come on back it up again.
Look at his,
his fucking face.

2646
02:38:35.241 --> 02:38:37.300
It hits his cheek and then it goes into his car.

2647
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:42.260
Donald did it hits his face first.
Right here you're blind.

2648
02:38:42.261 --> 02:38:46.440
You need to go to a doctor.
Boom.

2649
02:38:46.570 --> 02:38:51.290
That punch hits his face.
Punch Punch 100 periods is hear me.

2650
02:38:51.470 --> 02:38:55.790
Do you see when you get up in the morning?
100% no,
Jamie,

2651
02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:58.970
there's an angle from the other side.
One more time.
No,
no.

2652
02:38:58.971 --> 02:39:02.450
This isn't the evidence.
This is what the evidence shows.
It's not just a video.

2653
02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:05.930
No big deal.
On the other side.
One more time.
One more time.

2654
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:10.890
He'll go chin.
Look,
watch this.

2655
02:39:11.090 --> 02:39:14.240
Now watch this.
Next one.
It hit Kalir.
It's fucking his hair

2656
02:39:15.980 --> 02:39:19.160
before it hits anything from a headbutt.

2657
02:39:21.340 --> 02:39:24.680
The Punch lands on the fucking cheek.
That's what you were arguing against.

2658
02:39:24.681 --> 02:39:26.030
You were saying it hits his clavicle.

2659
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:30.590
It definitely wasn't his clavicle that punches and then glances off and then

2660
02:39:30.591 --> 02:39:34.040
hits him on the gentlemen.
Here's the other view.
What are you talking about?

2661
02:39:34.041 --> 02:39:38.100
This view?
You can't see the punch land.
You can see the head,
but just

2662
02:39:39.610 --> 02:39:43.370
watch it looks like he hit him in the head with a Headbutt,
right?

2663
02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:46.820
What's it slowly,
slow,
slow look.

2664
02:39:47.330 --> 02:39:51.470
Bright hand writing and hit the Chin first clearly right and hits the cheek is

2665
02:39:51.471 --> 02:39:53.850
100% but hits the tank and

2666
02:39:55.610 --> 02:39:58.370
definitely headbutted him afterwards.
But the rights,
he could hit him first.

2667
02:39:58.371 --> 02:40:00.620
I've got to agree with you on that.
I'll give you that.

2668
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:03.580
There is a head but at 100% but look,

2669
02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:06.410
there's a handbook but it is a headbutt for sure,
but here at boom,

2670
02:40:06.411 --> 02:40:10.810
right hand first.
Do it one more time.
Watch this to right.
Where does it go?
Dude?

2671
02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:14.070
Do what you just did.
Watch one more time.
Look that head butt though son.

2672
02:40:14.370 --> 02:40:17.750
But the right hand came before it.
I agree.
Backing up to where you're both,

2673
02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:22.260
there was a headbutt.
Okay,
go ahead.
Dot.
No,
no,
no.
It's before that.
Here it goes.

2674
02:40:22.261 --> 02:40:24.570
Watch.
This will be the right hand.
See,

2675
02:40:24.571 --> 02:40:28.380
but it's clear as day pull and that's head.
But no,

2676
02:40:28.381 --> 02:40:30.100
he hit him in the fucking cheek.
No.

2677
02:40:30.210 --> 02:40:32.940
Do you see from the overhead that punch lands on his cheek?

2678
02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:34.810
It lands on his cheek and jaw oath.

2679
02:40:34.910 --> 02:40:39.910
It's called Bam on the face and then headbutt Bam.

2680
02:40:40.770 --> 02:40:44.730
Right there.
100% headbutt hundred percent punch lands for agree.
Both.

2681
02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:46.860
Both of them are damaging.
Fucked him up.

2682
02:40:46.890 --> 02:40:49.080
So from that thing with the one that fight,
either way,

2683
02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:51.550
I'm not taking anything away from Johnson from that angle,

2684
02:40:51.551 --> 02:40:55.880
100% they collide heads.
So now we know,
but also 100% that punch lands first.

2685
02:40:55.890 --> 02:40:59.070
You should see it right there dude.
And Doom.
Yup.
Beat him.
Fair and square.

2686
02:40:59.071 --> 02:41:03.360
Crazy powerful Anthony.
But I don't think it matters the punch lands first.

2687
02:41:03.361 --> 02:41:05.350
I mean there was a headbutt.
It definitely wasn't that bad,

2688
02:41:05.370 --> 02:41:08.430
but he got tagged by that right hand on the face first,

2689
02:41:08.490 --> 02:41:12.060
which was lob comes right.
Which one wobbled him more is a good question.

2690
02:41:12.090 --> 02:41:16.170
Who the only one can answer is him really and I bet even he can I believe so out

2691
02:41:16.171 --> 02:41:18.450
of it.
He can't,
yeah.
What do you do in a situation like that?

2692
02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:19.680
If you have the guidelines,

2693
02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:23.220
a punch and then the head but lands in the Headbutt con clearly the guy lands a

2694
02:41:23.230 --> 02:41:26.640
punching gets hurt but the headbutts stiffens him up and he goes out part of the

2695
02:41:26.641 --> 02:41:27.030
game.

2696
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:30.360
It is part of the game but what do you say that happens but the method of Kao

2697
02:41:30.361 --> 02:41:33.900
was kind of Headbutt Right.
We should bring back headbutts.

2698
02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:37.500
It would have to be like how much time has passed between them because like say

2699
02:41:37.501 --> 02:41:41.130
if you tagged guy with a right hand and he was wobbly as fuck and he was backing

2700
02:41:41.131 --> 02:41:44.940
up in a few seconds go by and then he throws a right hand and misses and you

2701
02:41:44.941 --> 02:41:47.760
collide heads and he goes unconscious.
True.
Then what happened?

2702
02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:51.830
Then what do you do?
Well then you need a rematch.
I think that one was like,

2703
02:41:51.930 --> 02:41:54.510
you know what I'm saying?
It's like you can't ask for a rematch.

2704
02:41:54.511 --> 02:41:56.640
The fight like that,
it killed that magnitude.

2705
02:41:56.670 --> 02:41:59.580
They would have to be some sort of a huge event.
See,

2706
02:41:59.581 --> 02:42:04.110
I wanted to see Gus fin and DC fight next.
That's a good fight.

2707
02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:07.620
That's a great fight.
I wish they were doing that instead of separating them.

2708
02:42:07.621 --> 02:42:10.020
Well,
gossips in versus baders an interesting fight too,

2709
02:42:10.021 --> 02:42:12.900
man would bait or did to open st Prue.
I thought it was really interesting,

2710
02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:17.400
but OVN.
St Prue is not new either.
Wrestler that DC is DC who's wrestler,

2711
02:42:17.490 --> 02:42:20.940
especially when you're dealing with a guy who was his size cloud,
not a long,

2712
02:42:20.941 --> 02:42:25.380
tall guy like Jon Jones who is so awkward and strong,
but a guy more his size.

2713
02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:29.880
I fixed stocky guy like Beta Beta.
Beta won't take DC down proof.

2714
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:34.570
Oh yeah.
He's fighting soon too.
When is that?
He's fine.
My boy Pat Cummings

2715
02:42:37.190 --> 02:42:39.850
is a fucking nightmare.
Yeah,

2716
02:42:41.550 --> 02:42:45.090
he's a great guy,
man.
He awesome.
Awesome,
great guy.
Sweet man.

2717
02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:48.510
I hate to say super athletic,
but God dammit,

2718
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:53.890
he pushed the University of Tennessee national,
not professional,
professional,

2719
02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:57.960
but I'm at a elite,
elite athlete,
Division One athlete.

2720
02:42:57.961 --> 02:43:01.710
I need received Tennessee.
He loves it and twisters,
man lots.
He loves it.

2721
02:43:01.730 --> 02:43:03.510
He already has a calf crank from the truck.

2722
02:43:03.540 --> 02:43:06.260
He already has a Jason von flue choke.
Remember that?
Yeah,

2723
02:43:06.570 --> 02:43:09.290
he got that dude in a von flue,
Joe.
He rushing cat.

2724
02:43:09.420 --> 02:43:11.440
There's a lot of dudes you don't even know that position

2725
02:43:12.150 --> 02:43:16.270
<v 3>up at Pat Cummings.
I'm telling you is a fucking monster.
He's a monster.</v>

2726
02:43:16.390 --> 02:43:18.100
He's a monster.
Pat will win that fight,

2727
02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:21.440
that fucking left hook that knocked shogun out.
Now,
man,

2728
02:43:22.270 --> 02:43:26.340
sidestep a specimen.
I know,
man.
I,
and I've trained a little,

2729
02:43:26.350 --> 02:43:30.750
very well on the ground.
Super,
very good grappler.
He loves playing London.

2730
02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:35.020
Uh,
he,
he loves playing also known as Sean Williams.
God,
he loves going there.

2731
02:43:35.910 --> 02:43:39.670
Coming back.
Pat Cummings is one of those guys.
He's like Rashad Evans.

2732
02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:41.590
It's fucking impossible.
Submit man.

2733
02:43:41.710 --> 02:43:45.700
He trains with VRE doom all the time and me all the time and gets in the worst

2734
02:43:45.701 --> 02:43:49.840
positions ever.
He's a tough dude too,
man.

2735
02:43:51.380 --> 02:43:53.990
It's cutting weight down to a tee.
Yeah,

2736
02:43:54.130 --> 02:43:57.310
and has insane endurance and work ethic.
Good luck with that.

2737
02:43:57.370 --> 02:43:59.400
His work ethic and the such,
such good bytes,

2738
02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:04.640
but makes baby Eddie Bravo up that chat.

2739
02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:09.880
Open shows power.
It was nasty.
The money on it.
Let's do it.

2740
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:11.660
How much you want put your thousand dollars

2741
02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:18.790
$80,000
20 bucks for fun.

2742
02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:23.550
$20
give you a $20 chipolte lay.

2743
02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:25.450
No,
it's how about,
how about a dinner?

2744
02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:29.770
How about it did you take the three of us out to dinner?
The loser buys dinner,

2745
02:44:29.850 --> 02:44:32.880
whereas at the good place,
wherever we want,
thousand dollars

2746
02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:38.830
we'll go get a steak somewhere.
Yeah,
Morton's wherever.
Damn.

2747
02:44:38.831 --> 02:44:42.280
You're willing to gamble on there.
Oh,
Vince wins anyways and I still pay for it.

2748
02:44:42.310 --> 02:44:45.260
How about
that

2749
02:44:47.950 --> 02:44:50.980
thousand bucks?
Fucking a thousand right here.

2750
02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:54.310
Do you really want to do a thousand or you want to do dinner?

2751
02:44:54.850 --> 02:44:59.590
What's going to happen?
Let's play a thousand fucking ratable dude.
Oh Vince,

2752
02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:02.950
so bolts.
You listen to me.
I'm betting Brendan,

2753
02:45:03.010 --> 02:45:05.910
1000 it's on you that you really want to get involved in this.

2754
02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:08.830
You've got to decide right now before we touch hands.
It was my idea.

2755
02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:12.980
I'm calling your bluff.
Thousand dollars

2756
02:45:20.410 --> 02:45:21.243
a

2757
02:45:22.390 --> 02:45:26.980
thousand dollars I swear to God it was my idea,

2758
02:45:27.460 --> 02:45:31.930
but it was a bluff.
It's not a bluff.
We both have our size.

2759
02:45:31.931 --> 02:45:34.990
You kept back out,
back out.
Don't back out.

2760
02:45:35.770 --> 02:45:37.850
I'll do a thousand end dinner.
Oh my God.

2761
02:45:41.140 --> 02:45:45.700
Pat,
you've got to train your ass off.
When is that fight?
Goddammit.

2762
02:45:45.701 --> 02:45:47.590
I'm two weeks.
It's on the Machida card.

2763
02:45:47.650 --> 02:45:51.930
Oh my goodness.
All right.

2764
02:45:53.940 --> 02:45:58.660
I wanted cash.
No bills.
No fucking check,
man.
Oh,
right off.

2765
02:45:58.661 --> 02:46:00.180
Don't bring me a 10th planning check

2766
02:46:02.050 --> 02:46:04.040
operation that I get it.

2767
02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:08.350
I'll give you $1,500 in private lesson.

2768
02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:15.080
You got a free gym membership.
Yeah.
I actually charged 15 in an hour.
Try 16 now.

2769
02:46:15.150 --> 02:46:19.100
I'll give you a break all you owe me a hundred bucks,
dude.

2770
02:46:19.130 --> 02:46:21.710
I'm a little nervous now.
That really,

2771
02:46:22.050 --> 02:46:24.580
that really escalating and say definitely that's a lot of rotting.

2772
02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:29.510
Thousand Bucks is real cash.
That's real cash.
That's going to fuck him up.

2773
02:46:30.910 --> 02:46:32.540
Trust me.
He's not.
You know what's going to happen.

2774
02:46:32.541 --> 02:46:34.280
Pat comes going to break him in the second round.

2775
02:46:35.330 --> 02:46:38.690
You can see what's going to happen.
This is what's going to happen.
Pat,
listen,

2776
02:46:38.810 --> 02:46:39.643
look me in the eye.

2777
02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:43.360
I'm just going to get twisted twist or he's going to get twisted.
Your fun.

2778
02:46:43.580 --> 02:46:47.180
I bet my entire bank account,
he doesn't get submitted.
Okay.

2779
02:46:47.181 --> 02:46:51.080
What kind of odds on the twist or would you give?
What are odd?
Okay,

2780
02:46:51.081 --> 02:46:54.080
here's the odds on the twister.
If he gets him in the twister,

2781
02:46:55.490 --> 02:47:00.200
you got to bet you bet a hundred and if he gets him into twist or he has to give

2782
02:47:00.201 --> 02:47:02.960
you 10,000 okay,

2783
02:47:06.250 --> 02:47:11.170
that's
the right od for sure.
That's about right.

2784
02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:13.100
No,
no,
no.
It's not.
He's good dude.

2785
02:47:13.310 --> 02:47:16.610
That's not when it's training with you full time.

2786
02:47:16.670 --> 02:47:20.210
No K two wigs.
Just have it all.

2787
02:47:20.211 --> 02:47:24.260
He said that to win.
It's a very good bad,
it's an interesting bad,

2788
02:47:24.261 --> 02:47:25.100
it's an interesting fight.

2789
02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:28.220
You got to look at the fact that he knocked out shogun with one fucking punch

2790
02:47:28.221 --> 02:47:31.400
like that and say this kid is a stud and he's getting better and he's fast and

2791
02:47:31.401 --> 02:47:34.460
he's striking his fucking for sure dangerous and powerful,

2792
02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:38.420
but the odds of him winning bike twister when only one person,

2793
02:47:38.421 --> 02:47:41.330
everyone by twister ever in the history of the fucking UFC.

2794
02:47:41.370 --> 02:47:44.540
And that's the Korean Zombie one goddamn twister of all time.

2795
02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:48.440
The ads that he wins by a twister,
I say a hundred to 10,000 they want you on.

2796
02:47:49.960 --> 02:47:54.170
I mean sure.
That's very,
very reasonable.

2797
02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:57.200
That's even reasonable.
I think God's or a reasonable one in a million.

2798
02:47:57.230 --> 02:47:58.460
It probably more than low.

2799
02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:03.200
So you are doing is stealing $100 from Eddie Bravo.

2800
02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:06.260
Okay.
I'm already stealing a thousand telling you,
let's do it.

2801
02:48:06.261 --> 02:48:10.310
Let's have another bed.
$100 bet.
If he gets him into twister,

2802
02:48:10.340 --> 02:48:14.420
you'll owe me 2000 uh,
no.
Uh,
10,000

2803
02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:18.220
but if he doesn't,

2804
02:48:21.740 --> 02:48:25.380
if he doesn't,
what do I get?
100.
A hundred bucks either stealing a hundred.

2805
02:48:26.270 --> 02:48:30.320
That's gifts,
Tim.
Yes,

2806
02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:34.970
that's right.
I'll fucking Kentucky and I will be doing twisters.
I'll look.

2807
02:48:34.971 --> 02:48:39.610
What if Pat Summitt.
Tim,
what if Pat Summitt.
Tim doesn't matter.

2808
02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:44.540
New Jersey.
It's in New Jersey and two weeks.
Shit,
I'm in town.

2809
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:49.630
Is it the 25th April 25th whatever city you're in that Hickson Hickson.

2810
02:48:50.481 --> 02:48:55.481
Gracie is having a seminar on the 25th so it's the 25th what's that?

2811
02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:00.830
Montreal.
That's that one is the 25th yeah.
Oh,
this is the Fox card.

2812
02:49:00.910 --> 02:49:03.590
Here's the fire announcing it,
right?
Yeah,
I'm announcing that one.
Oh,

2813
02:49:03.650 --> 02:49:06.330
I'm announcing the Montreal card to Demetrius.

2814
02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:08.130
It's a paper be mouse Johnson here.

2815
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:09.840
<v 2>Goshi card card took ahead.
Huh?</v>

2816
02:49:10.770 --> 02:49:15.770
Rampage Lewis and or getting pulled out of the car rather is a is a bad one that

2817
02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:18.390
was going to happen.
Didn't like that man.

2818
02:49:18.450 --> 02:49:21.150
I thought that they could work that shit out.
I thought that,

2819
02:49:21.430 --> 02:49:26.040
I mean I think that if there is some sort of a a break in the contract enough to

2820
02:49:26.041 --> 02:49:27.780
where he can sign with the UFC,

2821
02:49:27.781 --> 02:49:29.430
I felt like they would have already worked it out.

2822
02:49:29.450 --> 02:49:32.300
You would think his lawyer or you think the UFC lawyers who are the best in the

2823
02:49:32.301 --> 02:49:35.310
business,
but like,
dude,
don't promote them yet.
We don't know.

2824
02:49:35.370 --> 02:49:40.230
Let's figure this logistics out and then do it.
Yeah,
it was too rushed.
Yeah.
Well,

2825
02:49:40.231 --> 02:49:41.064
I don't know,
man.

2826
02:49:41.850 --> 02:49:45.320
Maybe they thought that they would be able to get it in under the wire before I

2827
02:49:45.370 --> 02:49:49.740
risk it.
I don't know.
Risk what you've already established.

2828
02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:53.380
The rap page doesn't want to be in Bella tour,
so whether he didn't know,
not,

2829
02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:58.020
but now not really because now the court saying what money would you still got

2830
02:49:58.021 --> 02:50:00.520
to fight for Bella Toy,
but then it's a little board is,

2831
02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:03.180
you know the court granted an injunction I believe.

2832
02:50:03.210 --> 02:50:05.220
I believe they kept him for fighting for the UFC,

2833
02:50:05.221 --> 02:50:07.500
but they didn't say that he has to fight for Bela Tarr.

2834
02:50:07.940 --> 02:50:12.780
They recognized an argument and it has to be worked out now,

2835
02:50:12.810 --> 02:50:15.990
so they just said,
you can't fight for the UC at this.
Exactly.
At this point,

2836
02:50:16.260 --> 02:50:20.120
the granted an injunction.
I think that's exactly how it works.
If I had to bet,

2837
02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:21.690
I would probably using the wrong terminology,

2838
02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:24.030
but I'm pretty sure that's exactly how it works.

2839
02:50:24.660 --> 02:50:26.250
So rampage can't fight for the UFC.

2840
02:50:26.251 --> 02:50:29.250
So the car takes a big hit and wasn't there another fight in the car to the got

2841
02:50:29.251 --> 02:50:33.240
pulled.
What was the other fight that got pulled?
Another big one,
right.

2842
02:50:33.630 --> 02:50:36.570
Was it Royce was to be on that,
but they took him off to put them.
Roy.

2843
02:50:36.610 --> 02:50:40.200
He's now fighting for the title title,
but I thought it was supposed to be there.

2844
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:44.300
My crazy.
Well that's a great place for him to fight.
He lives there.

2845
02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:45.420
That's where it was supposed to be.

2846
02:50:45.421 --> 02:50:47.370
And they took him off that and put them on that Vegas card.

2847
02:50:47.490 --> 02:50:49.680
Well that Vegas card is a monster man.

2848
02:50:49.681 --> 02:50:51.330
And when they have those title fights in Vegas,

2849
02:50:51.331 --> 02:50:55.140
it's worth a shit load of Cheddar.
The fuck.
Yeah.
Shit load of Shit.

2850
02:50:55.290 --> 02:51:00.060
A lot of money.
And those Vegas cards,
man,
you know,

2851
02:51:00.090 --> 02:51:03.540
and because people like to go there,
man,
they will.
They will.
The Vegas loves it.

2852
02:51:03.750 --> 02:51:06.540
People like to do it.
It's a different animal when it's in Vegas.

2853
02:51:06.540 --> 02:51:10.530
And the money that it generates for the casino is insane and comparison to the

2854
02:51:10.531 --> 02:51:13.820
money that it generates for some random arena somewhere.
If you put it on it,

2855
02:51:13.821 --> 02:51:17.190
some random arena in Montreal,
I mean it's great for the economy of Montreal,

2856
02:51:17.370 --> 02:51:21.210
but the amount of money that gets spent in Vegas is off the goddamn charts.

2857
02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:22.870
Everyone,
they'll fight jam.

2858
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:26.340
Blake is making a big comeback or they making a come back.
Well,

2859
02:51:26.370 --> 02:51:29.250
they definitely took a big hit.
I think it's more of a normalization.

2860
02:51:29.430 --> 02:51:32.430
The economy goes down,
gambling goes down.
There's no way around it.

2861
02:51:32.460 --> 02:51:35.250
People don't have the money.
I think the hotels are taking a huge hit.

2862
02:51:35.251 --> 02:51:37.440
The shit was crazy as hotels,
they're not doing well.

2863
02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:41.160
We were in a car once and we asked the driver,
uh,
his cab driver,

2864
02:51:41.190 --> 02:51:45.390
like how much different is Vegas right now?
And he goes,
it's 50% down,

2865
02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:47.100
50% down.

2866
02:51:47.350 --> 02:51:51.090
You said 50% down and calls 50 beach sent down in business.

2867
02:51:51.091 --> 02:51:53.640
Like they're all aware of it.
I know.
I know that city center,

2868
02:51:53.700 --> 02:51:58.170
the engineer fucked up building it and it's not safe structurally and they have

2869
02:51:58.171 --> 02:52:01.620
to rip it down.
Why?
It's no way.
This might be breaking news,

2870
02:52:01.970 --> 02:52:05.800
big ground stone ground breaking.
I'm pretty sure I read gigantic.

2871
02:52:06.820 --> 02:52:10.590
Pretty sure I read that on a phone call from a kid.
Let's get home.
God.
Swear.

2872
02:52:11.070 --> 02:52:13.510
Swear though.
I'm almost positive.
Wow.

2873
02:52:13.511 --> 02:52:15.760
Something structurally is fucked up and they have to tear it down.

2874
02:52:16.110 --> 02:52:18.550
It's like tons of tons of money.
Let's get young Jamie,

2875
02:52:18.551 --> 02:52:20.440
to pull up some articles on this bullshit.

2876
02:52:20.700 --> 02:52:24.400
To me that sounds insane.
If that's the case,

2877
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:27.940
what a huge hit.
Someone that's terrifying.

2878
02:52:28.060 --> 02:52:32.510
Someone really powerful in Vegas.
Told me back when I was working with the UFC,

2879
02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:37.210
he said it's like it used to be that the casinos or packed and then now it's

2880
02:52:37.211 --> 02:52:41.590
like someone took a giant vacuum and just vacuumed all the people out of the

2881
02:52:41.591 --> 02:52:46.310
casino.
Yeah,
that's what it looks.
I'm not a Vegas guy.
Never.
You know,

2882
02:52:46.410 --> 02:52:48.970
it's real weird when you go off the grid,

2883
02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:53.020
when you get out of the Strip and you go to them funky casinos that are out in

2884
02:52:53.021 --> 02:52:57.820
the middle of nowhere pressure.
Whoa.
There's a lot of casinos in Vegas,

2885
02:52:57.821 --> 02:52:58.960
so you don't ever think about,

2886
02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:02.770
there's a lot of like weird fucking casinos all over the spot.

2887
02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:06.070
That's for the true grit gamblers guys that they just want to gamble,

2888
02:53:06.210 --> 02:53:09.660
that don't want to be on the strip.
They just want a place where they could go.

2889
02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:12.910
Well,
you just see a different tone of human being.

2890
02:53:13.240 --> 02:53:15.730
It's almost a different creature.
Dude.
Colons,

2891
02:53:15.731 --> 02:53:20.020
gall and shape don't give a fuck last night I countries people.

2892
02:53:21.100 --> 02:53:23.680
That's why he's got to keep that mode.
That makes it keep that gut.

2893
02:53:24.290 --> 02:53:26.870
Do you ever go to commerce casino?
That place is packed.
That was our last night.

2894
02:53:26.871 --> 02:53:29.890
There was some fights.
That was Bama fights.
Eddie Jackson.
Oh really?
One.

2895
02:53:29.891 --> 02:53:33.520
He looked like chuck with Dell and it's Prime Eddie Jackson just destroy this

2896
02:53:33.521 --> 02:53:38.180
guy.
But uh,
the place was packed and it was 98% Asian.

2897
02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:41.410
They love the gamble.
Oh yeah.
The place was packed.
It was.

2898
02:53:41.411 --> 02:53:43.270
That's different though cause that's not Vegas.

2899
02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:45.700
These are these local casinos is all they got.

2900
02:53:45.701 --> 02:53:49.960
It's like this or drive four hours to Vegas.
True.
If you're a card gambler,

2901
02:53:49.961 --> 02:53:51.940
you can gamble right here.
If you're a poker guy,

2902
02:53:51.941 --> 02:53:53.560
there's plenty of gambling in la.

2903
02:53:53.860 --> 02:53:58.860
Like Ari Shaffir before he made it as a comic was making more money gambling on

2904
02:53:58.991 --> 02:54:03.200
poker.
He was on eighth no,
usually playing in tournaments.
Oh Wow.

2905
02:54:03.310 --> 02:54:07.150
He was going to fucking really good.
He's very good.
Ari,
smartest shit dude.

2906
02:54:07.270 --> 02:54:11.230
So he would go to these poker tournaments and when he made 35 grand one year

2907
02:54:11.231 --> 02:54:14.710
just playing poker and he wasn't making much money.
As a comic who's struggling?

2908
02:54:15.910 --> 02:54:19.510
It's crazy.
You can make some money and you can,
you can get action.

2909
02:54:19.540 --> 02:54:22.090
That's the big thing I heard.
Online's the way to do it though.

2910
02:54:22.270 --> 02:54:25.570
Could you sit at home in your fucking underwear out?
Illegal in America anymore.

2911
02:54:25.690 --> 02:54:30.130
It's different.
Like I think you have to go to places like Nevada.

2912
02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:32.290
You can gamble online,
but you can gamble.

2913
02:54:32.291 --> 02:54:35.110
You can play poker online against people from Nevada.
I was like,

2914
02:54:35.111 --> 02:54:39.160
all those pro poker players,
a lot of them moved out of country.

2915
02:54:39.430 --> 02:54:43.300
A lot of them moved to Menai Monaco.
Monaco.
How'd you say that?
Monica Monaco.

2916
02:54:43.510 --> 02:54:46.880
They moved to Monaco.
They moved to all these countries where it's legal.
They,

2917
02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:51.680
some of them moved to China and they play in that Chinese place.
Oh,
huge.

2918
02:54:52.060 --> 02:54:54.850
What's that?
That area of Macau.
Macau.
Yeah.
Macau.

2919
02:54:54.851 --> 02:54:57.290
Apparently her Macau is going off crazy.

2920
02:54:57.340 --> 02:54:59.320
They say it's Vegas Times 10 that's what I've heard.

2921
02:54:59.350 --> 02:55:03.980
Just a Mad Asian gangs hurting Dubai's the same way.
Really not

2922
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:07.670
<v 0>gambling.
No gap.
As far as crazy.
It's Islamic,
right?
We run out of time.</v>

2923
02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:11.540
How dare you?
We're having a hard time jumping on the scamming and good the time.

2924
02:55:11.690 --> 02:55:14.440
Give us five minutes.
What's that?
Yeah,
let's go part two.

2925
02:55:14.441 --> 02:55:17.670
You want you guys got something to do?
No,
let's do another hour.
It's chill.

2926
02:55:17.690 --> 02:55:20.030
Shower.
All right.
Kill this and we'll come back.
