00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.240
<v Speaker 2>that happens just slightly because a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people are in a cave in situation</v>

3
00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:11.530
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're literally buried under a series</v>

4
00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:15.790
<v Speaker 2>of antiquated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stale symbols that they're looking at</v>

5
00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:18.430
<v Speaker 2>the universe through and they feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped.</v>

6
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like their shoes are too tight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if like a psychedelic or meditating too,</v>

7
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 2>and I really mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just saying that to say that</v>

8
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.520
<v Speaker 2>because I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think meditation has a very</v>

9
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:32.350
<v Speaker 2>similar effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but any of these things,</v>

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 2>they reset those symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Structures in your brain and if you just</v>

11
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in a cave in and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>an extra inch compared to like being</v>

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.080
<v Speaker 2>pressed against the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big fucking deal man.</v>

13
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's slightly percentage difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Change change is like,</v>

14
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 2>oh thank God I'm 13 percent less</v>
<v Speaker 2>frightened than it was for my entire</v>

15
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard Tony Robbins talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about changing paths in life is you get</v>

17
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting analogy.</v>

18
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>He talks about like you're going to cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>going the exactly saint or a boat or two</v>

19
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Speaker 1>boats going exactly the same direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one boat just takes a two degree</v>

20
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just two degrees here.</v>

21
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.320
<v Speaker 1>As they go further down the one boat</v>
<v Speaker 1>that took two degrees turn is going to</v>

22
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>go wider and wider away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original path and that each decision</v>

23
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:20.390
<v Speaker 1>that you make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good decision.</v>

24
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Takes you closer even though it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're just steering your ship,</v>

25
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>just dirt as you go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a much different path,</v>

26
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>a much different end than if you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>stayed on the original path.</v>

27
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different and psychedelics makes you go</v>

28
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn Clyde.</v>

29
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the the,</v>

30
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 1>the currents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to bring you back though.</v>

31
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well ego tries to eat bread in the</v>

32
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of bring it back to where you were</v>

33
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like got to take them a good.</v>

34
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always said get off that current</v>

35
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.380
<v Speaker 1>doing psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like pressing the reset button for</v>

36
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like control all the.</v>

37
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your your desktop reboots and</v>

38
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>there's only one folder on the desktop</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's that desktop says the folder</v>

39
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>says my old bullshit and you have two</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

40
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Either you just like create a completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different desktop,</v>

41
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>look at reality as a completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different or open up my old bullshit and</v>

42
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.470
<v Speaker 1>fall back into these familiar patterns</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're very comforting,</v>

43
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.080
<v Speaker 1>in those moments after the psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience are so important to grab and</v>

45
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:25.130
<v Speaker 1>hang onto because it gives you this</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to make this new way of</v>

46
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:26.930
<v Speaker 1>thinking like a part of your habit.</v>

47
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Once you get in that habit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's fucking,</v>

48
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 days or 60 days or 90 days,</v>

49
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.280
<v Speaker 1>like people say that once you like have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pattern ingrained in how you behave</v>

50
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:41.990
<v Speaker 1>and think and do it just takes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent approach to that pattern and</v>

51
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:45.950
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes like an like a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like that's why people quit smoking.</v>

52
00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Like get past 90 days and you'll be all</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

53
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews say when you have,</v>

54
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>if you go to sit in the same feed three</v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

55
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:53.510
<v Speaker 1>he's just keep sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your,</v>

56
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>that's your two old time seed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

57
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.903
<v Speaker 1>that's smart.</v>

58
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I'd make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you take a psychedelic,</v>

59
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like if your life is a polluted</v>
<v Speaker 2>city,</v>

60
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 2>like what are those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Polluted like Detroit,</v>

61
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Detroit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

62
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 2>And it's like the psychedelic all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden takes you in a helicopter outside</v>

63
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 2>the pollution and so now you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

64
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.350
<v Speaker 2>the air up here so fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so nice down here.</v>

65
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is helicopter going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

66
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 2>It's going to put you back out into your</v>
<v Speaker 2>city and that's where the job starts,</v>

67
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:21.791
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

68
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I clean this fucking thing up?</v>

69
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 2>And then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the.</v>

70
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 2>That's when you start doing things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercising,</v>

71
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 2>meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or that's where you create just a very</v>

72
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>simple intention in everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is as much as possible.</v>

73
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to alleviate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering of people around me as much as</v>

74
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

75
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might not be a lot,</v>

76
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.240
<v Speaker 2>it might just be call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might just be those.</v>

77
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.400
<v Speaker 3>So we got back from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from this last UFC,</v>

78
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 3>just a little bit of mushrooms was</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough that I saw a homeless guy and he</v>

79
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.830
<v Speaker 3>was looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

80
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 3>I opened my wallet and I only have</v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties,</v>

81
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.480
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

82
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

83
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.530
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it does.</v>

84
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.120
<v Speaker 2>And those little moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

85
00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:06.110
<v Speaker 2>it shows you that you get those moments</v>
<v Speaker 2>present themselves to you all day,</v>

86
00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:09.290
<v Speaker 2>fucking long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you are stuck in selfishness,</v>

87
00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.124
<v Speaker 2>you don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.740
<v Speaker 2>It's real simple little things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's fun.</v>

89
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a very wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of simple intention can really</v>

90
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.240
<v Speaker 2>deep pollute your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your subjective city that you've been</v>

91
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.360
<v Speaker 2>sucking in shitty gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one title.</v>

92
00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I saw it</v>

93
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 3>that I was the only time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've worked guide to somebody,</v>

94
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 3>but it was Willie Hunter was on him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was shitting on following.</v>

95
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 3>He was shitting on some like comic who</v>
<v Speaker 3>would become like a vine star,</v>

96
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she was a shitty comment,</v>

97
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 3>but it became like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>

98

<v Speaker 3>I hate fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

99
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 3>fine man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just for fun.</v>

100
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 3>There's six seconds from videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

101
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:39.514
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate him.</v>

102
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.950
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about a six second youtube video?</v>

103
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Watch that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

104
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 3>He was just big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty and really try to talk about it.</v>

105
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started with the mushrooms and he was</v>

106
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a bad person.</v>

107
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he kept doing it and eventually I</v>

108
00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

109
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.530
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was you being a bad person and I'm</v>

110
00:04:57.531 --> 00:04:58.460
<v Speaker 3>so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>

111
00:04:58.461 --> 00:05:00.830
<v Speaker 3>it's okay because here's the deal from</v>
<v Speaker 3>now on,</v>

112
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.580
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to be that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just let that go and let people</v>

113
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:05.414
<v Speaker 3>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

114
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

115
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.470
<v Speaker 3>that's what it shows you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can change,</v>

116
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 2>but that thing you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you realize,</v>

117
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:12.630
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bad person.</v>

118
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.990
<v Speaker 2>That is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

119
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the name and Buddhism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an actual name for that and it's</v>

120
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:22.020
<v Speaker 2>considered to be a very sweet moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you need that moment.</v>

121
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:26.430
<v Speaker 2>It's virtualized or where you need that</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment where you look at your life and</v>

122
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:31.020
<v Speaker 2>you feel this very specific kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadness because you look at all the</v>

123
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:34.410
<v Speaker 2>times you could have been kinder all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

124
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:37.170
<v Speaker 2>You could have called that person back</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the times.</v>

125
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:41.400
<v Speaker 2>He could have made decisions that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing your boat and the direction of a</v>

126
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:45.390
<v Speaker 2>better world and you didn't do it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should feel sad about that,</v>

127
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.730
<v Speaker 2>but you shouldn't spend your whole life</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling sad about it.</v>

128
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.910
<v Speaker 2>You should just spend some time there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and look at it and think,</v>

129
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's gone.</v>

130
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.060
<v Speaker 2>The past has been devoured by time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only this moment,</v>

131
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 2>and so from this point forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as I can,</v>

132
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.500
<v Speaker 2>my decisions are going to be based on</v>
<v Speaker 2>reducing the suffering of my species,</v>

133
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 2>and that means like if your trash is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have to let her keep going</v>

134
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
