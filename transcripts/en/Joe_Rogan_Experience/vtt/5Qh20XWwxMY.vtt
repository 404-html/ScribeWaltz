00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh righty Jane,</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.123
<v Speaker 1>what's happening?</v>

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.961
<v Speaker 1>You are here.</v>

5
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:07.411
<v Speaker 1>You made it.</v>

6
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:08.244
<v Speaker 1>And I'm excited too.</v>

7
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.911
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this.</v>

8
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:09.744
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>

9
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>So your story is a very fascinating story.</v>

10
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>You got a brain injury and you decided to make a game to help your brain</v>

11
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:20.484
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>

12
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.271
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

13
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>what led you to even attempt something like that?</v>

14
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of anything like that in the past.</v>

15
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

16
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 2>I had been designing games professionally and researching them for 10 years.</v>

17
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 2>By the time I hit my head and it was not my first instinct.</v>

18
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.531
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

19
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I have a brain injury.</v>

20
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Let me make a game.</v>

21
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.410
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

22
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 2>about a month into the recovery,</v>

23
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't getting any better.</v>

24
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 2>I was really depressed and anxious.</v>

25
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

26
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was,</v>

27
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 2>it was like the lowest point of my life.</v>

28
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 2>And I knew from my research that when we play games,</v>

29
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

30
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.210
<v Speaker 2>we have more optimism,</v>

31
00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 2>we're more determined.</v>

32
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 2>We're better able to ask people for help,</v>

33
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 2>right to team up with us,</v>

34
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:01.694
<v Speaker 2>be your allies.</v>

35
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 2>And I just figured,</v>

36
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

37
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.843
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

38
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 2>this is like the worst I've ever felt in my life.</v>

39
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if I can bring some of that game full spirit to recovery,</v>

40
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I could kind of jump start my brain back into healing.</v>

41
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>So what was the nature of your injury?</v>

42
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

43
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

44
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:19.360
<v Speaker 2>it started out as just a normal concussion.</v>

45
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.343
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

46
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 2>so this is my public service announcement,</v>

48
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

49
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.323
<v Speaker 2>Of the episode.</v>

50
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I was standing up from underneath and open cabinet and I'm a runner,</v>

51
00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:33.700
<v Speaker 2>so I've really strong legs and I was just in a hurry and I've just full us right</v>

52
00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 2>up into the corner of the cabinet,</v>

53
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

54
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.371
<v Speaker 2>hit my head.</v>

55
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:37.360
<v Speaker 2>And it was like classic,</v>

56
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

57
00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 2>my husband was joking around,</v>

58
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

59
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.240
<v Speaker 2>who's the president?</v>

60
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.820
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't remember who the president was and I was like,</v>

61
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.713
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

62
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.680
<v Speaker 2>that really bad.</v>

63
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>All I could get hit in the head.</v>

64
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:46.884
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't remember.</v>

65
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>This is Barack Obama.</v>

66
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.001
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

67
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:50.260
<v Speaker 2>and all I could remember was,</v>

68
00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 2>it's not George Bush anymore,</v>

69
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.070
<v Speaker 2>but I couldn't remember who it was.</v>

70
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.001
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

71
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.150
<v Speaker 1>So just standing up and hitting the edge of the cabinet.</v>

72
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.720
<v Speaker 1>It was an,</v>

73
00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.510
<v Speaker 1>an opening.</v>

75
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 2>It was an omen cabinet.</v>

76
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 2>So this is the PSA is,</v>

77
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

78
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 2>shut cabinet doors because apparently I have now learned after this happened to</v>

79
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:11.351
<v Speaker 2>me that this happens to a lot of people and you can get a serious head injury as</v>

80
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 2>like a football player by doing this.</v>

81
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 2>So out.</v>

82
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

83
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>So just standing up.</v>

84
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>So he stood up quick,</v>

85
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.751
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

86
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.011
<v Speaker 1>Whacked your head.</v>

88
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Did you go unconscious or did not go on conscious,</v>

89
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 2>saw stars and everything,</v>

91
00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

92
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.101
<v Speaker 2>a lot of concussions,</v>

93
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 2>it takes a few hours,</v>

94
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.470
<v Speaker 2>the brain starts to swell and it's not till later that day that you really start</v>

95
00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:34.060
<v Speaker 2>to feel like something's really wrong.</v>

96
00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:34.840
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

97
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

98
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.400
<v Speaker 2>is that what happened to you?</v>

99
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

100
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

101
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

102
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.401
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

103
00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

104
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.890
<v Speaker 2>there was no internal bleeding or anything.</v>

105
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

106
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

107
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

108
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 2>the doctor said,</v>

109
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

110
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:45.880
<v Speaker 2>you'll be fine and you know,</v>

111
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:46.714
<v Speaker 2>give it a week,</v>

112
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.130
<v Speaker 2>maybe a couple of weeks.</v>

113
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.750
<v Speaker 2>I come back after month,</v>

114
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 2>they tell me,</v>

115
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.861
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

116
00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:51.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

117
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:51.521
<v Speaker 2>some people,</v>

118
00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:53.050
<v Speaker 2>if it doesn't heal in the first month,</v>

119
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 2>it takes three months.</v>

120
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.780
<v Speaker 2>And if it doesn't heal in three months,</v>

121
00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:56.591
<v Speaker 2>it might be a year.</v>

122
00:02:56.591 --> 00:02:57.550
<v Speaker 2>And if it's not a year,</v>

123
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're stuck like this.</v>

124
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Were you experiencing the classic symptoms?</v>

125
00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you couldn't like stare at the sun,</v>

126
00:03:03.631 --> 00:03:04.940
<v Speaker 1>the sunlight would bother your eyes.</v>

127
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Loud noises.</v>

128
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.151
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

129
00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

130
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.051
<v Speaker 2>all light.</v>

131
00:03:07.051 --> 00:03:07.884
<v Speaker 2>Like if I,</v>

132
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

133
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I would try to go into like a whole foods or fluorescent lights would feel like</v>

134
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I was like under fire from weapons.</v>

135
00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:15.271
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

136
00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>

137
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.081
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

138
00:03:16.081 --> 00:03:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I was in bed basically for three months.</v>

139
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Everything,</v>

140
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.470
<v Speaker 2>like all stimulus would make me nauseous and um,</v>

141
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.210
<v Speaker 2>migraines and everything.</v>

142
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.470
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>

143
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.060
<v Speaker 2>it's so it started out normal concussion,</v>

144
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:30.990
<v Speaker 2>but then it's kind of unraveled into what they call post concussion syndrome,</v>

145
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:31.824
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

146
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.663
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

147
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.680
<v Speaker 2>which is a thing that I didn't know existed,</v>

148
00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:39.150
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people and the concussions take up to a year to heal.</v>

149
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

150
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:40.884
<v Speaker 1>they can.</v>

151
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

152
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.701
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

153
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

154
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>from working for the UFC,</v>

155
00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people that neglect those.</v>

156
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

157
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.311
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

158
00:03:46.311 --> 00:03:47.460
<v Speaker 1>it gets really ugly.</v>

159
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I've also seen people that were great fighters.</v>

161
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named Tj grant who was in line for a UFC title shot,</v>

162
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

163
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.130
<v Speaker 1>got a concussion.</v>

164
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even from getting kicked or punched,</v>

165
00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:00.060
<v Speaker 1>it was from,</v>

166
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

167
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.070
<v Speaker 1>grappling exchange,</v>

168
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 1>just bonked his head on something.</v>

169
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:04.511
<v Speaker 1>I've a,</v>

170
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was somebody's knee or someone's hip or something like that and</v>

171
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.740
<v Speaker 1>then was never the same again and has never fall again.</v>

172
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's been like,</v>

173
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I think almost two years.</v>

174
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

175
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.440
<v Speaker 2>And I mean that's something I've gotten actually pretty active in the research</v>

176
00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:21.350
<v Speaker 2>community and trying to share information.</v>

177
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.290
<v Speaker 2>So it turns out like the first week of recovery,</v>

178
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

179
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.420
<v Speaker 2>can really determine if you're going to go into this extended,</v>

180
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

181
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:31.220
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take you three months,</v>

182
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:31.641
<v Speaker 2>six months,</v>

183
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>

184
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

185
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.081
<v Speaker 2>if you're not,</v>

186
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:34.670
<v Speaker 2>if you're not resting enough in that,</v>

187
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.600
<v Speaker 2>that first week.</v>

188
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.990
<v Speaker 1>So the first week it's critical that you just do nothing.</v>

189
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

190
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 2>they call it cognitive rest and basically you want to not do anything that is,</v>

191
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 2>that feels difficult for you.</v>

192
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>

193
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't read,</v>

194
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 2>I could only watch TV shows I'd already seen before because having to process</v>

195
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 2>plot Gnuplot was not,</v>

196
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

197
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.291
<v Speaker 2>was not helpful.</v>

198
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 2>So I was walking like rewatching Buffy the vampire slayer because I seen them</v>

199
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 2>all like a million times.</v>

200
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

201
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.300
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

202
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.621
<v Speaker 2>and yet,</v>

203
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:02.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

204
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 2>keep the lights off if they,</v>

205
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

206
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 2>keep sunglasses on indoors.</v>

207
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

208
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 2>but the first 48 hours and then after that,</v>

209
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>the first week,</v>

210
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

211
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 2>if you can avoid over stressing your brain,</v>

212
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.200
<v Speaker 2>you have a much better chance to recover within the one to two week period as</v>

213
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.043
<v Speaker 2>well as people.</v>

214
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

215
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>And people don't know people like they tried to,</v>

216
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I tried to go right back to work.</v>

217
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 2>I was in the middle of writing my first book and it was due in a couple months.</v>

218
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

219
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't miss my deadline.</v>

220
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:28.571
<v Speaker 2>I've got to do this.</v>

221
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:29.051
<v Speaker 2>I've gotta power through.</v>

222
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to can barely unlike,</v>

223
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.230
<v Speaker 2>can't even see the screen.</v>

224
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 2>But you're,</v>

225
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>

226
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 2>when you have a concussion,</v>

228
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking clearly,</v>

229
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.010
<v Speaker 2>you are not irrational person.</v>

230
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>You're just,</v>

231
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 2>you're just like,</v>

232
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:39.491
<v Speaker 2>I have to do this.</v>

233
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 2>I have to try.</v>

234
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 2>And other people will look at you and be like,</v>

235
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:42.311
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with you?</v>

236
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:43.144
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>

237
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.711
<v Speaker 2>totally out of it.</v>

239
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Why are you trying to work?</v>

240
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 2>But you're not,</v>

241
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that same kind of rational decision making ability.</v>

242
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:51.544
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes,</v>

243
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

244
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 2>a friend or a loved one needs to take you aside and say,</v>

245
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm not letting you do anything for this first week.</v>

246
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 2>You've just got to let your brain,</v>

247
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:00.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

248
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.010
<v Speaker 1>and this is correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

249
00:06:03.011 --> 00:06:04.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's relatively new,</v>

250
00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:08.410
<v Speaker 1>our understanding of what takes place after concussion and what you have to do</v>

251
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.460
<v Speaker 1>to recover.</v>

252
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

253
00:06:10.361 --> 00:06:10.510
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

254
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.380
<v Speaker 2>there's just last year it was a big study that came out showing that four months</v>

255
00:06:14.381 --> 00:06:15.490
<v Speaker 2>after concussion,</v>

256
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.300
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

257
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.530
<v Speaker 2>your brain is still different.</v>

258
00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:18.220
<v Speaker 2>There's still,</v>

259
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

260
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.500
<v Speaker 2>it's like a kind of a scarring that happens.</v>

261
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.603
<v Speaker 2>I get scab,</v>

262
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

263
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.900
<v Speaker 2>that certain parts of the brain will still be thickened,</v>

264
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

265
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.760
<v Speaker 2>four months after,</v>

266
00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:29.710
<v Speaker 2>even if you think you're feeling fine,</v>

267
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.690
<v Speaker 2>which means that you're still vulnerable.</v>

268
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

269
00:06:32.021 --> 00:06:33.490
<v Speaker 2>if you were to get hit again,</v>

270
00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:34.510
<v Speaker 2>it would be more dangerous.</v>

271
00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:34.990
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

272
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.231
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

273
00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:37.420
<v Speaker 2>and if you're still feeling symptoms after four months,</v>

274
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

275
00:06:37.721 --> 00:06:40.960
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's like when you cut yourself open and you get the Scab,</v>

276
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

277
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.570
<v Speaker 2>you can't be picking at the scab by doing things that are triggering your</v>

278
00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:47.494
<v Speaker 2>symptoms.</v>

279
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

280
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

281
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.590
<v Speaker 1>So who was it that told you you got to settle down?</v>

282
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.191
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

283
00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:53.461
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

284
00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:53.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

285
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.710
<v Speaker 2>my doctor had said that,</v>

286
00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:56.371
<v Speaker 2>and of course I'm a,</v>

287
00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:57.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm a science geek that's,</v>

288
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.560
<v Speaker 2>I have a phd.</v>

289
00:06:58.561 --> 00:06:59.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like my background.</v>

290
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

291
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.830
<v Speaker 2>and I was having my husband Google do Google scholar searches for traumatic</v>

292
00:07:04.831 --> 00:07:07.920
<v Speaker 2>brain injury research cause I couldn't use the computer just like,</v>

293
00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:08.641
<v Speaker 2>you got to figure,</v>

294
00:07:08.641 --> 00:07:09.331
<v Speaker 2>is this normal?</v>

295
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:09.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

296
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.160
<v Speaker 2>I started feeling suicidal.</v>

297
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.233
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

298
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

299
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.920
<v Speaker 2>that was new for me.</v>

300
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.880
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like literally having him Google suicidal thoughts,</v>

301
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.830
<v Speaker 2>concussion because I'm like,</v>

302
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.693
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>

303
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.410
<v Speaker 2>am I really suicidal?</v>

304
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.711
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

305
00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:26.250
<v Speaker 2>am I rationally thinking I'm never going to able to work again.</v>

306
00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:27.510
<v Speaker 2>My husband's got to take care of me.</v>

307
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.590
<v Speaker 2>I should just end it.</v>

308
00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Which is what I was looking like.</v>

309
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.350
<v Speaker 2>The voices in my head were saying,</v>

310
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.480
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't feel,</v>

311
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

312
00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:34.380
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

313
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.990
<v Speaker 2>that didn't feel like myself.</v>

314
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.060
<v Speaker 2>And so fortunately he was finding articles like,</v>

315
00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:39.331
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

316
00:07:39.331 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Speaker 2>one in three people with a concussion have suicidal thoughts and that is</v>

317
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:45.270
<v Speaker 2>actually a reaction to the neurochemistry.</v>

318
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

319
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.860
<v Speaker 2>when you have a concussion,</v>

320
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.140
<v Speaker 2>you don't have dopamine in the reward pathway,</v>

321
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.250
<v Speaker 2>reward pathways,</v>

322
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.520
<v Speaker 2>which means your brain can't anticipate anything good in the future.</v>

323
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.900
<v Speaker 2>You become like completely unable to imagine that you'll feel better,</v>

324
00:07:57.901 --> 00:07:59.430
<v Speaker 2>that good things will happen for you.</v>

325
00:07:59.431 --> 00:08:04.431
<v Speaker 2>And that's just like a perfect neurochemical foundation for suicide.</v>

326
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.540
<v Speaker 1>So you were able to remember how you used to think and so you knew this is not</v>

327
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>the way I think.</v>

328
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

329
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

330
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

331
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

332
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.833
<v Speaker 2>I had like a,</v>

333
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I was able to distance myself a little bit from the thoughts where,</v>

334
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

335
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

336
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

337
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

338
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

339
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.651
<v Speaker 2>cause I was just at home,</v>

340
00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:22.221
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't going anywhere.</v>

341
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I would say to my husband,</v>

342
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:24.164
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

343
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.140
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I have this voice that's saying,</v>

344
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.381
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

345
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 2>you should kill yourself.</v>

346
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 2>And I would,</v>

347
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 2>I would talk about it because I didn't,</v>

348
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

349
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

350
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I think if you talk about it,</v>

351
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

352
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 2>it becomes less,</v>

353
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

354
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:38.130
<v Speaker 2>this feeling that you have that you have to really believe and,</v>

355
00:08:38.131 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 2>and more like the thing that you can look at and try to figure out.</v>

356
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

357
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.160
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

358
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:44.160
<v Speaker 2>and so it was like,</v>

359
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.330
<v Speaker 2>it just felt so weird to me because I'm like,</v>

360
00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

361
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.411
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

362
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:49.100
<v Speaker 2>I had never,</v>

363
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 2>I never had that before.</v>

364
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

365
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>and once I knew that it was a symptom of concussion rather than,</v>

366
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.091
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

367
00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Jane has figured out that her life is terrible and logically she wants to kill</v>

368
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 2>herself,</v>

369
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I was able to live with it.</v>

370
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.471
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

371
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 2>the research literature says they go away as the brain heals.</v>

372
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.370
<v Speaker 2>So I just thought,</v>

373
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:08.980
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

374
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

375
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 2>it might still,</v>

376
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 2>I might still hear that voice for,</v>

377
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

378
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 2>a few weeks or a few months,</v>

379
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 2>but I know that that's a symptom of healing and not have actually feel.</v>

380
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just going to get on with it.</v>

381
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:20.981
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

382
00:09:20.981 --> 00:09:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Is there a medication that you can take while this was going on?</v>

383
00:09:24.161 --> 00:09:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Anything that speeds up the healing or anti inflammation medication?</v>

384
00:09:27.971 --> 00:09:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

385
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.461
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

386
00:09:28.461 --> 00:09:29.294
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

387
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.810
<v Speaker 2>this is what's so hard about post concussion syndrome is there's nothing that's</v>

388
00:09:32.811 --> 00:09:34.940
<v Speaker 2>been shown to speed it up.</v>

389
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

390
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I was offered really powerful anti anxiety meds,</v>

391
00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:40.250
<v Speaker 2>depression meds.</v>

392
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:40.821
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

393
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I chose not to take them because I just didn't want to go down that road.</v>

394
00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:46.310
<v Speaker 2>I'd never taken them before.</v>

395
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

396
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

397
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.291
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

398
00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:49.160
<v Speaker 2>and there's no known therapies.</v>

399
00:09:49.161 --> 00:09:54.161
<v Speaker 2>People have tried to do like oxygen deep oxygen therapy and hypobaric chamber.</v>

400
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

401
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:54.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

402
00:09:54.951 --> 00:09:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

403
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

404
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.833
<v Speaker 2>did you try any of that?</v>

405
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I did not try that.</v>

406
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.023
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

407
00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.923
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

408
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

409
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.830
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

410
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.010
<v Speaker 2>actually this is a sort of very exciting for me.</v>

411
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

412
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.353
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

413
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.940
<v Speaker 2>because there's no good treatment for this.</v>

414
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.020
<v Speaker 2>When my game worked so well for me and I saw other people started using it at</v>

415
00:10:12.021 --> 00:10:12.181
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

416
00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:12.621
<v Speaker 2>well for them,</v>

417
00:10:12.621 --> 00:10:17.621
<v Speaker 2>we were able to get a grant from the NIH to test this with young athletes,</v>

418
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:18.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

419
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.900
<v Speaker 2>through Ohio State University Medical Research Center.</v>

420
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.200
<v Speaker 2>We just released our findings last week that the game that I invented did</v>

421
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.730
<v Speaker 2>improve the post concussion syndromes and 100% of the people who used it,</v>

422
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

423
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.840
<v Speaker 2>compared to only 50% of people who didn't play.</v>

424
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.430
<v Speaker 2>So this is one of,</v>

425
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:37.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

426
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:41.360
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the first validated treatments that can,</v>

427
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:41.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

428
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.170
<v Speaker 2>reduce the headaches and the nausea and the confusion and the,</v>

429
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

430
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.693
<v Speaker 2>difficulty.</v>

431
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.150
<v Speaker 1>So how did you get to the point where you wanted to experiment with a game?</v>

432
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

433
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.210
<v Speaker 1>you're recovering slowly.</v>

434
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:54.511
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

435
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:54.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

436
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 1>how slow is this taking?</v>

437
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Like how many months afterwards?</v>

438
00:10:57.721 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 1>We still come.</v>

439
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

440
00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:58.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

441
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.040
<v Speaker 2>it's 34 days,</v>

442
00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:00.580
<v Speaker 2>which I will,</v>

443
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I will never,</v>

444
00:11:01.601 --> 00:11:02.434
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

445
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:03.500
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

446
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.450
<v Speaker 2>it's emblazoned into my memory 34 days after I hit my head,</v>

447
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

448
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:09.430
<v Speaker 2>that I was,</v>

449
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm always completely desperate.</v>

450
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.850
<v Speaker 2>I literally was saying to myself,</v>

451
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game because</v>

452
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.873
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

453
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:18.990
<v Speaker 1>those two options,</v>

454
00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.400
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange.</v>

455
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.111
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

456
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:25.710
<v Speaker 1>but so maybe be the only person in human history that's ever said that I'm going</v>

457
00:11:25.711 --> 00:11:27.600
<v Speaker 1>to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game.</v>

458
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:27.851
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

459
00:11:27.851 --> 00:11:28.210
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

460
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

461
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I love writing my first book,</v>

463
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.360
<v Speaker 2>which was all about the psychology of games.</v>

464
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.130
<v Speaker 2>And I just thought to myself,</v>

465
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.413
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>

466
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.313
<v Speaker 2>I got to prove it.</v>

467
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

468
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

469
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing this book saying that playing games makes us happier and stronger</v>

470
00:11:41.181 --> 00:11:42.050
<v Speaker 2>and more resilient.</v>

471
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I got to prove this theory.</v>

472
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

473
00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:46.670
<v Speaker 2>there's all other kinds of proof in the book,</v>

474
00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:46.971
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

475
00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:47.804
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to live it.</v>

476
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

477
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.220
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

478
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:49.480
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

479
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.570
<v Speaker 2>and that was just,</v>

480
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

481
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how else to provoke the positive emotions.</v>

482
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 2>And when we play games and his whole list of positive emotions that we feel when</v>

483
00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 2>we play games like curiosity and excitement and awe and wonder and pride,</v>

484
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like,</v>

485
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get some of these emotions because my doctor had said the more depressed</v>

486
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:08.410
<v Speaker 2>and anxious you are,</v>

487
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 2>that can actually slow down the healing process.</v>

488
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 2>It is actually a detrimental,</v>

489
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.530
<v Speaker 2>right if you,</v>

490
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 2>if you fuel,</v>

491
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:17.220
<v Speaker 2>if you can feed the freshman anxiety</v>

492
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.031
<v Speaker 1>detrimental in,</v>

493
00:12:18.031 --> 00:12:23.031
<v Speaker 1>in terms of measurable effects or detrimental in terms of the way you feel like</v>

494
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.740
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

495
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.340
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

496
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.431
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

497
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:24.940
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

498
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

499
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.480
<v Speaker 2>the brain's ability to heal the neurochemistry of depression is not conducive to</v>

500
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:34.470
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

501
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:39.120
<v Speaker 1>So literally being depressed can slow down the physical healing of the brain</v>

502
00:12:39.121 --> 00:12:39.650
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

503
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:40.483
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

504
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.110
<v Speaker 2>And so they're like,</v>

505
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

506
00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:43.970
<v Speaker 2>so try not to worry.</v>

507
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.481
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

508
00:12:44.481 --> 00:12:44.571
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

509
00:12:44.571 --> 00:12:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>

510
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.320
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

511
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

512
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.090
<v Speaker 2>I can't get out of bed.</v>

513
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:47.991
<v Speaker 2>My books do.</v>

514
00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I can't write.</v>

515
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.890
<v Speaker 2>My husband had lost his job a few months earlier and I'm like,</v>

516
00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I may never work and I'm going to be like a Barista now.</v>

517
00:12:54.501 --> 00:12:56.570
<v Speaker 2>This is like maybe if I can stand,</v>

518
00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.463
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

519
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

520
00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.151
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

521
00:12:59.151 --> 00:12:59.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

522
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.070
<v Speaker 1>so the 34 days,</v>

523
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:01.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

524
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.100
<v Speaker 1>What is the 34 days were when it was at its worst,</v>

525
00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:04.500
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

526
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:04.860
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

527
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.693
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

528
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.720
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

529
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.500
<v Speaker 2>everyone kept saying,</v>

530
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:07.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

531
00:13:07.591 --> 00:13:08.670
<v Speaker 2>you'll be fine in a few days.</v>

532
00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:11.730
<v Speaker 2>So we find a few weeks and then I went and saw my doctor after 30 days.</v>

533
00:13:11.731 --> 00:13:13.230
<v Speaker 2>And then the doctor said,</v>

534
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.281
<v Speaker 2>uh Oh yeah.</v>

535
00:13:14.281 --> 00:13:14.881
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

536
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:17.100
<v Speaker 2>some people don't get better in a month.</v>

537
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Those people,</v>

538
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.230
<v Speaker 2>it often takes three months.</v>

539
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.580
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

540
00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:23.100
<v Speaker 2>for people who don't get better in three months and it often takes a year,</v>

541
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.200
<v Speaker 2>and if you're not better than a year,</v>

542
00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:26.790
<v Speaker 2>then you might be like this forever.</v>

543
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.930
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

544
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:28.770
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

545
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.390
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

546
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.021
<v Speaker 2>it made me,</v>

547
00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:32.370
<v Speaker 2>it kind of freaked me out.</v>

548
00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.200
<v Speaker 1>So did you experiment with things during this time?</v>

549
00:13:36.201 --> 00:13:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Like w w when you were researching?</v>

550
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

551
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.930
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that I really experiment with was a tiny eat things with,</v>

552
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

553
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.660
<v Speaker 2>like Omega is the Omega three,</v>

554
00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:48.231
<v Speaker 2>Omega six,</v>

555
00:13:48.231 --> 00:13:49.580
<v Speaker 2>which are supposed to be good for,</v>

556
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.220
<v Speaker 2>for brain healing.</v>

557
00:13:52.221 --> 00:13:54.650
<v Speaker 2>And there is some scientific literature on that where,</v>

558
00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean doctors will say,</v>

559
00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:56.834
<v Speaker 2>eat walnuts,</v>

560
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

561
00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.070
<v Speaker 2>donuts.</v>

562
00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

563
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's a good like,</v>

564
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

565
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:01.761
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

566
00:14:01.761 --> 00:14:02.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

567
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.250
<v Speaker 2>it's available to them off real good.</v>

568
00:14:04.251 --> 00:14:04.670
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

569
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

570
00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I suppose if it can be a capsule,</v>

571
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 2>you can absorb things better from food.</v>

572
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.700
<v Speaker 1>What does walnut wallets,</v>

573
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 1>it's like omega three omega six fatty acids in fish oil.</v>

574
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

575
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of those weird vegans.</v>

576
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.741
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

577
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:18.574
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>

578
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 1>What about a hemp oil?</v>

579
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Does that have yeah,</v>

580
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.460
<v Speaker 2>hemp is good.</v>

581
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Hemp is really good too.</v>

582
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:24.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

583
00:14:24.841 --> 00:14:25.680
<v Speaker 2>But at the time,</v>

584
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

585
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.610
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I could kind of get it together to do was walnuts.</v>

586
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

587
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

588
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 1>So walnuts where it,</v>

589
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

590
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.430
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is uh,</v>

591
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.330
<v Speaker 1>oh wife.</v>

592
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.060
<v Speaker 1>What do I do that well is a football player.</v>

593
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.320
<v Speaker 1>It was a famous football player and he suffered a lot of concussions and created</v>

594
00:14:43.321 --> 00:14:44.940
<v Speaker 1>something called neuro one.</v>

595
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

596
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:46.760
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

597
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.760
<v Speaker 1>a nootropic blend and he created it to deal with some of the symptoms that he</v>

598
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 1>had had or some of the repercussions from all the head trauma that he had a,</v>

599
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.560
<v Speaker 1>so I was wondering if you'd ever tried anything.</v>

600
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.351
<v Speaker 2>I have not.</v>

601
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:05.351
<v Speaker 2>I know there are a lot of that sort of nutraceutical like interest in</v>

602
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:06.650
<v Speaker 2>experimenting with that.</v>

603
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.820
<v Speaker 2>I did not try that</v>

604
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:08.930
<v Speaker 1>because of the dopamine.</v>

605
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:10.750
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering like Serotonin,</v>

606
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.400
<v Speaker 1>like five HTP is really good for,</v>

607
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

608
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Rebuilding Serotonin or building blocks with Sarah.</v>

609
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

610
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get it together to try any of that.</v>

611
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 2>So you were just really struggling.</v>

612
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I was struggling.</v>

613
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:22.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

614
00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

615
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.383
<v Speaker 2>I would like,</v>

616
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I would sit on the bathroom floor and like cry for hours,</v>

617
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.420
<v Speaker 2>but quietly.</v>

618
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

619
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't want my husband,</v>

620
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.040
<v Speaker 1>different Gal.</v>

621
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Nice,</v>

622
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.413
<v Speaker 1>very polite.</v>

623
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.383
<v Speaker 1>And your depression,</v>

624
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.220
<v Speaker 1>it seems counter intuitive to someone who doesn't know anything like me that</v>

625
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.330
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that you could only watch like Buffy the vampire slayer because</v>

626
00:15:39.331 --> 00:15:40.380
<v Speaker 1>he'd already seen it before,</v>

627
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.130
<v Speaker 1>but playing your game like decent part of yeah.</v>

628
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So stimulating,</v>

629
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:45.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

630
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:45.751
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

631
00:15:45.751 --> 00:15:47.490
<v Speaker 2>and actually I couldn't play video games.</v>

632
00:15:47.491 --> 00:15:49.860
<v Speaker 2>I would try to play like peggle I was,</v>

633
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

634
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.211
<v Speaker 2>Tayga will be easy.</v>

635
00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:51.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

636
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like a kind of pinball game,</v>

637
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

638
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.360
<v Speaker 2>where you shoot little pinballs around pop pigs and it's a,</v>

639
00:15:57.361 --> 00:15:59.070
<v Speaker 2>and they played like the Hallelujah chorus,</v>

640
00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:00.180
<v Speaker 2>every level you complete.</v>

641
00:16:00.181 --> 00:16:00.541
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

642
00:16:00.541 --> 00:16:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Yay,</v>

643
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.430
<v Speaker 2>and I'm successful.</v>

644
00:16:02.431 --> 00:16:03.840
<v Speaker 2>They're like playing a prayed for me.</v>

645
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

646
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:04.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

647
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:05.130
<v Speaker 2>that'll,</v>

648
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:05.431
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

649
00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:06.330
<v Speaker 2>that'll really help.</v>

650
00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Help me.</v>

651
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

652
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.940
<v Speaker 2>but even that was too stimulating.</v>

653
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

654
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.270
<v Speaker 2>so I couldn't play video games.</v>

655
00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:11.851
<v Speaker 2>So the game,</v>

656
00:16:11.851 --> 00:16:13.830
<v Speaker 2>I meant it was not a video game.</v>

657
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

658
00:16:14.101 --> 00:16:18.210
<v Speaker 2>we did eventually make an APP and a web version so people could,</v>

659
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:18.810
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

660
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:19.740
<v Speaker 2>other people could play,</v>

661
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:23.670
<v Speaker 2>but it was more like just a set of rules that I would follow.</v>

662
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:24.803
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

663
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:25.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

664
00:16:25.321 --> 00:16:25.950
<v Speaker 2>like you wouldn't like,</v>

665
00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:26.041
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

666
00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:27.870
<v Speaker 2>how do you play hide and seek or how do you play poker?</v>

667
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Just like learn the rules and play.</v>

668
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

669
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.410
<v Speaker 2>so I just started making up rules for myself about doing things that you would</v>

670
00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:35.340
<v Speaker 2>do in a video game,</v>

671
00:16:35.341 --> 00:16:39.750
<v Speaker 2>like collecting power ups or spotting like making lists of the bad guys and all</v>

672
00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:43.440
<v Speaker 2>the ways like where they would show up and what my strategies were for fighting</v>

673
00:16:43.441 --> 00:16:43.801
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

674
00:16:43.801 --> 00:16:44.680
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

675
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.140
<v Speaker 2>coming up with a quest list.</v>

676
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:46.890
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

677
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.370
<v Speaker 2>what's something I can do in the next 24 hours to feel better,</v>

678
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.070
<v Speaker 2>like something concrete that I can accomplish.</v>

679
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:58.310
<v Speaker 2>And so just starting to approach my recovery with these really concrete gameful</v>

680
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.520
<v Speaker 2>strategies.</v>

681
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

682
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:02.820
<v Speaker 2>and really the,</v>

683
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

684
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:03.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

685
00:17:03.331 --> 00:17:06.120
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I did was I adopted the secret identity.</v>

686
00:17:06.121 --> 00:17:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Like my avatar.</v>

687
00:17:07.081 --> 00:17:10.920
<v Speaker 2>I was going to have an Avatar in my recovery and that was Jane the concussion</v>

688
00:17:10.921 --> 00:17:11.400
<v Speaker 2>slayer.</v>

689
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm like,</v>

690
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.601
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

691
00:17:12.601 --> 00:17:13.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be like Buffy.</v>

692
00:17:13.711 --> 00:17:16.800
<v Speaker 2>And Buffy did not choose to be the slayer.</v>

693
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.281
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

694
00:17:17.281 --> 00:17:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Like they just hold her.</v>

695
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.231
<v Speaker 2>You're this layer,</v>

696
00:17:19.231 --> 00:17:20.310
<v Speaker 2>you have to save the world.</v>

697
00:17:20.311 --> 00:17:20.730
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

698
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.500
<v Speaker 2>I did not choose to hit my head,</v>

699
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.590
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to be like her and just arise to the occasion.</v>

700
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

701
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:31.010
<v Speaker 2>and kind of try to tap into my inner sense of determination and being a Badass.</v>

702
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 1>And so what did you do like after you took on this persona or adopted the idea</v>

703
00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:39.360
<v Speaker 1>of this Avatar?</v>

704
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Like what did you do?</v>

705
00:17:40.381 --> 00:17:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Like what were your power ups?</v>

706
00:17:41.641 --> 00:17:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Like who are the bad guys?</v>

707
00:17:43.051 --> 00:17:43.161
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

708
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:43.321
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

709
00:17:43.321 --> 00:17:43.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

710
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

711
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 2>and bad guys wear anything that would trigger my symptoms.</v>

712
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:46.611
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

713
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:47.120
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

714
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

715
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 2>bright lights,</v>

716
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 2>a crowded space,</v>

717
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:50.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

718
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:50.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

719
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

720
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean everything.</v>

721
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

722
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.443
<v Speaker 2>but the thing with,</v>

723
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 2>with bad guys and like,</v>

724
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:55.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

725
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 2>in a video game like,</v>

726
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.230
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

727
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.063
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

728
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:58.921
<v Speaker 2>there's a monster,</v>

729
00:17:58.921 --> 00:17:59.701
<v Speaker 2>you don't run away.</v>

730
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:03.540
<v Speaker 2>You got to figure out how you're going to tackle it or get past it.</v>

731
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:03.961
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

732
00:18:03.961 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 2>and the same is true with recovery from any kind of injury or illness.</v>

733
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep testing the limits,</v>

734
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:09.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

735
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Cause otherwise you wind up never getting better.</v>

736
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Speaker 2>You kind of convinced that you're just flat on your back forever.</v>

737
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:17.790
<v Speaker 2>And this is sort of an aside,</v>

738
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 2>but as I was doing all the research for this new book,</v>

739
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.350
<v Speaker 2>I found out that the number one predictor of disability after a back injury is</v>

740
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:30.410
<v Speaker 2>avoiding things that make your back hurt early on during recovery.</v>

741
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:32.700
<v Speaker 2>So you would think like,</v>

742
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:32.911
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

743
00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:33.744
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

744
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

745
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

746
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything that will make your back worse.</v>

747
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.020
<v Speaker 2>But the longer you keep that mindset,</v>

748
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a number one predictor of who becomes chronically disabled.</v>

749
00:18:43.381 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 2>You're not able to work,</v>

750
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:44.780
<v Speaker 2>are there,</v>

751
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.010
<v Speaker 2>their life is affected in a major way and it's not,</v>

752
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 2>the severity of the injury is not the severity of the pain.</v>

753
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

754
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.610
<v Speaker 2>and so with all kinds of injury and illness now,</v>

755
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 2>because you get stuck in that pattern,</v>

756
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 2>you never really thinking yourself as injured.</v>

757
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

758
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

759
00:18:59.130 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

760
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.810
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

761
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:01.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

762
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:02.430
<v Speaker 2>but with all of these things,</v>

763
00:19:02.431 --> 00:19:03.270
<v Speaker 2>it's a careful balance.</v>

764
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:05.340
<v Speaker 2>So you have to recognize that the bad guys are bad.</v>

765
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

766
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I can't go out and be in a crowded space for three hours.</v>

767
00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 2>It can't go to like a lady Gaga concert,</v>

768
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.930
<v Speaker 2>which I really wanted to do.</v>

769
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:12.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

770
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.073
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] not going to do that.</v>

771
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

772
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 2>I said that it's kind of like a,</v>

773
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the next time she comes through that'll be like,</v>

774
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 2>what am I epic wins when I can go see her.</v>

775
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.393
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

776
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 2>but like you can do little things to task.</v>

777
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Let me go into the whole foods and see how many minutes I can make it before the</v>

778
00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:27.810
<v Speaker 2>symptoms come back.</v>

779
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.400
<v Speaker 2>So you kind of like testing,</v>

780
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.641
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

781
00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:31.050
<v Speaker 2>today was 30 seconds,</v>

782
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.913
<v Speaker 2>I got to leave.</v>

783
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe next week it'll be five minutes.</v>

784
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:36.570
<v Speaker 2>And then you kind of start to get your life back because you don't want to get</v>

785
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:41.571
<v Speaker 2>on that course towards seeing yourself as is kind of chronically disabled.</v>

786
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:41.821
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

787
00:19:41.821 --> 00:19:42.331
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

788
00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:42.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

789
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.520
<v Speaker 2>you come up with these ways to,</v>

790
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.290
<v Speaker 2>to battle the bad guys,</v>

791
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

792
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.290
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

793
00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.500
<v Speaker 2>And in the version that we tested with the NIH,</v>

794
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.890
<v Speaker 2>that's the game is activate three power ups a day.</v>

795
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.630
<v Speaker 2>So for me that might have been eating walnuts or like cuddling my dog,</v>

796
00:19:57.631 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 2>cause that made me feel like safe and happy.</v>

797
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:02.670
<v Speaker 2>So anything that provokes a positive emotion,</v>

798
00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:07.020
<v Speaker 2>if you're depressed and you have to really find what are the things that can get</v>

799
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:08.310
<v Speaker 2>through that depression and,</v>

800
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 2>and still make you feel good.</v>

801
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:10.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

802
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:10.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

803
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.161
<v Speaker 2>cuddle my dog,</v>

804
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:11.994
<v Speaker 2>I'd eat walnuts.</v>

805
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Do you do three of those a day?</v>

806
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.400
<v Speaker 2>One bad guy battle a day where he really test the limits to see if you're</v>

807
00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:18.234
<v Speaker 2>getting better.</v>

808
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

809
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 2>and one quest today,</v>

810
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.160
<v Speaker 2>which is the smallest possible thing you can do that we'll kind of move you in</v>

811
00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:29.220
<v Speaker 2>the direction of your goal or recovery or just feel like something productive</v>

812
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.361
<v Speaker 2>that you want to do.</v>

813
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:31.890
<v Speaker 2>So I remember one time I,</v>

814
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.581
<v Speaker 2>my quest,</v>

815
00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:37.581
<v Speaker 2>I decided to bake cookies for the Baristas at the coffee place down this area</v>

816
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:37.711
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

817
00:20:37.711 --> 00:20:38.041
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

818
00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:38.201
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

819
00:20:38.201 --> 00:20:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I cause I could felt like I couldn't do anything for myself.</v>

820
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.621
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

821
00:20:40.621 --> 00:20:42.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to bake cookies for someone else today.</v>

822
00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:43.220
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

823
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:43.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

824
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 2>as a result randomly I want of getting free coffee for a year because they were</v>

825
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:47.900
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

826
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I cannot believe somebody came like down with this giant plate of cookies fresh</v>

827
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:52.384
<v Speaker 2>out of the oven.</v>

828
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

829
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:53.820
<v Speaker 2>but I did not,</v>

830
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I did not expect that.</v>

831
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

832
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Speaker 2>but that was just like,</v>

833
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:56.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

834
00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:01.420
<v Speaker 2>find one thing I can do today that will have a positive impact.</v>

835
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

836
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.033
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

837
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.480
<v Speaker 2>that's the sort of,</v>

838
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.890
<v Speaker 2>there's other stuff you know,</v>

839
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.671
<v Speaker 2>in the game,</v>

840
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:07.870
<v Speaker 2>but that's sort of the main,</v>

841
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.551
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

842
00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:13.551
<v Speaker 2>you're basically using game gain models to kind of structure your life to make</v>

843
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 2>sure that you're staying engaged,</v>

844
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.830
<v Speaker 2>not hiding,</v>

845
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

846
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 2>actually making progress to getting better.</v>

847
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.580
<v Speaker 1>This sounds really difficult.</v>

848
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.230
<v Speaker 1>More difficult than I think most people would ever imagine recovering from a</v>

849
00:21:27.231 --> 00:21:28.041
<v Speaker 1>concussion would be.</v>

850
00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:29.930
<v Speaker 1>I think most people would think that.</v>

851
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:30.950
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

852
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:31.731
<v Speaker 1>don't want to say most people,</v>

853
00:21:31.731 --> 00:21:32.990
<v Speaker 1>let me just say what I would think.</v>

854
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.100
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had a concussion,</v>

855
00:21:34.101 --> 00:21:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think since I was probably 20.</v>

856
00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.850
<v Speaker 1>And I would think that what it would be like would be like,</v>

857
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.361
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

858
00:21:41.361 --> 00:21:41.631
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

859
00:21:41.631 --> 00:21:42.441
<v Speaker 1>it feels like shit.</v>

860
00:21:42.441 --> 00:21:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Let me just lie down here.</v>

861
00:21:43.371 --> 00:21:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll put ice on my head,</v>

862
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch TV or something and I'll just go to,</v>

863
00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a lot of naps,</v>

864
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:48.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

865
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Like you think it'll feel like a hangover or something like that.</v>

866
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.280
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that your thinking becomes muddled too.</v>

867
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.780
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just that you have these physical symptoms,</v>

868
00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.670
<v Speaker 2>you're not able to think clearly.</v>

869
00:21:59.671 --> 00:22:01.230
<v Speaker 2>You're not thinking like yourself.</v>

870
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.670
<v Speaker 2>And that can really lead to a lot of confusion,</v>

871
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.990
<v Speaker 2>bad decisions.</v>

872
00:22:06.991 --> 00:22:07.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

873
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.183
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

874
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.053
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

875
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:09.800
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

876
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.170
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

877
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.070
<v Speaker 2>they try to hide the severity of the symptoms because they think that,</v>

878
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

879
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.353
<v Speaker 2>it will,</v>

880
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

881
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.040
<v Speaker 2>other people will judge them or they're like,</v>

882
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.300
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of it that's very common.</v>

883
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I've now learned with concussions.</v>

884
00:22:22.711 --> 00:22:25.410
<v Speaker 2>People hide the severity of symptoms because there's like,</v>

885
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.190
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

886
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.520
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

887
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.180
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking clearly and you think it's important that other people not</v>

888
00:22:30.181 --> 00:22:31.020
<v Speaker 2>really see.</v>

889
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

890
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:31.811
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>

891
00:22:31.811 --> 00:22:36.300
<v Speaker 2>I've of become this sort of weird spokes person slash guru for concussions</v>

892
00:22:36.301 --> 00:22:37.920
<v Speaker 2>because of my ted talk about it.</v>

893
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.240
<v Speaker 2>So every day,</v>

894
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.700
<v Speaker 2>literally I hear on Facebook or Twitter from someone who's like,</v>

895
00:22:41.701 --> 00:22:43.680
<v Speaker 2>just been concussed and they're like,</v>

896
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.723
<v Speaker 2>what do I do?</v>

897
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

898
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.320
<v Speaker 2>and I actually,</v>

899
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

900
00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:47.281
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

901
00:22:47.281 --> 00:22:47.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

902
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

903
00:22:48.271 --> 00:22:48.601
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

904
00:22:48.601 --> 00:22:48.930
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

905
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:49.681
<v Speaker 2>I'm your ally.</v>

906
00:22:49.681 --> 00:22:50.730
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like always,</v>

907
00:22:50.731 --> 00:22:51.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

908
00:22:51.001 --> 00:22:53.370
<v Speaker 2>sending direct messages to like random people.</v>

909
00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:53.821
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

910
00:22:53.821 --> 00:22:58.320
<v Speaker 2>checking in on them to see I'm feeling great thing because it's not even like if</v>

911
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.240
<v Speaker 2>your friends or family will not understand,</v>

912
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.020
<v Speaker 2>they will think,</v>

913
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:01.231
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

914
00:23:01.231 --> 00:23:04.110
<v Speaker 2>you'll be out on the couch for three days and they expect you to be back to</v>

915
00:23:04.111 --> 00:23:04.471
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>

916
00:23:04.471 --> 00:23:06.390
<v Speaker 2>And they don't understand why three months,</v>

917
00:23:06.391 --> 00:23:07.290
<v Speaker 2>four months later,</v>

918
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.940
<v Speaker 2>you're still struggling.</v>

919
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

920
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:10.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

921
00:23:10.621 --> 00:23:13.140
<v Speaker 2>it has not been discussed enough,</v>

922
00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:14.610
<v Speaker 2>although I think that's changing now.</v>

923
00:23:14.611 --> 00:23:15.090
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

924
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.480
<v Speaker 2>especially with so many soldiers coming back with longterm,</v>

925
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

926
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:20.310
<v Speaker 2>symptoms of,</v>

927
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.330
<v Speaker 2>of the concussions.</v>

928
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:22.710
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

929
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:27.710
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that's confusing to me with this is that in the beginning,</v>

930
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.450
<v Speaker 1>the first stage of your concussion,</v>

931
00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:31.210
<v Speaker 1>it's critical.</v>

932
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:31.890
<v Speaker 1>You do nothing.</v>

933
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:32.723
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

934
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.150
<v Speaker 1>But then after a while you're like pushing it.</v>

935
00:23:36.151 --> 00:23:36.301
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

936
00:23:36.301 --> 00:23:36.611
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

937
00:23:36.611 --> 00:23:38.400
<v Speaker 1>how much time can I spend at whole foods for free?</v>

938
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

939
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.060
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

940
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

941
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Like many people would think that that's sort of counter intuitive.</v>

942
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:43.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

943
00:23:43.731 --> 00:23:43.881
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

944
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:44.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

945
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:44.641
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

946
00:23:44.641 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 2>in the is when the brain needs the most resources,</v>

947
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:49.011
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

948
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 2>So you don't mind early stages like,</v>

949
00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:51.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

950
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 2>how many days?</v>

951
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.800
<v Speaker 2>So depending on the studies you read,</v>

952
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:58.810
<v Speaker 2>it'll say between 48 hours to one week is the most crucial stage where you want,</v>

953
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.670
<v Speaker 2>where you want the most cognitive rest and you want to avoid,</v>

954
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:05.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

955
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.780
<v Speaker 2>it basically just exhausting the brain because blood,</v>

956
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Speaker 2>anything you do that's cognitively demanding,</v>

957
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.140
<v Speaker 2>it directs blood flow to different regions of the brain.</v>

958
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:20.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't want your brain spending time trying to figure out your email instead</v>

959
00:24:20.331 --> 00:24:20.810
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

960
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:21.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

961
00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:21.710
<v Speaker 2>because there's only,</v>

962
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 2>there's only so much blood to flow around.</v>

963
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

964
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.973
<v Speaker 2>and you don't,</v>

965
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.440
<v Speaker 2>you don't want it to be spent and,</v>

966
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:27.680
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

967
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.580
<v Speaker 2>and try and do an email will require so much more effort from you than it</v>

968
00:24:31.581 --> 00:24:32.181
<v Speaker 2>normally would.</v>

969
00:24:32.181 --> 00:24:33.830
<v Speaker 2>So it's a sort of like vicious cycle.</v>

970
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

971
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.660
<v Speaker 2>now eventually the brain kind of gets into this sort of,</v>

972
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

973
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.640
<v Speaker 2>spaces where it's like,</v>

974
00:24:40.641 --> 00:24:41.090
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

975
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.290
<v Speaker 2>now we're working or you've got your,</v>

976
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:43.790
<v Speaker 2>you've got kind of your thickened up.</v>

977
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

978
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:45.740
<v Speaker 2>lesions that's going to take,</v>

979
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:46.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

980
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 2>four months to kind of dissolve and,</v>

981
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.550
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

982
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.120
<v Speaker 2>and be back to normal.</v>

983
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

984
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.160
<v Speaker 2>so you can,</v>

985
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.100
<v Speaker 2>you can test and you can say engage and,</v>

986
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.720
<v Speaker 2>and not being engaged.</v>

987
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.700
<v Speaker 2>We'll feel depression and anxiety.</v>

988
00:24:58.701 --> 00:25:02.390
<v Speaker 2>So partly it's like you're trying to balance the mental health with the</v>

989
00:25:02.391 --> 00:25:03.230
<v Speaker 2>cognitive health.</v>

990
00:25:03.231 --> 00:25:03.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't,</v>

991
00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:07.010
<v Speaker 2>if you were to do cognitive rest for a month,</v>

992
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.850
<v Speaker 2>if you like being in solitary confinement and we know that that has really bad</v>

993
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.800
<v Speaker 2>mental health affects.</v>

994
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.843
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

995
00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.051
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

996
00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:15.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

997
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.100
<v Speaker 1>your kind of figuring this out as you go along,</v>

998
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.160
<v Speaker 1>there's really not a road map that's set out.</v>

999
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.080
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever done this before and you just sort of take your game designing</v>

1000
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:32.081
<v Speaker 1>skills and apply what you know about the positive effects of games and you</v>

1001
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 1>experiment on yourself like a Guinea pig.</v>

1002
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1003
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I was worried that you might be fucking your brain up or Nah,</v>

1004
00:25:40.731 --> 00:25:41.564
<v Speaker 1>I'm like</v>

1005
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.700
<v Speaker 2>what could be worse than what was already happening.</v>

1006
00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1007
00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:46.601
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>

1008
00:25:46.601 --> 00:25:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll like literally within 48 hours the,</v>

1009
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.500
<v Speaker 2>that fog that like super black,</v>

1010
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:53.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1011
00:25:53.891 --> 00:25:54.351
<v Speaker 2>you wanted,</v>

1012
00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:56.530
<v Speaker 2>I fog was gone and it was,</v>

1013
00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.570
<v Speaker 2>it none of the symptoms and go and it was as can cost as I was,</v>

1014
00:26:01.571 --> 00:26:01.960
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1015
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.140
<v Speaker 2>that feeling of hopelessness really went away.</v>

1016
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.380
<v Speaker 2>And because of the fun of it.</v>

1017
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:09.341
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

1018
00:26:09.341 --> 00:26:13.270
<v Speaker 2>this is why I wrote the book because I didn't really understand why worked.</v>

1019
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:17.020
<v Speaker 2>I knew it worked for me and then I put the rules online and people started</v>

1020
00:26:17.021 --> 00:26:19.990
<v Speaker 2>writing me from all over the world that they were using it.</v>

1021
00:26:19.991 --> 00:26:21.940
<v Speaker 2>And not just for concussions.</v>

1022
00:26:21.941 --> 00:26:22.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1023
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:24.130
<v Speaker 2>people were writing for,</v>

1024
00:26:24.131 --> 00:26:24.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1025
00:26:24.371 --> 00:26:25.300
<v Speaker 2>I have cancer,</v>

1026
00:26:25.301 --> 00:26:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I just had knee surgery.</v>

1027
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:27.791
<v Speaker 2>Someone you know,</v>

1028
00:26:27.791 --> 00:26:30.490
<v Speaker 2>who was just like noticed with als starts playing it.</v>

1029
00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:31.810
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1030
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1031
00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.123
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1032
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:33.550
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1033
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.660
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be,</v>

1034
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.330
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to be extraordinary effective at treating depression,</v>

1035
00:26:37.331 --> 00:26:41.680
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and also making people feel just stronger,</v>

1036
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 2>just like better of themselves.</v>

1037
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 2>And I did not understand it.</v>

1038
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:46.794
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

1039
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I say this all the time people,</v>

1040
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:53.241
<v Speaker 2>because there can be a lot of skepticism that a game can be helpful during a</v>

1041
00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:54.780
<v Speaker 2>really serious,</v>

1042
00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1043
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 2>challenge in your life.</v>

1044
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like trivial.</v>

1045
00:26:57.901 --> 00:26:58.734
<v Speaker 2>It sounds stupid.</v>

1046
00:26:59.160 --> 00:26:59.431
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1047
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:00.570
<v Speaker 2>so I freely acknowledged,</v>

1048
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.890
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand why it worked.</v>

1049
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:05.700
<v Speaker 2>It seemed kind of absurd to me for people with much more serious problems and I</v>

1050
00:27:05.701 --> 00:27:06.534
<v Speaker 2>had to,</v>

1051
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1052
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.310
<v Speaker 2>so that's why I wrote the book.</v>

1053
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.420
<v Speaker 2>It's why I started doing,</v>

1054
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.860
<v Speaker 2>in our clinical trial and the studies we've been doing for the last few years to</v>

1055
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:18.240
<v Speaker 2>try to understand because I didn't at all I knew was that it seemed to be having</v>

1056
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:19.590
<v Speaker 2>all these positive effects and that,</v>

1057
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1058
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.020
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

1059
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.620
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1060
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean even to a game designer like myself who believes in the power of games,</v>

1061
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I was really taken off guard.</v>

1062
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1063
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.440
<v Speaker 1>So how did you structure it?</v>

1064
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1065
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:37.010
<v Speaker 1>did you first start off just coming up with things like power pills or walnuts</v>

1066
00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:42.171
<v Speaker 1>and bad guys or depression and how did you like put this whole thing together?</v>

1067
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:43.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1068
00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:43.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1069
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I just started making youtube videos,</v>

1070
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:45.331
<v Speaker 2>which is really funny.</v>

1071
00:27:45.331 --> 00:27:48.270
<v Speaker 2>You can go back and look at like the first youtube videos of me.</v>

1072
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:48.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1073
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Scott,</v>

1074
00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:53.390
<v Speaker 2>like why I'm making a game for my concussion or something like that.</v>

1075
00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.860
<v Speaker 1>And First Youtube video you made,</v>

1076
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.960
<v Speaker 1>what were you still suffering?</v>

1077
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.421
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1078
00:27:57.421 --> 00:27:57.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1079
00:27:57.571 --> 00:27:58.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1080
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.450
<v Speaker 2>How many months was it into?</v>

1081
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.291
<v Speaker 2>I thought this is like,</v>

1082
00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:03.390
<v Speaker 2>I think on day 34 this is like the day I'm like,</v>

1083
00:28:03.391 --> 00:28:04.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm making a game.</v>

1084
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make a youtube video explaining the game.</v>

1085
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.670
<v Speaker 2>What's it like to when you watch that video now?</v>

1086
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:08.851
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1087
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:10.290
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy because I can't,</v>

1088
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:10.921
<v Speaker 2>you can see,</v>

1089
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:12.300
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of words.</v>

1090
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:12.790
<v Speaker 2>Aye.</v>

1091
00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.240
<v Speaker 2>Aye.</v>

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Aye.</v>

1093
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.473
<v Speaker 2>Aye.</v>

1094
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1095
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:15.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1098
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.561
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1099
00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:17.394
<v Speaker 2>What would it be under?</v>

1100
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Why I'm making a game?</v>

1101
00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:21.121
<v Speaker 2>Concussion,</v>

1102
00:28:21.121 --> 00:28:22.110
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1103
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

1104
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.090
<v Speaker 2>You'll find it.</v>

1105
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1106
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like you can see I can't,</v>

1107
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1108
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1109
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 2>you see how fast I talk.</v>

1110
00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:28.884
<v Speaker 2>Am I right?</v>

1111
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm like talking.</v>

1112
00:28:29.731 --> 00:28:30.031
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1113
00:28:30.031 --> 00:28:31.170
<v Speaker 2>So how long ago was this?</v>

1114
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Five years ago?</v>

1115
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1116
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.820
<v Speaker 1>And how long do you think it was before you felt like 100% you again?</v>

1117
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1118
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like 99% right now.</v>

1119
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:42.691
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1120
00:28:42.691 --> 00:28:42.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:28:42.871 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's still not 100%.</v>

1122
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:44.761
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1123
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:45.161
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>

1124
00:28:45.161 --> 00:28:45.361
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1125
00:28:45.361 --> 00:28:47.640
<v Speaker 2>there's still some things like certain lights.</v>

1126
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I can't be around.</v>

1127
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

1128
00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:50.790
<v Speaker 2>it creates,</v>

1129
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.211
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1130
00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:52.980
<v Speaker 2>it feels like I'm having five years later.</v>

1131
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:54.451
<v Speaker 2>Well let's,</v>

1133
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:55.500
<v Speaker 2>let's play this real quick.</v>

1134
00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:58.323
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1135
00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I am making this video to explain and project some volume.</v>

1136
00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Jack hijacked a game to help the recovery process that I'm dealing with it after</v>

1137
00:29:13.971 --> 00:29:18.971
<v Speaker 3>I hit my head and got a concussion and that was about five weeks ago and their</v>

1138
00:29:22.851 --> 00:29:27.000
<v Speaker 3>recovery has been very slow and hard.</v>

1139
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.731
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1140
00:29:28.731 --> 00:29:29.564
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1141
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 3>it's getting to a point where I feel like I need again to help me get what I was</v>

1142
00:29:36.351 --> 00:29:40.580
<v Speaker 3>doing some research today about post concussion syndrome,</v>

1143
00:29:40.581 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 3>which is what definitely told that weird artifacts and the sound will</v>

1144
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:46.500
<v Speaker 3>concentrating trouble.</v>

1145
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:46.721
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1146
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably just sitting there with my laptop in my lap.</v>

1147
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.033
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1148
00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.520
<v Speaker 3>serious planning,</v>

1149
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:56.890
<v Speaker 3>mental problem solving that would give me a concussion pickler and having a very</v>

1150
00:29:56.891 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 3>hard time.</v>

1151
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.630
<v Speaker 3>I was not a pro.</v>

1152
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1153
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:01.960
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1154
00:30:01.961 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 3>and I get dizzy a lot.</v>

1155
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1156
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.730
<v Speaker 3>and I get headaches and nauseous,</v>

1157
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.573
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing.</v>

1158
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:07.371
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely,</v>

1159
00:30:07.371 --> 00:30:07.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1160
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Can really see clearly you're,</v>

1161
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.700
<v Speaker 1>you're moving way,</v>

1162
00:30:11.701 --> 00:30:12.690
<v Speaker 1>way slower.</v>

1163
00:30:12.691 --> 00:30:14.100
<v Speaker 1>You're talking way slower.</v>

1164
00:30:14.101 --> 00:30:15.060
<v Speaker 1>You can see you're struggling.</v>

1165
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.320
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1166
00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1167
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:16.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1168
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:16.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1169
00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're on meth right now.</v>

1170
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.010
<v Speaker 2>I am a naturally very energetic person.</v>

1171
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.320
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to me that you're not 100% still.</v>

1172
00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:26.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1173
00:30:26.541 --> 00:30:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1174
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 2>you know it and I'm not sure entirely why I was knocked out once when I was</v>

1175
00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:32.990
<v Speaker 2>younger,</v>

1176
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.510
<v Speaker 2>like knocked out for like five minutes.</v>

1177
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1178
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.741
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

1179
00:30:36.741 --> 00:30:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I fell off a sliding board.</v>

1180
00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.913
<v Speaker 2>What's a sliding?</v>

1181
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a Philadelphia thing.</v>

1182
00:30:41.361 --> 00:30:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1183
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1184
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.400
<v Speaker 2>like a slide like,</v>

1185
00:30:43.401 --> 00:30:43.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1186
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.490
<v Speaker 2>like at the playgrounds that you go down there.</v>

1187
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1188
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.330
<v Speaker 2>fried chicken Philly.</v>

1189
00:30:47.331 --> 00:30:52.010
<v Speaker 2>We called it sliding boards and I fell right off the side and hit my head on a</v>

1190
00:30:52.011 --> 00:30:53.330
<v Speaker 2>cement block.</v>

1191
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1192
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:55.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was really young.</v>

1193
00:30:55.941 --> 00:30:57.140
<v Speaker 2>That was my first concussion.</v>

1194
00:30:57.141 --> 00:30:58.000
<v Speaker 2>So that's probably</v>

1195
00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.140
<v Speaker 1>what's going on to,</v>

1196
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.841
<v Speaker 1>as it were,</v>

1197
00:30:59.841 --> 00:31:00.980
<v Speaker 1>repeated concussions,</v>

1198
00:31:00.981 --> 00:31:01.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1199
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.331
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1200
00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:01.430
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1201
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.380
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is I was so young,</v>

1202
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.490
<v Speaker 2>I did not,</v>

1203
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.941
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1204
00:31:04.941 --> 00:31:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's like four or something.</v>

1205
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.750
<v Speaker 2>I actually didn't know that I'd had a concussion.</v>

1206
00:31:08.751 --> 00:31:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I thought this was my first concussion in 2009.</v>

1207
00:31:11.091 --> 00:31:11.631
<v Speaker 2>And the doctor's like,</v>

1208
00:31:11.631 --> 00:31:11.751
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1209
00:31:11.751 --> 00:31:12.650
<v Speaker 2>have you had a concussion port?</v>

1210
00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.450
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1211
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1212
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.510
<v Speaker 2>because obviously everyone knows now if you have more than one,</v>

1213
00:31:17.511 --> 00:31:18.380
<v Speaker 2>it can start to,</v>

1214
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:19.790
<v Speaker 2>the healing will take longer.</v>

1215
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know until like a month into my injury,</v>

1216
00:31:23.211 --> 00:31:25.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to my parents and they mentioned,</v>

1217
00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:26.331
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1218
00:31:26.331 --> 00:31:26.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1219
00:31:26.841 --> 00:31:30.590
<v Speaker 2>the last time you had a concussion you were feeling better and much faster.</v>

1220
00:31:30.591 --> 00:31:31.130
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1221
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.963
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1222
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:32.600
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1223
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.680
<v Speaker 2>what last time?</v>

1224
00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:33.891
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1225
00:31:33.891 --> 00:31:36.950
<v Speaker 2>you remember when you fell off the sliding board when you were,</v>

1226
00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1227
00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.140
<v Speaker 2>anything when there were four.</v>

1228
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1229
00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:40.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1230
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.920
<v Speaker 2>my five year old doesn't remember anything when she was four.</v>

1231
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:43.240
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1232
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1233
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:43.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1234
00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.500
<v Speaker 2>when you broke your collarbone,</v>

1235
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:45.741
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1236
00:31:45.741 --> 00:31:45.831
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1237
00:31:45.831 --> 00:31:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I do remember like wearing a sling for collarbone,</v>

1238
00:31:48.681 --> 00:31:50.750
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know that I had a concussion.</v>

1239
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:51.710
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1240
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:52.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1241
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.740
<v Speaker 1>so even though you were four and then the next one,</v>

1242
00:31:54.741 --> 00:31:55.461
<v Speaker 1>you were an adult.</v>

1243
00:31:55.461 --> 00:31:56.294
<v Speaker 1>It's still</v>

1244
00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

1245
00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:57.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1246
00:31:57.411 --> 00:31:57.880
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1247
00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1248
00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:58.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1249
00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:59.573
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

1250
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:00.970
<v Speaker 2>people like Reese,</v>

1251
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.550
<v Speaker 2>the fines does not quite understand how this works yet.</v>

1252
00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

1253
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:09.680
<v Speaker 2>if the cumulative Knox have to be all within the same few years or if it can</v>

1254
00:32:09.681 --> 00:32:10.880
<v Speaker 2>stretch out over a lifetime.</v>

1255
00:32:10.881 --> 00:32:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I try not to think about it too much because I'm like,</v>

1256
00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:14.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1257
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.781
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1258
00:32:14.781 --> 00:32:16.550
<v Speaker 2>if it happens again that I'm really,</v>

1259
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1260
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:18.441
<v Speaker 2>but I'm actually,</v>

1261
00:32:18.441 --> 00:32:21.660
<v Speaker 2>I like walk around like this covering yeah,</v>

1262
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:21.890
<v Speaker 2>give,</v>

1263
00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:22.041
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1264
00:32:22.041 --> 00:32:22.880
<v Speaker 2>if I'm at like at a,</v>

1265
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:23.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1266
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.790
<v Speaker 2>like a concert or like in a 200 a element.</v>

1267
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I literally want,</v>

1268
00:32:27.921 --> 00:32:29.810
<v Speaker 2>if I'm like at a nightclub or something,</v>

1269
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I want to wear a helmet.</v>

1270
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm like wondering if I can bring that back.</v>

1271
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I stayed a girl that used to go to mosh pits.</v>

1272
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

1273
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.390
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1274
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:41.570
<v Speaker 1>she got headbutted by a dude once she came over to my apartment after she,</v>

1275
00:32:41.571 --> 00:32:41.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1276
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.930
<v Speaker 1>had been marching and she's like holding her head and I'm like,</v>

1277
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:45.764
<v Speaker 1>what do you deal with?</v>

1278
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I think she went to see some crazy fucking bad,</v>

1279
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember the,</v>

1280
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.360
<v Speaker 1>is there a band called the creeps?</v>

1281
00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:55.281
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1282
00:32:55.281 --> 00:32:55.551
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1283
00:32:55.551 --> 00:32:59.000
<v Speaker 1>it was in Boston and like 88 89.</v>

1284
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.820
<v Speaker 1>So we should be wearing helmets.</v>

1285
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.830
<v Speaker 1>You definitely don't get headbutted in a mosh pit.</v>

1286
00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:04.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1287
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:08.520
<v Speaker 1>But I would think like there's certain assholes like drunken dummies and you'd</v>

1288
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 1>go out to places you,</v>

1289
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:10.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1290
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:10.721
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1291
00:33:10.721 --> 00:33:11.541
<v Speaker 1>And I'm short,</v>

1292
00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:13.640
<v Speaker 1>so I'm always worried about the elbows.</v>

1293
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Someone's like reaching for something,</v>

1294
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.670
<v Speaker 1>some big dude.</v>

1295
00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:17.504
<v Speaker 1>We'll just,</v>

1296
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1297
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.810
<v Speaker 1>even like on planes when people are taking down their luggage,</v>

1298
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I like cower by the windows or by the window.</v>

1299
00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:24.603
<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>

1300
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1301
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:26.770
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>

1302
00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:27.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1303
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.390
<v Speaker 1>the recognition of vulnerabilities,</v>

1304
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:29.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1305
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.230
<v Speaker 1>an issue with people that get hurt because then all of a sudden you realize you</v>

1306
00:33:33.231 --> 00:33:36.110
<v Speaker 1>can get hurt and sometimes you just walk on eggshells all the time.</v>

1307
00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:37.910
<v Speaker 1>It reduces the quality of your life.</v>

1308
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1309
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.351
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1310
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:39.591
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1311
00:33:39.591 --> 00:33:40.424
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of,</v>

1312
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:41.990
<v Speaker 1>that gets to that idea of,</v>

1313
00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:42.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1314
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.060
<v Speaker 1>spotting the bag eyes,</v>

1315
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:46.730
<v Speaker 1>things that could hurt you and then you decide kind of how,</v>

1316
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 1>how comfortable you are.</v>

1317
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.090
<v Speaker 1>You can't just run away.</v>

1318
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:51.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't just hide.</v>

1319
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.950
<v Speaker 1>You have to kind of push your comfort limits a little bit.</v>

1320
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1321
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:56.840
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not going to go skiing.</v>

1322
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I that ski ski.</v>

1323
00:33:59.271 --> 00:33:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1324
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.051
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1325
00:34:00.051 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think certain.</v>

1326
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:04.400
<v Speaker 1>There's certain things now that I feel like it's not worth the risk to me.</v>

1327
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.413
<v Speaker 1>A third,</v>

1328
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:06.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1329
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine.</v>

1330
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I just started skiing at 45.</v>

1331
00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:11.350
<v Speaker 1>It's my first time skiing.</v>

1332
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I fucking wiped out hard last year,</v>

1333
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.620
<v Speaker 1>but that's fine.</v>

1334
00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

1335
00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.960
<v Speaker 1>and didn't hit my head and I'm pretty good at falling.</v>

1336
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I know how to fall or Tom molden rolled with it,</v>

1337
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:21.740
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

1338
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.101
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1339
00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I was going to fast when I wiped.</v>

1340
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1341
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a video that's online too.</v>

1342
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 1>We retweeted earlier today.</v>

1343
00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:33.460
<v Speaker 1>This fucking kid is in Colorado and he's on a skateboard and he's going 70 miles</v>

1344
00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:39.950
<v Speaker 1>an hour down a hill and you just watch it.</v>

1345
00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:44.690
<v Speaker 1>And like every part of my body's like tingling with fear,</v>

1346
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:45.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1347
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.660
<v Speaker 1>that anticipation injuries.</v>

1348
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

1349
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:49.400
<v Speaker 1>you tweeted that.</v>

1350
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Did you treat the roof topper?</v>

1351
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy in Russia?</v>

1352
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:53.683
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1353
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1354
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm really interested in like neuro hacks,</v>

1355
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.690
<v Speaker 1>how you can do little things to like change,</v>

1356
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 1>like how your brain is working right now.</v>

1357
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1358
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:02.871
<v Speaker 1>and that video,</v>

1359
00:35:02.871 --> 00:35:05.450
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to me would be really good for people to get a little bit of</v>

1360
00:35:05.451 --> 00:35:06.410
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline going.</v>

1361
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.920
<v Speaker 1>If you're like on your couch and you're like having a hard time getting yourself</v>

1362
00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:10.550
<v Speaker 1>out of bed.</v>

1363
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1364
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.370
<v Speaker 1>he's going 70 miles an hour down this crazy hill</v>

1365
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.160
<v Speaker 1>with horrible music and it looks like a video game.</v>

1366
00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:22.994
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1367
00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:23.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1368
00:35:23.391 --> 00:35:27.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just crazy that this kid is doing this because you can't stop.</v>

1369
00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1370
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:28.881
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1371
00:35:28.881 --> 00:35:29.990
<v Speaker 1>he's really good.</v>

1372
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1373
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.000
<v Speaker 1>So there's a point where he,</v>

1374
00:35:32.001 --> 00:35:32.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1375
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 1>he turns a skateboard sideways to slow it down,</v>

1376
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.010
<v Speaker 1>like at the very,</v>

1377
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1378
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.090
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1379
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.570
<v Speaker 1>and there's a couple little wiggles there.</v>

1380
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's about to go down.</v>

1381
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.900
<v Speaker 1>And if he goes down,</v>

1382
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:43.621
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1383
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:44.550
<v Speaker 1>you're breaking everything.</v>

1384
00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1385
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 1>You're going 70 miles an hour.</v>

1386
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:47.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1387
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:49.080
<v Speaker 1>he is fall lying.</v>

1388
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:51.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

1389
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:51.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1390
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:54.870
<v Speaker 1>they're not faking this unless this is some sort of advanced CG.</v>

1391
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1392
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:55.921
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>

1393
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:56.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1394
00:35:56.191 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 2>it almost could be a video game.</v>

1395
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Like watch when he reaches his hands down,</v>

1396
00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:03.900
<v Speaker 1>he has some kind of crazy gloves on and when he reaches his hands down,</v>

1397
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:07.420
<v Speaker 1>there's certain parts in the video where he's a touching the sparks,</v>

1398
00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:08.770
<v Speaker 1>sparks the sparks.</v>

1399
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:09.953
<v Speaker 1>I look at that.</v>

1400
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ,</v>

1401
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I cried.</v>

1402
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.623
<v Speaker 1>He almost fell.</v>

1403
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's getting like really close to falling.</v>

1404
00:36:15.001 --> 00:36:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a couple times there where there's like this intense wiggle and</v>

1405
00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:21.690
<v Speaker 1>he's talking himself like a,</v>

1406
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:24.320
<v Speaker 1>a speed skater so that he can go faster.</v>

1407
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1408
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Crazy fucker.</v>

1409
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Like what is wrong with kids?</v>

1410
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean I get it.</v>

1411
00:36:29.461 --> 00:36:30.630
<v Speaker 1>This is an adrenaline rush.</v>

1412
00:36:30.631 --> 00:36:35.631
<v Speaker 1>But when you see this knowing what you suffered from standing up under a</v>

1413
00:36:36.091 --> 00:36:36.750
<v Speaker 1>cabinet.</v>

1414
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:37.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1415
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1416
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.191
<v Speaker 1>And does this freak?</v>

1417
00:36:39.191 --> 00:36:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1418
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Does he have a helmet on?</v>

1419
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Is that a hat?</v>

1420
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.770
<v Speaker 1>That's a helmet.</v>

1421
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:43.261
<v Speaker 1>It's a helmet.</v>

1422
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:44.094
<v Speaker 1>Held him.</v>

1423
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Was that how long are going to do well?</v>

1424
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:47.453
<v Speaker 1>Oh little.</v>

1425
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:48.530
<v Speaker 1>We get legal.</v>

1426
00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 1>You this,</v>

1427
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.793
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

1428
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.240
<v Speaker 1>That kid is crazy.</v>

1429
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.090
<v Speaker 1>That's how he slowed down and now he's up.</v>

1430
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.000
<v Speaker 1>He's down to a reasonable pace.</v>

1431
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.141
<v Speaker 1>But when you see him,</v>

1432
00:36:58.141 --> 00:36:59.700
<v Speaker 1>he'll do it again to slow it down.</v>

1433
00:36:59.701 --> 00:37:01.260
<v Speaker 1>He grabs a board and look at this.</v>

1434
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:02.750
<v Speaker 1>That is nuts.</v>

1435
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Are you figuring out how many hours have,</v>

1436
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean cause he's like a virtuoso at.</v>

1437
00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:08.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1438
00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:10.960
<v Speaker 2>So there's like thousands and thousands of hours.</v>

1439
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1440
00:37:11.341 --> 00:37:12.960
<v Speaker 1>He's put the 10,000 hours in.</v>

1441
00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1442
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.300
<v Speaker 1>But good Lord,</v>

1443
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:16.860
<v Speaker 1>when you see something like that,</v>

1444
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:18.000
<v Speaker 1>no one what you went through,</v>

1445
00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:20.420
<v Speaker 1>like anything like when you see like dirt bike riders</v>

1446
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.920
<v Speaker 2>doing fine.</v>

1447
00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I actually have a really,</v>

1448
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I stopped watching professional football,</v>

1449
00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:24.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1450
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:25.970
<v Speaker 2>after I used to,</v>

1451
00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:26.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1452

<v Speaker 2>I mean go 40 niners right.</v>

1453
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:30.140
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1454
00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:30.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1455
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.363
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1456
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch football anymore.</v>

1457
00:37:33.861 --> 00:37:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>

1458
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1459
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:35.743
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

1460
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:36.760
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1461
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1462
00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't enjoy it in the same way because I,</v>

1463
00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.893
<v Speaker 2>I just feel,</v>

1464
00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad players and when I see,</v>

1465
00:37:43.821 --> 00:37:45.350
<v Speaker 2>when I see like a really hard hit,</v>

1466
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:46.723
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1467
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I just feel bad.</v>

1468
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.273
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1469
00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that's something a lot of people are struggling with these days with all</v>

1470
00:37:52.581 --> 00:37:53.180
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1471
00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:53.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1472
00:37:53.331 --> 00:37:57.200
<v Speaker 1>the real sports story that they did on traumatic brain injury and the issues</v>

1473
00:37:57.201 --> 00:37:59.420
<v Speaker 1>that people are having and the,</v>

1474
00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that I've seen from fighters over the years is,</v>

1475
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:04.370
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely affected my enjoyment.</v>

1476
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.290
<v Speaker 1>What's this retiring after concussion next hit to my head.</v>

1477
00:38:09.291 --> 00:38:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Could possibly,</v>

1478
00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:10.803
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1479
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:11.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1480
00:38:11.141 --> 00:38:11.920
<v Speaker 2>this is a thing now,</v>

1481
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.161
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1482
00:38:12.161 --> 00:38:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

1483
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.820
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

1484
00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1485
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.601
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1486
00:38:13.601 --> 00:38:15.340
<v Speaker 2>they're retiring one,</v>

1487
00:38:15.341 --> 00:38:16.720
<v Speaker 2>two years into their career.</v>

1488
00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:17.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1489
00:38:17.481 --> 00:38:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1490
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.320
<v Speaker 1>there's more of that now than ever before because guys are realizing first of</v>

1491
00:38:21.321 --> 00:38:21.950
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1492
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:22.880
<v Speaker 1>at the end of,</v>

1493
00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:23.723
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1494
00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.370
<v Speaker 1>at the end of their career,</v>

1495
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.610
<v Speaker 1>they're most likely going to be debilitated.</v>

1496
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1497
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1498
00:38:29.061 --> 00:38:33.800
<v Speaker 1>almost all of the players that take a lot of hits suffer from serious injuries</v>

1499
00:38:33.801 --> 00:38:34.910
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of their lives.</v>

1500
00:38:34.911 --> 00:38:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1501
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're young and you're looking at your future,</v>

1502
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.601
<v Speaker 1>go and look,</v>

1503
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I could put all my energy into this and you know,</v>

1504
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:41.920
<v Speaker 1>be a mess.</v>

1505
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Or I can say,</v>

1506
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:43.480
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1507
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm still young.</v>

1508
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm 23.</v>

1509
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I could do anything I want.</v>

1510
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:47.021
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1511
00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:47.201
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1512
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I've been in the NFL,</v>

1513
00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1514
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I've experienced it.</v>

1515
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Let me just get the fuck out of here.</v>

1516
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1517
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.593
<v Speaker 1>Go try something else.</v>

1518
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.230
<v Speaker 2>She worried that the future of the sport is going,</v>

1519
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.780
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a big socioeconomic divide.</v>

1520
00:38:57.781 --> 00:38:59.040
<v Speaker 2>We're the only people who,</v>

1521
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.460
<v Speaker 2>who really want to play and are willing to take that risk are people who feel</v>

1522
00:39:02.461 --> 00:39:03.630
<v Speaker 2>like they have nothing to lose.</v>

1523
00:39:03.631 --> 00:39:04.464
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1524
00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:04.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1525
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.740
<v Speaker 1>we just stat and there's the people that want to watch it.</v>

1526
00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:08.381
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>

1527
00:39:08.381 --> 00:39:10.080
<v Speaker 1>we've experienced that with the UFC too.</v>

1528
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.273
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1529
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people that want to watch the,</v>

1530
00:39:14.311 --> 00:39:15.390
<v Speaker 1>the head injuries that just,</v>

1531
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.830
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what they're seeing yet.</v>

1532
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.150
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand.</v>

1533
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.313
<v Speaker 1>Like when you,</v>

1534
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.990
<v Speaker 1>you watch somebody get kol like really badly,</v>

1535
00:39:21.991 --> 00:39:24.930
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone get head kicked or no dropped in their head or something</v>

1536
00:39:24.931 --> 00:39:25.590
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1537
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:25.861
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1538
00:39:25.861 --> 00:39:26.910

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1551
00:39:33.511 --> 00:39:34.170
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch,</v>

1552
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:38.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch fights either for the same reason when I have friends who are so</v>

1553
00:39:38.281 --> 00:39:39.210
<v Speaker 2>into it and,</v>

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1563
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:48.023
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1564
00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:48.571
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1565
00:39:48.571 --> 00:39:53.520
<v Speaker 2>you admire people's ability to be so good at this.</v>

1566
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:54.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1567
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.880
<v Speaker 2>this thing that we've created to test human potential.</v>

1568
00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:57.750
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1569
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:58.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1570
00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:59.573
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1571
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:05.070
<v Speaker 2>if I've sort of started drifting to sports where there's fewer concussions,</v>

1572
00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:05.281
<v Speaker 2>although,</v>

1573
00:40:05.281 --> 00:40:05.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1574
00:40:05.491 --> 00:40:09.780
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a big tennis fan and one of the big stars just got a concussion this</v>

1575
00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.710
<v Speaker 2>weekend at the u s open,</v>

1576
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.320

1585
00:40:24.571 --> 00:40:27.900
<v Speaker 2>practice with her sunglasses on the hoodie pulled up and she just has that,</v>

1591
00:40:36.151 --> 00:40:37.800
<v Speaker 2>she's not thinking clearly,</v>

1592
00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:38.760
<v Speaker 2>but you can see her.</v>

1593
00:40:38.761 --> 00:40:39.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1594
00:40:39.001 --> 00:40:40.980
<v Speaker 2>she's like a shell of herself.</v>

00:40:47.691 --> 00:40:49.130
<v Speaker 2>you have to get super better,</v>

1604
00:40:49.131 --> 00:40:49.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1605
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:51.070
<v Speaker 1>finish their clinical trial.</v>

1606
00:40:51.071 --> 00:40:51.904
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

1607
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1608
00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:53.831
<v Speaker 1>be better,</v>

1609
00:40:53.831 --> 00:40:54.830
<v Speaker 1>but what is super better,</v>

1610
00:40:54.831 --> 00:40:55.410
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1611
00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:56.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1612
00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1613
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.731
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

1614
00:40:57.731 --> 00:40:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

1615
00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 2>I do want to reach out because,</v>

1616
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1617
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.990
<v Speaker 2>because I know how hard it was and how,</v>

1618
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:04.240
<v Speaker 2>how so few people,</v>

1619
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.133
<v Speaker 2>I mean just the,</v>

1620
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.700
<v Speaker 2>the general public conversation about this is not caught up to kind of the</v>

1621
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:12.430
<v Speaker 2>reality of what people experience</v>

1622
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.241
<v Speaker 1>well that uh,</v>

1623
00:41:13.241 --> 00:41:14.260
<v Speaker 1>those ice baths,</v>

1624
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:15.200
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1625
00:41:15.201 --> 00:41:16.330
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems with that,</v>

1626
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.350
<v Speaker 1>that form of cold therapy is that you get out in your legs like rubber.</v>

1627
00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1628
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.900
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1629
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.960
<v Speaker 1>everything's not working so good.</v>

1630
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.600
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can't do that stuff and then work out.</v>

1631
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:26.021
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1632
00:41:26.021 --> 00:41:26.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1633
00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:29.680
<v Speaker 1>to some forms of cold therapy that you can do and you can work out after it,</v>

1634
00:41:29.681 --> 00:41:30.910
<v Speaker 1>but not those ice pass.</v>

1635
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I have done,</v>

1636
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.240
<v Speaker 2>I run marathons.</v>

1637
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.530
<v Speaker 2>I have done some ice bath and I've,</v>

1638
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:36.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1639
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:36.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1640
00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:38.780
<v Speaker 2>have you ever done the whole body cryotherapy?</v>

1641
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:42.320
<v Speaker 2>We stepped in the chamber and you go to 250 degrees below zero for three</v>

1642
00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:43.070
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

1643
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:43.903
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

1644
00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1645
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.610
<v Speaker 2>it's the best body element.</v>

1646
00:41:46.611 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Like do you kind of,</v>

1647
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.140
<v Speaker 2>is there like a mental state that is changed?</v>

1648
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:51.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1649
00:41:51.851 --> 00:41:52.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1650
00:41:52.001 --> 00:41:53.920
<v Speaker 1>your brain produces something called neoprene,</v>

1651
00:41:53.921 --> 00:41:54.754
<v Speaker 1>Nefron,</v>

1652
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.740
<v Speaker 1>cold shock proteins and all these different things happen when you hit minus one</v>

1653
00:41:59.741 --> 00:42:01.210
<v Speaker 1>50 degrees below zero.</v>

1654
00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:02.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1655
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:03.521
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1656
00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:05.800
<v Speaker 1>there's also the something that someone just invented,</v>

1657
00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the reserve brought this up,</v>

1658
00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.800
<v Speaker 1>something called a cryo helmet.</v>

1659
00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Like you put it on over your head.</v>

1660
00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like a gel pack thing.</v>

1661
00:42:13.001 --> 00:42:13.421
<v Speaker 1>Like a,</v>

1662
00:42:13.421 --> 00:42:17.300
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a Hoodie and you put it on and it's like they,</v>

1663
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:20.320
<v Speaker 1>they really recommend it for people that have had head injuries,</v>

1664
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.080
<v Speaker 1>sort of reduction in swelling.</v>

1665
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:23.531
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1666
00:42:23.531 --> 00:42:23.800
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

1667
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could see that if you're trying to treat the inflammation.</v>

1668
00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:26.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1669
00:42:26.351 --> 00:42:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like a whole thing.</v>

1670
00:42:27.971 --> 00:42:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Like I got like a frozen helmet,</v>

1671
00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:30.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1672
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:31.180
<v Speaker 2>he goes a little gel packs.</v>

1673
00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I took one of those.</v>

1674
00:42:32.351 --> 00:42:33.970
<v Speaker 2>But it's a helmet on your head.</v>

1675
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I will of course I'm going to say no.</v>

1676
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.130
<v Speaker 2>You got to pull up like Google scholar though.</v>

1677
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.023
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

1678
00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I want to see like is there any literature on this yet?</v>

1679
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1680
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.400
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm,</v>

1681
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.410
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like hold up.</v>

1682
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.653
<v Speaker 2>I don't pull it.</v>

1683
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm fairly conservative with telling other people what to do.</v>

1684
00:42:50.171 --> 00:42:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Like for myself,</v>

1685
00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:51.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1686
00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1687
00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:52.511
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1688
00:42:52.511 --> 00:42:53.344
<v Speaker 2>I'll make a game.</v>

1689
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:55.000
<v Speaker 2>But for telling other people to do,</v>

1690
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1691
00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.540
<v Speaker 2>wait until there's a peer reviewed paper for sure.</v>

1692
00:42:59.110 --> 00:42:59.801
<v Speaker 2>But fighters,</v>

1693
00:42:59.801 --> 00:42:59.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1694
00:42:59.981 --> 00:43:03.190
<v Speaker 2>bas Rutten who's a former UFC heavyweight champion,</v>

1695
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.050
<v Speaker 2>great fighter was talking about that.</v>

1696
00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:05.600
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

1697
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.311
<v Speaker 2>that's important.</v>

1698
00:43:06.311 --> 00:43:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Like when guys get hit to ice their head after it's over,</v>

1699
00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:11.530
<v Speaker 2>and he in his rationale was like,</v>

1700
00:43:11.531 --> 00:43:11.681
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1701
00:43:11.681 --> 00:43:12.401
<v Speaker 2>if you hurt your knee,</v>

1702
00:43:12.401 --> 00:43:13.240
<v Speaker 2>what's the first thing they do?</v>

1703
00:43:13.241 --> 00:43:13.901
<v Speaker 2>They put ice on it.</v>

1704
00:43:13.901 --> 00:43:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you put ice on your head?</v>

1705
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:15.761
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1706
00:43:15.761 --> 00:43:17.470
<v Speaker 2>that actually makes a lot of sense.</v>

1707
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1708
00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:18.050
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1709
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.671
<v Speaker 2>that's really interesting.</v>

1710
00:43:18.671 --> 00:43:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I was just reading about,</v>

1711
00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1712
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.240
<v Speaker 2>you probably know this,</v>

1713
00:43:22.241 --> 00:43:24.700
<v Speaker 2>they say like five minutes after you stopped breathing,</v>

1714
00:43:24.701 --> 00:43:26.770
<v Speaker 2>supposedly you have like brain cell death.</v>

1715
00:43:26.771 --> 00:43:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard this?</v>

1716
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.830
<v Speaker 2>If somebody who's drowned and you can't get them breathing again in five</v>

1717
00:43:29.831 --> 00:43:30.360
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

1718
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.193
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1719
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.240
<v Speaker 2>then supposedly it's too late and they're now finding that if you cool down the</v>

1720
00:43:37.091 --> 00:43:39.310
<v Speaker 2>body and the brain that they can come back.</v>

1721
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:41.620
<v Speaker 2>You can be not breathing,</v>

1722
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:42.370
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1723
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1724
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:43.810
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>

1725
00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:46.240
<v Speaker 2>heart beating for more than five minutes.</v>

1726
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Now if you get the body temperature so enough,</v>

1727
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:49.443
<v Speaker 2>pack them with ice.</v>

1728
00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.160
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing now they're starting to do that.</v>

1729
00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like a first,</v>

1730
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.813
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1731
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.011
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1732
00:43:54.011 --> 00:43:54.371
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

1733
00:43:54.371 --> 00:43:55.121
<v Speaker 2>I was just telling my husband,</v>

1734
00:43:55.121 --> 00:43:55.361
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1735
00:43:55.361 --> 00:43:56.080
<v Speaker 2>we need to,</v>

1736
00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.190
<v Speaker 2>we need you to read this literature.</v>

1737
00:43:57.191 --> 00:44:00.340
<v Speaker 2>So cause I want to know if I'm supposed to do this or wait until like the EMT</v>

1738
00:44:00.341 --> 00:44:00.820
<v Speaker 2>shows how,</v>

1739
00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:01.810
<v Speaker 2>like if something happens,</v>

1740
00:44:01.811 --> 00:44:04.570
<v Speaker 2>should I start packing ice or,</v>

1741
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:05.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1742
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.073
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

1743
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1744
00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm not actually sure if the practical implications of this.</v>

1745
00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.370
<v Speaker 2>As you get older you realize more and more hell damn vulnerable people are so</v>

1746
00:44:15.371 --> 00:44:16.630
<v Speaker 2>physically vulnerable.</v>

1747
00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1748
00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Well this is really interesting because you know,</v>

1749
00:44:18.551 --> 00:44:19.384
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1750
00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:20.860
<v Speaker 2>in doing what I do,</v>

1751
00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I have confronted a lot of skepticism and I would even say,</v>

1752
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean people who are really quite sarcastic,</v>

1753
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.140
<v Speaker 2>but they hear about this,</v>

1754
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:29.741
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1755
00:44:29.741 --> 00:44:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to adopt a secret identity.</v>

1756
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.000
<v Speaker 2>It's going to make me not depressed.</v>

1757
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1758
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.080
<v Speaker 2>usually it's people not suffering from depression who say this.</v>

1759
00:44:36.081 --> 00:44:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you're really suffering from something debilitating,</v>

1760
00:44:39.511 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 2>like clinical depression,</v>

1761
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:41.100
<v Speaker 2>you will try anything.</v>

1762
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.990
<v Speaker 2>So the people who are pretty happy and healthy and they'll,</v>

1763
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Speaker 2>they'll say this,</v>

1764
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:46.260
<v Speaker 2>it sounds ridiculous.</v>

1765
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1766
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:47.640
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1767
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.200
<v Speaker 2>but you're talking about bloggers,</v>

1768
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:50.063
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1769
00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1770
00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:50.930
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1771
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:51.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1772
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:51.541
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1773
00:44:51.541 --> 00:44:54.480
<v Speaker 2>And The New Yorker just ran a big giant piece,</v>

1774
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1775
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:55.470
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1776
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:56.520
<v Speaker 2>about super better,</v>

1777
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.593
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1778
00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:58.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1779
00:44:58.770 --> 00:44:59.400
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1780
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1781
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:04.650
<v Speaker 2>it was both positive but also like still this sounds kind of ridiculous.</v>

1782
00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Well it does sound ridiculous,</v>

1783
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:07.590
<v Speaker 2>but then it's like,</v>

1784
00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:07.771
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1785
00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:09.330
<v Speaker 2>can work and sound ridiculous.</v>

1786
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.171
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1787
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:10.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it's like,</v>

1788
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1789
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1790
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1791
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.720
<v Speaker 2>when you realize how vulnerable people are and how much is out of our control,</v>

1792
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean those are the people who are the first in line to try this and who</v>

1793
00:45:21.811 --> 00:45:22.530
<v Speaker 2>benefit the most.</v>

1794
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.980
<v Speaker 2>So we had half a million people play an electronic version,</v>

1795
00:45:25.981 --> 00:45:29.400
<v Speaker 2>like logging their power ups and they're bad guys and quest so that I could get</v>

1796
00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:32.310
<v Speaker 2>data on it and see what are the most effective power ups.</v>

1797
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Like how often do you have to,</v>

1798
00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1799
00:45:34.111 --> 00:45:34.950
<v Speaker 2>check in to,</v>

1800
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:35.803
<v Speaker 2>to get better.</v>

1801
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.950
<v Speaker 2>And we found that people with the,</v>

1802
00:45:37.951 --> 00:45:42.240
<v Speaker 2>which is the most painful and difficult situations where the ones that were</v>

1803
00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:43.890
<v Speaker 2>benefiting the most,</v>

1804
00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like sort of the more you realize how vulnerable you are,</v>

1805
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:50.580
<v Speaker 2>the more open you are and the more this kind of concrete,</v>

1806
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:51.781
<v Speaker 2>purposeful,</v>

1807
00:45:51.781 --> 00:45:55.410
<v Speaker 2>positive action can actually make a big difference.</v>

1808
00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:56.870
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1809
00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:57.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1810
00:45:57.141 --> 00:45:59.370
<v Speaker 1>once you feel the vulnerability you,</v>

1811
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1812
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.863
<v Speaker 1>cause it'd be,</v>

1813
00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.450
<v Speaker 1>it becomes real.</v>

1814
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Whereas when you look at someone who has a broken leg and you go,</v>

1815
00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:06.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1816
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I can intellectually understand that that person broke their leg,</v>

1817
00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.190
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what it feels like.</v>

1818
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1819
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:14.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1820
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.380
<v Speaker 1>if you've never broken your leg,</v>

1821
00:46:15.381 --> 00:46:16.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't know that feeling.</v>

1822
00:46:16.371 --> 00:46:16.670
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1823
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:17.000
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1824
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:17.481
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1825
00:46:17.481 --> 00:46:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't even stand on this stupid thing.</v>

1826
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

1827
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.170
<v Speaker 1>that feeling where like,</v>

1828
00:46:21.171 --> 00:46:21.411
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1829
00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:21.841
<v Speaker 1>now what?</v>

1830
00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:22.670
<v Speaker 1>What do I have to do?</v>

1831
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:23.271
<v Speaker 1>What do I have to do?</v>

1832
00:46:23.271 --> 00:46:23.871
<v Speaker 1>Tom would have to do,</v>

1833
00:46:23.871 --> 00:46:25.280
<v Speaker 1>and then the reality changes.</v>

1834
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:25.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1835
00:46:25.671 --> 00:46:30.671
<v Speaker 1>And the reality of you having that head trauma and trying to figure out like,</v>

1836
00:46:31.341 --> 00:46:33.560
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be a way to get out of the swamp,</v>

1837
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.150
<v Speaker 1>this mental swamp.</v>

1838
00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.510
<v Speaker 1>And I'm stuck in a let's fucking make a game.</v>

1839
00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Like let's do it.</v>

1840
00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:40.083
<v Speaker 1>You like you're just,</v>

1841
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1842
00:46:41.151 --> 00:46:42.110
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense to me.</v>

1843
00:46:42.111 --> 00:46:45.980
<v Speaker 1>It be a person has been through a bunch of surgeries and injuries and stuff.</v>

1844
00:46:45.981 --> 00:46:50.320
<v Speaker 1>It totally makes sense to me because there's a reality that every time I've</v>

1845
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.650
<v Speaker 1>really badly injured myself,</v>

1846
00:46:51.651 --> 00:46:53.200
<v Speaker 1>like where I needed knee surgery or something,</v>

1847
00:46:53.201 --> 00:46:54.034
<v Speaker 1>there's like a,</v>

1848
00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.000
<v Speaker 1>just an acceptance just goes,</v>

1849
00:46:56.001 --> 00:46:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

1850
00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.073
<v Speaker 1>let's just go do it.</v>

1851
00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's go do it because now this thing's broken.</v>

1852
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.950
<v Speaker 1>And until that happens,</v>

1853
00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:01.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of people will tell you,</v>

1854
00:47:01.851 --> 00:47:02.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1855
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:03.380
<v Speaker 1>once you try rehabbing it,</v>

1856
00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:04.580
<v Speaker 1>why don't you try doing this?</v>

1857
00:47:04.581 --> 00:47:04.731
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1858
00:47:04.731 --> 00:47:05.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1859
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1860
00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you get it.</v>

1861
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.340
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1862
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.920
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of times you'll have an injury and you won't know if it will get</v>

1863
00:47:09.921 --> 00:47:10.670
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1864
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1865
00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.180
<v Speaker 2>W W if you'll be able to get back to what you were doing before,</v>

1866
00:47:14.181 --> 00:47:18.800
<v Speaker 2>which is actually where the name super better comes from because I wasn't sure I</v>

1867
00:47:18.801 --> 00:47:22.190
<v Speaker 2>would ever have the same cognitive capabilities I had.</v>

1868
00:47:22.191 --> 00:47:22.401
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1869
00:47:22.401 --> 00:47:22.821
<v Speaker 2>at that time,</v>

1870
00:47:22.821 --> 00:47:23.320
<v Speaker 2>I was using,</v>

1871
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:23.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1872
00:47:23.481 --> 00:47:24.230
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1873
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1874
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:25.730
<v Speaker 2>I had just gotten my phd,</v>

1875
00:47:25.731 --> 00:47:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I was doing research.</v>

1876
00:47:26.931 --> 00:47:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1877
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:28.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1878
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I was to being able to have an intellectual profession.</v>

1879
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1880
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:34.270
<v Speaker 2>and so I,</v>

1881
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.781
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like,</v>

1882
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 2>get better soon.</v>

1883
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1884
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1885
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:37.541
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

1886
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 2>That means get back to who you were before this happened.</v>

1887
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:45.700
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't know if I would ever be able to do any of that again.</v>

1888
00:47:45.701 --> 00:47:46.091
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>

1889
00:47:46.091 --> 00:47:46.181
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1890
00:47:46.181 --> 00:47:47.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get better.</v>

1891
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get super better.</v>

1892
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll just be different.</v>

1893
00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like this new super version of myself,</v>

1894
00:47:52.061 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 2>like Spiderman.</v>

1895
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:53.441
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1896
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:53.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1897
00:47:53.741 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 2>he got bit by the radioactive spider and this concussions,</v>

1898
00:47:56.681 --> 00:47:57.790
<v Speaker 2>my radioactive spider,</v>

1899
00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:59.080
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know who I'm going to be,</v>

1900
00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:01.060
<v Speaker 2>but it'll be someone different.</v>

1901
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:01.811
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1902
00:48:01.811 --> 00:48:02.141
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1903
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 2>and instead of just trying to,</v>

1904
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1905
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.700
<v Speaker 2>because anytime you're having an injury or an illness,</v>

1906
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 2>you don't know who you're going to be at the end of it.</v>

1907
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.050
<v Speaker 2>He might be back to normal.</v>

1908
00:48:11.051 --> 00:48:14.440
<v Speaker 2>It might be different and you want it to be the best different that it could be.</v>

1909
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:14.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1910
00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:18.340
<v Speaker 1>There's been many stories of people that have gotten knocked in the head and all</v>

1911
00:48:18.341 --> 00:48:21.430
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden had musical house mathematical talent.</v>

1912
00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1913
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:22.840
<v Speaker 1>What are you hoping that that was going to</v>

1914
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.000
<v Speaker 2>the weirdest experience?</v>

1915
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1916
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:29.260
<v Speaker 2>so I'm a very introverted person by nature.</v>

1917
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1918
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:30.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1919
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.590
<v Speaker 2>like if my phone rings,</v>

1920
00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:33.401
<v Speaker 2>I won't answer it.</v>

1921
00:48:33.401 --> 00:48:35.530
<v Speaker 2>Like even if you're my friend or like your mind mom,</v>

1922
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:35.951
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1923
00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:36.041
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1924
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:37.270
<v Speaker 2>it's too much social interaction.</v>

1925
00:48:37.271 --> 00:48:38.021
<v Speaker 2>Like I get anxiety,</v>

1926
00:48:38.021 --> 00:48:38.854
<v Speaker 2>I can't answer it.</v>

1927
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1928
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1929
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:41.740
<v Speaker 2>that's been like my whole life.</v>

1930
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.550
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1931
00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:43.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1932
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.650
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1933
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:44.321
<v Speaker 2>what we know about,</v>

1934
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:46.060
<v Speaker 2>like the difference between introverts and extroverts,</v>

1935
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:49.960
<v Speaker 2>introverts tend to stimulate themselves with internal thinking.</v>

1936
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.440
<v Speaker 2>They're always,</v>

1937
00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.820
<v Speaker 2>they're always thinking and they don't need other people to kind of get them</v>

1938
00:48:54.821 --> 00:48:55.654
<v Speaker 2>excited.</v>

1939
00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Extroverts respond much more positively to external stimulation.</v>

1940
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.553
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

1941
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're just primed.</v>

1942
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 2>If they see someone smiling at them,</v>

1943
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:05.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like a cocaine hit,</v>

1944
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:06.280
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1945
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.590
<v Speaker 2>So when I had the injury I couldn't think to myself anymore.</v>

1946
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.640
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't like entertain myself with my own thoughts.</v>

1947
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:17.700
<v Speaker 2>And I became like this super extroverted person and I started like calling</v>

1948
00:49:17.771 --> 00:49:19.180
<v Speaker 2>everybody in my phone,</v>

1949
00:49:19.181 --> 00:49:22.120
<v Speaker 2>like contact lists in which people I would never,</v>

1950
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean we wouldn't even pick up the phone and I'm like,</v>

1951
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.380
<v Speaker 2>please talk to me cause I couldn't,</v>

1952
00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:29.020
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't literally cannot be an introvert anymore.</v>

1953
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.860
<v Speaker 2>But that only lasted for like a couple months and then my surgeon to get better.</v>

1954
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.070
<v Speaker 2>I went back to being introverted and I still,</v>

1955
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.300
<v Speaker 2>today I,</v>

1956
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I try to keep some of that because I actually discovered,</v>

1957
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:42.030
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1958
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.330
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1959
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I really like,</v>

1960
00:49:43.331 --> 00:49:44.410
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to talk to people.</v>

1961
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:47.170
<v Speaker 2>He does not actually a burden,</v>

1962
00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1963
00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:48.290
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1964
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.850
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

1965
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:49.390
<v Speaker 2>so that was,</v>

1966
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:49.960
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

1967
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.880
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the sort of super better,</v>

1968
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1969
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:54.650
<v Speaker 2>changes for me is I realize and they were,</v>

1970
00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:55.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1971
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:56.830
<v Speaker 2>we know from psychological literature,</v>

1972
00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:59.170
<v Speaker 2>extroverts really are happier.</v>

1973
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.250
<v Speaker 2>They live longer,</v>

1974
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:01.510
<v Speaker 2>they're psychologically healthier.</v>

1975
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:02.080
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1976
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.660
<v Speaker 2>if you can convince yourself to be social,</v>

1977
00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1978
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:06.370
<v Speaker 2>it's really good for you.</v>

1979
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1980
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.830
<v Speaker 2>the introverts just so have a different brain chemistry.</v>

1981
00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:09.950
<v Speaker 2>So their brains telling them,</v>

1982
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:10.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1983
00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.160
<v Speaker 2>two people scary.</v>

1984
00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1985
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:12.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1986
00:50:12.851 --> 00:50:13.840
<v Speaker 2>too much stimulation.</v>

1987
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:14.441
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1988
00:50:14.441 --> 00:50:15.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1989
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the,</v>

1990
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.790
<v Speaker 1>one of the weirdest things about online interaction is it,</v>

1991
00:50:18.791 --> 00:50:23.791
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a combination of both introvert behavior and extrovert bay.</v>

1992
00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Cause even though you are interacting with people,</v>

1993
00:50:26.201 --> 00:50:27.530
<v Speaker 1>you're not seeing no,</v>

1994
00:50:27.531 --> 00:50:28.370
<v Speaker 1>it's controlled</v>

1995
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:28.960
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1996
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:29.390
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1997
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:33.350
<v Speaker 2>it's the face to face can be really a daunting.</v>

1998
00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1999
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2000
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:35.781
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd like the,</v>

2001
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:36.614
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

2002
00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.810
<v Speaker 2>the energy that it takes.</v>

2003
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2004
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:40.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not,</v>

2005
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:41.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same thing as being,</v>

2006
00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:42.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2007
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.640
<v Speaker 2>just cause you're introvert doesn't mean you're,</v>

2008
00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:44.420
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

2009
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.100
<v Speaker 2>like socially unable.</v>

2010
00:50:46.101 --> 00:50:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2011
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2012
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:47.240
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

2013
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.080
<v Speaker 2>you're not a misfit.</v>

2014
00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:48.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2015
00:50:48.391 --> 00:50:49.170
<v Speaker 1>obviously you,</v>

2016
00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:52.200
<v Speaker 1>you're very capable of keeping a regular conversation going.</v>

2017
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.453
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2018
00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2019
00:50:54.091 --> 00:50:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

2020
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Then you can say you're an introvert,</v>

2021
00:50:56.701 --> 00:50:57.900
<v Speaker 1>but you're easily,</v>

2022
00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:58.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2023
00:50:58.321 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 1>you're easy.</v>

2024
00:50:58.850 --> 00:50:59.091
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2025
00:50:59.091 --> 00:50:59.281
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2026
00:50:59.281 --> 00:50:59.611
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2027
00:50:59.611 --> 00:51:00.271
<v Speaker 1>you're just talking.</v>

2028
00:51:00.271 --> 00:51:00.931
<v Speaker 1>No problems.</v>

2029
00:51:00.931 --> 00:51:01.490
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>

2030
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2031
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I've had some introverts on this podcast before,</v>

2032
00:51:03.691 --> 00:51:05.010
<v Speaker 1>and then it's obvious.</v>

2033
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:05.850
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2034
00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:06.800
<v Speaker 1>everything's an effort.</v>

2035
00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2036
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:08.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2037
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.460
<v Speaker 2>It's probably more of an effort for me than it looks.</v>

2038
00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2039
00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.660
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's more of an effort for everybody then it looks,</v>

2040
00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:14.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a good point.</v>

2041
00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:15.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2042
00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that I'm just,</v>

2043
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:22.400
<v Speaker 1>one of the issues with online interaction is that you don't see the people and</v>

2044
00:51:22.451 --> 00:51:22.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2045
00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:23.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2046
00:51:23.021 --> 00:51:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

2047
00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.213
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

2048
00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.220
<v Speaker 1>my intention is it's kind of ambiguous.</v>

2049
00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:27.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2050
00:51:27.731 --> 00:51:31.060
<v Speaker 1>like you're write something or you put something out there and it's a,</v>

2051
00:51:31.061 --> 00:51:32.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not completely clear.</v>

2052
00:51:32.501 --> 00:51:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Like if you say something,</v>

2053
00:51:34.301 --> 00:51:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I get the tone.</v>

2054
00:51:35.831 --> 00:51:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I can tell if you're being sarcastic.</v>

2055
00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:38.920
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2056
00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:39.250
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2057
00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:39.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2058
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:39.941
<v Speaker 1>if someone,</v>

2059
00:51:39.941 --> 00:51:41.260
<v Speaker 1>if you say something mean to me,</v>

2060
00:51:41.261 --> 00:51:42.430
<v Speaker 1>like we have to look at each other,</v>

2061
00:51:42.431 --> 00:51:42.671
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2062
00:51:42.671 --> 00:51:43.504
<v Speaker 1>fucking really?</v>

2063
00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2064
00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Like in this weird thing to it.</v>

2065
00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you do that online,</v>

2066
00:51:47.621 --> 00:51:48.640
<v Speaker 1>there's like none of that.</v>

2067
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2068
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's,</v>

2069
00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:55.420
<v Speaker 1>there's something very strange that's going on in our culture right now with so</v>

2070
00:51:55.421 --> 00:52:00.310
<v Speaker 1>many people spending a giant amount of their time only interacting with people</v>

2071
00:52:00.311 --> 00:52:01.150
<v Speaker 1>through text.</v>

2072
00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2073
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the areas of research that I was diving into.</v>

2074
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:06.721
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2075
00:52:06.721 --> 00:52:06.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2076
00:52:06.901 --> 00:52:09.330
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't just know research brain injury stuff,</v>

2077
00:52:09.331 --> 00:52:14.331
<v Speaker 2>I typically research video games and how they change how we feel and think and</v>

2078
00:52:14.671 --> 00:52:14.941
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>

2079
00:52:14.941 --> 00:52:16.440
<v Speaker 2>And what does that mean you're punched in?</v>

2080
00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:19.260
<v Speaker 2>The field is called performance studies.</v>

2081
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:23.730
<v Speaker 2>So I was just basically studying how people perform,</v>

2082
00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:24.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2083
00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:26.730
<v Speaker 2>in video games and as a result of video games,</v>

2084
00:52:26.731 --> 00:52:28.860
<v Speaker 2>sort of collaboration skills,</v>

2085
00:52:28.861 --> 00:52:30.810
<v Speaker 2>they're sort of psychological performance,</v>

2086
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:31.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2087
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.440
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

2088
00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:32.700
<v Speaker 2>At,</v>

2089
00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.100
<v Speaker 2>at Uc Berkeley it was where I studied.</v>

2090
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:36.263
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2091
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.760
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things that we know that's happening in video games is that</v>

2092
00:52:38.761 --> 00:52:41.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a really big difference between playing a video game in the same room</v>

2093
00:52:41.551 --> 00:52:44.370
<v Speaker 2>with somebody and playing online.</v>

2094
00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:48.930
<v Speaker 2>And so like if we're playing call of duty and I'm trying to kill you and if</v>

2095
00:52:48.931 --> 00:52:50.250
<v Speaker 2>we're playing in the same room,</v>

2096
00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:54.090
<v Speaker 2>we actually undergo really great,</v>

2097
00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:54.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2098
00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:55.380
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of,</v>

2099
00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.640
<v Speaker 2>they call it synchronization.</v>

2100
00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:57.750
<v Speaker 2>So our heart rates,</v>

2101
00:52:57.751 --> 00:52:59.850
<v Speaker 2>we'll sync up our breathing rates,</v>

2102
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:00.690
<v Speaker 2>sing GAAP,</v>

2103
00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:04.740
<v Speaker 2>we get it's kind of mirror neuron in process going on where it's like blood flow</v>

2104
00:53:04.741 --> 00:53:06.900
<v Speaker 2>is mirroring where it's flowing.</v>

2105
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.960
<v Speaker 2>The patterns of activation are mirroring each other and all of that is</v>

2106
00:53:09.961 --> 00:53:12.450
<v Speaker 2>associated with more compassion,</v>

2107
00:53:12.451 --> 00:53:13.171
<v Speaker 2>more empathy.</v>

2108
00:53:13.171 --> 00:53:14.010
<v Speaker 2>We like each other more.</v>

2109
00:53:14.011 --> 00:53:14.970
<v Speaker 2>We trust each other more,</v>

2110
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.410
<v Speaker 2>even if the game is violent,</v>

2111
00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.550
<v Speaker 2>even if we're competing.</v>

2112
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2113
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.010
<v Speaker 2>all of this happens and it happens because,</v>

2114
00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:20.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2115
00:53:20.221 --> 00:53:22.380
<v Speaker 2>when you were playing a game with or against someone,</v>

2116
00:53:22.381 --> 00:53:24.900
<v Speaker 2>you have to try to get in their brain like what are they going to do next?</v>

2117
00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:25.411
<v Speaker 2>What's next?</v>

2118
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Move.</v>

2119
00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2120
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:29.430
<v Speaker 2>and so your brain starts to mirror what you think they're doing.</v>

2121
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's this,</v>

2122
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 2>it's this really intense mind body mirroring that goes on.</v>

2123
00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:37.000
<v Speaker 1>What triggers the mirroring,</v>

2124
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:39.760
<v Speaker 1>the observance of the character on the screen?</v>

2125
00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2126
00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:40.941
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2127
00:53:40.941 --> 00:53:41.211
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2128
00:53:41.211 --> 00:53:41.760
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2129
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.140
<v Speaker 2>it's because it only works if you're in the same space,</v>

2130
00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:45.200
<v Speaker 2>physical space with them,</v>

2131
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:47.120
<v Speaker 2>but you're still looking at a screen.</v>

2132
00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:47.811
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2133
00:53:47.811 --> 00:53:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Well you're trying to think what are they doing?</v>

2134
00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.370
<v Speaker 2>And there just something about if you're the,</v>

2135
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.480
<v Speaker 2>you may think you're looking at the screen,</v>

2136
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:59.300
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a general awareness,</v>

2137
00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.860
<v Speaker 2>like when you're sitting next to someone,</v>

2138
00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.580
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2139
00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:05.000
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of sort of what's going on and the,</v>

2140
00:54:05.001 --> 00:54:06.350
<v Speaker 2>and cues that you're picking up,</v>

2141
00:54:06.351 --> 00:54:07.520
<v Speaker 2>body language cues.</v>

2142
00:54:07.521 --> 00:54:09.330
<v Speaker 2>And if you'd like turn to look at them,</v>

2143
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.120
<v Speaker 2>you'll even just in a split second,</v>

2144
00:54:11.121 --> 00:54:13.190
<v Speaker 2>you'll get this sort of facial expression queue.</v>

2145
00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:14.413
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2146
00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.970
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't happen in online games.</v>

2147
00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2148
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:18.830
<v Speaker 2>so what we've just been measured.</v>

2149
00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:19.431
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2150
00:54:19.431 --> 00:54:19.581
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2151
00:54:19.581 --> 00:54:20.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2152
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:24.500
<v Speaker 2>So what we've seen is if you take the same game and play it,</v>

2153
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2154
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:26.120
<v Speaker 2>against somebody in the room,</v>

2155
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:28.430
<v Speaker 2>you wind up with these positive impacts,</v>

2156
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2157
00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:29.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2158
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:30.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2159
00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:30.741
<v Speaker 2>more compassion,</v>

2160
00:54:30.741 --> 00:54:31.520
<v Speaker 2>more empathy.</v>

2161
00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.510
<v Speaker 2>You like each other more.</v>

2162
00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.250
<v Speaker 2>If you play the same game online,</v>

2163
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.710
<v Speaker 2>you're not able to see their facial expression.</v>

2164
00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:38.810
<v Speaker 2>You're not able to get the same,</v>

2165
00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:39.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2166
00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.510
<v Speaker 2>sinking phenomenon.</v>

2167
00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:43.910
<v Speaker 2>You actually dehumanize the opponent,</v>

2168
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:44.930
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2169
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:46.250
<v Speaker 2>your testosterone goes up,</v>

2170
00:54:46.251 --> 00:54:48.350
<v Speaker 2>you feel less empathy towards them.</v>

2171
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2172
00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:53.150
<v Speaker 2>and so it's one of the reasons why in the book I talk about how,</v>

2173
00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:53.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2174
00:54:53.521 --> 00:54:57.410
<v Speaker 2>unless you're actively trying to change your personality to be more aggressive</v>

2175
00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.040
<v Speaker 2>and you want to,</v>

2176
00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:58.431
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2177
00:54:58.431 --> 00:55:01.830
<v Speaker 2>for some reason you feel like you want to be kind of more of a have,</v>

2178
00:55:01.831 --> 00:55:02.960
<v Speaker 2>it's like aggressive,</v>

2179
00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.520
<v Speaker 2>hostile personality.</v>

2180
00:55:04.521 --> 00:55:04.701
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

2181
00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:09.701
<v Speaker 2>you should not spend more than half your time trying to beat strangers online</v>

2182
00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:11.053
<v Speaker 2>because of the,</v>

2183
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.440
<v Speaker 2>because it's just not</v>

2184
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:13.793
<v Speaker 1>after times,</v>

2185
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:14.730
<v Speaker 1>a lot of time,</v>

2186
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.140
<v Speaker 1>half your half your gaming time.</v>

2187
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

2188
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:19.290
<v Speaker 1>What are you recommending?</v>

2189
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Speaker 1>24 hours in a day?</v>

2190
00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:21.900
<v Speaker 1>No more than 12 hours.</v>

2191
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:22.943
<v Speaker 1>Killing strangers.</v>

2192
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.421
<v Speaker 1>And it actually,</v>

2193
00:55:23.421 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2194
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:28.610
<v Speaker 2>21 hours a week is where you start to see the benefits of games reduce and</v>

2195
00:55:28.891 --> 00:55:30.120
<v Speaker 2>negative impacts increase.</v>

2196
00:55:30.121 --> 00:55:31.740
<v Speaker 2>So there's another public service announcement.</v>

2197
00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2198
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:33.173
<v Speaker 1>what have you,</v>

2199
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.820
<v Speaker 1>have you done it in layers where you know,</v>

2200
00:55:35.821 --> 00:55:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you like I used to do a land parties.</v>

2201
00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:40.920
<v Speaker 1>My friends used to play quake lan parties.</v>

2202
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2203
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 1>and it's really fun.</v>

2204
00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:42.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2205
00:55:42.791 --> 00:55:43.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of camaraderie and stuff.</v>

2206
00:55:43.921 --> 00:55:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2207
00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:46.710
<v Speaker 1>But if you put a barrier up,</v>

2208
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:47.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2209
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:51.030
<v Speaker 1>But during the same room or if they're in a room that's right next door,</v>

2210
00:55:51.031 --> 00:55:54.420
<v Speaker 1>but you know they're there and may be can hear their voice or if you shut that</v>

2211
00:55:54.421 --> 00:55:55.530
<v Speaker 1>door and you can't hear their voice,</v>

2212
00:55:55.531 --> 00:55:56.850
<v Speaker 1>have you changed?</v>

2213
00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Have they seen like what,</v>

2214
00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.000
<v Speaker 1>what if the mirroring is consistent?</v>

2215
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2216
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:05.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm the studies that I've seen show that you have to be in physical proximity.</v>

2217
00:56:05.821 --> 00:56:09.480
<v Speaker 2>So if there was a barrier and we were unable,</v>

2218
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I was unable to look over and get those cues from your body language or from</v>

2219
00:56:12.841 --> 00:56:16.140
<v Speaker 2>your facial expression that it would not happen.</v>

2220
00:56:16.141 --> 00:56:18.480
<v Speaker 2>How'd your cubicle thing and I can just like reach up.</v>

2221
00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2222
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:19.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2223
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.651
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2224
00:56:19.651 --> 00:56:20.011
<v Speaker 2>Then you,</v>

2225
00:56:20.011 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Speaker 2>then you probably would,</v>

2226
00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:21.840
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

2227
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.150
<v Speaker 2>I liked this idea of this aging.</v>

2228
00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:27.460
<v Speaker 2>The thing I'm really curious about is with twitch and now youtube gaming is if</v>

2229
00:56:27.461 --> 00:56:29.860
<v Speaker 2>you can watch somebody playing and,</v>

2230
00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.750
<v Speaker 2>and now you're seeing their face,</v>

2231
00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2232
00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:34.870
<v Speaker 2>while they're playing a game.</v>

2233
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2234
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:39.730
<v Speaker 2>studies have shown that watching someone play a game that you know how to play</v>

2235
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:43.060
<v Speaker 2>will trigger the same mirror neurons because your brain can kind of emulate,</v>

2236
00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:43.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2237
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:44.591
<v Speaker 2>if you're playing a game,</v>

2238
00:56:44.591 --> 00:56:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to play.</v>

2239
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the controls,</v>

2240
00:56:46.421 --> 00:56:47.254
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the goals.</v>

2241
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.340
<v Speaker 2>My brain will just be like,</v>

2242
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2243
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2244
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.160
<v Speaker 2>If I know how to play the game,</v>

2245
00:56:51.161 --> 00:56:51.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2246
00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:51.820
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2247
00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I know what she's trying to do.</v>

2248
00:56:53.051 --> 00:56:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I know what a strategist.</v>

2249
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2250
00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is,</v>

2251
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.710
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows what to do,</v>

2252
00:56:56.711 --> 00:56:57.460
<v Speaker 2>can away from the ghost.</v>

2253
00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:57.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2254
00:56:57.641 --> 00:56:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2255
00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.870
<v Speaker 2>So one thing I'm interested in is if I can see someone's face,</v>

2256
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2257
00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:03.363
<v Speaker 2>while they're playing the game,</v>

2258
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:04.001
<v Speaker 2>they're playing a game.</v>

2259
00:57:04.001 --> 00:57:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2260
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.860
<v Speaker 2>could you get some of the benefits,</v>

2261
00:57:05.861 --> 00:57:10.420
<v Speaker 2>but it would only be uni directional because if you're like live streaming your</v>

2262
00:57:10.421 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 2>game plan,</v>

2263
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.613
<v Speaker 2>you can't see me.</v>

2264
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:12.390
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2265
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2266
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.020
<v Speaker 2>but it would be interesting since we know that if you get this mirror neuron a</v>

2267
00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:16.740
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>

2268
00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:17.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2269
00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.350
<v Speaker 2>it makes people want to help each other more like each other more.</v>

2270
00:57:20.351 --> 00:57:22.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm like thinking like being a powerful,</v>

2271
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:23.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2272
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:28.260
<v Speaker 2>twitch streamer or youtube game streamer like could make you really cultivate a</v>

2273
00:57:29.171 --> 00:57:31.930
<v Speaker 2>large community of people who really want to help you,</v>

2274
00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.980
<v Speaker 2>which put seems like,</v>

2275
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:36.820
<v Speaker 2>like if I were building an empire of like a new kind of community,</v>

2276
00:57:36.821 --> 00:57:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that would be what I would be building because they would be really,</v>

2277
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:41.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2278
00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.150
<v Speaker 2>it would be like a really tight bond,</v>

2279
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:43.770
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2280
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:44.940
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

2281
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:45.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2282
00:57:45.751 --> 00:57:48.930
<v Speaker 1>this twitch thing has caught a lot of people by surprise because I think a lot,</v>

2283
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:53.130
<v Speaker 1>no one would have ever thought that it would be so popular to watch someone play</v>

2284
00:57:53.131 --> 00:57:53.860
<v Speaker 1>video games.</v>

2285
00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2286
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:57.970
<v Speaker 2>And the mirror neuron thing helps explain it because it's not like watching TV</v>

2287
00:57:57.971 --> 00:57:59.080
<v Speaker 2>where it's just passive.</v>

2288
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:00.730
<v Speaker 2>If you know how to play the game,</v>

2289
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:05.970
<v Speaker 2>your brain starts working to sort of process it and anticipate,</v>

2290
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:06.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2291
00:58:06.461 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 2>what they're gonna do next.</v>

2292
00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Trying to figure out what has,</v>

2293
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.260
<v Speaker 2>what decision lawmaker or where they'll go.</v>

2294
00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2295
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 2>and so you're actually getting a lot of the same stimulation as if you were</v>

2296
00:58:16.331 --> 00:58:17.170
<v Speaker 2>playing the game yourself.</v>

2297
00:58:17.171 --> 00:58:18.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing people don't understand.</v>

2298
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2299
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:20.920
<v Speaker 2>we see this with musicians too.</v>

2300
00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.760
<v Speaker 2>If you know how to play a musical instrument and you watch somebody playing that</v>

2301
00:58:24.761 --> 00:58:25.780
<v Speaker 2>same musical instrument,</v>

2302
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:27.730
<v Speaker 2>your brain starts to,</v>

2303
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2304
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.390
<v Speaker 2>activate as if you are playing it yourself,</v>

2305
00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:33.430
<v Speaker 2>which is why it can be more interesting for,</v>

2306
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2307
00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:34.990
<v Speaker 2>somebody knows how to play the piano,</v>

2308
00:58:34.991 --> 00:58:38.080
<v Speaker 2>to watch someone else play the piano or listen to someone else play the piano</v>

2309
00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.550
<v Speaker 2>versus somebody who doesn't know.</v>

2310
00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.840
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense.</v>

2311
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:41.411
<v Speaker 1>When a,</v>

2312
00:58:41.411 --> 00:58:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I used to play quake,</v>

2313
00:58:42.281 --> 00:58:43.640
<v Speaker 1>we used to watch these uh,</v>

2314
00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:44.523
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2315
00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2316
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:45.031
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

2317
00:58:45.031 --> 00:58:48.640
<v Speaker 1>they call them demos and what it was was a game that they would record.</v>

2318
00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2319
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:50.760
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd see it through a player's eye,</v>

2320
00:58:50.761 --> 00:58:55.360
<v Speaker 1>so you get to see how good a player moves and then it would make you play</v>

2321
00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:55.780
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2322
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:56.240
<v Speaker 1>You would do,</v>

2323
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.820
<v Speaker 1>would play better after you saw that.</v>

2324
00:58:57.850 --> 00:58:58.683
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2325
00:58:58.840 --> 00:58:59.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2326
00:58:59.081 --> 00:59:00.280
<v Speaker 1>They were really popular.</v>

2327
00:59:00.281 --> 00:59:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Like demos were super popular.</v>

2328
00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:05.410
<v Speaker 1>You would download them and you would play them in game like in your game.</v>

2329
00:59:05.411 --> 00:59:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2330
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

2331
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2332
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

2333
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2334
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I was like into counter strike a little bit.</v>

2335
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the case with athletics too.</v>

2336
00:59:12.671 --> 00:59:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2337
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:16.660
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people tell me that when they watch like a really good basketball</v>

2338
00:59:16.661 --> 00:59:19.180
<v Speaker 1>player play that it makes them play better basketball.</v>

2339
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2340
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I know it's the case with pool.</v>

2341
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I played pool and when I watch really good players play,</v>

2342
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:28.250
<v Speaker 1>like I can kind of emulate what they do.</v>

2343
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:31.790
<v Speaker 1>But if I feel like it's not just like copying,</v>

2344
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of tune in.</v>

2345
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:34.021
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2346
00:59:34.021 --> 00:59:34.390
<v Speaker 1>they're good</v>

2347
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:35.770
<v Speaker 2>because your brain is practicing it.</v>

2348
00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2349
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I find that after a grand slam in tennis,</v>

2350
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:42.280
<v Speaker 2>it was because I'll watch me only reason why I'm not watching tennis right now</v>

2351
00:59:42.281 --> 00:59:43.990
<v Speaker 2>is because we're here doing this.</v>

2352
00:59:43.991 --> 00:59:45.100
<v Speaker 2>I like something going on.</v>

2353
00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:46.180
<v Speaker 2>I had the u s open,</v>

2354
00:59:46.181 --> 00:59:50.770
<v Speaker 2>my favorite player is playing like literally right now in your player Joe Willie</v>

2355
00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Tsonga who I named my puppy after.</v>

2356
00:59:52.091 --> 00:59:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I have a dog named the Songa if he's playing right now to get,</v>

2357
00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:56.920
<v Speaker 2>get to the semis.</v>

2358
00:59:57.210 --> 00:59:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2359
00:59:57.730 --> 00:59:59.980
<v Speaker 2>but no spoilers because I'm recording it.</v>

2360
01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2361
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:01.510
<v Speaker 2>but I know that,</v>

2362
01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:04.360
<v Speaker 2>so I'll go like two weeks watching hours and hours of tennis a day.</v>

2363
01:00:04.361 --> 01:00:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Then I go to play tennis and I'm better.</v>

2364
01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm absolutely,</v>

2365
01:00:07.811 --> 01:00:08.380
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2366
01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I see the ball better,</v>

2367
01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I get to it better.</v>

2368
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2369
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm absolutely,</v>

2370
01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:12.590
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

2371
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:16.060
<v Speaker 2>because my brain has spent two weeks mirroring everything.</v>

2372
01:00:16.061 --> 01:00:16.301
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

2373
01:00:16.301 --> 01:00:17.440
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't know how to play,</v>

2374
01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:18.340
<v Speaker 2>if you've never played,</v>

2375
01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.600
<v Speaker 2>your body won't do it.</v>

2376
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.560
<v Speaker 2>So you have to have,</v>

2377
01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:23.610
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a model for,</v>

2378
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:24.360
<v Speaker 2>for this to work.</v>

2379
01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Totally makes sense.</v>

2380
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:25.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2381
01:00:25.801 --> 01:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Because like something like tennis,</v>

2382
01:00:27.061 --> 01:00:32.061
<v Speaker 1>like I've maybe played once in my whole life when I was in my early twenties,</v>

2383
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>so you wouldn't get as much benefit.</v>

2384
01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't get anything because I'm not going to play again.</v>

2385
01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:37.551
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

2386
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have time in the day.</v>

2387
01:00:38.821 --> 01:00:39.654
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

2388
01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand that.</v>

2389
01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense.</v>

2390
01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that probably is the case with pretty much everything that people do.</v>

2391
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why,</v>

2392
01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2393
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>a sense of community amongst people that are all involved in the same sort of</v>

2394
01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:52.150
<v Speaker 1>endeavor.</v>

2395
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>So important because you kind of push each other and inspire each other and also</v>

2396
01:00:56.221 --> 01:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>you kind of feed off of each other.</v>

2397
01:00:58.050 --> 01:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one,</v>

2398
01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>like if we were all comedians,</v>

2399
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe you would have like a certain kind of style that I don't have and I would</v>

2400
01:01:03.721 --> 01:01:04.554
<v Speaker 1>see your style go,</v>

2401
01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:05.011
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2402
01:01:05.011 --> 01:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Jane's got this crazy thing she's doing well,</v>

2403
01:01:06.721 --> 01:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda cool.</v>

2404
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>And then like maybe I would do something that you didn't do and you're like,</v>

2405
01:01:10.441 --> 01:01:15.441
<v Speaker 1>maybe I need to like be more this or me more and sort of tune into how people</v>

2406
01:01:15.481 --> 01:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>are doing to the point where a lot of comics when they're around each other,</v>

2407
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2408
01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:24.410
<v Speaker 1>it becomes an issue sometimes because they kind of mimic each other's personas</v>

2409
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

2410
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.590
<v Speaker 1>or maybe just the cadence.</v>

2411
01:01:26.591 --> 01:01:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2412
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2413
01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Start picking up.</v>

2414
01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:28.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2415
01:01:28.201 --> 01:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named David towl.</v>

2416
01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the funniest guys ever.</v>

2417
01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2418
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>he's got a way of talking that's really fun.</v>

2419
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And when he talks,</v>

2420
01:01:35.851 --> 01:01:40.851
<v Speaker 1>like there's so many young guys that come up that star talking like Dave a towel</v>

2421
01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

2422
01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>it became an issue where there was like all these little,</v>

2423
01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>like Patrice O'Neal Eastcom tell babies.</v>

2424
01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.081
<v Speaker 1>There was all these,</v>

2425
01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:49.141
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2426
01:01:49.141 --> 01:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>tell babies that were running around it.</v>

2427
01:01:50.701 --> 01:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>But it really,</v>

2428
01:01:51.601 --> 01:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>they're just young comics that admire is sorta Kate in.</v>

2429
01:01:55.501 --> 01:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to do it too.</v>

2430
01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And they were like super inspired because they're young and they're just trying</v>

2431
01:01:59.941 --> 01:02:00.511
<v Speaker 1>to make it,</v>

2432
01:02:00.511 --> 01:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>and then to seeing this guy who's this,</v>

2433
01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:02.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2434
01:02:02.371 --> 01:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>like fantastic comedian,</v>

2435
01:02:04.051 --> 01:02:04.884
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2436
01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>and then they don't even realize it,</v>

2437
01:02:06.391 --> 01:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>but they're just adopting it.</v>

2438
01:02:07.501 --> 01:02:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2439
01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2440
01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:08.231
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2441
01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:09.340
<v Speaker 2>that makes perfect sense.</v>

2442
01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:10.174
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2443
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.013
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

2444
01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:11.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2445
01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:12.910
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a template.</v>

2446
01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2447
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Nobody exists in a vacuum.</v>

2448
01:02:14.441 --> 01:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2449
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2450
01:02:14.921 --> 01:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>everybody sort of,</v>

2451
01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

2452
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>everyone influences everyone around to a certain extent.</v>

2453
01:02:20.191 --> 01:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>We all want to believe that we're some rogue independent operator that exists</v>

2454
01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>out in the fringe of society and lives in a fucking wooden house in the woods</v>

2455
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

2456
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:28.523
<v Speaker 1>That sounds nice.</v>

2457
01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:30.421
<v Speaker 1>It sounds nice,</v>

2458
01:02:30.421 --> 01:02:30.811
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

2459
01:02:30.811 --> 01:02:32.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a k it's a creation of fiction.</v>

2460
01:02:32.651 --> 01:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2461
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:33.211
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2462
01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:33.391
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2463
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:33.811
<v Speaker 2>and it's funny,</v>

2464
01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I some of the um,</v>

2465
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:35.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2466
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.511
<v Speaker 2>someone I admire,</v>

2467
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Clive Thompson,</v>

2468
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:40.140
<v Speaker 2>he writes a lot about technology for like wired and your times.</v>

2469
01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:40.671
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2470
01:02:40.671 --> 01:02:42.930
<v Speaker 2>and he had a book out recently about,</v>

2471
01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:43.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2472
01:02:43.081 --> 01:02:44.640
<v Speaker 2>is technology changing our brain.</v>

2473
01:02:44.641 --> 01:02:46.590
<v Speaker 2>And the opening chapter says,</v>

2474
01:02:46.591 --> 01:02:46.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2475
01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:47.700
<v Speaker 2>newsflash,</v>

2476
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.240
<v Speaker 2>everything changes your brain.</v>

2477
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.550
<v Speaker 2>This sentence you just read,</v>

2478
01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:51.750
<v Speaker 2>it changed your rain.</v>

2479
01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2480
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:55.890
<v Speaker 2>So I mean on one hand it's sort of silly to look at research that says,</v>

2481
01:02:55.891 --> 01:02:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2482
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:58.050
<v Speaker 2>games change your brain like this or you know,</v>

2483
01:02:58.051 --> 01:02:59.070
<v Speaker 2>music changed everything like that.</v>

2484
01:02:59.330 --> 01:02:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2485
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:00.750
<v Speaker 2>because everything you do,</v>

2486
01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:05.400
<v Speaker 2>everything you're exposed to changes your rain and you're making a memory or</v>

2487
01:03:05.401 --> 01:03:05.820
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2488
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.680
<v Speaker 2>your sort of activating a pattern.</v>

2489
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2490
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.560
<v Speaker 2>so I mean like even this conversation,</v>

2491
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2492
01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.890
<v Speaker 2>congratulations like you have changed my brain today,</v>

2493
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:16.360
<v Speaker 2>but this is just something to think about,</v>

2494
01:03:16.361 --> 01:03:19.520
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of responsibility and I know how we interact with each other.</v>

2495
01:03:19.521 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2496
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:20.423
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2497
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:20.850
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2498
01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:21.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2499
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the weirdest things about doing a podcast is how many people will</v>

2500
01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 1>tell me after they listened to podcasts for our 500 episodes,</v>

2501
01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.171
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2502
01:03:29.171 --> 01:03:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you changed my life.</v>

2503
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2504
01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2505
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of responsibility,</v>

2506
01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.640
<v Speaker 1>but we really are changing each other's lives.</v>

2507
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:35.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2508
01:03:35.851 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 1>the podcast has changed my life.</v>

2509
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Just being able to talk to all these different people.</v>

2510
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:41.910
<v Speaker 1>It's why it's important not to have dip shits and your life.</v>

2511
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're around people that are just constantly fucking up and</v>

2512
01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:47.760
<v Speaker 1>constantly making the same mistakes over and over again,</v>

2513
01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:50.190
<v Speaker 1>like that pattern affects you too.</v>

2514
01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2515
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 1>That pattern will creep into your mind.</v>

2516
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2517
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.931
<v Speaker 2>Well then say,</v>

2518
01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:54.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2519
01:03:54.351 --> 01:03:54.680
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2520
01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.190
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2521
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:58.380
<v Speaker 2>it's really good to try and yourself with people who inspire you because they,</v>

2522
01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:01.160
<v Speaker 2>they talk about having a cognitive model for behavior change.</v>

2523
01:04:01.161 --> 01:04:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're trying to get better in some way,</v>

2524
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:04.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2525
01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.510
<v Speaker 2>if you can visually,</v>

2526
01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:08.780
<v Speaker 2>if you know somebody who's already done it or doing positive things in their</v>

2527
01:04:08.781 --> 01:04:09.470
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>

2528
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.950
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2529
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:13.550
<v Speaker 2>it requires less energy for your brain to imagine yourself doing it.</v>

2530
01:04:13.551 --> 01:04:13.671
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2531
01:04:13.671 --> 01:04:14.070
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

2532
01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:14.690
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>

2533
01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:17.060
<v Speaker 2>if you're not trying to be anybody who's trying to get healthy or trying to get</v>

2534
01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:18.170
<v Speaker 2>fit or whatever it is,</v>

2535
01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2536
01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:19.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2537
01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.500
<v Speaker 2>it's literally harder to imagine.</v>

2538
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:25.880
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like more exhausting for you to try to imagine yourself getting</v>

2539
01:04:25.881 --> 01:04:26.510
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

2540
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're surrounded by people who are doing it,</v>

2541
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.170
<v Speaker 2>it becomes familiar to your brain.</v>

2542
01:04:30.171 --> 01:04:32.930
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of examples that your brain can call on.</v>

2543
01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:37.520
<v Speaker 2>It literally takes less energy for you to imagine yourself actually doing it.</v>

2544
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:38.810
<v Speaker 2>And weirdly,</v>

2545
01:04:38.811 --> 01:04:41.630
<v Speaker 2>they found at Stanford University using,</v>

2546
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2547
01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.890
<v Speaker 2>like avatars.</v>

2548
01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.820
<v Speaker 2>If you can see an Avatar that is designed to look like you,</v>

2549
01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.920
<v Speaker 2>like doing the sort of things you want to do,</v>

2550
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.341
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2551
01:04:49.341 --> 01:04:49.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2552
01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:50.510
<v Speaker 2>being really physically fit,</v>

2553
01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:51.950
<v Speaker 2>like working out in the game world.</v>

2554
01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:55.850
<v Speaker 2>If you just watch an avatar customer design to look like you doing that,</v>

2555
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:59.030
<v Speaker 2>it lowers the cognitive threshold for you to do it.</v>

2556
01:04:59.031 --> 01:05:01.130
<v Speaker 2>And then you will do more in real life.</v>

2557
01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:01.460
<v Speaker 2>You leave,</v>

2558
01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2559
01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:07.120
<v Speaker 2>you will work out more or you'll spend more time committed to those goals just</v>

2560
01:05:07.581 --> 01:05:11.900
<v Speaker 2>by having watched the sort of mirror version of yourself having done it.</v>

2561
01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating that,</v>

2562
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating because that seems to open up a whole new of possibility for</v>

2563
01:05:18.341 --> 01:05:20.190
<v Speaker 1>people creating virtual realities.</v>

2564
01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2565
01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Like virtual realities where you're,</v>

2566
01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2567
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:27.630
<v Speaker 1>like one of the big things that they say it's an important for progress in</v>

2568
01:05:27.701 --> 01:05:28.491
<v Speaker 1>sports and,</v>

2569
01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.520
<v Speaker 1>and in pretty much anything is visualization.</v>

2570
01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Visualize yourself doing things.</v>

2571
01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a big thing with martial arts.</v>

2572
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:34.341
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2573
01:05:34.341 --> 01:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2574
01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>take a lot of fighters.</v>

2575
01:05:35.411 --> 01:05:35.541
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2576
01:05:35.541 --> 01:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2577
01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>they talk them through their scenarios.</v>

2578
01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:39.200
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>

2579
01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.770
<v Speaker 1>they will sit down and the close her eyes and meditate and visualize a</v>

2580
01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:44.650
<v Speaker 1>themselves getting out of bad situations,</v>

2581
01:05:44.651 --> 01:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>visualize themselves winning and do it over and over and over again to the point</v>

2582
01:05:48.371 --> 01:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>where it becomes like a part of this is your reality.</v>

2583
01:05:52.061 --> 01:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Your reality is you win.</v>

2584
01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2585
01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2586
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.400
<v Speaker 1>it seems like if you could watch a video of you doing all those things and</v>

2587
01:05:59.471 --> 01:06:01.960
<v Speaker 1>artificially created you yup.</v>

2588
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:02.861
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2589
01:06:02.861 --> 01:06:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Jumping higher than you've ever jumped before.</v>

2590
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Did scoring and tennis or,</v>

2591
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:08.083
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2592
01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:08.781
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

2593
01:06:08.781 --> 01:06:08.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2594
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:09.200
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2595
01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.570
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bit of nuance to it that's really interesting.</v>

2596
01:06:11.571 --> 01:06:12.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2597
01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.153
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2598
01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.061
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2599
01:06:14.061 --> 01:06:19.061
<v Speaker 2>if you are like walking on a treadmill while you're watching a custom avatar of</v>

2600
01:06:19.401 --> 01:06:20.960
<v Speaker 2>yourself and the Avatar,</v>

2601
01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:21.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2602
01:06:21.231 --> 01:06:24.170
<v Speaker 2>starts running faster and is getting fitter,</v>

2603
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:25.610
<v Speaker 2>you will run faster,</v>

2604
01:06:25.611 --> 01:06:26.190
<v Speaker 2>you will,</v>

2605
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.961
<v Speaker 2>you will work harder.</v>

2606
01:06:26.961 --> 01:06:29.840
<v Speaker 2>If you are engaged in an activity,</v>

2607
01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.733
<v Speaker 2>it can really,</v>

2608
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:31.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2609
01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:33.140
<v Speaker 2>get you moving.</v>

2610
01:06:33.141 --> 01:06:33.950
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

2611
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:37.130
<v Speaker 2>it would be good to tie it to when you're actually working out.</v>

2612
01:06:37.131 --> 01:06:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Like it might not be,</v>

2613
01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:39.740
<v Speaker 2>it might not last for,</v>

2614
01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:40.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2615
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I watched this movie today and a week later I'm still feeling more powerful.</v>

2616
01:06:44.271 --> 01:06:46.010
<v Speaker 2>You kind of want to do it in the moment.</v>

2617
01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2618
01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:50.270
<v Speaker 2>are they the one study at Sanford found for 24 hours?</v>

2619
01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:51.350
<v Speaker 2>They were safe,</v>

2620
01:06:51.351 --> 01:06:51.780
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

2621
01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.090
<v Speaker 2>were more physically active,</v>

2622
01:06:53.091 --> 01:06:55.580
<v Speaker 2>like taking stairs or doing more pushups or whatever.</v>

2623
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:56.833
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2624
01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.793
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2625
01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:01.640
<v Speaker 2>but I do like the idea of using it perfectly like that.</v>

2626
01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.400
<v Speaker 2>The one thing they know is like for positive visualization,</v>

2627
01:07:04.401 --> 01:07:05.151
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've seen,</v>

2628
01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:09.940
<v Speaker 2>there's been new research coming out that you have to visualize the effortful</v>

2629
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:11.900
<v Speaker 2>action and not the outcome.</v>

2630
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're visualizing getting,</v>

2631
01:07:13.491 --> 01:07:13.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2632
01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.650
<v Speaker 2>lifted up on people with people shoulders,</v>

2633
01:07:15.651 --> 01:07:17.090
<v Speaker 2>like I'm the champion.</v>

2634
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2635
01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:22.250
<v Speaker 2>that actually seems to sometimes have a counter productive effect because your</v>

2636
01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:24.500
<v Speaker 2>brain can imagine it so vividly.</v>

2637
01:07:24.501 --> 01:07:27.380
<v Speaker 2>You kind of feel like you've already had that payoff and your,</v>

2638
01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:31.760
<v Speaker 2>you put in less effort that does ms studies for a few years at show this.</v>

2639
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2640
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:33.560
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2641
01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:33.711
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2642
01:07:33.711 --> 01:07:37.280
<v Speaker 2>but if you're visualizing the effortful activity that it takes to get there,</v>

2643
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:38.360
<v Speaker 2>you're picturing,</v>

2644
01:07:38.361 --> 01:07:38.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2645
01:07:38.631 --> 01:07:41.360
<v Speaker 2>here's what I have to do on game day and you're thinking about,</v>

2646
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:42.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2647
01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:42.801
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2648
01:07:42.801 --> 01:07:46.580
<v Speaker 2>the things that require effort on your part techniques or you know,</v>

2649
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2650
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:48.350
<v Speaker 2>the actions you're going to take.</v>

2651
01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2652
01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.150
<v Speaker 2>that is helpful.</v>

2653
01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.040
<v Speaker 2>So you just don't want to think about,</v>

2654
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2655
01:07:52.581 --> 01:07:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait til they,</v>

2656
01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:54.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2657
01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.500
<v Speaker 2>call me up and say that I won.</v>

2658
01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2659
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you have,</v>

2660
01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:58.911
<v Speaker 2>you can't think about it.</v>

2661
01:07:58.911 --> 01:07:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

2662
01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:02.480
<v Speaker 2>you have to be visualizing the things that are going to require effort and</v>

2663
01:08:02.481 --> 01:08:04.280
<v Speaker 2>energy on your part.</v>

2664
01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:04.940
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

2665
01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:08.090
<v Speaker 2>that's that seems to be the most help.</v>

2666
01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.190
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating because like just that statement right there,</v>

2667
01:08:11.191 --> 01:08:13.770
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be the most helpful.</v>

2668
01:08:13.771 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 1>There's so much weirdness and all this is so it's,</v>

2669
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like magic.</v>

2670
01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck is going on?</v>

2671
01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Like what the,</v>

2672
01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>with the visualization process,</v>

2673
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:23.250
<v Speaker 1>what's the mechanism like what,</v>

2674
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.020
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2675
01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>what is it an inspiration?</v>

2676
01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean how much of inspiration,</v>

2677
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:31.040
<v Speaker 1>how much is inspiration a factor in success?</v>

2678
01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably gigantic.</v>

2679
01:08:32.931 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2680
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.270
<v Speaker 1>So is that all right?</v>

2681
01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:35.103
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

2682
01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:37.930
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different avenues I am,</v>

2683
01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:42.100
<v Speaker 2>I focus on self efficacy as what you're trying to increase.</v>

2684
01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:42.611
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2685
01:08:42.611 --> 01:08:43.880
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to inspiration.</v>

2686
01:08:43.881 --> 01:08:48.580
<v Speaker 2>So self efficacy is when you feel like you have the skills and abilities and</v>

2687
01:08:48.581 --> 01:08:50.650
<v Speaker 2>resources you need to achieve your goal.</v>

2688
01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:51.250
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2689
01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:51.790
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2690
01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:52.990
<v Speaker 2>it's different from self esteem.</v>

2691
01:08:52.991 --> 01:08:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Self esteem is like,</v>

2692
01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:54.041
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2693
01:08:54.041 --> 01:08:55.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good person United.</v>

2694
01:08:55.181 --> 01:08:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Sort of like myself.</v>

2695
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Self efficacy is very specific.</v>

2696
01:08:58.691 --> 01:08:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2697
01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:01.450
<v Speaker 2>if I have self efficacy about running a marathon,</v>

2698
01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:04.330
<v Speaker 2>it means that I have done and you know,</v>

2699
01:09:04.331 --> 01:09:06.130
<v Speaker 2>at least a few 20 mile runs.</v>

2700
01:09:06.131 --> 01:09:07.750
<v Speaker 2>I know how hard it's going to be.</v>

2701
01:09:07.751 --> 01:09:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I've got my receipt,</v>

2702
01:09:08.651 --> 01:09:09.071
<v Speaker 2>I know how to,</v>

2703
01:09:09.071 --> 01:09:09.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2704
01:09:09.371 --> 01:09:10.600
<v Speaker 2>fuel during the Ron.</v>

2705
01:09:10.601 --> 01:09:11.830
<v Speaker 2>I know how much I hate to take sodium.</v>

2706
01:09:11.831 --> 01:09:13.150
<v Speaker 2>I have to take a different points.</v>

2707
01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I know what the course looks like,</v>

2708
01:09:14.531 --> 01:09:15.730
<v Speaker 2>so I've got a mental plan.</v>

2709
01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Having that sense of reasonable optimism and focusing on visualizing what you'll</v>

2710
01:09:23.381 --> 01:09:28.381
<v Speaker 2>do successfully that's focused on your own skills and abilities that in all of</v>

2711
01:09:28.781 --> 01:09:31.240
<v Speaker 2>the scientific literature is linked to better outcomes.</v>

2712
01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:34.630
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're imagining things that are outside of your control,</v>

2713
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:39.990
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't because how is it might inspire you and maybe you'll,</v>

2714
01:09:40.150 --> 01:09:40.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2715
01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.440
<v Speaker 2>get out of bed and put more of an effort as you,</v>

2716
01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:43.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2717
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.610
<v Speaker 2>picture something good happening to you.</v>

2718
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.270
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

2719
01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:52.320
<v Speaker 2>the mental model that seems to be most powerful is when you're focusing on</v>

2720
01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.660
<v Speaker 2>things that you have direct control over,</v>

2721
01:09:55.661 --> 01:09:56.590
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>

2722
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2723
01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:59.710
<v Speaker 2>The self efficacy.</v>

2724
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2725
01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>how much of all that is just a little,</v>

2726
01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:11.160
<v Speaker 1>what you were talking about is just focus is just thinking about what you're</v>

2727
01:10:11.161 --> 01:10:14.190
<v Speaker 1>doing and the more you think about what you're doing and the more energy you put</v>

2728
01:10:14.191 --> 01:10:15.480
<v Speaker 1>towards what you're doing makes you better.</v>

2729
01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And how much of this is just mean?</v>

2730
01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that all these ideas of just visualization is what you're doing</v>

2731
01:10:21.481 --> 01:10:24.570
<v Speaker 1>is really just focusing more and loving more what you're doing?</v>

2732
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:26.270
<v Speaker 2>I think that could be a big part of it.</v>

2733
01:10:26.271 --> 01:10:26.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2734
01:10:26.541 --> 01:10:26.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2735
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:28.970
<v Speaker 2>the focus attention it,</v>

2736
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:29.840
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2737
01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.400
<v Speaker 2>you're able to perform better,</v>

2738
01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:32.600
<v Speaker 2>you learn faster.</v>

2739
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it is also something to do with the dopamine system.</v>

2740
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2741
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2742
01:10:38.961 --> 01:10:40.100
<v Speaker 2>in video games.</v>

2743
01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:41.503
<v Speaker 2>So if some,</v>

2744
01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.090
<v Speaker 2>so I've talked to lots of neuroscientists,</v>

2745
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:44.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2746
01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:46.350
<v Speaker 2>for this book and um,</v>

2747
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.980
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them will say if you wanna increase someone's self efficacy,</v>

2748
01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you have them play a video game.</v>

2749
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm in a video game,</v>

2750
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:57.260
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly required to take action and then wait to see,</v>

2751
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.770
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2752
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I try to fire my weapon.</v>

2753
01:10:59.511 --> 01:11:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I wait to see if I shot successfully.</v>

2754
01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:03.110
<v Speaker 2>I try to orient around an obstacle,</v>

2755
01:11:03.111 --> 01:11:03.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to see,</v>

2756
01:11:03.711 --> 01:11:08.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get information every time that your brain expects information</v>

2757
01:11:08.001 --> 01:11:09.020
<v Speaker 2>about your performance,</v>

2758
01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.780
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a little dopamine release and dopamine feels good.</v>

2759
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:13.160
<v Speaker 2>So you got excited.</v>

2760
01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:13.831
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2761
01:11:13.831 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Speaker 2>but increased open mean also allows you to pay closer attention and to learn</v>

2762
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:19.530
<v Speaker 2>faster,</v>

2763
01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:20.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2764
01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:23.700
<v Speaker 2>So anytime you're trying something where you're constantly taking actions,</v>

2765
01:11:23.701 --> 01:11:26.700
<v Speaker 2>getting feedback and you have to kind of learn and improve,</v>

2766
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:27.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2767
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:31.950
<v Speaker 2>you'll get all this dopamine going and that is associated with the ability to</v>

2768
01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:33.060
<v Speaker 2>build self efficacy.</v>

2769
01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:35.820
<v Speaker 2>So I think that there is a,</v>

2770
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:36.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2771
01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a neurochemical process that's underlying this.</v>

2772
01:11:39.511 --> 01:11:40.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

2773
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.430
<v Speaker 2>it's not just,</v>

2774
01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2775
01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not just a matter of,</v>

2776
01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:46.020
<v Speaker 2>of what you think.</v>

2777
01:11:46.021 --> 01:11:50.700
<v Speaker 2>It's also about changing what is going on in your brain so that the brain is</v>

2778
01:11:50.701 --> 01:11:54.570
<v Speaker 2>primed to learn faster to improve.</v>

2779
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's um,</v>

2780
01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:56.221
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2781
01:11:56.221 --> 01:11:57.054
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2782
01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:58.050
<v Speaker 2>that's why,</v>

2783
01:11:58.050 --> 01:11:58.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2784
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:02.370
<v Speaker 2>that's why there seemed to be so many cool applications for video games because</v>

2785
01:12:02.371 --> 01:12:07.371
<v Speaker 2>if you can get a cancer patient who feels really powerless and overwhelmed to</v>

2786
01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:13.410
<v Speaker 2>play a video game about chemotherapy and it starts building self advocacy and</v>

2787
01:12:13.411 --> 01:12:14.580
<v Speaker 2>getting all the dopamine going,</v>

2788
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:17.820
<v Speaker 2>there was a clinical trial that showed that kids who played a video game about</v>

2789
01:12:17.821 --> 01:12:18.654
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>

2790
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:23.900
<v Speaker 2>we're for two to three months later missing fewer doses of their medicine,</v>

2791
01:12:25.231 --> 01:12:26.370
<v Speaker 2>taking more antibiotics,</v>

2792
01:12:26.371 --> 01:12:27.570
<v Speaker 2>they were more engaged,</v>

2793
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:28.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2794
01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:32.610
<v Speaker 2>which leads to more cases of cancer being going into remission.</v>

2795
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2796
01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.280
<v Speaker 2>But isn't that just more focus?</v>

2797
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Just focusing and thinking,</v>

2798
01:12:36.701 --> 01:12:36.810
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2799
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:40.530
<v Speaker 2>it's using it as a mechanism to focus and think about your illness,</v>

2800
01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.100
<v Speaker 2>focus and think about your recovery.</v>

2801
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.980
<v Speaker 2>It's focused with the dopamine hit and the increased over mean is gonna it,</v>

2802
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.460
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2803
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.950
<v Speaker 2>it changes what's,</v>

2804
01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:51.810
<v Speaker 2>well now we'll get really deep here.</v>

2805
01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2806
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:54.660
<v Speaker 2>every time that you consider a goal,</v>

2807
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.090
<v Speaker 2>your brain stops and says,</v>

2808
01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:57.930
<v Speaker 2>is it worth it?</v>

2809
01:12:57.930 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Because your brain is trying to conserve your body's energy and you know,</v>

2810
01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:02.161
<v Speaker 2>they're the,</v>

2811
01:13:02.161 --> 01:13:03.270
<v Speaker 2>your cognitive energy.</v>

2812
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.991
<v Speaker 2>And we'll say,</v>

2813
01:13:03.991 --> 01:13:04.320
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

2814
01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.430
<v Speaker 2>if I do this goal,</v>

2815
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:06.360
<v Speaker 2>am I,</v>

2816
01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.193
<v Speaker 2>do I really want it?</v>

2817
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to put the energy to do it?</v>

2818
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:13.020
<v Speaker 2>And what researchers have found is the more dopamine you have in your reward</v>

2819
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:13.854
<v Speaker 2>pathways,</v>

2820
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.750
<v Speaker 2>the more you focus on the positive outcome and the less you think about the</v>

2821
01:13:18.751 --> 01:13:19.650
<v Speaker 2>effort required.</v>

2822
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:21.870
<v Speaker 2>So if I give you a bunch of dopamine hits,</v>

2823
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:23.130
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be thinking about,</v>

2824
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I might be cured someday.</v>

2825
01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:27.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't care how many side effects there are to this medicine.</v>

2826
01:13:27.151 --> 01:13:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm swallowing this pill,</v>

2827
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:29.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2828
01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:29.621
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2829
01:13:29.621 --> 01:13:33.480
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to do it because you're focused on the positive outcome,</v>

2830
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:36.780
<v Speaker 2>not all of the other things that stress you out about it or make you,</v>

2831
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:37.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2832
01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.820
<v Speaker 2>the nausea and the,</v>

2833
01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:39.270
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2834
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:40.470
<v Speaker 2>the energy that it takes.</v>

2835
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.000
<v Speaker 2>And this is true if you're doing push ups,</v>

2836
01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:42.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2837
01:13:42.511 --> 01:13:42.780
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2838
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.820
<v Speaker 2>do I really feel like doing a hundred pushups right now?</v>

2839
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2840
01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.950
<v Speaker 2>if you have more dopamine going,</v>

2841
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:48.630
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be more likely to say,</v>

2842
01:13:48.631 --> 01:13:49.411
<v Speaker 2>this is important to me.</v>

2843
01:13:49.411 --> 01:13:50.370
<v Speaker 2>It's part of my training.</v>

2844
01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2845
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.920
<v Speaker 2>and if you are low dopamine,</v>

2846
01:13:52.921 --> 01:13:54.420
<v Speaker 2>which is when you're clinically depressed,</v>

2847
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:55.800
<v Speaker 2>you have really load open mean.</v>

2848
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.960
<v Speaker 2>So everything seems too hard.</v>

2849
01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:58.411
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2850
01:13:58.411 --> 01:13:59.970
<v Speaker 2>why am I going to bother getting out of bed?</v>

2851
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.680
<v Speaker 2>There's like the effort required seems so much more important than the goal.</v>

2852
01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:09.840
<v Speaker 2>So there is a neurological underpinning to self advocacy is sort of this</v>

2853
01:14:09.841 --> 01:14:14.841
<v Speaker 2>combination of really wanting to achieve your goal and having that increased</v>

2854
01:14:14.891 --> 01:14:16.450
<v Speaker 2>attention so you learn faster.</v>

2855
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:16.970
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

2856
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:17.803
<v Speaker 2>but you have to,</v>

2857
01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:18.520
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2858
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:18.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2859
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:19.450
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

2860
01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:20.283
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

2861
01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a matter of saying,</v>

2862
01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:22.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pay attention.</v>

2863
01:14:22.451 --> 01:14:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to be priming your brain to increase the dopamine and your reward</v>

2864
01:14:27.251 --> 01:14:27.910
<v Speaker 2>pathways.</v>

2865
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2866
01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>But the dopamine hit.</v>

2867
01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:31.930
<v Speaker 1>What is the mechanism that creates the dopamine hit?</v>

2868
01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Is it just simply loving what you're doing,</v>

2869
01:14:33.911 --> 01:14:34.744
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2870
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:35.151
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2871
01:14:35.151 --> 01:14:35.250
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2872
01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:35.401
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2873
01:14:35.401 --> 01:14:36.234
<v Speaker 2>It's gold.</v>

2874
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.931
<v Speaker 2>It's gold.</v>

2875
01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:38.400
<v Speaker 2>It's anticipation.</v>

2876
01:14:38.450 --> 01:14:39.271
<v Speaker 2>What specifically?</v>

2877
01:14:39.271 --> 01:14:40.530
<v Speaker 2>It's anticipation of feedback.</v>

2878
01:14:40.531 --> 01:14:41.530
<v Speaker 2>So the fastest way for like,</v>

2879
01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:43.380
<v Speaker 2>you want it to increase your dopamine right now,</v>

2880
01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.980
<v Speaker 2>I would say make a prediction about something that's going to happen today.</v>

2881
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2882
01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:48.930
<v Speaker 2>it could be anything.</v>

2883
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

2884
01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I predict that song go,</v>

2885
01:14:50.661 --> 01:14:52.800
<v Speaker 2>we'll win today and four sets,</v>

2886
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:53.431
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

2887
01:14:53.431 --> 01:14:54.900
<v Speaker 2>You make a prediction about something.</v>

2888
01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Every time you make a prediction,</v>

2889
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:57.090
<v Speaker 2>your brain's like,</v>

2890
01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:57.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2891
01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:58.373
<v Speaker 2>I might be right.</v>

2892
01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to m n and that'll feel good.</v>

2893
01:15:00.451 --> 01:15:01.284
<v Speaker 2>And if I'm not right,</v>

2894
01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:02.101
<v Speaker 2>I'll learn something.</v>

2895
01:15:02.101 --> 01:15:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Why did he lose in five sites or whatever.</v>

2896
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.180
<v Speaker 2>So I make a better prediction next time.</v>

2897
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:07.740
<v Speaker 2>That gives you a dope me.</v>

2898
01:15:07.741 --> 01:15:09.180
<v Speaker 2>And so in a video game,</v>

2899
01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.410
<v Speaker 2>when you fire your weapon,</v>

2900
01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.180
<v Speaker 2>you have predicted that it's going to successfully shoot that guy over there and</v>

2901
01:15:15.181 --> 01:15:17.160
<v Speaker 2>you're waiting for to see on the screen.</v>

2902
01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Did I miss or did I hit?</v>

2903
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:20.160
<v Speaker 2>That's why you get a dopamine hit.</v>

2904
01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.440
<v Speaker 2>So every time you make a prediction,</v>

2905
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.880
<v Speaker 2>your brain jeers up to either celebrate that you were right,</v>

2906
01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Yay success or I got to learn so that I can do better the next time.</v>

2907
01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.390
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think I,</v>

2908
01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:35.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2909
01:15:35.071 --> 01:15:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I have friends,</v>

2910
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.260
<v Speaker 1>I have one friend in particular that didn't grow up with any healthy sense of</v>

2911
01:15:40.261 --> 01:15:41.880
<v Speaker 1>competition and it's,</v>

2912
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:43.230
<v Speaker 1>he's actually talked about that.</v>

2913
01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's one thing that he could go back and do again,</v>

2914
01:15:46.321 --> 01:15:49.950
<v Speaker 1>like he thinks his parents didn't really instill any sense of competition in</v>

2915
01:15:49.951 --> 01:15:50.101
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2916
01:15:50.101 --> 01:15:51.000
<v Speaker 1>And he's one of those guys,</v>

2917
01:15:51.001 --> 01:15:51.790
<v Speaker 1>if he's playing a game,</v>

2918
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:52.740
<v Speaker 1>it's not going his way.</v>

2919
01:15:53.010 --> 01:15:53.910
<v Speaker 1>He'll pull the plug.</v>

2920
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2921
01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.440
<v Speaker 1>he'll flip the board over.</v>

2922
01:15:55.441 --> 01:15:56.274
<v Speaker 1>He's that guy.</v>

2923
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2924
01:15:57.631 --> 01:15:57.931
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2925
01:15:57.931 --> 01:15:58.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2926
01:15:58.051 --> 01:16:00.600
<v Speaker 1>you know what's going on in the brain.</v>

2927
01:16:00.601 --> 01:16:01.291
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

2928
01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:02.160
<v Speaker 1>you have this reaction,</v>

2929
01:16:02.161 --> 01:16:07.161
<v Speaker 1>but to him losing is just devastating and write James or only if you can win.</v>

2930
01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2931
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.501
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2932
01:16:08.501 --> 01:16:08.661
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2933
01:16:08.661 --> 01:16:10.030
<v Speaker 2>and it's probably what's going on.</v>

2934
01:16:10.031 --> 01:16:11.260
<v Speaker 2>It's his brain is saying,</v>

2935
01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:12.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2936
01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:15.520
<v Speaker 2>it's starting to realize no amount of effort is going to turn this around.</v>

2937
01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.320
<v Speaker 2>And so he just walks away.</v>

2938
01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:17.531
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2939
01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:17.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

2940
01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2941
01:16:18.201 --> 01:16:19.010
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

2942
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:20.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

2943
01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.590
<v Speaker 1>there's no history of figuring things out and getting better.</v>

2944
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2945
01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who has ever started anything and gotten really good at it and knows</v>

2946
01:16:29.301 --> 01:16:29.871
<v Speaker 1>it in the beginning,</v>

2947
01:16:29.871 --> 01:16:30.704
<v Speaker 1>you suck.</v>

2948
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:31.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's some,</v>

2949
01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.360
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of exciting.</v>

2950
01:16:32.361 --> 01:16:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2951
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:33.081
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2952
01:16:33.081 --> 01:16:33.914
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2953
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.371
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2954
01:16:34.371 --> 01:16:35.330
<v Speaker 1>you pick something up,</v>

2955
01:16:35.331 --> 01:16:36.740
<v Speaker 1>say a tennis,</v>

2956
01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:37.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2957
01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:38.930
<v Speaker 1>like if I started to playing tennis today,</v>

2958
01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to play tennis.</v>

2959
01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I would suck and it would be exciting because I would get my ass kicked on.</v>

2960
01:16:44.991 --> 01:16:45.321
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2961
01:16:45.321 --> 01:16:45.621
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2962
01:16:45.621 --> 01:16:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I have to figure this fucking thing out.</v>

2963
01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Like what makes that ball spin like that?</v>

2964
01:16:49.281 --> 01:16:50.570
<v Speaker 1>How's that guy whacked that ball?</v>

2965
01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.021
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2966
01:16:51.021 --> 01:16:51.381
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

2967
01:16:51.381 --> 01:16:51.591
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2968
01:16:51.591 --> 01:16:52.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2969
01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.750
<v Speaker 1>he knows he's number crunching.</v>

2970
01:16:53.751 --> 01:16:54.171
<v Speaker 1>He's gay.</v>

2971
01:16:54.171 --> 01:16:55.000
<v Speaker 1>He's like data.</v>

2972
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:55.880
<v Speaker 1>He knows he's got,</v>

2973
01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.410
<v Speaker 1>he's chunking information.</v>

2974
01:16:57.411 --> 01:16:59.210
<v Speaker 1>He knows that if I move left,</v>

2975
01:16:59.211 --> 01:17:01.430
<v Speaker 1>the ball's going to go there and he's going to go here and,</v>

2976
01:17:01.431 --> 01:17:01.951
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

2977
01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:02.710
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2978
01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:04.340
<v Speaker 1>And I don't have that.</v>

2979
01:17:04.341 --> 01:17:04.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2980
01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.560
<v Speaker 2>and that experience of getting better,</v>

2981
01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:06.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2982
01:17:06.891 --> 01:17:08.720
<v Speaker 2>that's the basis for self efficacy.</v>

2983
01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2984
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:10.183
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>

2985
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people ask me,</v>

2986
01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:12.681
<v Speaker 2>like parents will say,</v>

2987
01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:13.670
<v Speaker 2>what kids should my,</v>

2988
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:17.180
<v Speaker 2>what game should my kids be playing for a learning experience?</v>

2989
01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.510
<v Speaker 2>But I say every game is designed to be a learning experience because you're</v>

2990
01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be bad.</v>

2991
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's why games feel so good is that you're,</v>

2992
01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:25.190
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2993
01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:26.390
<v Speaker 2>every time you play a new game,</v>

2994
01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.620
<v Speaker 2>you're figuring it out.</v>

2995
01:17:27.621 --> 01:17:28.850
<v Speaker 2>You're learning how it works,</v>

2996
01:17:28.851 --> 01:17:29.690
<v Speaker 2>you're getting better.</v>

2997
01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.890
<v Speaker 2>That experience of constantly getting better and proving to yourself,</v>

2998
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I can figure something out.</v>

2999
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.680
<v Speaker 2>I can improve,</v>

3000
01:17:36.681 --> 01:17:38.390
<v Speaker 2>I can master something.</v>

3001
01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3002
01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:39.830
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3003
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the reasons this is a fundamental reason why people like</v>

3004
01:17:42.561 --> 01:17:45.800
<v Speaker 2>playing games and why they don't play the same game forever.</v>

3005
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes you do if the game that you can never master like chess or</v>

3006
01:17:49.641 --> 01:17:50.090
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

3007
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3008
01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:51.740
<v Speaker 2>but most people will,</v>

3009
01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.820
<v Speaker 2>will really get into a game for a while and then feel like they have stopped</v>

3010
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:57.343
<v Speaker 2>improving.</v>

3011
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:58.400
<v Speaker 2>And so the brain gets,</v>

3012
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:59.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3013
01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:00.260
<v Speaker 2>wants to keep learning,</v>

3014
01:18:00.261 --> 01:18:01.460
<v Speaker 2>wants to keep getting better.</v>

3015
01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:06.590
<v Speaker 2>The dopamine hits are only gonna come if you aren't sure how to be successful.</v>

3016
01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3017
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:08.570
<v Speaker 2>So you have to play a new game.</v>

3018
01:18:08.571 --> 01:18:10.580
<v Speaker 2>So why we don't play Tic Tac toe is adults,</v>

3019
01:18:10.581 --> 01:18:11.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3020
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

3021
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:11.601
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3022
01:18:11.601 --> 01:18:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Dopamine hits from tic TAC toe.</v>

3023
01:18:12.891 --> 01:18:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know exactly what's going to happen.</v>

3024
01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:15.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3025
01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit game and keep trying to tell my five year old,</v>

3026
01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:22.080
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a draw every time kids bullshit.</v>

3027
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3028
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:24.550
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

3029
01:18:24.551 --> 01:18:25.020
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3030
01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.220
<v Speaker 1>a lead ism attached to chess.</v>

3031
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Chess is the only game.</v>

3032
01:18:28.901 --> 01:18:30.490
<v Speaker 1>It's considered a,</v>

3033
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:30.750
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

3034
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:31.960
<v Speaker 1>a worthwhile pursuing.</v>

3035
01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:32.853
<v Speaker 1>Now it's terrible.</v>

3036
01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:33.791
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

3037
01:18:33.791 --> 01:18:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Because parents will tell kids that are playing video games and they're wasting</v>

3038
01:18:37.601 --> 01:18:38.150
<v Speaker 1>their time.</v>

3039
01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3040
01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:42.310
<v Speaker 1>but if you came home when your kid was playing chess silently with his friend</v>

3041
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:43.430
<v Speaker 1>and they're just looking at the,</v>

3042
01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.081
<v Speaker 1>he be like,</v>

3043
01:18:44.081 --> 01:18:44.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3044
01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:46.060
<v Speaker 1>my kid is up to a good thing.</v>

3045
01:18:46.061 --> 01:18:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3046
01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:46.741
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

3047
01:18:46.741 --> 01:18:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3048
01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:50.460
<v Speaker 2>first because Einstein play chess so well,</v>

3049
01:18:50.461 --> 01:18:51.181
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of it.</v>

3050
01:18:51.181 --> 01:18:51.361
<v Speaker 2>Although,</v>

3051
01:18:51.361 --> 01:18:51.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3052
01:18:51.571 --> 01:18:54.650
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting if you read letters that he used to write fucking hated</v>

3053
01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:55.210
<v Speaker 2>chess.</v>

3054
01:18:55.210 --> 01:18:55.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3055
01:18:55.410 --> 01:18:56.243
<v Speaker 2>he loved it.</v>

3056
01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.520
<v Speaker 2>But he wrote to people that he was worried that he was addicted to it.</v>

3057
01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.500
<v Speaker 2>He talked a lot about how,</v>

3058
01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:03.330
<v Speaker 2>how he had this game addiction,</v>

3059
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.700
<v Speaker 2>which is fascinating when you think about today,</v>

3060
01:19:05.701 --> 01:19:06.900
<v Speaker 2>how many people worried about,</v>

3061
01:19:06.901 --> 01:19:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm addicted to world of Warcraft or whatever game.</v>

3062
01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:12.180
<v Speaker 2>So even Einstein worried about being addicted</v>

3063
01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.620
<v Speaker 1>to his favorite game.</v>

3064
01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It is real game addiction is absolutely real.</v>

3065
01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:16.471
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

3066
01:19:16.471 --> 01:19:16.940
<v Speaker 1>It is</v>

3067
01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:17.630
<v Speaker 2>a real,</v>

3068
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:18.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3069
01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:18.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3070
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:20.060
<v Speaker 2>it is absolutely real.</v>

3071
01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:21.290
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3072
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:25.280
<v Speaker 2>there are techniques for breaking that pattern by the way,</v>

3073
01:19:25.281 --> 01:19:26.114
<v Speaker 2>if you would,</v>

3074
01:19:26.210 --> 01:19:28.340
<v Speaker 2>do you want it quick technique for how to break?</v>

3075
01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3076
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3077
01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.250
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole chapter in,</v>

3078
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:34.220
<v Speaker 2>in the Super Better Book about the game addiction and how,</v>

3079
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:35.571
<v Speaker 2>how to stop it,</v>

3080
01:19:35.571 --> 01:19:36.404
<v Speaker 2>how to reverse it.</v>

3081
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3082
01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.240
<v Speaker 2>and what tends to lead people into it.</v>

3083
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3084
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Biggest that's my friend Duncan was on,</v>

3085
01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:41.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3086
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:45.200
<v Speaker 1>biggest addict I know to video games always have me feel normal.</v>

3087
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3088
01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:48.520
<v Speaker 2>the biggest predictor for,</v>

3089
01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:49.413
<v Speaker 2>uhW,</v>

3090
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:53.140
<v Speaker 2>who will become addicted to games and feel like it kind of gets out of control</v>

3091
01:19:53.141 --> 01:19:57.610
<v Speaker 2>spirals out of control is if they're playing for escapist purposes to try to</v>

3092
01:19:57.611 --> 01:19:59.350
<v Speaker 2>block other feelings.</v>

3093
01:19:59.351 --> 01:19:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3094
01:19:59.470 --> 01:19:59.771
<v Speaker 2>I have these,</v>

3095
01:19:59.771 --> 01:20:00.431
<v Speaker 2>all these problems,</v>

3096
01:20:00.431 --> 01:20:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to play the game instead.</v>

3097
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3098
01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:02.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm feeling anxious,</v>

3099
01:20:02.981 --> 01:20:04.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to play the game and said,</v>

3100
01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:05.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3101
01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:07.050
<v Speaker 2>so the way you reverse it is you,</v>

3102
01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:07.983
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

3103
01:20:08.650 --> 01:20:08.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3104
01:20:08.921 --> 01:20:10.470
<v Speaker 2>I talk about it as playing to get better.</v>

3105
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:13.530
<v Speaker 2>You are instead of playing to avoid something,</v>

3106
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.370
<v Speaker 2>you focus on what you're doing that is making you better.</v>

3107
01:20:17.371 --> 01:20:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's just to start getting better at this game,</v>

3108
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:21.330
<v Speaker 2>then you focus on,</v>

3109
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:21.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3110
01:20:21.721 --> 01:20:23.070
<v Speaker 2>why I'm playing with,</v>

3111
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:23.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3112
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:24.211
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3113
01:20:24.211 --> 01:20:28.080
<v Speaker 2>my friends is like improving my relationships or I'm focusing on strategy or</v>

3114
01:20:28.081 --> 01:20:30.090
<v Speaker 2>building my teamwork skills or whatever it is.</v>

3115
01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:31.020
<v Speaker 2>You start to think about,</v>

3116
01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3117
01:20:32.190 --> 01:20:35.640
<v Speaker 2>other goals outside the game that the game is connected to because the</v>

3118
01:20:35.641 --> 01:20:40.641
<v Speaker 2>biological process of addiction is the narrowing of goals that the brain</v>

3119
01:20:42.181 --> 01:20:42.781
<v Speaker 2>responds to.</v>

3120
01:20:42.781 --> 01:20:43.740
<v Speaker 2>This is true for,</v>

3121
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:45.630
<v Speaker 2>for drug addiction.</v>

3122
01:20:45.631 --> 01:20:45.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3123
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:47.100
<v Speaker 2>all forms of addiction,</v>

3124
01:20:47.101 --> 01:20:47.934
<v Speaker 2>pornography,</v>

3125
01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.610
<v Speaker 1>narrowing of goals at the brain response,</v>

3126
01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:50.991
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3127
01:20:50.991 --> 01:20:51.111
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3128
01:20:51.111 --> 01:20:51.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3129
01:20:51.321 --> 01:20:51.531
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3130
01:20:51.531 --> 01:20:52.700
<v Speaker 2>you get like this dopamine hit.</v>

3131
01:20:52.701 --> 01:20:56.240
<v Speaker 2>When you anticipate something good in,</v>

3132
01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.620
<v Speaker 2>in addiction,</v>

3133
01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:03.460
<v Speaker 2>the brain starts to believe that the only source of the next dopamine hit is the</v>

3134
01:21:03.561 --> 01:21:04.610
<v Speaker 2>thing you're addicted to.</v>

3135
01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:10.180
<v Speaker 2>And you can't imagine other things that are gonna make you feel that good or</v>

3136
01:21:10.761 --> 01:21:11.660
<v Speaker 2>feel that excited.</v>

3137
01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:12.411
<v Speaker 2>And one of,</v>

3138
01:21:12.411 --> 01:21:15.950
<v Speaker 2>there's this great new book called the biology of desire that lays a</v>

3139
01:21:15.951 --> 01:21:16.650
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientist,</v>

3140
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:18.770
<v Speaker 2>kind of lays out all the new thinking on addiction.</v>

3141
01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.810
<v Speaker 2>And the way that you break,</v>

3142
01:21:20.811 --> 01:21:25.010
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways you break out of cycle for any addiction is to start priming the</v>

3143
01:21:25.011 --> 01:21:30.011
<v Speaker 2>brain to anticipate success or pleasure from other things.</v>

3144
01:21:30.981 --> 01:21:34.850
<v Speaker 2>So you have to just talk about like widening the scope of what is going to</v>

3145
01:21:34.851 --> 01:21:35.870
<v Speaker 2>provide that dopamine hit.</v>

3146
01:21:35.871 --> 01:21:38.060
<v Speaker 2>So in game play you have to stop,</v>

3147
01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3148
01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:44.380
<v Speaker 2>you have to stop thinking about the game as the only source of that,</v>

3149
01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.080
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3150
01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.190
<v Speaker 2>that good feeling.</v>

3151
01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:51.150
<v Speaker 2>So you have to start thinking about other goals that you have besides just the</v>

3152
01:21:51.151 --> 01:21:53.930
<v Speaker 2>sort of sense of relief that the game is going to provide.</v>

3153
01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Um hmm.</v>

3154
01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:55.710
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

3155
01:21:55.710 --> 01:22:00.270
<v Speaker 1>that's something that they tell addicts that are drug addicts use channel at</v>

3156
01:22:00.271 --> 01:22:01.650
<v Speaker 1>addiction into something else.</v>

3157
01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:02.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's essentially what they're saying.</v>

3158
01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:03.691
<v Speaker 1>They're saying,</v>

3159
01:22:03.691 --> 01:22:03.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3160
01:22:03.811 --> 01:22:05.730
<v Speaker 1>you need to do is find something else,</v>

3161
01:22:05.731 --> 01:22:07.800
<v Speaker 1>but that's positive that you can get addicted to.</v>

3162
01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3163
01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:12.210
<v Speaker 1>So you're seeking out that weird chemical reaction in the mind,</v>

3164
01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:12.571
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3165
01:22:12.571 --> 01:22:14.510
<v Speaker 1>When you're stimulated by something else.</v>

3166
01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3167
01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:18.390
<v Speaker 1>And instead of chasing crack you'll chase exercise.</v>

3168
01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:19.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3169
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.920
<v Speaker 2>But in what we're seeing with games,</v>

3170
01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.790
<v Speaker 2>because games aren't inherently dangerous,</v>

3171
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:25.250
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to quit playing games.</v>

3172
01:22:25.251 --> 01:22:29.390
<v Speaker 2>And in fact it can be dangerous to just go cold Turkey on games because it's</v>

3173
01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:32.060
<v Speaker 2>like taking someone off an antidepressant without tapering them.</v>

3174
01:22:32.061 --> 01:22:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Because Games have such a powerful impact on our,</v>

3175
01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:36.400
<v Speaker 2>our happiness.</v>

3176
01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.020
<v Speaker 1>You know how the kids are going to listen to this go mom,</v>

3177
01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:39.940
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous for me to quit this game.</v>

3178
01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:41.930
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Jane,</v>

3179
01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:43.170
<v Speaker 2>they're like suicide.</v>

3180
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:47.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean their cases of kids who have killed themselves when their parents turn</v>

3181
01:22:47.371 --> 01:22:50.640
<v Speaker 2>off the game and those kids would have killed themselves over anything.</v>

3182
01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:53.490
<v Speaker 2>I I think,</v>

3183
01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it is likely related to,</v>

3184
01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.680
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing when you take someone off and ended a precedent and the</v>

3185
01:22:58.681 --> 01:23:01.080
<v Speaker 2>brain is no longer having that.</v>

3186
01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.073
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3187
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:03.533
<v Speaker 2>it's like dope.</v>

3188
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:04.410
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3189
01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:05.170
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3190
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:06.560
<v Speaker 2>you lose your ability to imagine.</v>

3191
01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Is the term it positive?</v>

3192
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Is the term addiction?</v>

3193
01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Like is that a flawed term?</v>

3194
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Like it,</v>

3195
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:16.140
<v Speaker 1>cause it seems like it's so limited and so narrow in its scope.</v>

3196
01:23:16.141 --> 01:23:16.290
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

3197
01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:17.310
<v Speaker 1>we think of addiction,</v>

3198
01:23:17.311 --> 01:23:19.140
<v Speaker 1>we think of always on the heroin,</v>

3199
01:23:19.410 --> 01:23:19.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3200
01:23:19.741 --> 01:23:21.780
<v Speaker 1>like you just automatically think,</v>

3201
01:23:21.781 --> 01:23:26.730
<v Speaker 1>but really what is it that your brain has locked into these pathways of</v>

3202
01:23:26.731 --> 01:23:28.410
<v Speaker 1>achieving desirable effects?</v>

3203
01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3204
01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3205
01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:30.550
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

3206
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:31.121
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot,</v>

3207
01:23:31.121 --> 01:23:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3208
01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:35.890
<v Speaker 2>I've done some work with some real real rotation centers,</v>

3209
01:23:35.891 --> 01:23:40.891
<v Speaker 2>recovery centers for addiction where they're starting to be more aware of this,</v>

3210
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:45.460
<v Speaker 2>the new sense of what addiction is.</v>

3211
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3212
01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:46.990
<v Speaker 2>but if people are interested,</v>

3213
01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:50.290
<v Speaker 2>the book that just came out this year about that the biology of desire does a</v>

3214
01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:53.770
<v Speaker 2>really good job of explaining it because it's,</v>

3215
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3216
01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:54.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3217
01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:56.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty provocative argument.</v>

3218
01:23:56.351 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 2>It says that addiction is not a disease.</v>

3219
01:23:58.750 --> 01:23:59.290
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3220
01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:00.123
<v Speaker 2>it's a fun,</v>

3221
01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:00.311
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3222
01:24:00.311 --> 01:24:02.980
<v Speaker 2>the brain is functioning absolutely perfectly.</v>

3223
01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:04.990
<v Speaker 2>It's just focusing on,</v>

3224
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.780
<v Speaker 2>it's like hyper focusing on one goal.</v>

3225
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:12.550
<v Speaker 2>But if you had that same brain chemistry about running a startup company,</v>

3226
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:12.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3227
01:24:12.761 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Mark Zuckerberg was addicted to his startup in the same way that someone can get</v>

3228
01:24:17.021 --> 01:24:19.570
<v Speaker 2>addicted to a video game or addicted to a substance,</v>

3229
01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.280
<v Speaker 2>you get hyper focused on one goal.</v>

3230
01:24:21.281 --> 01:24:22.140
<v Speaker 2>It's your only source of,</v>

3231
01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.310
<v Speaker 2>of pleasure and anticipation of,</v>

3232
01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:25.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3233
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:26.890
<v Speaker 2>these positive feelings.</v>

3234
01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:27.971
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

3235
01:24:27.971 --> 01:24:29.380
<v Speaker 2>the brain is working properly.</v>

3236
01:24:29.381 --> 01:24:30.214
<v Speaker 2>It's not broken.</v>

3237
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.910
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

3238
01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:32.440
<v Speaker 2>it's not a disease in that sense.</v>

3239
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:33.100
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>

3240
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:33.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3241
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:38.260
<v Speaker 2>it has just gotten stuck on a particular productive yeah.</v>

3242
01:24:38.261 --> 01:24:38.500
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

3243
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.310
<v Speaker 2>that is maybe ultimately not good for you physically are not good for your,</v>

3244
01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:44.080
<v Speaker 2>the life that you're trying to leave</v>

3245
01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.970
<v Speaker 1>career a good rest for your family life or,</v>

3246
01:24:46.971 --> 01:24:47.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3247
01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy that was addicted to,</v>

3248
01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:50.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3249
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:52.050
<v Speaker 1>one of those role playing games,</v>

3250
01:24:52.051 --> 01:24:52.884
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

3251
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was everquest and,</v>

3252
01:24:54.991 --> 01:24:55.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3253
01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:55.950
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3254
01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:59.400
<v Speaker 1>he had this really profound statement we were at the comedy store wants,</v>

3255
01:24:59.401 --> 01:25:01.560
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the managers and uh,</v>

3256
01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:02.430
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

3257
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I am so good at making money in my online life and so bad at it in my real life.</v>

3258
01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:10.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3259
01:25:10.471 --> 01:25:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3260
01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:12.210
<v Speaker 1>And like he was like,</v>

3261
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:14.220
<v Speaker 1>he was sitting there like a broken man.</v>

3262
01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:14.821
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3263
01:25:14.821 --> 01:25:15.211
<v Speaker 1>how often?</v>

3264
01:25:15.211 --> 01:25:17.250
<v Speaker 1>He plays like eight hours,</v>

3265
01:25:17.251 --> 01:25:17.641
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

3266
01:25:17.641 --> 01:25:18.474
<v Speaker 1>10 hours a day.</v>

3267
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Every day.</v>

3268
01:25:19.230 --> 01:25:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3269
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I go every day.</v>

3270
01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:20.911
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

3271
01:25:20.911 --> 01:25:21.211
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3272
01:25:21.211 --> 01:25:21.701
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3273
01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:22.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3274
01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't not play it.</v>

3275
01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.020
<v Speaker 1>And then that's when he said that like,</v>

3276
01:25:25.021 --> 01:25:25.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3277
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:29.820
<v Speaker 1>it was like this rare break from the game on during his free time.</v>

3278
01:25:29.821 --> 01:25:32.670
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't working and he came down to the comedy store to hang out and he's</v>

3279
01:25:32.671 --> 01:25:35.520
<v Speaker 1>pasty white Pale like almost gray skinned.</v>

3280
01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3281
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3282
01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Cause he was just like,</v>

3283
01:25:37.410 --> 01:25:41.190
<v Speaker 1>just drained mound Nurus sitting in front of a monitor all the time,</v>

3284
01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:42.380
<v Speaker 1>clicking and moving.</v>

3285
01:25:42.381 --> 01:25:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3286
01:25:42.690 --> 01:25:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3287
01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.350
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like the intervention for that,</v>

3288
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3289
01:25:45.801 --> 01:25:48.140
<v Speaker 2>if you were to sort of follow the guidelines,</v>

3290
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:49.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3291
01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:49.550
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3292
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:52.850
<v Speaker 2>of how you try and get people to sort of focus on other goals is you would just</v>

3293
01:25:52.851 --> 01:25:53.960
<v Speaker 2>start by asking him,</v>

3294
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.681
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3295
01:25:54.681 --> 01:25:56.300
<v Speaker 2>why are you good at making money in this game?</v>

3296
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.750
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

3297
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:57.350
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3298
01:25:57.350 --> 01:26:01.410
<v Speaker 2>what does it take in terms of skill or commitment or reserve?</v>

3299
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.090
<v Speaker 2>What are you,</v>

3300
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.601
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

3301
01:26:02.601 --> 01:26:03.320
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3302
01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.153
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3303
01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:07.280
<v Speaker 2>and start to think about strengths and abilities.</v>

3304
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:08.360
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

3305
01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:09.193
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3306
01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.590
<v Speaker 2>when you are thinking about yourself and what you're good at and what you're</v>

3307
01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:13.424
<v Speaker 2>capable of,</v>

3308
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:15.080
<v Speaker 2>it kind of takes you out of,</v>

3309
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:15.831
<v Speaker 2>you own it.</v>

3310
01:26:15.831 --> 01:26:16.664
<v Speaker 2>It's not the game,</v>

3311
01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:16.881
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3312
01:26:16.881 --> 01:26:20.180
<v Speaker 2>The game isn't making you successful or happy.</v>

3313
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.100
<v Speaker 2>It's your own skills and abilities.</v>

3314
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:23.930
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to be,</v>

3315
01:26:23.931 --> 01:26:25.160
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the scientific literature,</v>

3316
01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:28.580
<v Speaker 2>just talking about what you own and what,</v>

3317
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:33.610
<v Speaker 2>what is a result of your skills and abilities that that helps you broaden that.</v>

3318
01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.640
<v Speaker 2>So you realize you can apply that elsewhere.</v>

3319
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:39.170
<v Speaker 2>There might be other venues.</v>

3320
01:26:39.171 --> 01:26:42.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not the game that's giving this to me and this is something that I own.</v>

3321
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:43.723
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3322
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:46.640
<v Speaker 2>That's so hard to intellectualize.</v>

3323
01:26:46.641 --> 01:26:48.060
<v Speaker 2>Now when you're in the grips of addiction.</v>

3324
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.470
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

3325
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3326
01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.610
<v Speaker 2>It's why this is just like questions in my book that like literally you can ask</v>

3327
01:26:52.611 --> 01:26:56.100
<v Speaker 2>someone or you can ask yourself so that you don't have to intellectualize it.</v>

3328
01:26:56.101 --> 01:26:56.934
<v Speaker 2>And we just do the,</v>

3329
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:57.240
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

3330
01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:58.580
<v Speaker 2>there are a hundred quests in the book.</v>

3331
01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:59.900
<v Speaker 2>You just do what I do.</v>

3332
01:26:59.901 --> 01:27:00.651
<v Speaker 2>What I tell you to do.</v>

3333
01:27:00.651 --> 01:27:02.330
<v Speaker 2>They're all designed like little game missions.</v>

3334
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3335
01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:03.913
<v Speaker 2>because it is,</v>

3336
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:05.090
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

3337
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:06.650
<v Speaker 2>it is hard to change your mindset.</v>

3338
01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:06.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3339
01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:07.701
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely hard,</v>

3340
01:27:07.701 --> 01:27:11.840
<v Speaker 2>but what we know from studies of all kinds of mindset interventions is that once</v>

3341
01:27:11.841 --> 01:27:12.381
<v Speaker 2>you do it,</v>

3342
01:27:12.381 --> 01:27:12.951
<v Speaker 2>it sticks.</v>

3343
01:27:12.951 --> 01:27:15.800
<v Speaker 2>So unlike a lot of forms of therapy or medication,</v>

3344
01:27:15.801 --> 01:27:17.810
<v Speaker 2>you have to take this pill for the rest of your life.</v>

3345
01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.550
<v Speaker 2>You have to be in therapy for years.</v>

3346
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:21.350
<v Speaker 2>If you can do a mindset intervention,</v>

3347
01:27:21.650 --> 01:27:22.250
<v Speaker 2>it's done,</v>

3348
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:23.120
<v Speaker 2>benefits are there,</v>

3349
01:27:23.121 --> 01:27:28.121
<v Speaker 2>it's locked in and you can have a five minute mindset intervention and,</v>

3350
01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.380
<v Speaker 2>and instead of taking,</v>

3351
01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:30.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3352
01:27:30.771 --> 01:27:32.480
<v Speaker 2>prescription for the rest of your life.</v>

3353
01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:37.040
<v Speaker 1>What I've found to mitigate my addiction problems or my addictive tendencies is</v>

3354
01:27:37.041 --> 01:27:38.540
<v Speaker 1>just do a bunch of different things.</v>

3355
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3356
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of different activities that I do and the reason why I'm doing so</v>

3357
01:27:42.951 --> 01:27:44.690
<v Speaker 1>many different things is to keep from locking out.</v>

3358
01:27:44.691 --> 01:27:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3359
01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.431
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3360
01:27:45.431 --> 01:27:47.920
<v Speaker 2>So you've like intuitively figured that out.</v>

3361
01:27:47.921 --> 01:27:48.160
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

3362
01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3363
01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Well I figured it out from trial and error over a long life of addiction.</v>

3364
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I grew up being addicted to a bunch of different things.</v>

3365
01:27:56.071 --> 01:27:58.900
<v Speaker 1>At first it was art and then it became martial arts.</v>

3366
01:27:59.230 --> 01:28:03.580
<v Speaker 1>And then as I got older it became standup comedy and it became a pool.</v>

3367
01:28:03.581 --> 01:28:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I had a real problem with pool to a point where my manager thought it was</v>

3368
01:28:06.671 --> 01:28:07.660
<v Speaker 1>ruining my career.</v>

3369
01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

3370
01:28:08.410 --> 01:28:09.310
<v Speaker 1>I was playing eight,</v>

3371
01:28:09.311 --> 01:28:10.001
<v Speaker 1>10 hours a day.</v>

3372
01:28:10.001 --> 01:28:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I was playing in tournaments.</v>

3373
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:12.160
<v Speaker 1>All I want to do was play pool.</v>

3374
01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I would go do my comedy sets and then I go play pool till three,</v>

3375
01:28:15.431 --> 01:28:16.480
<v Speaker 1>four o'clock in the morning.</v>

3376
01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:19.420
<v Speaker 1>And then I would get up in the morning and go workout.</v>

3377
01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:20.081
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3378
01:28:20.081 --> 01:28:20.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3379
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:21.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3380
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:23.440
<v Speaker 1>go do my comedy and do the same thing every night and all.</v>

3381
01:28:23.441 --> 01:28:24.820
<v Speaker 1>But all I was thinking about was the game.</v>

3382
01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about like knocking the balls into the hole.</v>

3383
01:28:27.581 --> 01:28:28.001
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

3384
01:28:28.001 --> 01:28:30.750
<v Speaker 1>they're the dopamine effect or whatever it is of,</v>

3385
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:31.703
<v Speaker 1>of winning,</v>

3386
01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.530
<v Speaker 1>of or of being successful,</v>

3387
01:28:33.531 --> 01:28:36.910
<v Speaker 1>of running out the table of having the ball do what you want it to do.</v>

3388
01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3389
01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:38.890
<v Speaker 1>And because it's so difficult,</v>

3390
01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:42.550
<v Speaker 1>the reward is so much like anything that's really,</v>

3391
01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:43.480
<v Speaker 1>like if you play a game,</v>

3392
01:28:43.481 --> 01:28:44.320
<v Speaker 1>it's really easy,</v>

3393
01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:46.780
<v Speaker 1>but when you win it doesn't mean anything.</v>

3394
01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:49.480
<v Speaker 1>But when you play a game that's really hard to do.</v>

3395
01:28:49.481 --> 01:28:50.660
<v Speaker 1>That reward is so</v>

3396
01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.360
<v Speaker 2>fucking exciting.</v>

3397
01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3398
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:56.500
<v Speaker 2>But this is interesting cause like you become a more interesting person as a</v>

3399
01:28:56.501 --> 01:28:58.780
<v Speaker 2>result of having all the things that you do.</v>

3400
01:28:58.781 --> 01:29:03.781
<v Speaker 2>Like you're like this really unusual that you have all of these things instead</v>

3401
01:29:04.291 --> 01:29:06.900
<v Speaker 2>of being hyper focused on one aspect.</v>

3402
01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:07.531
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3403
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:08.730
<v Speaker 2>so it's probably,</v>

3404
01:29:09.330 --> 01:29:10.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems like a good strategy.</v>

3405
01:29:10.770 --> 01:29:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a broad spectrum junkie.</v>

3406
01:29:13.710 --> 01:29:14.520
<v Speaker 2>That might be,</v>

3407
01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.710
<v Speaker 2>that could be like a recipe for a good life though.</v>

3408
01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

3409
01:29:17.170 --> 01:29:18.090
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of independent,</v>

3410
01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:20.070
<v Speaker 2>interested in that idea now.</v>

3411
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Like what you should that should,</v>

3412
01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:22.890
<v Speaker 2>that should be like a thing,</v>

3413
01:29:22.891 --> 01:29:24.420
<v Speaker 2>broad spectrum junkie.</v>

3414
01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:27.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean it works right now,</v>

3415
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:28.800
<v Speaker 2>but it could go off the rails.</v>

3416
01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:29.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3417
01:29:29.341 --> 01:29:30.174
<v Speaker 2>Well you gotta keep,</v>

3418
01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:30.990
<v Speaker 2>you gotta keep,</v>

3419
01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:35.250
<v Speaker 2>you gotta keep that circle why it's going off the rails several times in my</v>

3420
01:29:35.251 --> 01:29:35.880
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3421
01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:36.241
<v Speaker 2>But it's just,</v>

3422
01:29:36.241 --> 01:29:36.481
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

3423
01:29:36.481 --> 01:29:37.770
<v Speaker 2>even I like with running,</v>

3424
01:29:37.771 --> 01:29:38.290
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

3425
01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:41.040
<v Speaker 2>I definitely use running for my mental health.</v>

3426
01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3427
01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:45.510
<v Speaker 2>and if I get an injury that is really hard for me.</v>

3428
01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I have to replace it with something or else,</v>

3429
01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:49.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3430
01:29:49.651 --> 01:29:51.150
<v Speaker 2>you go into a depression.</v>

3431
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:52.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a big thing with Jujitsu guys.</v>

3432
01:29:52.991 --> 01:29:56.530
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for them to take the time off before they go back and train</v>

3433
01:29:56.531 --> 01:29:57.550
<v Speaker 1>again once they get injured.</v>

3434
01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3435
01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And I have a cup of chronic injuries that I have because one particular of a</v>

3436
01:30:02.861 --> 01:30:03.760
<v Speaker 1>back injury,</v>

3437
01:30:03.761 --> 01:30:05.890
<v Speaker 1>there was a bulging disc that I just would,</v>

3438
01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:06.820
<v Speaker 1>I would ignore.</v>

3439
01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3440
01:30:07.150 --> 01:30:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

3441
01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

3442
01:30:07.810 --> 01:30:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I would hurt it pretty bad.</v>

3443
01:30:09.610 --> 01:30:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And then two weeks later I'd be sparring again.</v>

3444
01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3445
01:30:12.010 --> 01:30:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Because I was just needed that rush.</v>

3446
01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3447
01:30:14.150 --> 01:30:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Until it got pretty chronic.</v>

3448
01:30:15.730 --> 01:30:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And then I had to take a long stretch off and really let it heal up.</v>

3449
01:30:18.821 --> 01:30:19.420
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

3450
01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:20.790
<v Speaker 2>can you give me that perspective?</v>

3451
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:21.780
<v Speaker 2>It feels like,</v>

3452
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3453
01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:25.290
<v Speaker 2>just hearing you say that makes me think how really how important is for people</v>

3454
01:30:25.291 --> 01:30:28.890
<v Speaker 2>to understand like how this system works so that you can say,</v>

3455
01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:29.760
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3456
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.760
<v Speaker 2>my brain's telling me to go back and work out now.</v>

3457
01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Even though my doctor said don't do it and I can Google and it says,</v>

3458
01:30:36.241 --> 01:30:37.500
<v Speaker 2>stay off it for six weeks.</v>

3459
01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3460
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:41.190
<v Speaker 2>and to understand your brain is telling you that because it wants a dopamine</v>

3461
01:30:41.191 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 2>hit.</v>

3462
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:44.400
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to rehabilitate properly,</v>

3463
01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:48.420
<v Speaker 2>you need to start doing other things that produce dopamine hits.</v>

3464
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:48.721
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

3465
01:30:48.721 --> 01:30:49.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3466
01:30:49.021 --> 01:30:51.030
<v Speaker 2>fantasy sports for example.</v>

3467
01:30:51.031 --> 01:30:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Do you get really into that for the season that you're taking off?</v>

3468
01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3469
01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.730
<v Speaker 2>because that's you're making predictions,</v>

3470
01:30:56.731 --> 01:30:57.600
<v Speaker 2>so that's really,</v>

3471
01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:58.750
<v Speaker 2>that's not good work.</v>

3472
01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:00.263
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't work for you.</v>

3473
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.960
<v Speaker 2>No chance works for a lot of people playing poker then not you need to be</v>

3474
01:31:03.961 --> 01:31:04.770
<v Speaker 2>active.</v>

3475
01:31:04.770 --> 01:31:05.380
<v Speaker 2>Physically active.</v>

3476
01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:05.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3477
01:31:05.621 --> 01:31:09.790
<v Speaker 1>There there's has to be actual physical movement and fucking that nervousness is</v>

3478
01:31:09.791 --> 01:31:11.740
<v Speaker 1>a big part of my adrenaline junky thing.</v>

3479
01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3480
01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.180
<v Speaker 1>It's actual nerves.</v>

3481
01:31:13.410 --> 01:31:15.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like playing poker is,</v>

3482
01:31:15.311 --> 01:31:16.840
<v Speaker 1>it was never exciting to me.</v>

3483
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Even if like people are gambling for a lot of money,</v>

3484
01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:23.830
<v Speaker 1>whereas playing pool is extremely exciting because there's the execution,</v>

3485
01:31:23.831 --> 01:31:25.300
<v Speaker 1>the physical explanation of things.</v>

3486
01:31:25.330 --> 01:31:26.650
<v Speaker 1>So you're going into flow state.</v>

3487
01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3488
01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:28.210
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is,</v>

3489
01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:28.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3490
01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.313
<v Speaker 1>Too much.</v>

3491
01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3492
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I think my brain was wired with martial arts and competing,</v>

3493
01:31:33.550 --> 01:31:36.250
<v Speaker 1>which is extremely exciting,</v>

3494
01:31:36.251 --> 01:31:40.070
<v Speaker 1>but dangerous and thrilling and the thrills or so high,</v>

3495
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:45.400
<v Speaker 1>like the thrills of competing or just beyond anything that you can ever get from</v>

3496
01:31:45.401 --> 01:31:47.740
<v Speaker 1>something that's nonphysical nonthreatening.</v>

3497
01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:48.760
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3498
01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:52.630
<v Speaker 1>it's high level problem solving with dire physical health consequences.</v>

3499
01:31:52.690 --> 01:31:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3500
01:31:53.290 --> 01:31:57.250
<v Speaker 1>So there's all sorts of craziness involved in it and the intensity and the focus</v>

3501
01:31:57.251 --> 01:31:58.084
<v Speaker 1>that you need.</v>

3502
01:31:58.450 --> 01:32:00.340
<v Speaker 1>So you that guy on the skateboard</v>

3503
01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:01.241
<v Speaker 2>really well then.</v>

3504
01:32:01.241 --> 01:32:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3505
01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:02.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3506
01:32:02.071 --> 01:32:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Two well that's what's scary about it to me.</v>

3507
01:32:03.961 --> 01:32:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3508
01:32:04.290 --> 01:32:07.620
<v Speaker 1>That could have fucking easily been me when I was 17 or 18 years old.</v>

3509
01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I understand all that shit.</v>

3510
01:32:10.201 --> 01:32:12.720
<v Speaker 1>That's why one of the things that freaked me out the most about those people</v>

3511
01:32:12.721 --> 01:32:15.900
<v Speaker 1>that are tight rope walking and doing all the jumping,</v>

3512
01:32:15.901 --> 01:32:19.080
<v Speaker 1>those squirrel suits or they jump off of cliffs and fly around.</v>

3513
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3514
01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:20.951
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't know.</v>

3515
01:32:20.951 --> 01:32:22.740
<v Speaker 1>It freaks me out is that I get it.</v>

3516
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3517
01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:24.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what freaks me out.</v>

3518
01:32:24.121 --> 01:32:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3519
01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:25.171
<v Speaker 1>Race,</v>

3520
01:32:25.171 --> 01:32:25.951
<v Speaker 1>car driving,</v>

3521
01:32:25.951 --> 01:32:26.730
<v Speaker 1>all that shit is like,</v>

3522
01:32:26.730 --> 01:32:28.530
<v Speaker 1>I understand what this guy's doing.</v>

3523
01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:32.970
<v Speaker 1>He's feeding that monster in his brain that needs to be shocked and scared and</v>

3524
01:32:32.971 --> 01:32:36.000
<v Speaker 1>thrilled and what's next and you know,</v>

3525
01:32:36.001 --> 01:32:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like you feel alive,</v>

3526
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:40.120
<v Speaker 1>not just feel alive but hyper.</v>

3527
01:32:40.130 --> 01:32:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3528
01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:40.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3529
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:41.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3530
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Hyper alive in a very hot,</v>

3531
01:32:42.711 --> 01:32:46.370
<v Speaker 2>it's funny cause you were asking about focus earlier and obviously when you go</v>

3532
01:32:46.371 --> 01:32:50.180
<v Speaker 2>into that like the intense state where there is high stakes,</v>

3533
01:32:50.181 --> 01:32:50.900
<v Speaker 2>high risk,</v>

3534
01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:51.860
<v Speaker 2>your attention,</v>

3535
01:32:51.861 --> 01:32:53.390
<v Speaker 2>it's so super focused,</v>

3536
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:56.660
<v Speaker 2>a time slows down and you're able to see more process more.</v>

3537
01:32:57.170 --> 01:32:58.430
<v Speaker 2>So that could be part of,</v>

3538
01:32:58.460 --> 01:32:59.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean did you,</v>

3539
01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.950
<v Speaker 2>you're interested in,</v>

3540
01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:06.200
<v Speaker 2>in focus because that's a part of that experience at high,</v>

3541
01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:07.490
<v Speaker 2>which you don't get.</v>

3542
01:33:07.491 --> 01:33:07.700
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3543
01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's lots of highs where you're not going to happen.</v>

3544
01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:11.990
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of heightened focus and attend.</v>

3545
01:33:12.090 --> 01:33:16.260
<v Speaker 1>There's that and there's this state of peace that's achieved when you've</v>

3546
01:33:16.261 --> 01:33:20.940
<v Speaker 1>overcome almost insurmountable obstacles and fear and nervousness,</v>

3547
01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:22.290
<v Speaker 1>everything else,</v>

3548
01:33:22.770 --> 01:33:27.680
<v Speaker 1>like whatever weird problems that you might be dealing with,</v>

3549
01:33:27.710 --> 01:33:28.740
<v Speaker 1>with your personal life.</v>

3550
01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.780
<v Speaker 1>They seem so inconsequential.</v>

3551
01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:31.291
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3552
01:33:31.291 --> 01:33:31.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3553
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:35.370
<v Speaker 1>like when I would have like a relationship problems or girl,</v>

3554
01:33:35.371 --> 01:33:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I was dating some craziness.</v>

3555
01:33:37.261 --> 01:33:38.094
<v Speaker 1>We're about to break up.</v>

3556
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I would go spar and I would be like,</v>

3557
01:33:40.231 --> 01:33:41.970
<v Speaker 1>who gives a fuck?</v>

3558
01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3559
01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:42.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3560
01:33:42.571 --> 01:33:42.730
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3561
01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:43.351
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3562
01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:43.690
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

3563
01:33:43.690 --> 01:33:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time having this conversation with this girl I was dating was</v>

3564
01:33:46.651 --> 01:33:48.480
<v Speaker 1>like so dramatic and nonsense.</v>

3565
01:33:48.481 --> 01:33:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3566
01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.550
<v Speaker 1>so then I guess we're breaking up.</v>

3567
01:33:50.610 --> 01:33:50.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3568
01:33:50.971 --> 01:33:51.804
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

3569
01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:52.771
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>

3570
01:33:52.771 --> 01:33:53.431
<v Speaker 1>Like I fuck,</v>

3571
01:33:53.431 --> 01:33:54.264
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>

3572
01:33:54.570 --> 01:33:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Like either we like each other or we don't like each other.</v>

3573
01:33:56.591 --> 01:33:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Either they're going to hang out and have fun or we're not going to hang out</v>

3574
01:33:58.981 --> 01:33:59.341
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

3575
01:33:59.341 --> 01:33:59.461
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3576
01:33:59.461 --> 01:34:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>

3577
01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3578
01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:00.871
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3579
01:34:00.871 --> 01:34:01.700
<v Speaker 1>you're so cold,</v>

3580
01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:03.690
<v Speaker 1>your early twenties.</v>

3581
01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:04.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3582
01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:05.100
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3583
01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Fucking to do you really gain perspective instead of wallowing around in this,</v>

3584
01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:15.050
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's an addictive aspect of relationships to breakup,</v>

3585
01:34:15.090 --> 01:34:16.850
<v Speaker 1>makeup thing of the,</v>

3586
01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:18.420
<v Speaker 1>the highs and the lows of like,</v>

3587
01:34:18.670 --> 01:34:23.220
<v Speaker 1>there are some people that are addicted to arguing in relationships.</v>

3588
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3589
01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:23.970
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3590
01:34:23.970 --> 01:34:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Falling in love is an addiction.</v>

3591
01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3592
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3593
01:34:26.850 --> 01:34:29.070
<v Speaker 2>it's literally the same process.</v>

3594
01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:31.110
<v Speaker 2>It's the narrowing of attention on one day.</v>

3595
01:34:31.111 --> 01:34:33.510
<v Speaker 2>The only that person gets you that excited gets you that,</v>

3596
01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:34.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3597
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:35.790
<v Speaker 2>the bunch of biological tricks.</v>

3598
01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3599
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:36.391
<v Speaker 2>Age too,</v>

3600
01:34:36.391 --> 01:34:38.070
<v Speaker 2>because your body's trying to get you to breed.</v>

3601
01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3602
01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.420
<v Speaker 2>And what's really,</v>

3603
01:34:39.450 --> 01:34:42.330
<v Speaker 2>then you get the really problematic relationships when that happens for one</v>

3604
01:34:42.331 --> 01:34:43.380
<v Speaker 2>person and not the other.</v>

3605
01:34:43.381 --> 01:34:44.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's why you get stalkers.</v>

3606
01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3607
01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:46.050
<v Speaker 2>Well you get like,</v>

3608
01:34:46.050 --> 01:34:46.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

3609
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:49.410
<v Speaker 2>it's why it's why somebody seems you don't understand.</v>

3610
01:34:49.411 --> 01:34:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're dating and you kind of liked that person,</v>

3611
01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.370
<v Speaker 2>but they're already there down the road.</v>

3612
01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:54.480
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3613
01:34:54.630 --> 01:34:55.463
<v Speaker 2>they are there,</v>

3614
01:34:55.530 --> 01:34:56.251
<v Speaker 2>they are in love,</v>

3615
01:34:56.251 --> 01:34:57.084
<v Speaker 2>they are addicted.</v>

3616
01:34:57.530 --> 01:35:01.430
<v Speaker 2>And then your behavior might seem totally crazy to me because I'm not there yet.</v>

3617
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:03.020
<v Speaker 2>And even though I liked you,</v>

3618
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:06.320
<v Speaker 2>because you're further along in that process and that sort of narrowing of</v>

3619
01:35:06.321 --> 01:35:07.154
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

3620
01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:07.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3621
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I freak out where it's,</v>

3622
01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:09.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3623
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:11.900
<v Speaker 2>maybe if I had waited a few more weeks,</v>

3624
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I might've been that I might've been far enough along that it actually doesn't</v>

3625
01:35:16.581 --> 01:35:17.330
<v Speaker 2>scare me off.</v>

3626
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:17.511
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3627
01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:19.520
<v Speaker 2>like people who fall in love at different rates.</v>

3628
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

3629
01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:24.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not totally though that you're a crazy person and I'm a normal person and</v>

3630
01:35:24.201 --> 01:35:25.460
<v Speaker 2>therefore I shouldn't date you.</v>

3631
01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:26.630
<v Speaker 2>It's just your further,</v>

3632
01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:29.420
<v Speaker 2>the biochemical processes look a little faster for you.</v>

3633
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:30.643
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3634
01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:30.950
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3635
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:34.310
<v Speaker 2>I think like there are couples who break up too soon because one of them came</v>

3636
01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:38.660
<v Speaker 2>kind of cut further along in the addiction process and the other what a weird</v>

3637
01:35:38.661 --> 01:35:39.494
<v Speaker 2>way to look at it.</v>

3638
01:35:40.170 --> 01:35:40.770
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3639
01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:40.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3640
01:35:40.981 --> 01:35:43.860
<v Speaker 1>and also it's like the same exact person.</v>

3641
01:35:43.890 --> 01:35:46.650
<v Speaker 1>You could meet them six months later and they're perfect,</v>

3642
01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:47.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3643
01:35:47.610 --> 01:35:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3644
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Or you meet them right now because maybe they have enough going on yeah.</v>

3645
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:52.250
<v Speaker 2>In their life that they fall in love slower.</v>

3646
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3647
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:53.011
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3648
01:35:53.011 --> 01:35:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Because you'll fall in love faster if there's nothing else getting you excited</v>

3649
01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:57.900
<v Speaker 2>in your day.</v>

3650
01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3651
01:35:58.220 --> 01:35:58.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3652
01:35:58.311 --> 01:36:00.080
<v Speaker 1>it's also that term fall in love.</v>

3653
01:36:00.081 --> 01:36:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

3654
01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.910
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is going on there?</v>

3655
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that mean?</v>

3656
01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3657
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3658
01:36:03.621 --> 01:36:08.621
<v Speaker 1>you're just sinking up whatever personality aspects that you have holes and</v>

3659
01:36:09.170 --> 01:36:12.710
<v Speaker 1>square pegs in round holes and everyone's trying to figure out where everything</v>

3660
01:36:12.711 --> 01:36:13.341
<v Speaker 1>fits in.</v>

3661
01:36:13.341 --> 01:36:16.160
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also a weird thing where,</v>

3662
01:36:16.530 --> 01:36:16.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3663
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:20.810
<v Speaker 1>we've all had friends that alter who they are when they start dating someone.</v>

3664
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3665
01:36:21.090 --> 01:36:23.300
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange to see too,</v>

3666
01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:24.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3667
01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:28.100
<v Speaker 1>like they'll stop talking to some of their friends or they change their behavior</v>

3668
01:36:28.101 --> 01:36:29.960
<v Speaker 1>pretty radically and you're like,</v>

3669
01:36:29.961 --> 01:36:30.321
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3670
01:36:30.321 --> 01:36:30.730
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

3671
01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:34.340
<v Speaker 1>You're like fitting in to this mold of the other person requires.</v>

3672
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3673
01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Like one person is either more dominant or you're both like super fucking</v>

3674
01:36:38.901 --> 01:36:39.731
<v Speaker 1>codependence.</v>

3675
01:36:39.731 --> 01:36:41.450
<v Speaker 1>So you need each other all the time.</v>

3676
01:36:41.490 --> 01:36:42.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3677
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:43.223
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend.</v>

3678
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:45.530
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker can't go anywhere without his girlfriend.</v>

3679
01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.000
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't do anything without her.</v>

3680
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:47.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3681
01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

3682
01:36:48.190 --> 01:36:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

3683
01:36:48.930 --> 01:36:50.810
<v Speaker 1>w invite them over for a podcast.</v>

3684
01:36:50.811 --> 01:36:51.141
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

3685
01:36:51.141 --> 01:36:51.974

3686
01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:52.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3687
01:36:52.551 --> 01:36:53.540
<v Speaker 1>come on over for the game.</v>

3688
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:53.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3689
01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:54.920
<v Speaker 1>she's here to great.</v>

3690
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3691
01:36:55.451 --> 01:36:57.620
<v Speaker 1>like he doesn't go to the movies,</v>

3692
01:36:57.621 --> 01:36:58.820
<v Speaker 1>didn't do anything like they were like,</v>

3693
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:59.390
<v Speaker 1>does he,</v>

3694
01:36:59.390 --> 01:37:00.180
<v Speaker 1>is he happy?</v>

3695
01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:01.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking mess.</v>

3696
01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:02.533
<v Speaker 1>He's a mess.</v>

3697
01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:06.590
<v Speaker 1>But the two of them are a mess together and it's like in escapable pair.</v>

3698
01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:07.453
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

3699
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:08.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3700
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.910
<v Speaker 2>That may,</v>

3701
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:10.743
<v Speaker 2>they're happy,</v>

3702
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:11.231
<v Speaker 2>messy,</v>

3703
01:37:11.231 --> 01:37:11.840
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

3704
01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

3705
01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:12.881
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

3706
01:37:12.881 --> 01:37:13.680
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

3707
01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>

3708
01:37:14.230 --> 01:37:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3709
01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3710
01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:16.950
<v Speaker 1>what is happiness?</v>

3711
01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:17.941
<v Speaker 1>That's strange.</v>

3712
01:37:17.941 --> 01:37:18.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3713
01:37:18.151 --> 01:37:19.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're not depressed.</v>

3714
01:37:19.381 --> 01:37:20.550
<v Speaker 1>They're not jumping off bridges.</v>

3715
01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3716
01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:21.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3717
01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:21.841
<v Speaker 1>the Bolton,</v>

3718
01:37:21.841 --> 01:37:24.330
<v Speaker 1>they're not shooting heroin and that was all sounds good.</v>

3719
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3720
01:37:26.251 --> 01:37:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

3721
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:29.670
<v Speaker 1>what is it that makes people addicted to each other?</v>

3722
01:37:29.671 --> 01:37:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Cause they most certainly get addicted to each other.</v>

3723
01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3724
01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Like the feeling when someone breaks up with you when you can't believe they're</v>

3725
01:37:35.491 --> 01:37:35.701
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

3726
01:37:35.701 --> 01:37:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3727
01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3728
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:37.161
<v Speaker 1>Like that is like,</v>

3729
01:37:37.161 --> 01:37:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll like someone's stolen something from you.</v>

3730
01:37:39.541 --> 01:37:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Like they've stolen your happiness by taking off and just simply leaving you</v>

3731
01:37:44.131 --> 01:37:44.730
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

3732
01:37:44.730 --> 01:37:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3733
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3734
01:37:46.050 --> 01:37:46.620
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3735
01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:46.981
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

3736
01:37:46.981 --> 01:37:50.290
<v Speaker 1>they are a part of you like your whole,</v>

3737
01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:51.320
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3738
01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:51.620
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3739
01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:53.370
<v Speaker 1>your whole is missing a slice.</v>

3740
01:37:53.610 --> 01:37:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3741
01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole of,</v>

3742
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I know that</v>

3743
01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:58.140
<v Speaker 2>it means all the metaphors that people use.</v>

3744
01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.540
<v Speaker 2>It really does feel that way.</v>

3745
01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3746
01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3747
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:02.500
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that a biological trick?</v>

3748
01:38:02.501 --> 01:38:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Just to get us to breed,</v>

3749
01:38:03.551 --> 01:38:06.670
<v Speaker 1>like you stick around long enough to make a baby and then,</v>

3750
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:07.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3751
01:38:07.271 --> 01:38:09.500
<v Speaker 1>fall in love with the baby so that you raise it and so that,</v>

3752
01:38:09.501 --> 01:38:13.030
<v Speaker 1>that baby can go and have a baby in the sense of community that you have all</v>

3753
01:38:13.031 --> 01:38:15.850
<v Speaker 1>sorts of is addictive and it keeps you together,</v>

3754
01:38:15.851 --> 01:38:17.290
<v Speaker 1>which ensures survival.</v>

3755
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.621
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3756
01:38:17.621 --> 01:38:17.741
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3757
01:38:17.741 --> 01:38:19.480
<v Speaker 2>that's why cooperation feels good.</v>

3758
01:38:19.481 --> 01:38:21.100
<v Speaker 2>It's why kindness feels good.</v>

3759
01:38:21.190 --> 01:38:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3760
01:38:21.670 --> 01:38:22.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm still tricky.</v>

3761
01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.201
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3762
01:38:23.201 --> 01:38:23.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

3763
01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:24.161
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3764
01:38:24.161 --> 01:38:24.910
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

3765
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:25.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3766
01:38:25.151 --> 01:38:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very practical person.</v>

3767
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:29.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think I try to help people feel good.</v>

3768
01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I want to feel good,</v>

3769
01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:32.470
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3770
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:33.760
<v Speaker 2>cooperation and kindness.</v>

3771
01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:34.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3772
01:38:34.450 --> 01:38:39.190
<v Speaker 2>those things help society and help evolution and like we're stronger together.</v>

3773
01:38:39.310 --> 01:38:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3774
01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:40.713
<v Speaker 2>And it feels good.</v>

3775
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3776
01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:42.100
<v Speaker 2>like that's,</v>

3777
01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:44.110
<v Speaker 2>that's practical and you and I don't mind that.</v>

3778
01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:44.830
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3779
01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:46.120
<v Speaker 2>evolution is kind of tricking me.</v>

3780
01:38:46.121 --> 01:38:46.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3781
01:38:46.301 --> 01:38:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I have two babies.</v>

3782
01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I have a seven month old twin daughters.</v>

3783
01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3784
01:38:51.970 --> 01:38:52.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3785
01:38:52.570 --> 01:38:52.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3786
01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:53.020
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3787
01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:54.880
<v Speaker 2>if this is a trick of biology,</v>

3788
01:38:54.881 --> 01:38:56.110
<v Speaker 2>how I feel about them,</v>

3789
01:38:56.170 --> 01:38:58.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally cool with that because it feels good.</v>

3790
01:38:58.450 --> 01:38:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3791
01:38:58.870 --> 01:39:00.470
<v Speaker 2>That's biology's trick to me.</v>

3792
01:39:00.471 --> 01:39:01.480
<v Speaker 2>It tells me it feels good.</v>

3793
01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:02.141
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

3794
01:39:02.141 --> 01:39:02.471
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

3795
01:39:02.471 --> 01:39:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Biology for giving me these feelings I never have before.</v>

3796
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3797
01:39:06.751 --> 01:39:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can kind of intellectualize it down to the point where it's no longer</v>

3798
01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:11.250
<v Speaker 1>enjoyable cause he's,</v>

3799
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:16.260
<v Speaker 1>it isn't life itself a trick in a sense because it's really temporary no matter</v>

3800
01:39:16.261 --> 01:39:16.621
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

3801
01:39:16.621 --> 01:39:18.800
<v Speaker 1>You can accumulate all the Audis and,</v>

3802
01:39:18.801 --> 01:39:20.970
<v Speaker 1>and beautiful houses and boats you want,</v>

3803
01:39:20.971 --> 01:39:23.070
<v Speaker 1>but the end of the day it's over.</v>

3804
01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:23.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3805
01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:27.600
<v Speaker 1>like you use the sunrises and sunsets and you've got a certain amount of time</v>

3806
01:39:27.601 --> 01:39:28.434
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>

3807
01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.840
<v Speaker 1>So you can intellectualize that to the point where we're like,</v>

3808
01:39:30.841 --> 01:39:32.010
<v Speaker 1>well then what's the fucking point?</v>

3809
01:39:32.250 --> 01:39:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to end it now.</v>

3810
01:39:33.541 --> 01:39:35.040
<v Speaker 1>And some people do do that.</v>

3811
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:40.070
<v Speaker 1>They almost get to this thing where they can't be in the moment because they</v>

3812
01:39:40.111 --> 01:39:41.790
<v Speaker 1>don't know how long the moment lasts.</v>

3813
01:39:41.791 --> 01:39:45.120
<v Speaker 1>And the anticipation of the moment ending is just too freaky.</v>

3814
01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.320
<v Speaker 1>So like fuck this,</v>

3815
01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>

3816
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:50.190
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of the same thing as my friend who can't play the video game if he's</v>

3817
01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:51.660
<v Speaker 1>going to lose and he pulls the plug.</v>

3818
01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean really there's a lot of lot of the same sort of qualities and</v>

3819
01:39:56.041 --> 01:39:57.720
<v Speaker 1>characteristics of that kind of thinking.</v>

3820
01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:58.773
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3821
01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:03.570
<v Speaker 1>there's over intellectualizing or over analyzing to the point where you can't</v>

3822
01:40:03.571 --> 01:40:04.920
<v Speaker 1>even enjoy what it is.</v>

3823
01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I really want to work on this friend of yours like a figure like</v>

3824
01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:09.920
<v Speaker 2>video games therapy to like,</v>

3825
01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:12.680
<v Speaker 2>well it sounds like an interesting project EGOMANIAC.</v>

3826
01:40:12.681 --> 01:40:15.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do it too much problems.</v>

3827
01:40:15.170 --> 01:40:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I like by like I liked,</v>

3828
01:40:16.090 --> 01:40:16.271
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

3829
01:40:16.271 --> 01:40:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Like how would you help somebody who can't lose</v>

3830
01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:22.410
<v Speaker 1>usually be so happy that you're trying to help them because that means you're</v>

3831
01:40:22.411 --> 01:40:23.244
<v Speaker 1>talking about him.</v>

3832
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:25.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're focusing on him.</v>

3833
01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:28.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of awe but no,</v>

3834
01:40:28.171 --> 01:40:28.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's alive.</v>

3835
01:40:28.861 --> 01:40:31.740
<v Speaker 1>He lives in America is not an Ethiopia living in a grass house,</v>

3836
01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:32.101
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3837
01:40:32.101 --> 01:40:33.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's lucky as fuck.</v>

3838
01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3839
01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:35.930
<v Speaker 1>You got to think I,</v>

3840
01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3841
01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.140
<v Speaker 1>it's at a certain point in time that there's,</v>

3842
01:40:40.141 --> 01:40:40.974
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3843
01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:43.020
<v Speaker 1>there's levels to,</v>

3844
01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:45.870
<v Speaker 1>to like happiness and harmony,</v>

3845
01:40:45.871 --> 01:40:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the harmony that you achieve with the environment that you find yourself in and</v>

3846
01:40:50.071 --> 01:40:55.071
<v Speaker 1>the more chaos that you create and the more problems that you create just to</v>

3847
01:40:55.391 --> 01:40:56.980
<v Speaker 1>solve those problems.</v>

3848
01:40:57.190 --> 01:40:57.631
<v Speaker 1>It's got it,</v>

3849
01:40:57.631 --> 01:41:01.840
<v Speaker 1>that that energy keeps you from doing something else and that energy is going to</v>

3850
01:41:01.841 --> 01:41:04.390
<v Speaker 1>block you from the other pursuits.</v>

3851
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3852
01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:06.200
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

3853
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3854
01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:07.311
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3855
01:41:07.311 --> 01:41:11.600
<v Speaker 2>you need to take committed action towards positive things</v>

3856
01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:12.553
<v Speaker 1>and in a sense,</v>

3857
01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:14.510
<v Speaker 1>the entirety of your life</v>

3858
01:41:14.650 --> 01:41:15.483
<v Speaker 2>is again,</v>

3859
01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.473
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

3860
01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.553
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3861
01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.513
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

3862
01:41:19.090 --> 01:41:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I have a kind of funny story about that.</v>

3863
01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3864
01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:22.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3865
01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I did the Colbert report a few years ago and when you did that,</v>

3866
01:41:26.051 --> 01:41:27.010
<v Speaker 2>she'd break character.</v>

3867
01:41:27.130 --> 01:41:28.330
<v Speaker 2>So when he comes,</v>

3868
01:41:28.810 --> 01:41:29.643
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3869
01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:30.250
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3870
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:30.641
<v Speaker 2>not well,</v>

3871
01:41:30.641 --> 01:41:31.100
<v Speaker 2>not exactly.</v>

3872
01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:34.630
<v Speaker 2>He comes in the dressing room beforehand and they don't do a pre show interview</v>

3873
01:41:34.631 --> 01:41:36.940
<v Speaker 2>because they want you to be kind of off guard and off balance.</v>

3874
01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:39.250
<v Speaker 2>And he comes in and he says,</v>

3875
01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:39.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3876
01:41:39.461 --> 01:41:40.390
<v Speaker 2>have you seen the show?</v>

3877
01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:40.631
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3878
01:41:40.631 --> 01:41:42.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be in character and a,</v>

3879
01:41:42.671 --> 01:41:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be really stupid and stubborn and your job is to disabuse me of my</v>

3880
01:41:46.211 --> 01:41:48.400
<v Speaker 2>stupid and stubborn ideas.</v>

3881
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3882
01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:49.841
<v Speaker 2>and they said,</v>

3883
01:41:49.841 --> 01:41:50.980
<v Speaker 2>now let me ask you a question,</v>

3884
01:41:52.210 --> 01:41:53.043
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3885
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.830

01:41:54.851 --> 01:41:55.570
<v Speaker 2>a game.</v>

3889
01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:56.530
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3893
01:41:59.770 --> 01:42:00.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3894
01:42:01.090 --> 01:42:01.990
<v Speaker 2>is this like I am,</v>

3895
01:42:01.991 --> 01:42:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3896
01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:04.960
<v Speaker 2>are we practicing some kind of witty rapport for the show or whatever.</v>

3897
01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.381
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

3898
01:42:05.381 --> 01:42:06.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to go into that mode.</v>

3899
01:42:06.431 --> 01:42:06.791
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3900
01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:07.001
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3901
01:42:07.001 --> 01:42:07.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3902
01:42:07.211 --> 01:42:07.511
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3903
01:42:07.511 --> 01:42:08.171
<v Speaker 2>of course it is.</v>

3904
01:42:08.171 --> 01:42:09.004
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

3905
01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:11.770
<v Speaker 2>if life is a game and we spend all our time playing it,</v>

3906
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:13.600
<v Speaker 2>why are we so bad at it?</v>

3907
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:14.770
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3908
01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:15.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm like totally thrown off of Mike.</v>

3909
01:42:15.971 --> 01:42:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Is he being like Phyllis,</v>

3910
01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:17.793
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>

3911
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:18.191
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

3912
01:42:18.191 --> 01:42:20.470
<v Speaker 2>it turned out he was actually being quite philosophical and he had like,</v>

3913
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:21.910
<v Speaker 2>he had all of these,</v>

3914
01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:22.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3915
01:42:22.331 --> 01:42:23.470
<v Speaker 2>sort of thoughts about,</v>

3916
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:24.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3917
01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3918
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:26.800
<v Speaker 2>we've started mentioning philosophy books,</v>

3919
01:42:26.801 --> 01:42:27.640
<v Speaker 2>he'd ride and everything.</v>

3920
01:42:27.641 --> 01:42:28.210
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3921
01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:28.331
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3922
01:42:28.331 --> 01:42:28.580
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3923
01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:28.990
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

3924
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.823
<v Speaker 2>not like a,</v>

3925
01:42:30.190 --> 01:42:30.791
<v Speaker 2>not like a,</v>

3926
01:42:30.791 --> 01:42:31.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3927
01:42:31.271 --> 01:42:33.490
<v Speaker 2>ready like banter practice.</v>

3928
01:42:33.491 --> 01:42:34.001
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

3929
01:42:34.001 --> 01:42:35.800
<v Speaker 2>really thinking about that.</v>

3930
01:42:35.801 --> 01:42:36.400
<v Speaker 2>And I always,</v>

3931
01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.233
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3932
01:42:37.470 --> 01:42:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I have an,</v>

3933
01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:42.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean to return to that question and try to come up with a better answer for</v>

3934
01:42:42.401 --> 01:42:43.190
<v Speaker 2>him someday.</v>

3935
01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:43.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3936
01:42:43.341 --> 01:42:45.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a complicated game and there's no instruction book.</v>

3937
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:47.180
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're so bad at it.</v>

3938
01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:47.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3939
01:42:47.471 --> 01:42:50.120
<v Speaker 1>it's not everybody's bad and you run into people,</v>

3940
01:42:50.121 --> 01:42:50.331
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

3941
01:42:50.331 --> 01:42:50.691
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3942
01:42:50.691 --> 01:42:53.660
<v Speaker 1>this person is a really cool game going on.</v>

3943
01:42:53.690 --> 01:42:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3944
01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:54.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3945
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:57.440
<v Speaker 1>but it is just a game.</v>

3946
01:42:57.670 --> 01:43:02.480
<v Speaker 1>And essentially what the problem is that there's loaded words,</v>

3947
01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:05.000
<v Speaker 1>like the word addiction is a loaded word.</v>

3948
01:43:05.001 --> 01:43:06.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a loaded term.</v>

3949
01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I think the word game is a loaded term too.</v>

3950
01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:13.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated series of events that you're trying to manage.</v>

3951
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3952
01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:18.880
<v Speaker 1>And you're trying to manage risk and reward and benefit and then positive and</v>

3953
01:43:19.131 --> 01:43:21.080
<v Speaker 1>negative aspects of behavior.</v>

3954
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:22.131
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

3955
01:43:22.131 --> 01:43:23.660
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same as the game.</v>

3956
01:43:23.661 --> 01:43:25.160
<v Speaker 1>They're completely indistinguishable.</v>

3957
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3958
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:29.240
<v Speaker 1>It's one of them is just open ended and there's,</v>

3959
01:43:29.490 --> 01:43:29.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3960
01:43:29.721 --> 01:43:31.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no clear pathway.</v>

3961
01:43:31.311 --> 01:43:35.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a game that literally you're standing in the middle of the universe,</v>

3962
01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

3963
01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:41.200
<v Speaker 1>And especially in 2015 if you have the means you can get on a plane and go to</v>

3964
01:43:41.211 --> 01:43:42.680
<v Speaker 1>another part of the game.</v>

3965
01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:43.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3966
01:43:43.251 --> 01:43:45.980
<v Speaker 1>you could just hop on a plane and you know,</v>

3967
01:43:45.981 --> 01:43:48.260
<v Speaker 1>we were talking before this podcast started about,</v>

3968
01:43:48.261 --> 01:43:48.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3969
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:49.550
<v Speaker 1>the radio lab,</v>

3970
01:43:49.570 --> 01:43:51.860
<v Speaker 1>a podcast that's today,</v>

3971
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:52.611
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3972
01:43:52.611 --> 01:43:54.800
<v Speaker 1>about that guy who was on my podcast,</v>

3973
01:43:54.801 --> 01:43:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Cory Nolton and shot that Rhino.</v>

3974
01:43:56.930 --> 01:44:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a guy who took the game and decided to go to a fucking place.</v>

3975
01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:03.380
<v Speaker 1>He totally doesn't belong or has never,</v>

3976
01:44:03.381 --> 01:44:03.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3977
01:44:03.651 --> 01:44:05.090
<v Speaker 1>never is not born there,</v>

3978
01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:06.950
<v Speaker 1>whatever shouldn't say doesn't belong,</v>

3979
01:44:06.951 --> 01:44:10.910
<v Speaker 1>but a completely different area of the game and he's doing something over there</v>

3980
01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:12.800
<v Speaker 1>and everybody over on this part of the game,</v>

3981
01:44:12.801 --> 01:44:13.071
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3982
01:44:13.071 --> 01:44:15.380
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing over there?</v>

3983
01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Like some guy gets on a boat and decided to sail across the world,</v>

3984
01:44:18.291 --> 01:44:18.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3985
01:44:18.411 --> 01:44:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3986
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.801
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3987
01:44:18.801 --> 01:44:19.101
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3988
01:44:19.101 --> 01:44:19.431
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

3989
01:44:19.431 --> 01:44:20.480
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

3990
01:44:20.481 --> 01:44:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3991
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3992
01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:24.670
<v Speaker 1>he decided that he's going to go to a different part of the board and he's going</v>

3993
01:44:24.671 --> 01:44:28.520
<v Speaker 1>to get in a boat and he's going to drink rainwater and tried to catch fish and</v>

3994
01:44:28.521 --> 01:44:30.120
<v Speaker 1>travel across the fucking ocean.</v>

3995
01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:30.741
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

3996
01:44:30.741 --> 01:44:31.381
<v Speaker 1>people are playing,</v>

3997
01:44:31.381 --> 01:44:31.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3998
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Different kinds of games.</v>

3999
01:44:32.511 --> 01:44:34.370
<v Speaker 2>So like the guy who wants to kill a rhino,</v>

4000
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:38.420
<v Speaker 2>that's a combat game and the person who wants to sail around in the boat is</v>

4001
01:44:38.421 --> 01:44:42.080
<v Speaker 2>doing exploration and adventure game and other people are doing the,</v>

4002
01:44:42.081 --> 01:44:42.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4003
01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:45.320
<v Speaker 2>collection game where you are acquiring resources.</v>

4004
01:44:46.110 --> 01:44:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Everything that the Rhino guys doing the collection game well,</v>

4005
01:44:49.151 --> 01:44:49.301
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4006
01:44:49.301 --> 01:44:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Weird way.</v>

4007
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:50.181
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4008
01:44:50.181 --> 01:44:51.410
<v Speaker 2>He's collecting bodies.</v>

4009
01:44:51.411 --> 01:44:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4010
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4011
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:53.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4012
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:54.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4013
01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And I think the,</v>

4014
01:44:55.561 --> 01:44:57.910
<v Speaker 1>the guy who's on the boat is doing the collection game too,</v>

4015
01:44:57.911 --> 01:44:59.500
<v Speaker 1>cause he's collecting accolades.</v>

4016
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:00.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4017
01:45:00.370 --> 01:45:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I've made it across the ocean.</v>

4018
01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:03.493
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

4019
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4020
01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4021
01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:07.210
<v Speaker 1>The real way to do is go across the ocean.</v>

4022
01:45:07.211 --> 01:45:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell anybody.</v>

4023
01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4024
01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Where are you bidding for the last six months?</v>

4025
01:45:10.630 --> 01:45:11.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4026

<v Speaker 1>just chilling,</v>

4027
01:45:12.370 --> 01:45:13.300
<v Speaker 1>trying to find myself.</v>

4028
01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>

4029
01:45:14.010 --> 01:45:14.843
<v Speaker 1>you were on a boat</v>

4030
01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:17.580
<v Speaker 2>when Isaiah to training for a marathon.</v>

4031
01:45:17.730 --> 01:45:18.563
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4032
01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling anybody because I don't,</v>

4033
01:45:20.551 --> 01:45:22.920
<v Speaker 2>I want it to like just internal.</v>

4034
01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4035
01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be from,</v>

4036
01:45:24.330 --> 01:45:24.721
<v Speaker 2>well you know,</v>

4037
01:45:24.721 --> 01:45:28.170
<v Speaker 2>cause it's like this weird bias some people have about renters that like they</v>

4038
01:45:28.171 --> 01:45:31.290
<v Speaker 2>brag about it a lot or like they do it to like show off</v>

4039
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Gino who says that people who wish they were running.</v>

4040
01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh I really believe that.</v>

4041
01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4042
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you run,</v>

4043
01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:39.110
<v Speaker 1>like I have my friend Cameron,</v>

4044
01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Cameron Hanes,</v>

4045
01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.960
<v Speaker 1>he's run two ultra marathons.</v>

4046
01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Hey he'll,</v>

4047
01:45:42.970 --> 01:45:43.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4048
01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:46.280
<v Speaker 1>post about it on his Instagram or he'll show you his time or something like</v>

4049
01:45:46.281 --> 01:45:46.620
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4050
01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:47.251
<v Speaker 1>But he's trying to,</v>

4051
01:45:47.251 --> 01:45:47.810
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4052
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:52.100
<v Speaker 1>he's an athlete and these sponsored by a bunch of companies and part of his Gig</v>

4053
01:45:52.130 --> 01:45:54.920
<v Speaker 1>is that he inspires people and he really feels good about that.</v>

4054
01:45:54.921 --> 01:45:56.210
<v Speaker 1>It'll be genuine thing that he does,</v>

4055
01:45:56.410 --> 01:45:57.860
<v Speaker 1>takes people running up these mountains.</v>

4056
01:45:58.070 --> 01:46:00.290
<v Speaker 1>But you'll see these people at like bitch about it.</v>

4057
01:46:00.291 --> 01:46:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy's running,</v>

4058
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:03.170
<v Speaker 1>he's run a hundred miles in 24 hours.</v>

4059
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:04.490
<v Speaker 1>If that's unimpressive,</v>

4060
01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:05.010
<v Speaker 1>not worth,</v>

4061
01:46:05.010 --> 01:46:08.150
<v Speaker 1>then you need to go look in the mirror and find out what the fuck actually</v>

4062
01:46:08.151 --> 01:46:08.984
<v Speaker 1>impresses you.</v>

4063
01:46:09.410 --> 01:46:12.200
<v Speaker 1>You post a picture of your breakfast you can't get mad about.</v>

4064
01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4065
01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4066
01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Then yeah,</v>

4067
01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:15.620
<v Speaker 1>my eggs.</v>

4068
01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:16.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4069
01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4070
01:46:18.230 --> 01:46:19.063
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>

4071
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:20.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4072
01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:23.300
<v Speaker 1>why do people get upset that you say you're going to run a marathon and why</v>

4073
01:46:23.301 --> 01:46:24.170
<v Speaker 1>would anybody get upset?</v>

4074
01:46:24.171 --> 01:46:25.490
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to run a marathon.</v>

4075
01:46:25.491 --> 01:46:27.440
<v Speaker 1>You've got to run for three and a half,</v>

4076
01:46:27.441 --> 01:46:28.140
<v Speaker 1>four hours,</v>

4077
01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell your time is.</v>

4078
01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4079
01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:31.190
<v Speaker 1>That's up fucking long time.</v>

4080
01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4081
01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:35.570
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to do 20 minutes on the elliptical machine and not get bored.</v>

4082
01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4083
01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I could keep going for a lot longer.</v>

4084
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4085
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:39.740
<v Speaker 1>But at 20 minutes I'm like,</v>

4086
01:46:39.741 --> 01:46:40.221
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

4087
01:46:40.221 --> 01:46:41.054
<v Speaker 1>am I done?</v>

4088
01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Jay is as Christ get this over with.</v>

4089
01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:46.400
<v Speaker 1>When someone says they ran a marathon,</v>

4090
01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:49.310
<v Speaker 1>you start to question your own resolve.</v>

4091
01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:50.363
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4092
01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Which is like one of the reasons why they do it.</v>

4093
01:46:52.351 --> 01:46:53.550
<v Speaker 1>You're showing your score.</v>

4094
01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4095
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:56.310
<v Speaker 1>You're showing your game score and people are getting pissed.</v>

4096
01:46:56.330 --> 01:46:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4097
01:46:56.670 --> 01:46:57.503
<v Speaker 1>Too High.</v>

4098
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Fucking showing her highest score.</v>

4099
01:46:59.390 --> 01:47:00.240
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes,</v>

4100
01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:05.310
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I will post a terrible run cause I like you don't want to be too</v>

4101
01:47:05.311 --> 01:47:07.200
<v Speaker 1>inspiring that people feel like they can't do it.</v>

4102
01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck those people.</v>

4103
01:47:09.330 --> 01:47:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it slow run so that people will see like,</v>

4104
01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:16.950
<v Speaker 1>oh you're tricking you into doing shitty scores.</v>

4105
01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:18.510
<v Speaker 1>They're tricking you.</v>

4106
01:47:18.810 --> 01:47:19.643
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

4107
01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:20.730
<v Speaker 1>So true.</v>

4108
01:47:20.730 --> 01:47:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Well there's definitely that.</v>

4109
01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:26.430
<v Speaker 1>There's is a lot of people who when someone will accomplish something I will,</v>

4110
01:47:26.431 --> 01:47:31.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by watching the observers and one of the Instagram observers of</v>

4111
01:47:31.791 --> 01:47:33.720
<v Speaker 1>the most fascinating cause whenever I go to someone's page,</v>

4112
01:47:33.721 --> 01:47:34.830
<v Speaker 1>someone's done something cool.</v>

4113
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Like you know my friend Cameron running a hundred miles,</v>

4114
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:38.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at the,</v>

4115
01:47:38.861 --> 01:47:39.061
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4116
01:47:39.061 --> 01:47:43.260
<v Speaker 1>the negative comments and I go to their Instagram page and they're almost always</v>

4117
01:47:43.261 --> 01:47:43.951
<v Speaker 1>blocked.</v>

4118
01:47:43.951 --> 01:47:45.240
<v Speaker 1>It's almost always private,</v>

4119
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:46.291
<v Speaker 1>like locked.</v>

4120
01:47:46.291 --> 01:47:46.651
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

4121
01:47:46.651 --> 01:47:47.490
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

4122
01:47:47.730 --> 01:47:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you have to be one of their accepted friends on the comment on their pictures</v>

4123
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.740
<v Speaker 1>because they're hiding.</v>

4124
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4125
01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're not putting themselves out there.</v>

4126
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4127
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:57.390
<v Speaker 1>They're not showing their life</v>

4128
01:47:57.610 --> 01:48:00.580
<v Speaker 2>and which means they don't understand the vulnerability involved.</v>

4129
01:48:00.581 --> 01:48:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were,</v>

4130
01:48:01.330 --> 01:48:06.010
<v Speaker 2>if you had the experience of having other people write on your stuff the same</v>

4131
01:48:06.011 --> 01:48:07.330
<v Speaker 2>way that you were doing on someone else,</v>

4132
01:48:07.450 --> 01:48:09.010
<v Speaker 2>you might not be doing that.</v>

4133
01:48:09.110 --> 01:48:09.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4134
01:48:09.321 --> 01:48:10.520
<v Speaker 1>they're playing the low,</v>

4135
01:48:10.521 --> 01:48:12.080
<v Speaker 1>they're playing tic TAC toe,</v>

4136
01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:12.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4137
01:48:12.450 --> 01:48:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4138
01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Or someone else's out there playing chess.</v>

4139
01:48:14.630 --> 01:48:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4140
01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:18.620
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be like the new like zing my man.</v>

4141
01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:19.970
<v Speaker 1>You're playing tic TAC toe.</v>

4142
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4143
01:48:20.090 --> 01:48:22.550
<v Speaker 1>That's like tic Tac toe play a mother fucker.</v>

4144
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:23.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4145
01:48:23.271 --> 01:48:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is kind of what it is.</v>

4146
01:48:24.861 --> 01:48:28.760
<v Speaker 1>If life is this really super complex,</v>

4147
01:48:28.761 --> 01:48:33.350
<v Speaker 1>open ended game where essentially if you live in a free culture like we do,</v>

4148
01:48:33.351 --> 01:48:33.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4149
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:37.010
<v Speaker 1>we're not living in North Korea where you're assigned a job and if you don't cry</v>

4150
01:48:37.011 --> 01:48:38.180
<v Speaker 1>when something happens,</v>

4151
01:48:38.181 --> 01:48:38.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4152
01:48:38.361 --> 01:48:39.180
<v Speaker 1>you go to jail,</v>

4153
01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:39.530
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4154
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.951
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

4155
01:48:39.951 --> 01:48:41.990
<v Speaker 1>your game is essentially open ended.</v>

4156
01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

4157
01:48:42.230 --> 01:48:43.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

4158
01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:45.560
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons why when people get out of jail,</v>

4159
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:49.640
<v Speaker 1>they find themselves like institutionalize is the word,</v>

4160
01:48:49.641 --> 01:48:52.850
<v Speaker 1>but they find themselves so trapped in the game of jail.</v>

4161
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4162
01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:54.830
<v Speaker 1>That's how their brain is wired.</v>

4163
01:48:54.831 --> 01:48:59.210
<v Speaker 1>It's really extremely difficult for them to deal with the open ended game of</v>

4164
01:48:59.211 --> 01:48:59.770
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

4165
01:48:59.770 --> 01:49:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4166
01:49:00.490 --> 01:49:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4167
01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:01.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4168
01:49:01.211 --> 01:49:04.750
<v Speaker 2>even for UC it with when someone graduates college,</v>

4169
01:49:04.751 --> 01:49:08.980
<v Speaker 2>kids who have been from the top colleges who have been taught to play the game</v>

4170
01:49:08.981 --> 01:49:12.640
<v Speaker 2>of achieving and achieving in this really rigid structure,</v>

4171
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:16.630
<v Speaker 2>and then they get out into the world and nobody's telling them here,</v>

4172
01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:20.860
<v Speaker 2>here are the things you have to do to be considered a good student or be</v>

4173
01:49:20.861 --> 01:49:21.694
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

4174
01:49:21.970 --> 01:49:23.170
<v Speaker 2>And then they just lose it.</v>

4175
01:49:23.650 --> 01:49:24.520
<v Speaker 2>It's too much.</v>

4176
01:49:24.521 --> 01:49:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4177
01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:25.713
<v Speaker 2>Because they don't,</v>

4178
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:26.680
<v Speaker 2>they are not,</v>

4179
01:49:27.010 --> 01:49:28.660
<v Speaker 2>they have not been directing their own game.</v>

4180
01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:29.561
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4181
01:49:29.561 --> 01:49:30.394
<v Speaker 2>It's like you,</v>

4182
01:49:30.670 --> 01:49:31.241
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

4183
01:49:31.241 --> 01:49:34.990
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't been designing the game now you have to suddenly acquire that</v>

4184
01:49:34.991 --> 01:49:35.540
<v Speaker 2>skill.</v>

4185
01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:38.930
<v Speaker 1>It's also one of the problems that some people have with career academics.</v>

4186
01:49:38.931 --> 01:49:42.950
<v Speaker 1>People that never participated in the real world.</v>

4187
01:49:42.951 --> 01:49:47.390
<v Speaker 1>They went from college to teach in college and then they also,</v>

4188
01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:51.400
<v Speaker 1>they require these rigid standards of behavior and things.</v>

4189
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.761
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

4190
01:49:51.761 --> 01:49:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I heard your show about that.</v>

4191
01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:53.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4192
01:49:53.601 --> 01:49:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

4193
01:49:53.770 --> 01:49:54.730
<v Speaker 2>The Atlantic article.</v>

4194
01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

4195
01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4196
01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:56.800
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

4197
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:56.921
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4198
01:49:56.921 --> 01:50:01.921
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because I've been so steeped in psychology literature,</v>

4199
01:50:02.710 --> 01:50:03.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4200
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:04.280
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

4201
01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:07.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the folks who play super better are traumatized and they've,</v>

4202
01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:12.360
<v Speaker 2>they've been through PTSD and it is absolutely true that avoiding triggers</v>

4203
01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:16.150
<v Speaker 2>prolongs the problem.</v>

4204
01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:16.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4205
01:50:16.481 --> 01:50:16.850
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

4206
01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:17.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4207
01:50:17.261 --> 01:50:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I can look at the scientific literature and say trigger warnings are actually</v>

4208
01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:21.460
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

4209
01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:22.121
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to help.</v>

4210
01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:23.860
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make you weaker over time.</v>

4211
01:50:23.861 --> 01:50:24.940
<v Speaker 2>It's like we were talking about,</v>

4212
01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:25.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4213
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.871
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4214
01:50:25.871 --> 01:50:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm so scared of the bad guy.</v>

4215
01:50:27.101 --> 01:50:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I have to avoid everything that is a trigger.</v>

4216
01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4217
01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:31.720
<v Speaker 2>we know that that's not true.</v>

4218
01:50:31.721 --> 01:50:32.231
<v Speaker 2>So when I,</v>

4219
01:50:32.231 --> 01:50:32.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4220
01:50:32.471 --> 01:50:33.430
<v Speaker 2>when I hear about that,</v>

4221
01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:34.061
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4222
01:50:34.061 --> 01:50:34.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4223
01:50:34.301 --> 01:50:35.134
<v Speaker 2>I wish,</v>

4224
01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:37.450
<v Speaker 2>and I try to talk to people and I tweet when that article came out,</v>

4225
01:50:37.451 --> 01:50:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted about it and I have a lot of people who follow me who are,</v>

4226
01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:41.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4227
01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:46.360
<v Speaker 2>have PTSD and they're very conflicted about whether they're supposed to avoid</v>

4228
01:50:46.361 --> 01:50:49.720
<v Speaker 2>triggers and they like trigger warnings cause they think it's going to keep them</v>

4229
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:50.410
<v Speaker 2>safe.</v>

4230
01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:54.520
<v Speaker 2>But for everything we know is that you need to get better at controlling your</v>

4231
01:50:54.521 --> 01:50:55.600
<v Speaker 2>reaction to the trigger.</v>

4232
01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Avoiding it doesn't help.</v>

4233
01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:57.911
<v Speaker 2>So I can,</v>

4234
01:50:57.911 --> 01:50:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I can see why that's so frustrating to people.</v>

4235
01:50:59.850 --> 01:50:59.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4236
01:50:59.971 --> 01:51:00.061
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4237
01:51:00.061 --> 01:51:00.330
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

4238
01:51:00.330 --> 01:51:04.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the most frustrating aspects of that article in particular was that</v>

4239
01:51:04.530 --> 01:51:08.020
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in colleges today is it's,</v>

4240
01:51:08.021 --> 01:51:09.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a control issue.</v>

4241
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4242
01:51:09.630 --> 01:51:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4243
01:51:10.210 --> 01:51:15.210
<v Speaker 1>they're controlling behavior in such an extreme way that they're there.</v>

4244
01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:18.540
<v Speaker 1>They want to penalize people for micro aggressions.</v>

4245
01:51:18.541 --> 01:51:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4246
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Which is like you say something and I go,</v>

4247
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:21.873
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>

4248
01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Which is just a part of a fucking human interaction with it.</v>

4249
01:51:25.110 --> 01:51:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Like if I say something to you and you give me a sarcastic response,</v>

4250
01:51:28.201 --> 01:51:28.741
<v Speaker 1>I have to decide,</v>

4251
01:51:28.741 --> 01:51:29.280
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

4252
01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't enjoy communicating with her because she,</v>

4253
01:51:32.231 --> 01:51:33.360
<v Speaker 1>she makes me feel bad.</v>

4254
01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Or I have to say maybe I'm fucking Douchey and maybe people react to me in a</v>

4255
01:51:38.221 --> 01:51:42.690
<v Speaker 1>negative way and I should think about not what I want to say or how I want to</v>

4256
01:51:42.691 --> 01:51:43.201
<v Speaker 1>say things,</v>

4257
01:51:43.201 --> 01:51:46.980
<v Speaker 1>but rather how people might view what I'm saying and how they take it in.</v>

4258
01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:51.120
<v Speaker 1>And maybe I'm just an ineffective communicator and maybe what's going on here is</v>

4259
01:51:51.121 --> 01:51:51.570
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

4260
01:51:51.570 --> 01:51:51.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4261
01:51:51.871 --> 01:51:52.530
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

4262
01:51:52.530 --> 01:51:54.720
<v Speaker 1>there's like two people playing soccer.</v>

4263
01:51:54.721 --> 01:51:54.961
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4264
01:51:54.961 --> 01:51:57.210
<v Speaker 1>They're both trying to hit the ball and they collide into each other.</v>

4265
01:51:57.211 --> 01:51:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Who's fault is it?</v>

4266
01:51:58.170 --> 01:51:58.351
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4267
01:51:58.351 --> 01:51:58.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4268
01:51:58.740 --> 01:51:59.460
<v Speaker 1>they're both the,</v>

4269
01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:01.440
<v Speaker 1>it's just non smooth movement.</v>

4270
01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4271
01:52:02.010 --> 01:52:02.581
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

4272
01:52:02.581 --> 01:52:05.400
<v Speaker 1>that sort of interaction that you would get when you're trying to hit a soccer</v>

4273
01:52:05.401 --> 01:52:06.030
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>

4274
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:08.790
<v Speaker 1>It's very similar to the interaction that you had when two people communicating</v>

4275
01:52:08.791 --> 01:52:09.550
<v Speaker 1>with each other,</v>

4276
01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:12.330
<v Speaker 1>your e the colliding people.</v>

4277
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:16.290
<v Speaker 1>One person is not necessarily totally responsible for that collision.</v>

4278
01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4279
01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.780
<v Speaker 1>They're both sort of responsible for it.</v>

4280
01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:19.733
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>

4281
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:20.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

4282
01:52:20.410 --> 01:52:25.410
<v Speaker 1>a whole dance going on with poor decision making in the moment and lack of</v>

4283
01:52:26.191 --> 01:52:30.720
<v Speaker 1>experience and collisions and lack of an understanding of the consequences of</v>

4284
01:52:30.721 --> 01:52:31.554
<v Speaker 1>those collisions.</v>

4285
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:36.330
<v Speaker 1>All that is a part of going to college and all that is a part of growing up.</v>

4286
01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:39.780
<v Speaker 1>And when you have people that are shielding you from micro aggressions.</v>

4287
01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4288
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:44.580
<v Speaker 1>All that shit is just a part of being a human and dealing with your hormones and</v>

4289
01:52:44.581 --> 01:52:45.540
<v Speaker 1>emotions and yeah,</v>

4290
01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:48.590
<v Speaker 1>you're separated from your family for the first time and now you're in Michigan</v>

4291
01:52:48.591 --> 01:52:51.710
<v Speaker 1>and some fucking crazy university and you've got some fat,</v>

4292
01:52:51.711 --> 01:52:54.680
<v Speaker 1>stupid teacher that's never even existed outside of the real world.</v>

4293
01:52:54.681 --> 01:52:58.280
<v Speaker 1>And they're dictating your behavior patterns and telling you you're not allowed</v>

4294
01:52:58.281 --> 01:53:01.520
<v Speaker 1>to use a male and female pronouns anymore.</v>

4295
01:53:01.521 --> 01:53:02.120
<v Speaker 1>And all this.</v>

4296
01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I liked the teachers.</v>

4297
01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4298
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:04.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4299
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of friends who are,</v>

4300
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:07.120
<v Speaker 2>who are,</v>

4301
01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:07.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4302
01:53:07.670 --> 01:53:08.960
<v Speaker 2>they teach at university,</v>

4303
01:53:08.961 --> 01:53:09.980
<v Speaker 2>so that was dry.</v>

4304
01:53:10.130 --> 01:53:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I will remove the fat,</v>

4305
01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:12.253
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

4306
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:13.280
<v Speaker 1>well I'm just surprised.</v>

4307
01:53:14.010 --> 01:53:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's say skinny smart really yet or whatever.</v>

4308
01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm fat,</v>

4309
01:53:20.670 --> 01:53:21.070
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

4310
01:53:21.070 --> 01:53:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Does that even mean like physically what I mean is just like this,</v>

4311
01:53:24.421 --> 01:53:29.421
<v Speaker 1>this bloated sort of lazy entity that is creating this environment where you're,</v>

4312
01:53:31.921 --> 01:53:34.310
<v Speaker 1>you're establishing this artificial realm.</v>

4313
01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:36.060
<v Speaker 2>So is looking at what's going on.</v>

4314
01:53:36.090 --> 01:53:41.090
<v Speaker 2>This is not coming from instructors or faculty that this is coming from the</v>

4315
01:53:41.581 --> 01:53:43.440
<v Speaker 2>students and some of the phenomenon.</v>

4316
01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:44.370
<v Speaker 2>But it certainly,</v>

4317
01:53:44.370 --> 01:53:45.203
<v Speaker 2>it certainly was,</v>

4318
01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:46.703
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4319
01:53:46.830 --> 01:53:47.663
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

4320
01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:48.740
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

4321
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:49.020
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4322
01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:50.550
<v Speaker 2>this is definitely a younger phenomena.</v>

4323
01:53:50.551 --> 01:53:52.860
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't like something like deeply entrenched people who came up.</v>

4324
01:53:52.890 --> 01:53:53.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4325
01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:56.970
<v Speaker 2>my professors are totally like friends who are professors are totally weirded</v>

4326
01:53:56.971 --> 01:53:57.750
<v Speaker 2>out by it,</v>

4327
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:58.740
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to handle it.</v>

4328
01:53:58.890 --> 01:54:00.990
<v Speaker 2>They're not creating that culture.</v>

4329
01:54:00.991 --> 01:54:01.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4330
01:54:01.141 --> 01:54:06.141
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely something coming from the students who have been raised in this</v>

4331
01:54:06.751 --> 01:54:07.950
<v Speaker 2>culture of,</v>

4332
01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:08.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4333
01:54:08.690 --> 01:54:09.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4334
01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's that it's a very protective culture and you don't,</v>

4335
01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:14.370
<v Speaker 2>nobody should have their feelings hurt.</v>

4336
01:54:14.690 --> 01:54:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Nobody,</v>

4337
01:54:15.150 --> 01:54:15.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4338
01:54:15.421 --> 01:54:18.480
<v Speaker 2>nobody should experience failure or rejection.</v>

4339
01:54:18.750 --> 01:54:18.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4340
01:54:18.981 --> 01:54:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4341
01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's more from that culture then from anything related to like</v>

4342
01:54:23.821 --> 01:54:26.520
<v Speaker 2>contemporary academia or faculty</v>

4343
01:54:26.590 --> 01:54:31.480
<v Speaker 1>thing because isn't contemporary academia academia overwhelmingly liberal and</v>

4344
01:54:31.481 --> 01:54:32.314
<v Speaker 1>progressive?</v>

4345
01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:33.851
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4346
01:54:33.851 --> 01:54:34.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4347
01:54:34.181 --> 01:54:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

4348
01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:36.550
<v Speaker 2>I think on the political spectrum,</v>

4349
01:54:36.551 --> 01:54:36.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4350
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:41.910
<v Speaker 1>when you have something that's moving in one very particular direction,</v>

4351
01:54:42.190 --> 01:54:46.820
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes people will try to outdo themselves or are not in control.</v>

4352
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

4353
01:54:47.130 --> 01:54:47.491
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

4354
01:54:47.491 --> 01:54:48.324
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

4355
01:54:48.330 --> 01:54:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason why a student culture would have so much impact on this is</v>

4356
01:54:52.651 --> 01:54:56.580
<v Speaker 2>because universities are now like business models and the customer is always</v>

4357
01:54:56.581 --> 01:54:57.360
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4358
01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:58.193
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's not,</v>

4359
01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:01.290
<v Speaker 2>the professor is not the one who is,</v>

4360
01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:02.153
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4361
01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:06.420
<v Speaker 2>who is going to like the professors more often than not resist.</v>

4362
01:55:06.421 --> 01:55:07.950
<v Speaker 2>It's really more at the level of,</v>

4363
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4364
01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:09.353
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4365
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:09.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4366
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:12.750
<v Speaker 2>the business side of a college that is trying to make,</v>

4367
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:13.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4368
01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:13.641
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4369
01:55:13.641 --> 01:55:14.474
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4370
01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:15.540
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>

4371
01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:19.200
<v Speaker 2>make this a good customer experience for the student.</v>

4372
01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:19.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4373
01:55:19.891 --> 01:55:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that is that it's more of the divine.</v>

4374
01:55:21.691 --> 01:55:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the,</v>

4375
01:55:22.890 --> 01:55:26.730
<v Speaker 2>the political affiliations of faculty is not,</v>

4376
01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:27.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4377
01:55:27.150 --> 01:55:28.680
<v Speaker 2>none of that is really what's going on.</v>

4378
01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:32.970
<v Speaker 2>It's really more about the students pay so much money for college now and they</v>

4379
01:55:32.971 --> 01:55:37.280
<v Speaker 2>expect lots of perks and they expect their,</v>

4380
01:55:37.281 --> 01:55:39.390
<v Speaker 2>they're paying for a certain experience.</v>

4381
01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4382
01:55:40.170 --> 01:55:45.120
<v Speaker 2>I think that is really where you're seeing a lot of the friction come because</v>

4383
01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:47.100
<v Speaker 2>that's particularly younger generation is,</v>

4384
01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:48.413
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4385
01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:49.950
<v Speaker 2>seems to be if you look at,</v>

4386
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:50.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4387
01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:53.220
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of the experts are saying they want,</v>

4388
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:57.900
<v Speaker 2>they don't want the things that feel painful or feel like failure or feeling</v>

4389
01:55:57.930 --> 01:55:58.763
<v Speaker 2>stress.</v>

4390
01:55:58.850 --> 01:55:59.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4391
01:55:59.031 --> 01:55:59.691
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>

4392
01:55:59.691 --> 01:56:04.691
<v Speaker 1>then why are they a pointing out all these flaws and all these other people's</v>

4393
01:56:04.881 --> 01:56:09.881
<v Speaker 1>behavior to control them and flaws in the way people express themselves.</v>

4394
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Flaws.</v>

4395
01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4396
01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:12.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4397
01:56:12.501 --> 01:56:12.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4398
01:56:12.711 --> 01:56:13.410
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4399
01:56:13.410 --> 01:56:15.380
<v Speaker 1>part of it is obviously things need to change,</v>

4400
01:56:15.410 --> 01:56:15.771
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4401
01:56:15.771 --> 01:56:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4402
01:56:16.130 --> 01:56:17.600
<v Speaker 1>like what needs to change?</v>

4403
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.790
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

4404
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm a woman.</v>

4405
01:56:19.450 --> 01:56:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I play games.</v>

4406
01:56:20.410 --> 01:56:22.420
<v Speaker 2>If I log into an online video game,</v>

4407
01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:25.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be called a comment every time I log in.</v>

4408
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Does that happen a lot?</v>

4409
01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:27.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4410
01:56:27.771 --> 01:56:28.370
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

4411
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:31.040
<v Speaker 1>And do you think that happens a lot because of what we talked about earlier,</v>

4412
01:56:31.041 --> 01:56:35.000
<v Speaker 1>where there's the interaction of just dealing in text?</v>

4413
01:56:35.150 --> 01:56:39.620
<v Speaker 1>This is a very strange and the interaction without people being right there with</v>

4414
01:56:39.621 --> 01:56:40.250
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

4415
01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4416
01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:41.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4417
01:56:41.091 --> 01:56:41.930
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

4418
01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4419
01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:44.300
<v Speaker 1>seems like totally unnatural,</v>

4420
01:56:44.301 --> 01:56:44.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4421
01:56:44.570 --> 01:56:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4422
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.381
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

4423
01:56:45.381 --> 01:56:45.801
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>

4424
01:56:45.801 --> 01:56:46.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4425
01:56:46.071 --> 01:56:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4426
01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:47.630
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't happen to me in real life.</v>

4427
01:56:47.650 --> 01:56:47.811
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4428
01:56:47.811 --> 01:56:48.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was going to ask.</v>

4429
01:56:48.801 --> 01:56:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people in real life say those things to you?</v>

4430
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

4431
01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4432
01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:53.031
<v Speaker 1>Like how bizarre,</v>

4433
01:56:53.031 --> 01:56:53.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4434
01:56:53.301 --> 01:56:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4435
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:55.460
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you enter into this world.</v>

4436
01:56:55.730 --> 01:57:00.560
<v Speaker 1>So isn't that a function almost of the world itself being completely unnatural,</v>

4437
01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:04.490
<v Speaker 1>more so than then the people being any different in that world?</v>

4438
01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:04.911
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

4439
01:57:04.911 --> 01:57:05.241
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

4440
01:57:05.241 --> 01:57:06.390
<v Speaker 1>so all of those say</v>

4441
01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:10.820
<v Speaker 2>there are things that people say and do in everyday life that are legitimately</v>

4442
01:57:10.821 --> 01:57:11.654
<v Speaker 2>offensive.</v>

4443
01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4444
01:57:12.590 --> 01:57:13.423
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4445
01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:13.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4446
01:57:13.881 --> 01:57:16.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't use the terminology microaggressions,</v>

4447
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:17.083
<v Speaker 2>I don't use it,</v>

4448
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:18.800
<v Speaker 2>the trigger warning terminology.</v>

4449
01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:23.720
<v Speaker 2>So I think we're like in this period where on one hand things do need to change</v>

4450
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:24.590
<v Speaker 2>and some ways,</v>

4451
01:57:24.890 --> 01:57:25.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4452
01:57:25.311 --> 01:57:25.421
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4453
01:57:25.421 --> 01:57:30.421
<v Speaker 2>you have Nobel laureate scientist giving speeches where they say that it's,</v>

4454
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:34.370
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't like to have women in the lab because either they fall in love with</v>

4455
01:57:34.371 --> 01:57:36.710
<v Speaker 2>you or you fall in love with them and then you can't work together.</v>

4456
01:57:36.711 --> 01:57:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean when some,</v>

4457
01:57:37.581 --> 01:57:41.090
<v Speaker 2>when a Nobel laureate says that to a conference of,</v>

4458
01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:41.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4459
01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:46.160
<v Speaker 2>young scientists that that's not helpful I don't think,</v>

4460
01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:49.480
<v Speaker 1>but I know that that was taken out of context,</v>

4461
01:57:49.481 --> 01:57:49.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4462
01:57:49.661 --> 01:57:50.500
<v Speaker 1>the full extent.</v>

4463
01:57:50.810 --> 01:57:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a joke and he was also talking about his wife and because he met</v>

4464
01:57:56.381 --> 01:57:57.970
<v Speaker 1>his wife in the lab and,</v>

4465
01:57:58.210 --> 01:58:01.470
<v Speaker 1>and he was also making himself to be for his,</v>

4466
01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:02.860
<v Speaker 1>it was a very self deprecating,</v>

4467
01:58:02.861 --> 01:58:03.880
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know the extent of it.</v>

4468
01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I did read some sort of</v>

4469
01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:08.700
<v Speaker 2>re reassessment of that.</v>

4470
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

4471
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins printed the,</v>

4472
01:58:10.610 --> 01:58:10.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4473
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:15.690
<v Speaker 1>a full version of what he said and it's very different also.</v>

4474
01:58:15.691 --> 01:58:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is laughing.</v>

4475
01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I read the full version.</v>

4476
01:58:18.270 --> 01:58:19.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4477
01:58:19.150 --> 01:58:19.983
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4478
01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:21.021
<v Speaker 2>but so it's like,</v>

4479
01:58:21.021 --> 01:58:23.030
<v Speaker 2>so this is actually a perfect example because,</v>

4480
01:58:23.031 --> 01:58:24.140
<v Speaker 2>so if he was joking,</v>

4481
01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:24.920
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4482
01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:27.440
<v Speaker 2>So his intentions are totally good.</v>

4483
01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible that it's still not helpful to make that,</v>

4484
01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:33.020
<v Speaker 2>that kind of a statement?</v>

4485
01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:34.101
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4486
01:58:34.101 --> 01:58:35.780
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what people are talking about,</v>

4487
01:58:36.110 --> 01:58:36.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4488
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4489
01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:38.240
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

4490
01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:38.600
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4491
01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:42.520
<v Speaker 2>if on one hand there's a lot of interest trying to increase the number of women</v>

4492
01:58:42.521 --> 01:58:43.870
<v Speaker 2>in science and technology,</v>

4493
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:49.350
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that somebody would hear that and still be kind of demotivated by</v>

4494
01:58:49.781 --> 01:58:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it or kind of have that sink in?</v>

4495
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:53.440
<v Speaker 2>So I think people are,</v>

4496
01:58:53.441 --> 01:58:54.100
<v Speaker 2>when they're,</v>

4497
01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:55.780
<v Speaker 2>when we're discussing these things,</v>

4498
01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:57.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4499
01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:57.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4500
01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:59.200
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to police other people's language,</v>

4501
01:58:59.201 --> 01:58:59.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's,</v>

4502
01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:04.210
<v Speaker 2>I still think it's useful to say that might not be helpful.</v>

4503
01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:05.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4504
01:59:05.521 --> 01:59:05.850
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

4505
01:59:05.850 --> 01:59:06.481
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

4506
01:59:06.481 --> 01:59:08.640
<v Speaker 1>an article on the leak transcript,</v>

4507
01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:09.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4508
01:59:09.090 --> 01:59:10.050
<v Speaker 1>the leak transcript.</v>

4509
01:59:10.051 --> 01:59:13.440
<v Speaker 1>W w what happened was the people that saw it thought it,</v>

4510
01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:13.861
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4511
01:59:13.861 --> 01:59:16.680
<v Speaker 1>at least some of them thought was funny and,</v>

4512
01:59:16.890 --> 01:59:21.500
<v Speaker 1>but there were aspects of what he said that we're probably Clum busy,</v>

4513
01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:21.870
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4514
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Swanky or,</v>

4515
01:59:23.130 --> 01:59:23.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4516
01:59:23.431 --> 01:59:26.880
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to be funny and he's really just sort of an odd guy who's a</v>

4517
01:59:26.881 --> 01:59:27.600
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>

4518
01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4519
01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:28.680
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4520
01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:29.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4521
01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:31.380
<v Speaker 1>people decided that this is an awesome target.</v>

4522
01:59:31.650 --> 01:59:31.861
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4523
01:59:31.861 --> 01:59:32.690
<v Speaker 1>let's go after it.</v>

4524
01:59:32.690 --> 01:59:33.021
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4525
01:59:33.021 --> 01:59:34.140
<v Speaker 2>And to make an example,</v>

4526
01:59:34.330 --> 01:59:35.560
<v Speaker 2>which happens on the UN,</v>

4527
01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4528
01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:38.620
<v Speaker 2>the whole people get shamed on the Internet.</v>

4529
01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Now that's,</v>

4530
01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:40.550
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens.</v>

4531
01:59:40.970 --> 01:59:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4532
01:59:41.690 --> 01:59:42.523
<v Speaker 2>I mean my,</v>

4533
01:59:42.590 --> 01:59:42.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4534
01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any expertise in this area,</v>

4535
01:59:44.901 --> 01:59:45.734
<v Speaker 2>so it's probably not,</v>

4536
01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:46.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4537
01:59:46.730 --> 01:59:47.830
<v Speaker 2>worth me know</v>

4538
01:59:48.110 --> 01:59:48.440
<v Speaker 1>bound.</v>

4539
01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:52.310
<v Speaker 1>The official quote he says is strange as such a chauvinist monitor like me,</v>

4540
01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:54.560
<v Speaker 1>has it been asked to speak to women scientist?</v>

4541
01:59:54.890 --> 01:59:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you about my trouble with girls.</v>

4542
01:59:57.590 --> 01:59:58.700
<v Speaker 1>His trouble with girls,</v>

4543
01:59:58.730 --> 02:00:00.350
<v Speaker 1>three things happen when they were in the lab.</v>

4544
02:00:00.351 --> 02:00:01.340
<v Speaker 1>You Fall in love with them,</v>

4545
02:00:01.341 --> 02:00:03.650
<v Speaker 1>they fall in love with you and when you criticize them,</v>

4546
02:00:03.651 --> 02:00:04.101
<v Speaker 1>they cry.</v>

4547
02:00:04.101 --> 02:00:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we should make separate labs for boys and girls now.</v>

4548
02:00:07.281 --> 02:00:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>

4549
02:00:08.151 --> 02:00:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm impressed with the economic development of a second.</v>

4550
02:00:12.351 --> 02:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>This was before</v>

4551
02:00:12.930 --> 02:00:13.763
<v Speaker 2>not fair.</v>

4552
02:00:14.490 --> 02:00:15.560
<v Speaker 1>Of course he,</v>

4553
02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

4554
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>it was him joking.</v>

4555
02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:18.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4556
02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:19.661
<v Speaker 2>But he's definitely,</v>

4557
02:00:19.661 --> 02:00:20.530
<v Speaker 2>he's joking,</v>

4558
02:00:20.531 --> 02:00:25.180
<v Speaker 2>playing on stereotypes that girls cry and girls can't handle criticism.</v>

4559
02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:25.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4560
02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:26.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>

4561
02:00:26.370 --> 02:00:27.203
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4562
02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:27.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4563
02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:31.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna say that I think is totally fine to say,</v>

4564
02:00:31.631 --> 02:00:32.464
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4565
02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:33.670
<v Speaker 2>when you say these things,</v>

4566
02:00:33.730 --> 02:00:37.690
<v Speaker 2>it might result in some girl thinking,</v>

4567
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:38.583
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

4568
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:41.980
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm not going to be a good scientist because,</v>

4569
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:46.090
<v Speaker 2>because people say that girls aren't good in the lab or whatever it is.</v>

4570
02:00:46.630 --> 02:00:47.650
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it.</v>

4571
02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:48.533
<v Speaker 2>That's yeah,</v>

4572
02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:49.713
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it.</v>

4573
02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I try to be,</v>

4574
02:00:51.130 --> 02:00:51.911
<v Speaker 2>I tried to be,</v>

4575
02:00:51.911 --> 02:00:52.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4576
02:00:52.121 --> 02:00:55.330
<v Speaker 2>even when we say things like about people who play games a lot,</v>

4577
02:00:55.690 --> 02:00:56.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4578
02:00:56.260 --> 02:00:56.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4579
02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:57.390
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4580
02:00:57.390 --> 02:00:58.510
<v Speaker 2>they're wasting their lives.</v>

4581
02:00:58.511 --> 02:00:58.691
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4582
02:00:58.691 --> 02:01:00.130
<v Speaker 2>why don't you go out and do something real?</v>

4583
02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4584
02:01:01.210 --> 02:01:03.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's useful to say either.</v>

4585
02:01:03.101 --> 02:01:04.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's actually,</v>

4586
02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:06.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4587
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:08.620
<v Speaker 2>can be really damaging identity.</v>

4588
02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:09.591
<v Speaker 1>Generalize,</v>

4589
02:01:09.591 --> 02:01:09.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4590
02:01:09.801 --> 02:01:10.090
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

4591
02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

4592
02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>And women do that and girls aren't good at being in the lab and it's,</v>

4593
02:01:13.711 --> 02:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4594
02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:14.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4595
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:15.321
<v Speaker 1>it's damaging.</v>

4596
02:01:15.321 --> 02:01:20.321
<v Speaker 1>And I think now he understands that a joke like that as innocent as a,</v>

4597
02:01:20.901 --> 02:01:25.430
<v Speaker 1>he might have intended it to be when you're reading it in a text form,</v>

4598
02:01:25.431 --> 02:01:27.740
<v Speaker 1>especially in you taking some of it out of context,</v>

4599
02:01:27.741 --> 02:01:28.574
<v Speaker 1>it can be,</v>

4600
02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:30.800
<v Speaker 1>it can be a offensive,</v>

4601
02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>it can be hurtful for someone who's considering like how many girls were reading</v>

4602
02:01:35.481 --> 02:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>that they were considering a possible career in science.</v>

4603
02:01:38.001 --> 02:01:38.540
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

4604
02:01:38.540 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to with fucking people like this.</v>

4605
02:01:40.221 --> 02:01:40.761
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to,</v>

4606
02:01:40.761 --> 02:01:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna cry in your lab,</v>

4607
02:01:41.871 --> 02:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>

4608
02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>I just want to do work.</v>

4609
02:01:43.281 --> 02:01:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a scientist.</v>

4610
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4611
02:01:44.970 --> 02:01:48.570
<v Speaker 2>So we don't need to like police people to have this conversation.</v>

4612
02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:49.231
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4613
02:01:49.231 --> 02:01:50.064
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4614
02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:52.420
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

4615
02:01:52.420 --> 02:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>what does that sort of expose in some ways it exposes a,</v>

4616
02:01:56.940 --> 02:01:57.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4617
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Prevalent attitudes,</v>

4618
02:01:59.010 --> 02:01:59.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4619
02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>that this guy who is this esteemed Nobel winning scientist has this attitude,</v>

4620
02:02:05.590 --> 02:02:05.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4621
02:02:05.831 --> 02:02:08.440
<v Speaker 1>that he thinks it's funny to joke around about it and they're like,</v>

4622
02:02:08.441 --> 02:02:10.570
<v Speaker 1>even if he's not a sexist or a bad guy,</v>

4623
02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:15.700
<v Speaker 1>him making this joke about himself being some chauvinist monster and it's</v>

4624
02:02:15.701 --> 02:02:16.090
<v Speaker 1>become,</v>

4625
02:02:16.090 --> 02:02:19.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the things is because his wife is a prominent feminist and so he jokes</v>

4626
02:02:19.901 --> 02:02:22.060
<v Speaker 1>around about him being a chauvinist monster.</v>

4627
02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:22.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4628
02:02:22.321 --> 02:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4629
02:02:22.710 --> 02:02:23.300
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4630
02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Well that makes sense.</v>

4631
02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4632
02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:25.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

4633
02:02:26.350 --> 02:02:29.320
<v Speaker 1>it's all out of context and it's all also,</v>

4634
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:31.000
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a guy who's,</v>

4635
02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>who's real focus is,</v>

4636
02:02:32.811 --> 02:02:33.491
<v Speaker 1>is research,</v>

4637
02:02:33.491 --> 02:02:34.840
<v Speaker 1>not social interaction.</v>

4638
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4639
02:02:35.230 --> 02:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>He's not like a nuanced speaker is not a guy who is a carefully considered a</v>

4640
02:02:42.941 --> 02:02:46.690
<v Speaker 1>speaker who gets on stage and thinks about everything and the impact of all,</v>

4641
02:02:46.691 --> 02:02:46.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4642
02:02:46.931 --> 02:02:47.470
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4643
02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:50.320
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about like the awkward interaction that people might have</v>

4644
02:02:50.321 --> 02:02:51.154
<v Speaker 1>in college.</v>

4645
02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4646
02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.090
<v Speaker 1>this guy's awkward interaction is him being forced to write a speech.</v>

4647
02:02:55.091 --> 02:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Like if he did this a bunch of times,</v>

4648
02:02:56.831 --> 02:02:58.600
<v Speaker 1>he'd probably get really way better at it.</v>

4649
02:02:58.601 --> 02:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>And you have,</v>

4650
02:02:59.831 --> 02:03:02.370
<v Speaker 1>you sat down with him alone in,</v>

4651
02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>you guys were just talking over a glass of wine.</v>

4652
02:03:04.511 --> 02:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'd understand how his brain works better.</v>

4653
02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4654
02:03:07.150 --> 02:03:08.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe I would have spoke.</v>

4655
02:03:09.050 --> 02:03:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4656
02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

4657
02:03:10.090 --> 02:03:11.600
<v Speaker 2>if something offends you,</v>

4658
02:03:12.230 --> 02:03:15.380
<v Speaker 2>it's more useful to have a conversation about it then to just start.</v>

4659
02:03:16.610 --> 02:03:16.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4660
02:03:16.731 --> 02:03:18.110
<v Speaker 1>But it's fun to blog and shit.</v>

4661
02:03:18.111 --> 02:03:19.880
<v Speaker 1>All of this guy is this guy,</v>

4662
02:03:19.881 --> 02:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>he's old and he's white and he's famous or so.</v>

4663
02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Well write a book about the neurochemistry of outrage and because it's,</v>

4664
02:03:27.090 --> 02:03:28.350
<v Speaker 2>it's its own high,</v>

4665
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:29.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4666
02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>it's recreational,</v>

4667
02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:31.470
<v Speaker 1>recreational outrage.</v>

4668
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:31.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4669
02:03:31.601 --> 02:03:32.231
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt.</v>

4670
02:03:32.231 --> 02:03:32.711
<v Speaker 1>A real thing.</v>

4671
02:03:32.711 --> 02:03:32.861
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4672
02:03:32.861 --> 02:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4673
02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4674
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's what's going on in colleges and that people are finding</v>

4675
02:03:38.590 --> 02:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>when you're in college,</v>

4676
02:03:39.461 --> 02:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you were talking about the addiction that people have to video</v>

4677
02:03:42.401 --> 02:03:42.701
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

4678
02:03:42.701 --> 02:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the things that sort of stimulates that addiction is if you're</v>

4679
02:03:45.311 --> 02:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>trying to avoid things in your regular lottery.</v>

4680
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4681
02:03:47.170 --> 02:03:47.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4682
02:03:47.531 --> 02:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>if you're in college,</v>

4683
02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4684
02:03:49.150 --> 02:03:54.150
<v Speaker 1>the overwhelming anxiety of being a young person who has gone from being,</v>

4685
02:03:54.850 --> 02:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>living with their parents,</v>

4686
02:03:55.781 --> 02:03:56.591
<v Speaker 1>going to high school,</v>

4687
02:03:56.591 --> 02:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>now you're in college and you were just a couple of years away from the cliff of</v>

4688
02:04:00.581 --> 02:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>real world,</v>

4689
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>like you're fucking sliding towards it and you're trying to define it and</v>

4690
02:04:04.781 --> 02:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>redefine it and change it and establish yourself.</v>

4691
02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>And then along the way comes things that you can be angry at.</v>

4692
02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:11.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4693
02:04:11.651 --> 02:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>you will point your fucking fury.</v>

4694
02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>There are really unmeasured are unbalanced fury at those things where it doesn't</v>

4695
02:04:18.521 --> 02:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>necessarily make sense,</v>

4696
02:04:19.690 --> 02:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>but it makes sense to you because what you're really doing is you're avoiding</v>

4697
02:04:22.481 --> 02:04:24.620
<v Speaker 1>the adjuncts have social anxiety of,</v>

4698
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:25.211
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

4699
02:04:25.211 --> 02:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

4700
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>sexual rejection and all the,</v>

4701
02:04:29.771 --> 02:04:33.790
<v Speaker 1>all the shit that makes a person feel weird things.</v>

4702
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>And you channel that towards micro aggressions.</v>

4703
02:04:36.791 --> 02:04:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Are you that towards someone treat,</v>

4704
02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:39.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4705
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:42.720
<v Speaker 1>deciding to address you with a male or a female pronoun.</v>

4706
02:04:43.110 --> 02:04:43.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4707
02:04:43.261 --> 02:04:43.771
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

4708
02:04:43.771 --> 02:04:46.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of weirdness to being a person and that,</v>

4709
02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:47.670
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4710
02:04:47.670 --> 02:04:48.390
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4711
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:51.410
<v Speaker 1>the last thing I want to say about this is part,</v>

4712
02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:51.871
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

4713
02:04:51.871 --> 02:04:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I think people are just trying to make new roles for the game.</v>

4714
02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4715
02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:57.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4716
02:04:57.031 --> 02:04:57.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4717
02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>and when you're trying to change the rules of a game that is really upsetting.</v>

4718
02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:02.520
<v Speaker 2>If you're in the middle of the game,</v>

4719
02:05:02.570 --> 02:05:04.380
<v Speaker 2>you're playing a game and stuff is like,</v>

4720
02:05:04.590 --> 02:05:05.310
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

4721
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:06.060
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

4722
02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:06.870
<v Speaker 2>totally,</v>

4723
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:07.860
<v Speaker 2>can't do that now.</v>

4724
02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:09.091
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

4725
02:05:09.091 --> 02:05:10.890
<v Speaker 2>we've always been here and she,</v>

4726
02:05:10.891 --> 02:05:11.111
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4727
02:05:11.111 --> 02:05:11.281
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4728
02:05:11.281 --> 02:05:11.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4729
02:05:11.610 --> 02:05:11.821
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4730
02:05:11.821 --> 02:05:12.091
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4731
02:05:12.091 --> 02:05:12.211
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4732
02:05:12.211 --> 02:05:12.901
<v Speaker 2>you're playing soccer.</v>

4733
02:05:12.901 --> 02:05:14.820
<v Speaker 2>You can't kick the ball anymore with your feet.</v>

4734
02:05:15.050 --> 02:05:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4735
02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:16.620
<v Speaker 2>And you're in the middle of the game.</v>

4736
02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:17.060
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4737
02:05:17.060 --> 02:05:17.370
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4738
02:05:17.370 --> 02:05:17.671
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4739
02:05:17.671 --> 02:05:17.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4740
02:05:17.970 --> 02:05:20.860
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean as a game designer was say,</v>

4741
02:05:20.861 --> 02:05:23.580
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that there isn't a better game that actually could have</v>

4742
02:05:23.581 --> 02:05:24.414
<v Speaker 2>different rules,</v>

4743
02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:28.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's really upsetting to be in the middle of a game and have somebody say,</v>

4744
02:05:28.650 --> 02:05:29.190
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

4745
02:05:29.190 --> 02:05:29.431
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4746
02:05:29.431 --> 02:05:30.264
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't the rules.</v>

4747
02:05:30.450 --> 02:05:30.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4748
02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:31.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4749
02:05:31.231 --> 02:05:32.040
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should,</v>

4750
02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:32.970
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should.</v>

4751
02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4752
02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:34.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4753
02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:37.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to do it better because I mean,</v>

4754
02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:37.521
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4755
02:05:37.521 --> 02:05:41.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm a progressive person and I'm glad that things are changing in society in</v>

4756
02:05:41.241 --> 02:05:42.050
<v Speaker 2>lots of ways,</v>

4757
02:05:42.050 --> 02:05:42.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4758
02:05:42.411 --> 02:05:43.460
<v Speaker 2>then I'm excited about</v>

4759
02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:43.851
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4760
02:05:43.851 --> 02:05:44.900
<v Speaker 1>what makes you happy?</v>

4761
02:05:45.370 --> 02:05:45.650
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

4762
02:05:45.650 --> 02:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is good about the changes in society in a progressive?</v>

4763
02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:49.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4764
02:05:49.661 --> 02:05:49.951
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4765
02:05:49.951 --> 02:05:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad that we have marriage equality now.</v>

4766
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:53.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm really excited about that.</v>

4767
02:05:54.010 --> 02:05:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that,</v>

4768
02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:55.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4769
02:05:55.810 --> 02:05:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean paternity and maternity leave,</v>

4770
02:05:58.660 --> 02:05:58.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4771
02:05:58.991 --> 02:06:03.460
<v Speaker 2>becoming more people having longer maternity leave and the same length paternity</v>

4772
02:06:03.461 --> 02:06:05.950
<v Speaker 2>leave for dads as a new parent.</v>

4773
02:06:05.951 --> 02:06:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4774
02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:06.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4775
02:06:06.441 --> 02:06:08.230
<v Speaker 2>really excited to see companies doing that.</v>

4776
02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4777
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:09.580
<v Speaker 2>and I like,</v>

4778
02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:10.031
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

4779
02:06:10.031 --> 02:06:10.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4780
02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:11.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4781
02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I like that we're starting to talk about income inequality.</v>

4782
02:06:14.291 --> 02:06:19.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean optimistic that there will be changes in that direction.</v>

4783
02:06:19.421 --> 02:06:20.680
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

4784
02:06:21.190 --> 02:06:22.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4785
02:06:22.330 --> 02:06:25.480
<v Speaker 2>I think the black lives matter is hugely important movement.</v>

4786
02:06:25.481 --> 02:06:26.201
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

4787
02:06:26.201 --> 02:06:31.201
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of conversations going on right now where people are angry</v>

4788
02:06:31.241 --> 02:06:34.360
<v Speaker 2>or have struggled or feel like they've been playing a rigged game.</v>

4789
02:06:34.690 --> 02:06:35.290
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4790
02:06:35.290 --> 02:06:35.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4791
02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:40.570
<v Speaker 2>so it's not as long going to be pleasant and not all the tactics are going to be</v>

4792
02:06:40.630 --> 02:06:42.730
<v Speaker 2>effective or good either.</v>

4793
02:06:43.060 --> 02:06:43.893
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4794
02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:44.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4795
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the general attitude is definitely moving in a more progressive direction.</v>

4796
02:06:48.450 --> 02:06:49.201
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

4797
02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:49.990
<v Speaker 1>And somebody</v>

4798
02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:50.830
<v Speaker 2>who has been,</v>

4799
02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:52.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4800
02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:52.271
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

4801
02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I've had Twitter,</v>

4802
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4803
02:06:53.950 --> 02:06:58.240
<v Speaker 2>hordes yelling at me because they thought that I was breaking one of the new</v>

4804
02:06:58.241 --> 02:06:59.740
<v Speaker 2>rules of how we're supposed to,</v>

4805
02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:01.210
<v Speaker 2>like what did people yell at?</v>

4806
02:07:01.211 --> 02:07:01.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4807
02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:03.310
<v Speaker 2>one of the big instance I had was,</v>

4808
02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:04.173
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4809
02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:05.133
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

4810
02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:05.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4811
02:07:05.620 --> 02:07:08.350
<v Speaker 2>my recommendations for playing tetris after a trauma.</v>

4812
02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:12.250
<v Speaker 2>So there've been multiple randomized control studies now out of Oxford</v>

4813
02:07:12.250 --> 02:07:15.820
<v Speaker 2>University showing that if you play tetris within 24 hours of a traumatic event,</v>

4814
02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:18.160
<v Speaker 2>it will reduce the flashbacks.</v>

4815
02:07:18.161 --> 02:07:22.750
<v Speaker 2>You have the severity of flashbacks and other PTSD symptoms because it occupies</v>

4816
02:07:22.751 --> 02:07:27.020
<v Speaker 2>your brain and prevents your brain from kind of locking in and,</v>

4817
02:07:27.021 --> 02:07:30.280
<v Speaker 2>and obsessive compulsive way on the trauma.</v>

4818
02:07:30.370 --> 02:07:30.611
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4819
02:07:30.611 --> 02:07:31.120
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

4820
02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:34.630
<v Speaker 2>I think this is incredibly important advice that everyone should know.</v>

4821
02:07:34.631 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like drop and roll.</v>

4822
02:07:36.191 --> 02:07:36.401
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4823
02:07:36.401 --> 02:07:37.390
<v Speaker 2>if you catch on fire,</v>

4824
02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:38.470
<v Speaker 2>you know what to do.</v>

4825
02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Everybody should have tetris on their phone and have it available to them.</v>

4826
02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:42.630
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

4827
02:07:42.630 --> 02:07:43.000
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4828
02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.630
<v Speaker 2>because I know having suffered flashbacks from my own head injury,</v>

4829
02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:47.351
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

4830
02:07:47.351 --> 02:07:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would have nightmares and beat of which I was hitting my head and I</v>

4831
02:07:50.651 --> 02:07:51.680
<v Speaker 2>would feel it as if a real,</v>

4832
02:07:51.681 --> 02:07:54.580
<v Speaker 2>and I'd wake up and I'd be convinced that I had hit my head in the middle of the</v>

4833
02:07:54.581 --> 02:07:57.250
<v Speaker 2>night and was going to have this experience all over again.</v>

4834
02:07:57.670 --> 02:07:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4835
02:07:57.940 --> 02:07:59.230
<v Speaker 2>just nightmares constantly.</v>

4836
02:07:59.410 --> 02:08:00.970
<v Speaker 2>So I know how bad is no one people to do it.</v>

4837
02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:02.500
<v Speaker 2>When I started tweeting about it,</v>

4838
02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:07.720
<v Speaker 2>people I got told that there needed to be like trigger warnings on my tweets</v>

4839
02:08:07.721 --> 02:08:11.710
<v Speaker 2>because I was mentioning Ptsd and I might make somebody think about like a</v>

4840
02:08:11.711 --> 02:08:14.200
<v Speaker 2>trauma that they experienced and um,</v>

4841
02:08:14.230 --> 02:08:15.610
<v Speaker 2>while they're trying to change the game.</v>

4842
02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4843
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:16.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's like I under,</v>

4844
02:08:17.230 --> 02:08:17.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4845
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:18.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4846
02:08:18.221 --> 02:08:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

4847
02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I've been on the other side of it where people have said that I'm doing it</v>

4848
02:08:22.331 --> 02:08:23.164
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

4849
02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:27.850
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time I recognize there are people who are suffering or angry or</v>

4850
02:08:27.851 --> 02:08:31.480
<v Speaker 2>they have been at a disadvantage because of the way the game is rigged.</v>

4851
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:35.980
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm okay with there being like,</v>

4852
02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:38.920
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to be uncomfortable for awhile as these things change.</v>

4853
02:08:39.310 --> 02:08:40.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

4854
02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:41.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4855
02:08:41.170 --> 02:08:46.170
<v Speaker 1>so you're uncomfortable with being unjustly accused of being insensitive when</v>

4856
02:08:47.141 --> 02:08:50.980
<v Speaker 1>you're bringing out the scientific research that shows that a game can help you</v>

4857
02:08:50.981 --> 02:08:51.730
<v Speaker 1>with trauma.</v>

4858
02:08:51.730 --> 02:08:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4859
02:08:52.010 --> 02:08:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4860
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4861
02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:54.110
<v Speaker 2>I think I've,</v>

4862
02:08:54.230 --> 02:08:54.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4863
02:08:54.730 --> 02:08:55.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to keep doing it,</v>

4864
02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:57.193
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4865
02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:00.860
<v Speaker 2>but I understand that the people who say it are hurting the people who,</v>

4866
02:09:01.010 --> 02:09:02.520
<v Speaker 2>who are telling me that I'm triggering them.</v>

4867
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>So irrational.</v>

4868
02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that all irrational behavior like that should either be ignored or shit</v>

4869
02:09:07.461 --> 02:09:07.790
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

4870
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

4871
02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's dangerous.</v>

4872
02:09:09.771 --> 02:09:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's dangerous when it gets pointed out.</v>

4873
02:09:11.421 --> 02:09:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Like your,</v>

4874
02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:12.650
<v Speaker 1>your science,</v>

4875
02:09:12.650 --> 02:09:17.090
<v Speaker 1>you're pointing out the scientific aspects of a very specific activity that's</v>

4876
02:09:17.091 --> 02:09:18.140
<v Speaker 1>very good for trauma.</v>

4877
02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:20.450
<v Speaker 1>And they're saying that you shouldn't talk about this now.</v>

4878
02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:21.650
<v Speaker 1>That's nonsense.</v>

4879
02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4880
02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.840
<v Speaker 2>that's why I still talk about it.</v>

4881
02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4882
02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:25.500
<v Speaker 2>But I don't have to get into a fight with them.</v>

4883
02:09:25.501 --> 02:09:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4884
02:09:25.850 --> 02:09:25.941
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4885
02:09:25.941 --> 02:09:26.570
<v Speaker 1>you certainly don't.</v>

4886
02:09:26.570 --> 02:09:27.410
<v Speaker 1>You should ignore them.</v>

4887
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4888
02:09:27.710 --> 02:09:28.543
<v Speaker 1>Or Shit on them,</v>

4889
02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:29.810
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you feel.</v>

4890
02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4891
02:09:30.190 --> 02:09:32.210
<v Speaker 1>But I think that there's,</v>

4892
02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:33.800
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a,</v>

4893
02:09:33.801 --> 02:09:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I like how we're defining life as like a giant game or is equal to a giant game.</v>

4894
02:09:38.990 --> 02:09:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think that that's what's going on also with the reaction,</v>

4895
02:09:42.990 --> 02:09:45.080
<v Speaker 1>the negative reaction to progressive thinking.</v>

4896
02:09:45.081 --> 02:09:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Now like a,</v>

4897
02:09:46.011 --> 02:09:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I was tweeting something about,</v>

4898
02:09:47.690 --> 02:09:48.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4899
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:49.730
<v Speaker 1>this woman in,</v>

4900
02:09:49.770 --> 02:09:50.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4901
02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky that was trying to stop people from getting gay marriage licenses.</v>

4902
02:09:54.850 --> 02:09:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4903
02:09:55.190 --> 02:09:55.640
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4904
02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:56.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4905
02:09:56.150 --> 02:09:56.983
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

4906
02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:59.990
<v Speaker 1>I took a few days where I wasn't paying attention to Twitter that much and I</v>

4907
02:09:59.991 --> 02:10:02.870
<v Speaker 1>didn't know that there was this giant movement supporting this woman.</v>

4908
02:10:03.090 --> 02:10:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And I went to Mike Huckabee's fucking Twitter page and saw that this crazy old</v>

4909
02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:12.260
<v Speaker 1>asshole was like saying that there's a war against Christians.</v>

4910
02:10:12.261 --> 02:10:16.880
<v Speaker 1>And that like Hashtag religious liberty and so it was like that doesn't have a</v>

4911
02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:20.510
<v Speaker 1>religious liberty doesn't mean you enforce your religion on other people.</v>

4912
02:10:20.570 --> 02:10:20.711
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4913
02:10:20.711 --> 02:10:22.010
<v Speaker 1>But that's so crazy.</v>

4914
02:10:22.011 --> 02:10:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah and there was so much blow back.</v>

4915
02:10:24.651 --> 02:10:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I got so many people tweeting at me angrily tweeting at me for saying like,</v>

4916
02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:33.050
<v Speaker 1>and I tweeted something about Ted Cruz about how ridiculous his views are on</v>

4917
02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:37.220
<v Speaker 1>marriage and like that he's probably gay and I'm like if you've listened to the</v>

4918
02:10:37.221 --> 02:10:37.971
<v Speaker 1>way that guy talks,</v>

4919
02:10:37.971 --> 02:10:39.260
<v Speaker 1>he's super feminine.</v>

4920
02:10:39.410 --> 02:10:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like how many times we have to see this where these men,</v>

4921
02:10:42.291 --> 02:10:42.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4922
02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Because I have a bit that I used to do my act that there's two types of people</v>

4923
02:10:45.261 --> 02:10:46.250
<v Speaker 1>that hate gay marriage.</v>

4924
02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:49.430
<v Speaker 1>It's either you're really dumb or you're secretly worried the decks are</v>

4925
02:10:49.431 --> 02:10:50.030
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>

4926
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people.</v>

4927
02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:53.480
<v Speaker 1>And like this guy is like there's something going on here.</v>

4928
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Why does he care so much about two people that are in love that,</v>

4929
02:10:57.230 --> 02:11:01.940
<v Speaker 1>but watching the people that are angry that the game is being redefined and</v>

4930
02:11:01.941 --> 02:11:02.750
<v Speaker 1>there was all this,</v>

4931
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:05.210
<v Speaker 1>it was all this Christian stuff that was attached to it.</v>

4932
02:11:05.210 --> 02:11:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4933
02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:05.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4934
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:06.410
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

4935
02:11:06.410 --> 02:11:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Guess what else it says not to do in the Bible it says not to get divorced.</v>

4936
02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Like this lady,</v>

4937
02:11:10.851 --> 02:11:12.950
<v Speaker 1>the same lady has been divorced three times.</v>

4938
02:11:13.070 --> 02:11:14.180
<v Speaker 1>She's on her fourth marriage.</v>

4939
02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Guess what else it says you're not supposed to have tattoos.</v>

4940
02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:17.413
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4941
02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Those people were tattooed with religious symbols on them.</v>

4942
02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:22.670
<v Speaker 1>You've got a cross on your arm and you tattooed it.</v>

4943
02:11:22.671 --> 02:11:23.340
<v Speaker 1>She fucking,</v>

4944
02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:27.020
<v Speaker 1>you gotta read the whole book like crazy.</v>

4945
02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Like the things that they choose and it,</v>

4946
02:11:29.301 --> 02:11:29.781
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>

4947
02:11:29.781 --> 02:11:30.950
<v Speaker 1>is they trying to,</v>

4948
02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:34.310
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to define the world that they're playing in.</v>

4949
02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4950
02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:35.540
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to define right.</v>

4951
02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:39.360
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's important because even though I might disagree,</v>

4952
02:11:39.361 --> 02:11:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

4953
02:11:39.930 --> 02:11:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I vehemently disagree with people whose perspective seem to be fueled by hate.</v>

4954
02:11:44.970 --> 02:11:48.360
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's important to still try to have the empathy or the,</v>

4955
02:11:48.690 --> 02:11:53.370
<v Speaker 2>the mental insight to understand why does this make them feel so bad?</v>

4956
02:11:53.371 --> 02:11:54.480
<v Speaker 2>I think what you just said,</v>

4957
02:11:54.481 --> 02:11:57.450
<v Speaker 2>and you have the feeling that you thought you understood the rules.</v>

4958
02:11:57.780 --> 02:11:59.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean religion is a set of roles.</v>

4959
02:11:59.850 --> 02:12:00.631
<v Speaker 2>You thought you understood it.</v>

4960
02:12:00.631 --> 02:12:00.900
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

4961
02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:02.670
<v Speaker 2>you're playing the game right.</v>

4962
02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:03.810
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it right.</v>

4963
02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4964
02:12:04.890 --> 02:12:06.000
<v Speaker 2>and it is,</v>

4965
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:11.390
<v Speaker 2>it is psychologically distressing to have somebody else tell you were playing a</v>

4966
02:12:11.791 --> 02:12:12.520
<v Speaker 2>different game.</v>

4967
02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4968
02:12:12.850 --> 02:12:13.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4969
02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:14.010
<v Speaker 2>your game sucks.</v>

4970
02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4971
02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:16.380
<v Speaker 2>and you're not going to go to play it anymore.</v>

4972
02:12:16.710 --> 02:12:17.543
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4973
02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4974
02:12:18.850 --> 02:12:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I try to understand where those feelings are coming from because if you're going</v>

4975
02:12:24.451 --> 02:12:25.890
<v Speaker 2>to change people's minds,</v>

4976
02:12:26.490 --> 02:12:27.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4977
02:12:27.150 --> 02:12:28.140
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

4978
02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:30.660
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to acknowledge that they are in a real,</v>

4979
02:12:30.690 --> 02:12:32.670
<v Speaker 2>they are really in distress about this,</v>

4980
02:12:32.671 --> 02:12:32.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4981
02:12:32.911 --> 02:12:34.530
<v Speaker 2>then I doing this just to be jerks.</v>

4982
02:12:34.890 --> 02:12:35.723
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

4983
02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:38.370
<v Speaker 2>this is why change is fall to them.</v>

4984
02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:38.541
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4985
02:12:38.541 --> 02:12:41.640
<v Speaker 2>why are they in distress about something that doesn't directly affect them?</v>

4986
02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:43.740
<v Speaker 2>But it's because of what you just said.</v>

4987
02:12:43.741 --> 02:12:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Because it is,</v>

4988
02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:44.970
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

4989
02:12:44.970 --> 02:12:45.803
<v Speaker 2>it feels,</v>

4990
02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:47.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4991
02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:49.650
<v Speaker 2>they have committed to a framework,</v>

4992
02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:50.990
<v Speaker 2>a set of roles and,</v>

4993
02:12:50.991 --> 02:12:51.231
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4994
02:12:51.231 --> 02:12:51.750
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4995
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:52.500
<v Speaker 2>and put,</v>

4996
02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:53.480
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

4997
02:12:53.490 --> 02:12:54.091
<v Speaker 2>Once you're in it,</v>

4998
02:12:54.091 --> 02:12:54.924
<v Speaker 2>you're in it and,</v>

4999
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:55.531
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

5000
02:12:55.531 --> 02:12:56.311
<v Speaker 2>when you're playing a game,</v>

5001
02:12:56.311 --> 02:12:59.760
<v Speaker 2>you always try to stop the cheaters and you protect the boundaries of the game.</v>

5002
02:12:59.761 --> 02:12:59.981
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

5003
02:12:59.981 --> 02:13:02.370
<v Speaker 2>that's a mindset you get into and they're just,</v>

5004
02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.110
<v Speaker 2>they think they're just doing it.</v>

5005
02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:07.730
<v Speaker 1>What kind of country that was established by Christian values.</v>

5006
02:13:07.731 --> 02:13:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5007
02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:09.590
<v Speaker 1>The fucking games locked.</v>

5008
02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5009
02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:10.341
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5010
02:13:10.341 --> 02:13:11.540
<v Speaker 1>You can't change the rules.</v>

5011
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:12.231
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

5012
02:13:12.231 --> 02:13:13.650
<v Speaker 1>it really does seem like we've,</v>

5013
02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:15.320
<v Speaker 1>we've kind of touched on something here.</v>

5014
02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5015
02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:16.401
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

5016
02:13:16.401 --> 02:13:19.010
<v Speaker 1>this has been a really good one for me was the,</v>

5017
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5018
02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:21.020
<v Speaker 1>the overall looking at the,</v>

5019
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:26.260
<v Speaker 1>the whole existence as instead of defining it by the word game,</v>

5020
02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but looking at it with almost the same sort of a attitude or approach that you</v>

5021
02:13:33.061 --> 02:13:37.050
<v Speaker 1>would look at a game is a very beneficial good.</v>

5022
02:13:38.100 --> 02:13:39.120
<v Speaker 1>It's worked for me.</v>

5023
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:40.100
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

5024
02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:41.940
<v Speaker 1>your eyes get big like saucers.</v>

02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5031
02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

5032
02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:47.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5033

<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

5036
02:13:49.881 --> 02:13:50.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5037
02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:50.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5038
02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:52.770
<v Speaker 1>the ebb and flow of culture,</v>

5039
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:55.020
<v Speaker 1>like the things that are seemed to definitely,</v>

5040
02:13:55.110 --> 02:13:55.943
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

5041
02:13:56.070 --> 02:13:59.520
<v Speaker 1>even though I resist like this nonsense about microaggressions and trigger</v>

5042
02:13:59.521 --> 02:14:00.630
<v Speaker 1>warnings and stuff like that,</v>

5043
02:14:00.631 --> 02:14:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy that things are moving in the direction of acceptance.</v>

5044
02:14:04.710 --> 02:14:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5045
02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Very happy that,</v>

5046
02:14:06.031 --> 02:14:06.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5047
02:14:06.241 --> 02:14:07.800
<v Speaker 1>like you can be whatever the fuck you want.</v>

5048
02:14:07.801 --> 02:14:08.910
<v Speaker 1>You just saw you're a woman today.</v>

5049
02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:09.391
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

5050
02:14:09.391 --> 02:14:10.620
<v Speaker 1>As long as you don't hurt anybody,</v>

5051
02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:11.573
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

5052
02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:13.050
<v Speaker 1>This guy wants to wear dresses and you want,</v>

5053
02:14:13.051 --> 02:14:14.310
<v Speaker 1>he wants you to call him Jane now.</v>

5054
02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:15.173
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

5055
02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5056
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5057
02:14:16.231 --> 02:14:17.700
<v Speaker 1>these two guys want to get married to each other.</v>

5058
02:14:17.701 --> 02:14:18.534
<v Speaker 1>Terrific.</v>

5059
02:14:18.570 --> 02:14:18.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5060
02:14:18.901 --> 02:14:21.690
<v Speaker 1>these two people want to stop wearing makeup and they want to,</v>

5061
02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:22.650
<v Speaker 1>what do you give a shit?</v>

5062
02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

5063
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

5064
02:14:24.090 --> 02:14:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Or they want to dye their hair blue.</v>

5065
02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:26.393
<v Speaker 1>That's fine too.</v>

5066
02:14:26.490 --> 02:14:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Like eventually we'll all figure out that we are all just unique individuals</v>

5067
02:14:33.630 --> 02:14:34.850
<v Speaker 1>that are a part of giant,</v>

5068
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:39.950
<v Speaker 1>this gigantic super organism and the most conducive way or the most harmonic</v>

5069
02:14:40.471 --> 02:14:41.304
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

5070
02:14:42.090 --> 02:14:46.380
<v Speaker 1>harmonious way for us to interact with each other is to fuck with each other's</v>

5071
02:14:46.381 --> 02:14:46.831
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

5072
02:14:46.831 --> 02:14:50.460
<v Speaker 1>The least whatever path you're on your way in your game,</v>

5073
02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:53.160
<v Speaker 1>as long as it doesn't negatively affect people.</v>

5074
02:14:53.310 --> 02:14:55.650
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're not a destroyer out there,</v>

5075
02:14:55.651 --> 02:14:57.660
<v Speaker 1>your path is to burn down to the people's houses.</v>

5076
02:14:57.661 --> 02:14:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Your path is to steal.</v>

5077
02:14:58.921 --> 02:15:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Your path has to to hurt people.</v>

5078
02:15:00.810 --> 02:15:02.160
<v Speaker 1>As long as that's not going on.</v>

5079
02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Why care and,</v>

5080
02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:07.110
<v Speaker 1>and then ultimately once that is established,</v>

5081
02:15:07.111 --> 02:15:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I think then we will focus on,</v>

5082
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.271
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5083
02:15:09.271 --> 02:15:12.000
<v Speaker 1>well what are our rear real issues are real issues?</v>

5084
02:15:12.001 --> 02:15:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Aren't gay people getting married to each other?</v>

5085
02:15:13.770 --> 02:15:17.040
<v Speaker 1>A real issues are the people that actually are burning houses down the people</v>

5086
02:15:17.041 --> 02:15:17.860
<v Speaker 1>that are stealing.</v>

5087
02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5088
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Like these are the real issues that people have.</v>

5089
02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:22.620
<v Speaker 1>People that are not micro aggressions,</v>

5090
02:15:22.621 --> 02:15:23.730
<v Speaker 1>but actual aggressions.</v>

5091
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:27.450
<v Speaker 1>People that are actually committing crimes against each other and why are they</v>

5092
02:15:27.451 --> 02:15:28.020
<v Speaker 1>doing that?</v>

5093
02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:28.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5094
02:15:28.141 --> 02:15:29.340
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong with their game?</v>

5095
02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.630
<v Speaker 1>What happened to them?</v>

5096
02:15:30.810 --> 02:15:31.181
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

5097
02:15:31.181 --> 02:15:34.180
<v Speaker 1>what series of events have placed them in this sort of position?</v>

5098
02:15:34.181 --> 02:15:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5099
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:34.441
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5100
02:15:34.441 --> 02:15:34.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5101
02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:35.411
<v Speaker 2>Because it's not,</v>

5102
02:15:35.411 --> 02:15:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5103
02:15:36.190 --> 02:15:38.530
<v Speaker 2>people don't get into that in a vacuum.</v>

5104
02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:39.290
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5105
02:15:39.290 --> 02:15:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that's also something you realized once you have children.</v>

5106
02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5107
02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Like you have now.</v>

5108
02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:45.230
<v Speaker 1>And as a father,</v>

5109
02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:50.260
<v Speaker 1>one of the things has changed radically in my life is seeing people now.</v>

5110
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Like when I meet people,</v>

5111
02:15:53.301 --> 02:15:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I see them as babies that have grown up.</v>

5112
02:15:56.630 --> 02:15:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't see them as being in a static state.</v>

5113
02:15:59.331 --> 02:15:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5114
02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:00.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5115
02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:00.921
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

5116
02:16:00.921 --> 02:16:02.180
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange,</v>

5117
02:16:02.181 --> 02:16:03.440
<v Speaker 1>like even assholes that,</v>

5118
02:16:03.441 --> 02:16:03.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5119
02:16:03.831 --> 02:16:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I'd look at them and even go,</v>

5120
02:16:04.941 --> 02:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a fucking asshole.</v>

5121
02:16:06.230 --> 02:16:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I think of them as like,</v>

5122
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:10.100
<v Speaker 1>what happened to that person?</v>

5123
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.750
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

5124
02:16:10.750 --> 02:16:11.583
<v Speaker 2>that's like a,</v>

5125
02:16:11.670 --> 02:16:16.670
<v Speaker 2>that's I practice Zen Buddhism and that's like one of the big Buddhist</v>

5126
02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.730
<v Speaker 2>meditations is to picture people as babies.</v>

5127
02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5128
02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:21.920
<v Speaker 2>When you feel hate for somebody,</v>

5129
02:16:22.730 --> 02:16:26.780
<v Speaker 2>try to visualize them all the way down to throw little baby self and picture</v>

5130
02:16:26.781 --> 02:16:30.430
<v Speaker 2>what they look like as a baby and to think about who they were when they were</v>

5131
02:16:30.431 --> 02:16:33.940
<v Speaker 2>that baby before all of life happened to them,</v>

5132
02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:38.800
<v Speaker 2>to make them into somebody that has now triggered these,</v>

5133
02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:39.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5138
02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:52.640
<v Speaker 1>about kids that grow up in horrible environments,</v>

5139
02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:56.930
<v Speaker 1>dangerous volatile environments where the mother has all this cortisol in her</v>

5140
02:16:56.931 --> 02:17:01.931
<v Speaker 1>brain while the child in the womb and that the kid literally grows up like with</v>

02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:05.960
<v Speaker 1>they're developed out of the womb,</v>

5153
02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I've locked myself in a room with them when he was a kitten because there's the</v>

02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:41.570
<v Speaker 1>when I would get to them and pick them up.</v>

5169
02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5170
02:17:41.730 --> 02:17:44.160
<v Speaker 2>He was talking [inaudible] like finally somebody loves me.</v>

5171
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:45.823
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5172
02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:47.340
<v Speaker 2>but then when you put them down,</v>

5173
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:49.960
<v Speaker 2>like the same cat would just be,</v>

5174
02:17:49.970 --> 02:17:50.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5175
02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:54.210
<v Speaker 1>because his brain was programmed from the time he was a little baby.</v>

5176
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5177
02:17:54.570 --> 02:17:56.160
<v Speaker 1>And there was not a lot he could do.</v>

5178
02:17:56.161 --> 02:17:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't say that cat's ass asshole.</v>

5179
02:17:58.140 --> 02:17:58.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5180
02:17:58.291 --> 02:17:58.441
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5181
02:17:58.441 --> 02:18:00.750
<v Speaker 1>that fucking cat was born under an apartment building,</v>

5182
02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:01.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5183
02:18:01.321 --> 02:18:04.530
<v Speaker 1>and his mom was like running away from traffic and trying to eat rats or</v>

5184
02:18:04.531 --> 02:18:05.610
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they could kill.</v>

5185
02:18:05.710 --> 02:18:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5186
02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:06.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5187
02:18:06.341 --> 02:18:09.840
<v Speaker 2>I think this is one of the reasons why game thinking is so powerful because you,</v>

5188
02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:12.660
<v Speaker 2>this is zoom out and see the bigger structure that it's,</v>

5189
02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:12.940
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5190
02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:17.590
<v Speaker 2>there's always a bigger game and more pieces in play and you're getting other</v>

5191
02:18:17.591 --> 02:18:18.220
<v Speaker 2>people's,</v>

5192
02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:18.551
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5193
02:18:18.551 --> 02:18:20.270
<v Speaker 2>strategies or actions or,</v>

5194
02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:22.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5195
02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:23.313
<v Speaker 2>or the rules,</v>

5196
02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:24.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5197
02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:24.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5198
02:18:24.550 --> 02:18:28.060
<v Speaker 2>and being able to zoom out and see that makes you feel,</v>

5199
02:18:28.210 --> 02:18:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I think will you have more perspective,</v>

5200
02:18:30.551 --> 02:18:33.310
<v Speaker 2>more wisdom and maybe more compassion for other people.</v>

5201
02:18:33.430 --> 02:18:33.931
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

5202
02:18:33.931 --> 02:18:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Why people like to rightly so criticized,</v>

5203
02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:38.190
<v Speaker 1>very narrow minded,</v>

5204
02:18:38.191 --> 02:18:39.540
<v Speaker 1>small town thinking.</v>

5205
02:18:39.570 --> 02:18:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5206
02:18:39.870 --> 02:18:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Small little environments,</v>

5207
02:18:41.641 --> 02:18:43.710
<v Speaker 1>insulated environments that are very,</v>

5208
02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:44.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5209
02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:47.280
<v Speaker 1>very critic criticizing or very,</v>

5210
02:18:47.281 --> 02:18:47.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5211
02:18:47.491 --> 02:18:47.791
<v Speaker 1>just to,</v>

5212
02:18:47.791 --> 02:18:48.690
<v Speaker 1>just to have their,</v>

5213
02:18:48.691 --> 02:18:52.890
<v Speaker 1>their way set and they don't have a wide variety of experiences they can draw</v>

5214
02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:56.860
<v Speaker 1>upon or they don't have a broad nuanced view of the board that there,</v>

5215
02:18:56.861 --> 02:18:56.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5216
02:18:56.970 --> 02:18:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Playing on.</v>

5217
02:18:57.630 --> 02:18:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5218
02:18:58.440 --> 02:18:59.273
<v Speaker 2>So this is like,</v>

5219
02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:03.030
<v Speaker 2>this is giving me a lot of what a food for thought about.</v>

5220
02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:03.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5221
02:19:03.391 --> 02:19:06.720
<v Speaker 2>the links between social change and gainful thinking.</v>

5222
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5223
02:19:08.930 --> 02:19:09.681
<v Speaker 1>There's something there.</v>

5224
02:19:09.681 --> 02:19:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I think also as time is going on and uh,</v>

5225
02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:14.030
<v Speaker 1>this is one thing,</v>

5226
02:19:14.050 --> 02:19:14.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5227
02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:19.210
<v Speaker 1>the positive aspects of social media and of the Internet itself is that we're</v>

5228
02:19:19.220 --> 02:19:23.450
<v Speaker 1>getting more and more information instead of just accepting these preconceived</v>

5229
02:19:23.451 --> 02:19:25.610
<v Speaker 1>notions that we have about different groups of people.</v>

5230
02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Now we're being to so much data,</v>

5231
02:19:28.610 --> 02:19:33.610
<v Speaker 1>it's just inadvertently or a inarguably changing the way we view those groups</v>

5232
02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:39.170
<v Speaker 1>and that you are forced to like when you see like this black lives matter thing,</v>

5233
02:19:39.171 --> 02:19:42.380
<v Speaker 1>you see all these peaceful protests where these people are talking eloquently</v>

5234
02:19:42.410 --> 02:19:44.780
<v Speaker 1>speaking and showing video after video,</v>

5235
02:19:44.781 --> 02:19:45.830
<v Speaker 1>police brutality.</v>

5236
02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:46.670
<v Speaker 1>And then I've had,</v>

5237
02:19:46.670 --> 02:19:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I had a cop on Michael Wood who was a Baltimore retired Baltimore police officer</v>

5238
02:19:51.051 --> 02:19:51.950
<v Speaker 1>that talked about,</v>

5239
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:56.360
<v Speaker 1>very openly talked about the institutionalized racism and about how they had</v>

5240
02:19:56.361 --> 02:20:01.361
<v Speaker 1>found a papers from the 1970s that we're describing how to behave in certain</v>

5241
02:20:01.671 --> 02:20:04.370
<v Speaker 1>environments that were exactly the same as what's going on now.</v>

5242
02:20:04.370 --> 02:20:04.671
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

5243
02:20:04.671 --> 02:20:05.960
<v Speaker 1>this is a fucking system.</v>

5244
02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:07.930
<v Speaker 1>This is the,</v>

5245
02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that attitude existed just a few years ago.</v>

5246
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:13.300
<v Speaker 1>People are looking at all that data now and they go,</v>

5247
02:20:13.350 --> 02:20:18.260
<v Speaker 1>it's slowly coming around and even the hard liners are dropping.</v>

5248
02:20:18.290 --> 02:20:18.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5249
02:20:18.531 --> 02:20:21.890
<v Speaker 1>if they were at a 10 now they're at an a or a seven,</v>

5250
02:20:21.891 --> 02:20:22.940
<v Speaker 1>well I fucking kid,</v>

5251
02:20:22.941 --> 02:20:25.130
<v Speaker 1>you need to get all caught a school or something.</v>

5252
02:20:25.131 --> 02:20:25.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5253
02:20:25.371 --> 02:20:30.371
<v Speaker 1>it's like everyone is sort of slowly recognizing the pieces that are in play.</v>

5254
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:33.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more complicated then we want to,</v>

5255
02:20:33.740 --> 02:20:33.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5256
02:20:33.951 --> 02:20:36.470
<v Speaker 1>just narrowly sort of define them and these,</v>

5257
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:40.010
<v Speaker 1>these really simplistic terms where it's not simple.</v>

5258
02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:44.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a series of interactions that are going on all over the globe are human</v>

5259
02:20:44.091 --> 02:20:45.740
<v Speaker 1>beings are trying to find their way.</v>

5260
02:20:45.741 --> 02:20:49.970
<v Speaker 1>And they're also realizing somewhere along the line that their parents weren't</v>

5261
02:20:49.971 --> 02:20:51.950
<v Speaker 1>these all knowing creatures.</v>

5262
02:20:51.951 --> 02:20:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Neither were their parents,</v>

5263
02:20:53.241 --> 02:20:56.930
<v Speaker 1>neither were the President Roosevelt or fucking Abe Lincoln.</v>

5264
02:20:57.110 --> 02:21:00.080
<v Speaker 1>They were all people that were trying to find their way as well.</v>

5265
02:21:00.290 --> 02:21:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And this is a group effort.</v>

5266
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a group effort that's still going on and it's not even remotely done.</v>

5267
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:06.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not even close.</v>

5268
02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5269
02:21:07.470 --> 02:21:07.871
<v Speaker 2>So it's okay.</v>

5270
02:21:07.871 --> 02:21:09.640
<v Speaker 2>So instead of seeing the bigger picture,</v>

5271
02:21:09.970 --> 02:21:12.430
<v Speaker 2>we will see the bigger game and that will be,</v>

5272
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:13.620
<v Speaker 2>that will guide us.</v>

5273
02:21:13.620 --> 02:21:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5274
02:21:14.250 --> 02:21:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Bringing all right back to super better.</v>

5275
02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:17.251
